==Life==
El-Messiri was born in [[Damanhur]], Egypt, graduated with a BA in [[English literature]] from [[Alexandria University]] in 1959. He received a [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English and [[comparative literature]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1964 and a PhD in the same field from [[Rutgers University]] in 1969. He was professor emeritus of English and comparative literature at [[Ain Shams University]], Egypt since 1988. He was also a University Professor at [[King Saud University]], [[Saudi Arabia]] (1983–1988) and at [[Kuwait University]], [[Kuwait]] (1988–1989) and a visiting Professor at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]. He is considered as one of Egypt's most famous thinkers and very well known among Arab scholars.

El-Messiri's major areas of research included: Jews, Judaism and [[Zionism]]; [[secularism]] and prejudice; Western culture and contemporaneity; [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]]; [[literary theory]] and [[comparative literature]]. Over the course of his life his outlook moved from western secularism to a modern Islamic vision. El-Messiri wrote several articles about his ideas, including "Chosen Community, an Exceptional Burden", "A People Like Any other". He has also written for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

His eight-volume ''Encyclopedia of Jews, Judaism and Zionism'' (" موسوعة اليهود واليهودية والصهيونية: نموذج تفسيري جديد"), written in Arabic with an analytical/methodological form rather than an encyclopedic collection of information, is intended to provide analysis of the Middle East crisis, the history of Jews and the history of Zionism, as well as an in-depth analysis of Zionism, its ideology and beliefs, and ultimately the goals of such movement.

On July 2, 2008 he died after a very long battle against cancer at the Palestine Hospital, [[Cairo]].

'''''Aeterni Patris''''' ([[English language|English]]: Of the Eternal Father) was an [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in August 1879, (not to be confused with the [[apostolic letter]] of the same name written by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1868 calling the [[First Vatican Council]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01176a.htm O'Riordan, Michael. "Æterni Patris." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 4 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was subtitled "On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy in Catholic Schools in the Spirit (ad mentem) of the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas". The aim of the encyclical was to advance the revival of [[Scholastic philosophy]].

==Introduction==
In August 1879, eighteen months into his pontificate, Pope Leo XIII (formerly Joachim [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Pecci, [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of [[Perugia]]), issued the encyclical letter ''Aeterni Patris''. The aim of the encyclical was to aid and advance the restoration of [[Christian philosophy]], which he felt had fallen into danger and disrepute by adhering to [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modern trends]] in [[secular]] [[philosophy]], by urging a return to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic thinkers]] of the [[Middle Ages]], most especially the [[Angelic Doctor|Angelic]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctor]] [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], and the related philosophical system of [[Thomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LvvzlLf9dFEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=vehementer+nos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgyahUKEwi4nYD884HJAhVCPT4KHcJtBKM#v=onepage&amp;q=vehementer%20nos&amp;f=false Gilley, Sheridan. "The Papacy", ''The Cambridge History of Christianity'', Vol. 8 , Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.20] {{ISBN|9780521814560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclical attempts to clarify the roles of [[faith]] and [[philosophy]], later to be covered again in [[John Paul II]]'s encyclical, ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (On Faith and Reason), showing how most beneficially each may profit from the other.

The purpose of Leo XIII was the revival of St. Thomas's philosophy and the continuing of his spirit of investigation, but not necessarily the adoption of every argument and opinion to be found in the works of the scholastics.&lt;ref name=oriordan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01177a.htm O'Riordan, Michael. "Æterni Patris." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 18 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to the encyclical, the philosophy most conformable and useful for the faith is that of St. Thomas. The vigorous reintroduction of St. Thomas into the Catholic philosophical teaching was perceived by many as a bold and unprecedented step by the new pope. Indeed, since the [[French Revolution]], most pontiffs had preferred to condemn the errors in contemporary philosophy, not to recommend explicitly a return to the old. The encyclical, however, was no surprise to any acquainted with Cardinal Pecci, who had for years been spearheading a Thomistic renaissance in the schools in his diocese of Perugia, leading to such [[theologian]]s and philosophers as [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], [[Etienne Gilson]], and [[Jacques Maritain]].

The content of the encyclical was strongly influenced by [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]] professor from 1870 to 1879 at the College of Saint Thomas,  the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum]]. "Zigliara also helped prepare the great encyclicals ''Aeterni Patris'' and ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' and strongly opposed traditionalism and ontologism in favor of the moderate realism of Aquinas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://domcentral.org/blog/the-age-of-compromise-1800s/ Benedict Ashley, ''The Dominicans'', 9 "The Age of Compromise,"  Accessed 19, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213125723/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-age-of-compromise-1800s/ |date=2013-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zigliara, a member of seven Roman congregations including the Congregation for Studies, was a co-founder of the Academia Romano di San Tommaso in 1870.  Zigliara's fame as a scholar at the forefront of the Thomist revival at the time of his rectorship of the College of St. Thomas after 1873 was widespread in Rome and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iteadthomam.blogspot.com/2010/01/there-was-thomism-before-aeterni-patris.html  Francisco J. Romero Carrasquillo. "Ite ad Thomam", Accessed Feb. 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the publication of this encyclical [[Pope Leo XIII]] created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on October 15, 1879, and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called "leonine edition", of the complete works of Aquinas, the ''doctor angelicus''.&lt;ref name=oriordan/&gt;   The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to Zigliara.

== An overview of the document’s main points ==

'''Introduction'''
1.	The opening paragraph begins with a reference to [[Jesus|Christ’s]] command to His [[Apostles]] to set all men free by teaching the truth of the faith to all nations ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161129/http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28%3A19&amp;src=%21 Matthew 28:19]). Although philosophy can and has deceived men about important matters, it is also capable of illuminating the other sciences. This, then, is the aim of ''Aeterni Patris'': to promote the kind of philosophy that “shall respond most fitly to the excellence of faith, and at the same time [is] consonant with the dignity of human science.”

2.	The errors of philosophy have caused problems in public and private life. Philosophy alone is insufficient to emerge from error or prevent further erroneous conclusions “concerning divine or human things.” The faith of the Christian religion preserves philosophic truth by bringing to men “the grace of the divine wisdom.” Neither [[reason]] nor philosophy is destroyed by faith; [[God]], creator of “the light of reason in the human mind,” strengthens man and his reason by faith.

3.	Pointing to the [[Church Fathers]], the encyclical shows how reason and science were used to call people to faith.&lt;ref name=oriordan/&gt;

'''The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Philosophy Aids Faith'''

4.	In the fourth paragraph, the encyclical begins to articulate the ways in which philosophy can aid and complement true faith. Reason is characterized as a “steppingstone” to Christian faith, in that philosophy, when used rightly, fortifies the road to faith and prepares the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] for fit reception of [[revelation]]. Reason is characterized as rather autonomous, in that the [[Ancient philosophy|pagans]] demonstrated and proved conclusions, using only their natural reason, which supported certain truths regarding faith: the [[existence of God]], his power and divinity, as well as the existence of a [[natural law]]. A comparison is drawn between the way in which the Hebrews took with them Egyptian treasures to offer to the service of God, and the way in which truths discovered by the philosophy of the pagans are to be turned to the use and purposes of revealed doctrine.

5.	The great and noble fruits gathered from natural reason, as described in the fifth paragraph, include its ability to recognize “that the doctrine of the [[Gospel]] has even from its very beginning been made manifest by certain wonderful signs.” The spread, sanctity, and unity of the Church is another sign that reason can recognize.

6.	The sixth paragraph draws attention to the fact that sacred [[theology]] requires philosophy in order to be a genuine science: in order to assume the nature, form, and genius of a true science, theology requires the solid foundation of philosophy. Moreover, Philosophy complements theology in that true understanding and knowledge are better and more easily attained by those who join together philosophic studies with the love of faith and integrity of life.

7.	Philosophy is characterized as both a defensive and offensive tool of faith. Defensively it protects the revealed truth from distortion; offensively it weakens arguments contrary to revealed truth. The examples of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul’s]] use of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greek philosophy]] in [[Athens]] ([http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=17:16-34&amp;src=!Acts 17:16–34]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and [[King David|David’s]] use of [[Goliath|Goliath’s]] sword ([http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%201Samuel&amp;verse=17:50-54&amp;src=!1 Samuel 17:50–54]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) are given as literal and metaphorical examples of using philosophy in a defensive and offensive manner. The Church “commands” Christian teachers to enlist the help of philosophy in instructing the faithful but cautions against philosophical arguments that are contrary to revealed truth.

'''The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Faith Aids Philosophy'''

8.	Philosophy and revelation represent two realms of knowledge. Philosophy represents the profane realm of natural truth whereas revelation represents the divine realm of supernatural truth. Revelation or supernatural truth is beyond the reach of reason and therefore philosophy must accept these truths by faith. Philosophy is characterized as a handmaid to faith that humbly accepts revelation. Revelation has the “force of certain truth” so that what is contrary to faith is also contrary to reason. Thus, the philosopher is discouraged from accepting any conclusion that is opposed to revealed doctrine.

9.	The human mind is limited and needs the truth of revelation to avoid error. Without the supernatural truth of revelation the human mind is subject to error and opinion. The fact that revelation assists the philosopher in reasoning correctly does not detract from the dignity of the human intellect because wisdom is gained in recognizing the limits of reason. “Faith frees and saves reason from error, and endows it with manifold knowledge.” Revelation serves as a lamp for the philosopher’s path toward truth.

'''The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith in Historical Perspective'''

10.	The history of philosophy is marked by those who lacked “the gift of faith”—an error that led to doubtful claims about the nature of reality but especially divinity. However, Christ, “as the power and wisdom of God,” restores knowledge through his followers, and by their efforts redeems what is true in pagan philosophy. In doing so, Catholic doctrine was developed and defended against [[heresy|heretics]] and other adversaries who sought to propose contrary views.

11.	In combating these adversaries, Catholic [[apologetics|apologists]] even from the early centuries (for example, [[Justin Martyr]]) encountered both the power of reason to demonstrate certain attributes of God and the limitation of reason in relationship to revelation.

12.	The encyclical continues the list of those early Christian thinkers who have labored to defend the faith from error and develop a philosophically informed account of it: [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]], [[Aristides (Apologist)|Aristides]], [[Hermias (apologist)|Hermias]], [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Irenaeus]] of [[Lyon]]s, [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Tertullian]], amongst others, are listed.

13.	In paragraph 13, Pope Leo XIII continues his list of those who have advanced the Christian intellectual tradition. He turns his attention first to [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who Leo says “[w]ould seem to have wrested the palm from all.” The genius of Augustine was his ability to combat “most vigorously all the errors of his age,” as well as his ability to lay down the “safe foundations and sure structure of human science.” The paragraph ends with mention of [[John of Damascus|John Damascene]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], and [[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory of Nazianzen]] as carrying the tradition in the East, and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] in the West, all of whom Pope Leo says “[a]dded largely to the patrimony of philosophy.”

14.	Paragraph 14 speaks of the “doctors of the middle ages,” the “[[Scholasticism|Scholastics]],” whose contribution to the tradition was their “diligently collecting, and sifting, and storing up, as it were, in one place, for the use and convenience of posterity the rich and fertile harvests of Christian learning scattered abroad in the voluminous works of the holy Fathers.” Pope Leo XIII quotes [[Sixtus V|Pope Sixtus V]], who names in particular the “angelic St. Thomas and the seraphic [[St. Bonaventure]]” as preeminent doctors whose “surpassing genius” and “unwearied diligence” aided in further advancing the tradition.

15.	The quotation from Sixtus V continues through paragraph 15, and it is here that scholasticism, drawing together and compiling the sacred writings, the work of the “sovereign Pontiffs, the holy Fathers and the councils,” is portrayed as beneficial to the posterity in three ways: for (1) understanding and interpreting [[Holy Bible|Scripture]], (2) understanding the Fathers, and (3) combating heresies and errors. The last way is highlighted in the paragraph for the particular importance it plays in “confirming the dogmas of Catholic faith and confuting heresies.”  
		 
16.	In paragraph 16, the praise of scholastic theology is extended to the philosophy upon which it is based.

17.	The following paragraph names Thomas Aquinas as the preeminent example of scholasticism. He is praised for collecting together all the other arguments of scholastics, and then made valuable additions as well. Apart from his contributions to theology, Thomas, the encyclical claims, also touched finely upon all points of philosophy.

18.	In paragraph 18, Thomas is said to have triumphed over previous errors, and supplied those who follow him with the means to defeat other errors that would arise. Thomas also distinguished, “as is fitting,” faith from reason, without infringing upon the legitimate rights of either of them and instead strengthening each through the aid of the other.

'''The Authority of St. Thomas Aquinas'''

19.	The nineteenth paragraph begins a discussion of the many ways in which Aquinas’s authority has been recognized through the centuries. The encyclical describes how many [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] mandated the study of his works to their members: the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], of course, but also the [[Benedictines]], [[Carmelites]], [[Augustinians]], and [[Jesuits]]. This was done because St. Thomas reached such sound and defensible conclusions.

20.	The twentieth paragraph of the encyclical refers to all the great universities of the scholastic period where Thomistic theology enjoyed prominence, creating harmony among all the schools adhering to his teaching.

21.	The twenty-first paragraph of the encyclical continues the list of testimonials to St. Thomas’s greatness by mentioning some of the popes who have honored, borrowed from, and praised the work of St. Thomas.

22.	Thomas Aquinas has long been held “in singular honor” in the ecumenical councils, including those of [[Second Council of Lyon|Lyons]], [[Council of Vienne|Vienne]], [[Council of Florence|Florence]], and the [[First Vatican Council|Vatican]]. This high regard was most especially evident during the Council of Trent, in which his [[Summa Theologica|''Summa'']] was laid “upon the [[Altar (Catholicism)|altar]], together with sacred Scripture and the [[Papal bull|decrees of the supreme Pontiffs]].”
 
23.	Aquinas has been equally esteemed even among critics of the Church, “who openly declared that, if the teaching of Thomas Aquinas were only taken away, they could easily battle with all Catholic teachers.”
 
24.	The “struggling innovators of the sixteenth century” philosophized without regard for faith. Their inventions were in accordance with their own whims, and so, naturally, there arose a great diversity of philosophies, “differing and clashing” even in those matters of human knowledge that are most important. Pope Leo fears that many philosophers were forsaking the solid philosophical foundation of antiquity and turning toward “a foundation open to change.” And another danger: while Leo affirms the important work of scholarship, he cautions that philosophical pursuits should not be characterized by “mere [[erudition]]”; what is required, rather, is an authentic development of learning.

'''The Need for a Thomistic and Scholastic Renaissance'''
 
25.	Paragraph 25, which acknowledges that, in the face of these dangers, some already have already returned to the superior philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, is followed by the hortatory and encouraging remarks in paragraph 26.

26.	Both paragraphs use ornamental language in speaking of the “beauty” of the “pure streams” from the “precious fountainhead of the Angelic Doctor.” The language may appeal implicitly to a Thomistic understanding of Beauty as a transcendental quality inseparable from the Good and the Truth.

27.	The encyclical goes on in paragraph 27 to urge the teaching of scholastic philosophy and theology, especially to the young [[Seminary|seminarians]] “who are the growing hope of the Church.” Scholastic thought is likened to a strong weapon with which one may best defend the Catholic faith against the assault waged against her by the “machinations and craft of a certain false wisdom.” Scholastic philosophy is presented as second only to the “supernatural help of God,” in its ability to defend the faith.

28.	The restoring of the teachings of Thomas Aquinas in the universities and the strong foundation this will offer the students will also help society as a whole by offering it a “more peaceful and secure existence,” as well as protecting it from the “plague of perverse opinions.”

29.	Scholastic philosophy, with its “sound judgment,” “right method,” and “spirit,” will strengthen and guide all the different disciplines, including the [[liberal arts]] and the [[physical sciences]].

30.	In particular, scholastic philosophy does not oppose the “advance and development of natural science.” On the contrary, philosophy is in accord with the conclusions of [[History of physics|modern physics]]. This accord is exemplified by the openness of Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], among other scholastics, to giving “large attention to the knowledge of natural things.”

31.	This paragraph emphasizes that the revival of scholasticism and, in particular, Thomism for which the encyclical calls is not a recommendation to practice a slavish adherence to outdated doctrines and ideas: “if there is anything that ill agrees with the discoveries of a later age … it does not enter Our mind to propose that for imitation in Our age.” It is crucial, as well, that Aquinas’s own writings be read and studied, rather than derivative works that may already be affected by errors.

'''Conclusion'''

32.–34. The document ends with an invocation of God’s grace and the blessing of the [[saints]], for the important work that is recommended in the encyclical.

== Effects of the encyclical ==
[[Image:Vol._1_of_the_Leonine_edition_of_the_works_of_St._Thomas_Aquinas_(Leonine_edition).jpg|thumb|Volume 1 of the Leonine edition of the works of St. Thomas Aquinas (1882)]]
The interpretations and effects of the encyclical have been varied, some using it to authorize a return to a strict adherence to St. Thomas, others believing the document urges more a return to the spirit of Thomistic thinking. However various the effects may have been, the document has at least succeeded in reestablishing since its promulgation St. Thomas as a central figure in Catholic philosophy.

The chief aim of ''Aeterni Patris'' was the reintroduction of Thomism into Catholic educational centers for the purpose of bringing faith and reason back into a fruitful [[dialectic]]. Pope Leo XIII had recognized the detrimental effects to both society and religion when reason is privileged over faith. In an effort to promote Thomistic scholarship, Pope Leo XIII commissioned a critical edition of Aquinas’s works, referred to as the “Leonine” edition. Although Thomism had already enjoyed a half-century revival before 1879 through the writings of scholars such as [[Carlo Maria Curci]] (d. 1891), [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]] (d. 1892), and [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara|Tommaso Zigliara]] (d. 1893), ''Aeterni Patris'' heralded a renaissance of Thomism that still reverberates in modern theological and philosophical discourse.

Jesuit theologians such as [[Joseph Marechal|Joseph Maréchal]] (1878–1944), [[Karl Rahner]] (1904–1984), and [[Bernard Lonergan|Bernard J. F. Lonergan]] (1904–1984) developed a post-Kantian Thomism sometimes called “Transcendental Thomism.” The French theologians [[Charles Journet]] (1891–1975), [[Jacques Maritain]] (1882–1973), and [[Étienne Gilson]] (1884–1978) contributed significantly to Thomistic methodology. Journet along with Maritain founded the journal ''[[Nova et Vetera]]'' and contributed to sessions at [[Vatican II]]. Gilson founded the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. Gilson’s ''Being and Some Philosophers'' (1949) and Maritain’s ''The Degrees of Knowledge'' (1932) are still widely popular among students of Thomism.  Together, Gilson and Maritain are sometimes called "existential Thomists."

French Dominicans [[Pierre Mandonnet]] (1858–1936), [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]] (1895–1990), and [[Yves Congar]] (1904–1995) explored the historical background of Thomas Aquinas and its relationship to theology. One of the best known French Dominicans of the twentieth century was [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]] (1877–1964), who influenced generations of students during his tenure at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]] in [[Rome]]. These developments and contributions can be seen as a natural consequence of the aim of ''Aeterni Patris'' to bring faith and reason together in a fruitful dialectic. The spirit and thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas advocated by the encyclical has proven a valuable resource for Catholic philosophy and theology in bringing both faith and reason to bear on the problems of modern life.

In ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry'' (1990) [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] examines three major rival traditions of moral inquiry: encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional. Each was given defense from a canonical piece published in the late 19th century (the 9th Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'' and Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s ''Aeterni Patris''). MacIntyre ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical [[Thomism]] as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry.

[[File:Statue of Liberty 7.jpg|thumb|German professor Sieglinde Lemke argues that the [[Statue of Liberty]] "signifies this proselytizing mission as the natural extension of the US' sense of itself as an exceptional nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winfried Fluck|author2=Donald E. Pease|author3=John Carlos Rowe|title=Re-framing the Transnational Turn in American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMEHiv4LnasC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2011|publisher=University Press of New England|page=207|isbn=9781611681901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''American exceptionalism''' is an ideology holding the [[United States]] as unique among nations in positive or negative connotations, with respect to its ideas of democracy and personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=What, exactly, is 'American exceptionalism'? | author=Tyrrell, Ian | date=October 21, 2016 | magazine=The Week | url=http://theweek.com/articles/654508/what-exactly-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the concept has no formal definition, there are some themes common to various conceptions of the idea. One is the history of the United States is different from other nations.&lt;ref name="amerExcep"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=812lbix0oH4C&amp;pg=PA18 ''American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.''] Seymour Martin Lipset. New York, N.Y.: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc. 1996. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, American [[exceptionalism]] stems from the [[American Revolution]], becoming what political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] called "the first new nation"&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''The first new nation'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the American ideology of "[[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]", based on [[liberty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[individualism]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], [[democracy]], and [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]]. This [[ideology]] itself is often referred to as "American exceptionalism."&lt;ref name=Lipset1997&gt;Lipset, ''American Exceptionalism'', pp. 1, 17–19, 165–74, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme is the idea that the U.S. has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the [[Gettysburg address]] (1863), Americans have a duty to ensure "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Another theme is the sense the United States' history and mission give it a superiority over other nations.

The theory of the [[exceptionalism]] of the U.S. has developed over time and can be traced to many sources. French political scientist and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was the first writer to describe the country as "exceptional" in 1831 and 1840.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville, Alexis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEQvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Democracy in America''] (1840), part 2, p. 36: "The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."&lt;/ref&gt; The actual phrase "American Exceptionalism" was originally coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] as a critique of a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] faction of American Communists who argued that the American political climate was unique, making it an 'exception' to certain elements of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] is often credited with having crystallized this ideology in recent decades.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Political scientist Eldon Eisenach argues in the twenty-first century American exceptionalism has come under attack from the postmodern left as a reactionary myth: "The absence of a shared purposes ratified in the larger sphere of liberal-progressive public policy....beginning with the assumption of American exceptionalism as a reactionary myth."&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Eisenach, "A Progressive Conundrum: Federal Constitution, National State, and Popular Sovereignty" in Stephen Skowronek et al., eds., ''The Progressives' Century: Political Reform, Constitutional Government, and the Modern American State'' (Yale UP. 2016) pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

The exact term "American exceptionalism" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', Fred Shapiro notes "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by [[The Times]] of London on August 20, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/27/american_exceptionalism_neither_joseph_stalin_nor_alexis_de_tocqueville.html Zimmer, Ben "Did Stalin Really Coin "American Exceptionalism"?", Slate.com] Retrieved 1st of February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Its common use dates from Communist usage in the late 1920s. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] chastised members of the [[Jay Lovestone]]-led faction of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] for its claim the U.S. was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions". Stalin may have been told of the usage "American exceptionalism" by Broder &amp; Zack in ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American Communists started using the English term "American exceptionalism" in factional fights. It then moved into general use among intellectuals.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Albert Fried, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&amp;pg=PA7 ''Communism in America: A History in Documents''] (1997), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald E. Pease|title=The New American Exceptionalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=10|isbn=978-0-8166-2782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted most American historians endorse exceptionalism. He suggests these historians reason as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Richard | year = 1989 | title = How Exceptional is the American Political Economy? | jstor = 2150989 | journal = Political Science Quarterly | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.2307/2150989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[postnationalism|postnationalist]] scholars have rejected American exceptionalism, arguing the U.S. did not break from European history, and accordingly, the U.S. has retained class-based and [[racial inequality in the United States|race-based differences]], as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Noble, ''Death of a Nation: American Culture and the end of exceptionalism'', pp. xxiii ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:
:Why has the myth of American exceptionalism, characterized by a belief in America's highly distinctive features or unusual trajectory based on the abundance of its natural resources, its revolutionary origins and its Protestant religious culture that anticipated God's blessing of the nation, held such tremendous staying power, from its influence in popular culture to its critical role in foreign policy?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Roberts and Lindsay DiCuirci, eds., ''American Exceptionalism''  (2013) vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology, thereby avoid entangling themselves in rhetorical debates. [[Bernard Bailyn]], a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase "American exceptionalism," he insists upon the "distinctive characteristics of British North American life." He has argued the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly American patterns of education (in the broadest sense of the word); and he believes in the unique character of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen and Stanley N. Katz. "Bernard Bailyn, Historian, and Teacher: An Appreciation." in James A. Henretta, Michael Kämmen, and Stanley N. Katz, eds. ''The Transformation of Early American History: Society, Authority, and Ideology'' (1991) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Although the concept of American exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution''. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in the 1920s.

Some claim the phrase "American exceptionalism" originated with the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] in an English translation of a condemnation made in 1929 by Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] criticizing Communist supporters of [[Jay Lovestone]] for the heretical belief the US was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions".&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=American+exceptionalism+stalin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=piVIT6arD8Xt0gGMsIXuDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20exceptionalism%20stalin&amp;f=false The New American Exceptionalism], [[Donald E. Pease]]  U of Minnesota Press, 2009 {{ISBN|0-8166-2783-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-2783-7}} Length 246 pages p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This origin has been challenged, however, because the expression "American exceptionalism" was already used by Brouder &amp; Zack in the ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. Also, Fred Shapiro, editor of ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', has noted "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image during the Civil War by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 20, 1861.

Early examples of the term's usage do include a declaration made at the 1930 American Communist convention proclaiming "the storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="atl1"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-joseph-stalin-invented-american-exceptionalism/254534/ How Joseph Stalin Invented American Exceptionalism], ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase fell to obscurity after the 1930s, and in the 1980s American newspapers popularized it to describe America's cultural and political uniqueness.&lt;ref name="atl1" /&gt; The phrase became an issue of contention between presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], with Republicans attacking Obama for not believing in the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iviea | first1 = Robert L. | last2 = Ginerb | first2 = Oscar | year = 2009 | title = American Exceptionalism in a Democratic Idiom: Transacting the Mythos of Change in the 2008 Presidential Campaign | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 359–75 | doi = 10.1080/10510970903109961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==

=== Alexis de Tocqueville and others, from 1835 ===
The first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by French writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835/1840 work, ''[[Democracy in America]]'':&lt;ref&gt;"Foreword: on American Exceptionalism; Symposium on Treaties, Enforcement, and U.S. Sovereignty", ''Stanford Law Review'', May 1, 2003, p. 1479&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants, his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward; his religion alone bids him turn, from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us cease, then, to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis de Tocqueville]], ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Vintage Books, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kammen says many foreign visitors commented on American exceptionalism including [[Karl Marx]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Hermann Eduard von Holst]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Hilaire Belloc]]; they did so in complimentary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kammen p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the [[McGuffey Readers]] sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the ''Readers'' "hailed American exceptionalism, [[manifest destiny]], and America as God's country... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quentin R. Skrabec|title=William McGuffey: Mentor to American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiBkkpCRRg4C&amp;pg=PA223|year=2009|publisher=Algora Publishing|page=223|isbn=978-0-87586-728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communist debate, 1927 ===
In June 1927 [[Jay Lovestone]], a leader of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party in America]] and soon to be named General Secretary, described America's economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism, and the country's "tremendous reserve power"; strength and power which he said prevented [[Communist revolution]].&lt;ref name=Fried1997&gt;Fried, Albert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&amp;pg=PA82 ''Communism in America: a history in documents'', pp. 7–8, 19, 82–92.] Columbia University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-231-10235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], disagreeing America was so resistant to revolution, called Lovestone's ideas "the heresy of American exceptionalism"&lt;ref name=Keywords&gt;Pease, Donald E. Editors: Bruce Burgett and Glenn Hendler. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vIR8U3XyQMC&amp;pg=PT116 "Exceptionalism", pp. 108–12], in "Keywords for American Cultural Studies''.

A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States. Vol. II, Vol. II. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1994, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniqueness===
In general, Americans have had consideration in national "uniqueness." Historian Dorothy Ross points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics.

=== 21st-century development ===
Recently, socialists and other writers tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U.S. within and outside its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm American Exceptionalism]. The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept has also been discussed in the context of the 21st century in a book co-authored by [[Dick Cheney|former American Vice President Dick Cheney]]: ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name="simonandschuster"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America|author=Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= 2015 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= November 3, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes in their historical context ==
Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.

=== Absence of feudalism ===
Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist [[Louis Hartz]]. In ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist  and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked any feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates and a hereditary nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine A. |last=Holland |title=Hartz and Minds: The Liberal Tradition after the Cold War |journal=Studies in American Political Development |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=227–33 |doi=10.1017/S0898588X05000155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "liberal consensus" school, typified by [[David M. Potter|David Potter]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Richard Hofstadter]] followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding [[private property]], [[individual right]]s, and [[representative government]]. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Cross |title=Comparative Exceptionalism: Rethinking the Hartz Thesis in the Settler Societies of Nineteenth-Century United States and Australia |journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies |year=1995 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–41 |jstor=41053761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puritan roots and Protestant promise===
Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to [[Puritan|American Puritan]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Gandziarowski, ''The Puritan Legacy to American Politics'' (2010) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Many Puritans with [[Arminian]] leanings embraced a middle ground between strict [[Predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist predestination]] and a less restricting theology of [[Divine Providence]]. They believed God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, [[John Winthrop]], metaphorically expressed this idea as a "[[City upon a Hill]]"—that the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model community for the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Justin B. Litke, "Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist," ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html |title=John Winthrop, A Modell of Christian Charity(1630)|editor=The Hanover Historical Texts Project |publisher=Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1838), 3rd series 7:31–48. |date=August 1996 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413143419/http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html| archivedate= April 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans' moralistic values {{clarify|date=June 2018}} remained part of the national identity of the United States for centuries, remaining influential to the present day.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In this vein, Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. Eric Luis Uhlmann of Northwestern University argues that Puritan values were taken up by all remaining Americans as time went by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/AME%20CHAPTER.POSTING.pdf |title=Chapter posting |website=www.socialjudgments.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its ''Protestant Promise'', especially [[Catholics]] and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPIVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=protestant+promise#v=onepage&amp;q=protestant+promise&amp;f=false|title=Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise|first=Kevin M.|last=Schultz|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199987542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Revolution and republicanism ===
The ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. Historian [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] has argued, "Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wood, "Introduction" in ''Idea of America: Reflections on the Birth of the United States'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Idea-America-Reflections-United-States/dp/1594202907#reader_B004IYIUFG online].&lt;/ref&gt; Wood notes that the term is "presently much-maligned," although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnSvZs1Q7_oC&amp;pg=PT240|year= 2009|publisher=Penguin|page=240|isbn=9781440637919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land, a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to [[republicanism]], the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ari |last=Hoogenboom |authorlink=Ari Hoogenboom |chapter=American Exceptionalism Republicanism as Ideology |editor-first=Elisabeth |editor-last=Gläser |editor2-first=Hermann |editor2-last=Wellenreuther |title=Bridging the Atlantic: the question of American exceptionalism in perspective |year=2002 |pages=43–67 |isbn=978-0-521-78205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom characterized the [[American Revolution]] in unique ways—at a time when major nations had state religions. Republicanism (led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]) created modern [[constitutional republicanism]], with a limit on ecclesiastical powers. Historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, "With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some particular purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kidd |title=God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2010 |page=9 |isbn=978-0-465-00235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd further argues that "a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, ''God of Liberty,'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty ===
According to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America "was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions". Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on "reason of state" (which could justify any action) and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, ''Empire of liberty: the statecraft of Thomas Jefferson'' (1992) quote on p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson envisaged America is becoming the world's great "[[Empire of Liberty]]"—that is, the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, for, he said on departing the presidency in 1809, America was: "Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tucker and  Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty'' p. 7; see John P. Foley, ed. ''The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia'' (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA895&amp;dq=%22Trusted+with+the+destinies+of+this+solitary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T4A-Ttm4IMPTiAK-37zDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Trusted%20with%20the%20destinies%20of%20this%20solitary%22&amp;f=false text p. 895]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of arguments ==

[[Marilyn B. Young]] argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an "American empire," a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of American empire. Young says the Iraq War (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn B. Young, "One Empire Under G", ''European Contributions to American Studies'', May 2004, Vol. 55, pp. 8–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, conservative historians [[Larry Schweikart]] and Dave Dougherty argued that American Exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) [[Common Law]]; (2) Virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) Free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, From America's Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb, 1898–1945''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-089-8}}. Moreover, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, Vol. II, From the Cold War to the Age of Entitlement, 1945–2012''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 book entitled ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', former U.S. [[Vice President Dick Cheney]] sets out and argues the case for American Exceptionalism, and concludes: "we are, as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] said, 'the last, best hope of earth.' We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Dick and Liz Cheney. ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', Threshold Editions, New York, 2015. pp. 259ff. {{ISBN|978-1-5011-1541-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States be exceptional in that it was founded on a set of [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his [[Gettysburg Address]], America is a nation "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". In Lincoln's interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and in world perspective, the American mission is to ensure, "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."  Historian [[T. Harry Williams]] argues that Lincoln believed:
: In the United States man would create a society that would be the best and the happiest in the world. The United States was the supreme demonstration of democracy. However, the Union did not exist just to make men free in America. It had an even greater mission—to make them free everywhere. By the mere force of its example, America would bring democracy to an undemocratic world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, "Abraham Lincoln – Principle and Pragmatism in Politics: A Review Article," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1953) 40#1 pp. 89–106 at page 97 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1897545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and [[checks and balances]] (among the legislative, executive and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a "[[tyranny of the majority]]", are preservative of a free republican democracy, and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters' values. A consequence of this political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than does a more [[unitary state|unitary]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Alan Dahl|title=Toward democracy--a journey: reflections, 1940–1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FacUAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies Press, University of California, Berkeley|page=2:711|isbn=9780877723721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Eric Foner]] has explored the question of birthright citizenship, the provision of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) that makes every baby born in the United States a full citizen.
He argues that:
: birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism... birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner,
[http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/ "Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism," ''The Nation'' Aug. 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global leadership and activism ===
Yale Law School Dean [[Harold Hongju Koh]] has identified what he says is "the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism." He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hongju Koh, "On American Exceptionalism" 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1479 (2003) quote at p. 1487 [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2737&amp;context=fss_papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peggy Noonan]], an American political pundit, wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that "America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional".

Former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on American foreign policy entitled ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', co-authored with his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]], a former official of the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= September 2015|website= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= October 5, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frontier spirit ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the "American spirit"  were shaped by the frontier process (following [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]). They argue the American frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Etulain, ''Does the Frontier Experience Make America Exceptional?'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations had frontiers, but it did not shape them nearly as much as the American frontier did, usually because it was under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia had long frontiers, but they did not have "free land" and local control.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D. Wyman and Clifton B. Kroeber, eds. ''Frontier in Perspective'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The political and cultural environments were much different—the other frontiers did not involve widespread ownership of free land nor allow the settlers to control the local and provincial governments as in America. Their edge did not shape their national psyches.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin K. Mikesell, "Comparative Studies in Frontier History," in Richard Hofstadter and Seymour Martin Lipset, eds., ''Turner and the Sociology of the Frontier'' (1968) pp. 152–72&lt;/ref&gt; Each nation had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers]] in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, "mateship" and working together was valued more than individualism was in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mateship and Individualism in Modern Australian Drama |first=Dennis |last=Carroll |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1982 |pages=467–80 |jstor=3206809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobility and welfare ===
{{further|Economic mobility|Social mobility}}
For most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, the United States has been known as the "land of opportunity", and in this sense, it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hartmut |last=Kaelble |title=Social Mobility in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Europe and America in Comparative Perspective |year=1981 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-05274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this [[social mobility]] include:
* Occupational—children could easily choose careers which were not based upon their parents' choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephan |last=Thernstrom |title=The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880–1970 |year=1999 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-1-58348-443-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical—that geographical location was not seen as static, and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Stephenson |first2=Richard |last2=Jensen |first3=Janice Reiff |last3=Webster |title=Social predictors of American mobility: a census capture-recapture study of New York and Wisconsin, 1875–1905 |publisher=Newberry Library |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Status—as in most countries, family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle. America was notably unusual due to an accepted wisdom that anyone—from poor immigrants upwards—who worked hard, could aspire to similar standing, regardless of circumstances of birth. This aspiration is commonly called living the [[American dream]]. Birth details were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or high political status in American culture. This stood in contrast to other countries where many larger offices were socially determined, and usually hard to enter without being born into the suitable social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter M. |last=Blau |first2=Otis Dudley |last2=Duncan |title=The American Occupational Structure |location=London |publisher=Collier Macmillan |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-02-903670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, social mobility in the U.S. is lower than in some [[European Union]] countries if defined regarding income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar people in the [[Nordic countries]] or the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/338|title=Structural rigidities in the US and Europe|last=De Grauwe|first=Paul|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many economists, such as Harvard economist [[N. Gregory Mankiw]], however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: "Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html|date=January 12, 2011|title=Half-Full Glass of Economic Mobility|format=blog|first=Greg|last=Mankiw|accessdate=January 1, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122182147/http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html| archivedate= January 22, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding public welfare, [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. "is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional." He concludes, "By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "How Exceptional is the American Political Economy?" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1989) 104#1 pp. 91, 92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150989 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Scholars have been polarized on the topic, according to [[Michael Kammen]] with historians generally against it, while empirical social scientists have tended to be supporters.   Kammen reports that historians Lawrence Veysey, [[C. Vann Woodward]], [[Eric Foner]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Akira Iriye]],  and Ian Tyrrell have been opponents, while support has come from social scientists [[Daniel Bell]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], Alex Inkeles, Sanford Jacoby, [[Samuel P. Huntington]], Mona Harrington, John P. Roche, Richard Rose, [[Peter Temin]], and [[Aaron Wildavsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" ''American Quarterly'' (1993) p. 2 [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR2/kammen.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kammen argues that the hostile attacks began in the 1970s in the wake of the Vietnam War, when many intellectuals decided, "The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the [[social history|new social history]] used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as social mobility. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a work party to emerge in the United States did not mean that America was exceptionally favorable grounds for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme chauvinism displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally mid-1980s, colonial historians downplayed the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history.&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some of the critics pulled their punches, with Wilentz arguing for "distinctively American forms of class conflict" and Foner saying there was a  "distinctive character of American trade unionism."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The third idea of American exceptionalism—superiority—has been attacked with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In ''American Exceptionalism and Human Rights'' (2005), Canadian commentator [[Michael Ignatieff]] couches his discussion of the topic in entirely pejorative terms. He identifies three main sub-types: "exemptionalism" (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); "double standards" (criticizing "others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies, but ignoring what these organizations say of the United States"); and "legal isolationism" (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Ignatieff|title=American Exceptionalism and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUiZLQdGJwkC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2009|pages=3–8|isbn=978-1400826889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exceptionalism as "exemptionalism" ===
During the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hegemony or Empire?: The Redefinition of US Power Under George W. Bush |author=Charles Philippe David, David Grondin|isbn = 978-0754647744|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being "above" or an "exception" to the law, specifically the [[public international law|Law of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/ |title=Could Bush Be Prosecuted for War Crimes? |journal=Alternet |last=Frel |first=Jan |date=July 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225220/http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/| archivedate= May 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.) This new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis, and actual orientation diverges somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to "old-style" or "traditional American exceptionalism"-the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others, that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history—also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by the [[public international law]]. Indeed, recent research shows that "there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thimm|first=Johannes|title=American Exceptionalism – Conceptual Thoughts and Empirical Evidence|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=29 October 2013|location=Berlin|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2013, in the context of U.S. President Barack Obama's comment about American exceptionalism during his September 10, 2013, talk to the American people while considering military action on [[Syria]] for its alleged use of [[chemical weapons]] against civilians, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized Obama saying that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?_r=0 ''Vladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fuss.''] CNN. 12 September 2013. Retrieved 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]] on October 4, 2013, President of Ecuador [[Rafael Correa]] criticized Obama's policies and compared America's exceptionalism with [[Nazi Germany]], saying: "Does not this remind you of the Nazis' rhetoric before and during World War II? They considered themselves the chosen race, the superior race, etc. Such words and ideas pose extreme danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecuador's Correa: Obama's exceptionalism talk reminiscent of Nazi rhetoric before WWII|url=http://rt.com/news/correa-us-exceptionalism-dangerous-748/|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=RT|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral purity ===
Critics on the left such as Marilyn Young and [[Howard Zinn]] have argued that American history is so morally flawed, citing [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] and [[social welfare]] issues, that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Zinn |title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present |year=1980 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=|title-link=A People's History of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign, especially when dealing with Native Americans.&lt;ref name="The Myth of American Exceptionalism"&gt;{{cite web | author = Howard Zinn |url=http://video.mit.edu/watch/the-myth-of-american-exceptionalism-9935/|title = The Myth of American Exceptionalism |accessdate=October 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192523/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/258/| archivedate= October 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald E. Pease]] mocks American exceptionalism as a "state fantasy" and a "myth" in his 2009 book ''The New American Exceptionalism''.&lt;ref name="Pease"&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Pease |title=The New American Exceptionalism |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pease notes that "state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask", showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] and the exposure of government incompetence after [[Hurricane Katrina]] "opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="Pease" /&gt;

American theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] argued that the automatic assumption that America acts for the right will bring about moral corruption. However, Niebuhr did support the nation's Cold War policies. His position (called "[[Christian realism]]") advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=Mark |last=Edwards |title='God Has Chosen Us': Re-Membering Christian Realism, Rescuing Christendom, and the Contest of Responsibilities during the Cold War |journal=Diplomatic History |year=2009 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67–94 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2008.00747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double standards ===
U.S. historians like Thomas Bender "try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the [[Cold War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/wp/?p=307 |title=Index of /wp |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary W.

=== The Americanist heresy ===
{{Main|Americanism (heresy)}}

In 1898 [[Pope Leo XIII]] denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanism]] in the encyclical ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7630&amp;CFID=11811177&amp;CFTOKEN=51286733 |title=Americanism, Then and Now: Our Pet Heresy |publisher=Catholic Culture |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He targeted  American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain, arguing that it stood in  opposition to Papal denunciations of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm |title=The Heresy of Americanism: Response to Radical Traditionalists |publisher=Bringyou.to |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100205103443/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm| archivedate= February 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.as.wvu.edu/massey.htm |title=The Phantom Heresy? |publisher=West Virginia University |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, there was a tendency among Catholic clergy in the United States to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations, and to argue that the understanding of Church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass  the 'American Experience', which included greater individualism, tolerance of other religions, and Church–State separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAvoy | first1 = Thomas T. | year = 1959 | title = The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899–1917 | url = | journal = Review of Politics | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 53–82 | doi=10.1017/s0034670500021975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-emptive declinism ===
[[Herbert London]] has defined ''pre-emptive [[declinism]]'' as a postmodern belief "that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=6372 |title=Is the U.S. Still a Dependable Ally? |publisher=Hudson Institute |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; London ascribed the view to [[Paul Krugman]], among others.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=35976 |title=Examining Declinism |publisher=HumanEvents.com |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman had written in ''The New York Times'' that "We have always known that America's reign as the world's greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when it came, would be something grand and tragic."&lt;ref name=Krugman /&gt;

According to [[RealClearPolitics]], declarations of America's declining power have been common in the English-language media. In 1988, [[Flora Lewis]] said that "Talk of U.S. decline is real in the sense that the U.S. can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills." According to [[Anthony Lewis]] in 1990, Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline. Citing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy and "crucial weaknesses" in the military, [[Tom Wicker]] concluded "that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult—nearly impossible—for the United States".&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com" /&gt; In 2004, [[Pat Buchanan]] lamented "the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism |title=The Decline and Fall of Declinism |publisher=American.com |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129075119/http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism| archivedate= January 29, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Matthew Parris]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in London wrote that the United States is "overstretched", romantically recalling the Kennedy presidency, when "America had the best arguments" and could use moral [[persuasion]] rather than force to have its way in the world. From his vantage point in Shanghai, the ''International Herald Tribune''{{'}}s [[Howard W. French|Howard French]] worries about "the declining moral influence of the United States" over an emergent China.&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/declinism.html |title=Three Centuries of American Declinism |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The Post-American World'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Fareed Zakaria]] refers to a "Post-American world" that he says "is not about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, Fareed, ''The Post-American World''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-670-08229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similarities between the U.S. and Europe ===
In December 2009, historian [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]] published a book arguing that, despite widespread attempts to contrast the '[[American way of life]]' and the '[[European social model]]', America and Europe are actually very similar to a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the U.S. and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ba6ffa-ed90-11de-ba12-00144feab49a,s01=1.html|title=Financial Times|last=Lloyd|first=John|date=December 20, 2009|work=Martian myths that flatter Europe|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]] argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which this subject has been broached the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the "dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance," and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which these characteristics are concentrated there.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto, Felipe. ''The Americas: A Hemispheric History''. New York: Modern Library, 2003. p. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current official stance and its detractors ==
In April 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] responded to a journalist's question in Strasbourg with the statement, "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kirchick28-2009apr28,0,4218519.story |title=Squanderer in chief |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2010 | first=James | last=Kirchick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama further noted that "I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040400700.html |title=On European Trip, President Tries to Set a New, Pragmatic Tone |work=The Washington Post |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2010 | first=Michael| last=Sheer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitt Romney]] attacked Obama's statement, arguing it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitt Romney|title=No Apology: The Case for American Greatness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDpBpo5CVB4C&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=29|isbn=978-1-4299-3960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Arkansas Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] said that Obama's "worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we've had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith, "The New Battle: What It Means to be American," August 20, 2010, [www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41273.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on the [[Syrian civil war|Syria crisis]] on September 10, 2013, Obama said: "however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Tumulty, "American exceptionalism, explained", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/12/american-exceptionalism-explained/?hpid=z10 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In a direct response the next day, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] published an [[op-ed]] in ''The New York Times'', articulating that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisher, "Vladimir Putin's New York Times op-ed, annotated and fact-checked", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/12/vladimir-putins-new-york-times-op-ed-annotated-and-fact-checked/?hpid=z1 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's views were soon endorsed by future president [[Donald Trump]] who declared the op-ed "a masterpiece": "You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You are not going to like that term," Trump said. "It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Kirchick|Kirchik, James]] (15 August 2016), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/15/beware-the-hillary-clinton-loathing-donald-trump-loving-useful-idiots-of-the-left.html?via=newsletter&amp;source=CSAMedition "Beware the Hillary Clinton-Loathing, Donald Trump-Loving Useful Idiots of the Left"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump's stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the [[New America Foundation]], who in a 2016 ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' magazine symposium remarked that "Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that [[Hillary Clinton]] and many Republicans support".&lt;ref&gt;Schwenninger, Sherle R., Heather Hurlburt, [[Stephen Kinzer]] and [[Juan Cole]] (24 May 2016),

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7566">{{Thomism}}
'''Analytical Thomism''' is a [[philosophical movement]] which promotes the interchange of ideas between the thought of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] (including the philosophy carried on in relation to his thinking, called '[[Thomism]]'), and modern [[analytic philosophy]].  

Scottish philosopher [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] first coined the term in the early 1990s and has since been one the movement's leading proponents. According to Haldane, "analytical Thomism involves the bringing into mutual relationship of the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the ideas and concerns shared by St Thomas and his followers" (Haldane 2004, xii).

==History==

The modern revival of Aquinas's thought can be traced to the work of mid-19th Century thomists, such as [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], [[Josef Kleutgen]], [[Gaetano Sanseverino]], and [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]].  This movement received an enormous impetus by [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' of 1879. In the first half of the twentieth century, [[Edouard Hugon]], [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], [[Étienne Gilson]], and [[Jacques Maritain]], among others, carried on Leo's call for a Thomist revival (Paterson &amp; Pugh, xiii-xxiii).  Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking [[List of Catholic philosophers and theologians|Catholic philosophers]].  Some of the latter then began to harmonize Thomism with broader contemporary philosophical trends.  

Similarly, the [[Józef Maria Bocheński|Kraków Circle]] in Poland used [[mathematical logic]] in presenting Thomism, which the Circle judged to have "a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment, etc." (Simons 2011, pp. 61-79).  The Circle has been said to be "the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars" (Kraków Philosophy, n.d.).

==Recent philosophical reception of Aquinas==

By the middle of the 20th century Aquinas's thought came into dialogue with the analytical tradition through the work of [[Elizabeth Anscombe|G. E. M. Anscombe]], [[Peter Geach]], and [[Anthony Kenny]].  Anscombe was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s student, and his successor at the [[University of Cambridge]]; she was married to Geach, himself an accomplished logician and [[philosopher of religion]].  Geach had converted to Roman Catholicism while studying at Oxford, Anscombe had converted before she came up, and both were instructed in the Faith in Oxford by the Dominican Richard Kehoe, who received them both into the Church before they met one another.  Kenny, an erstwhile priest and former Catholic, became a prominent philosopher at the [[University of Oxford]] and is still portrayed by some as a promoter of Aquinas (Paterson &amp; Pugh, xiii-xxiii), though his denial of some basic Thomist doctrines (e.g. divine timelessness) casts doubt on this.  

Anscombe, and others such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John Finnis]], can largely be credited with the revival of "[[virtue ethics]]" in [[meta-ethics|analytic moral theory]] and "[[natural law theory]]" in [[jurisprudence]].  Both movements draw significantly upon Aquinas.

'''Antiochus'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} or '''Antioch{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Kantemir''' or '''Cantemir''' ({{lang-ru|Антиох Дмитриевич Кантемир}}, ''Antiokh Dmitrievich Kantemir''; {{lang-ro|Antioh Cantemir}}; {{lang-tr|Antioh Kantemiroğlu}}; {{lang-fr|Antioche Cantemir}}; 8 September 1708&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 1744) was a [[Moldavia]]n who served as a [[Intellectual|man of letters]], [[diplomat]], and prince during the [[Russian Enlightenment]]. He has been called "the father of [[Russian poetry]]".

{{anchor|History|Biography}}

==Life==
Kantemir was born into a [[Cantemir dynasty|noble Moldavian family]] of [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] origin,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} "Kantemir" deriving from "[[Khan (surname)|Khan]] [[Timur]]",&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kingsford, ''Companion to Russian Studies: Volume 2, An Introduction to Russian Language and Literature'', CUP Archive (1980), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Iaşi]] on 8 September 1708.{{sfnp|Gusterin|2008}} His illiterate grandfather [[Constantin Cantemir|Constantin]] had been made [[Voivode of Moldavia|voivode]] of [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1685 and was succeeded by his well-educated sons [[Antioch Cantemir, Prince of Moldavia|Antioch]] and [[Demetrius Cantemir|Demetrius]]. Kantemir was the son of Demetrius by his wife, the Princess Kassandra [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzene]], who claimed descent from the [[Kantakouzenos|Byzantine dynasty]] of the same name.{{sfnp|Gusterin|2008}} He spent much of his youth in [[Constantinople]] as a hostage to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He was then educated by his father and at the [[St&amp;nbsp;Petersburg]] [[Saint Petersburg State University|Academy]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} before moving to the family estate near [[Dmitrovsk]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

He served as the Russian ambassador at [[London]] from 1731 to 1736, when he was relocated to [[Paris]] to serve as Russia's [[Diplomatic minister|minister plenipotentiary]] to the [[Kingdom of France]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} There, he became a noted intellectual{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and a close friend of [[Montesquieu]] and [[Voltaire]]. Kantemir died a bachelor in [[Paris]] amid litigation concerning his illegitimate children.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Work==
Considered "the father of [[Russian poetry]]",{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Kantemir used his [[Classicism|classical]] education to assist [[Peter the Great]]'s [[Russian Enlightenment|programme of modernizing and westernizing]] [[Russian culture]]. His most noticeable effort in this regard is his ''Petrida'', an unfinished [[epic poetry|epic]] glorifying the emperor. He produced a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] on old Russian [[Meter (poetry)|versification]] in 1744{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and numerous [[ode]]s and [[fable]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} His use of [[French poetry|gallic rhyme schemes]] can make his work seem antiquated and awkward to modern readers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

He edited his father's ''History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire'' in England and wrote a biography and bibliography of his father which later accompanied its 1756 edition.&lt;ref&gt;London: N. Tindal.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} His 1742 ''Letters on Nature and Man'' (''O Prirode i Cheloveke'') was a philosophical work.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He is best remembered for his [[satire]]s in the manner of [[Juvenal]], including ''To My Mind: On Those Who Blame Education'' and ''On the Envy and Pride of Evil-Minded Courtiers'', which were among the first such works in the Russian language.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

Kantemir also translated [[Horace]] and [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] into Russian, as well as [[Algarotti]]'s ''[[Dialogues on Light and Colors]]''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} His 1740 translation of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|De Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' was partly censored as [[Heresy|heretical]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} His own works were translated into [[French language|French]] by the [[Abbé Guasco]], who also penned his biography.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

In mid-2015, the concept achieved significant attention within the bitcoin community amid a contentious debate among core developers over increasing the block size cap.&lt;ref name="Hern-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/bitcoin-xt-alternative-cryptocurrency-chief-scientist|title=Bitcoin's forked: chief scientist launches alternative proposal for the currency|author=Alex Hern|date=|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current reference implementation for bitcoin contains a computational [[bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]].&lt;ref name="inth"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/inside-the-fight-over-bitcoins-future |title=Inside the Fight Over Bitcoin’s Future |author= |accessdate=7 January 2017 |date=25 August 2015 |newspaper=The New Yorker |publisher=Conde Naste }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This averages to a daily maximum of around 300,000 transactions.&lt;ref name="diov"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/212919-disagreement-over-bitcoins-future-threatens-to-fork-the-currency |title=Disagreement over Bitcoin’s future threatens to fork the currency |author=Ryan Whitwam |accessdate=7 January 2017 |date=25 August 2015 |work=Extreme Tech |publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed that the block size increase to eight megabytes, and from then onwards to automatically increase it exponentially, doubling every two years. The proposal did not gain the necessary support to go into effect on the Bitcoin network by early 2016, the earliest possible switchover date. Its use has been in steady decline from March 2016 onwards.

As of August 2017, Bitcoin XT is a [[Bitcoin Cash]] client by default.&lt;ref name="releases"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/releases|title=Bitcoin XT Releases|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On June 10, 2014 Mike Hearn published a ''Bitcoin Improvement Proposal'' (BIP 64), calling for the addition of "a small P2P protocol extension that performs [[UTXO]] lookups given a set of outpoints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0064.mediawiki|title=bips/bip-0064.mediawiki at master · bitcoin/bips · GitHub|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 27, 2014 Hearn released version 0.10 of the [[client (computing)|client]], with the BIP 64 changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/releases/tag/v0.10|title=bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 22, 2015, [[Gavin Andresen]] published BIP 101 calling for an increase in the maximum block size. The changes would activate a fork allowing eight MB blocks (doubling in size every two years) once 75% of a stretch of 1,000 mined blocks is achieved after the beginning of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki|title=bips/bip-0101.mediawiki at master · bitcoin/bips · GitHub|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new maximum transaction rate under XT would have been 24 transactions per second.&lt;ref name="edov"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2974339/bitcoin-xt-debate-overshadowing-growth-opportunities.html |title=Bitcoin XT debate overshadowing growth opportunities |author=Tim Hornyak |accessdate=7 January 2017 |date=21 August 2015 |work=PC World |publisher=IDG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2015 Andresen's BIP101 proposal was merged into the XT [[codebase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/946e3ba8c7806a66c2b834d3817ff0c986c0811b|title=Implement hard fork to allow bigger blocks · bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt@946e3ba|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/releases/tag/v0.11A|title=bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bip 101 was reverted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/117|title=2MB block size bump by dgenr8 · Pull Request #117 · bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2-MB block size bump of [[Bitcoin Classic]] was applied instead.

== Reception ==
The August 2015 release of XT received widespread media coverage. ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "bitcoin is facing civil war".&lt;ref name="Hern-2015" /&gt; 

''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' wrote that "Bitcoin XT exposes the extremely social — extremely democratic — underpinnings of the open source idea, an approach that makes open source so much more powerful than technology controlled by any one person or organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/bitcoin-schism-shows-genius-open-source/|title=The Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source|date=19 August 2015|work=WIRED|author=Cade Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Adam Back]] was critical of the 75% activation threshold being too low and that some of the changes were insecure.&lt;ref name="bisp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/20/bitcoin-splits-will-it-break-or-be-better-than-ever.html |title=Bitcoin splits: Will it break, or be better than ever? |author=Everett Rosenfeld |accessdate=5 January 2017 |date=20 August 2015 |work=CNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bitcoin Cash support==

On August 25, 2017, Bitcoin XT published ''Release G'', which was a [[Bitcoin Cash]] client by default.&lt;ref name="releases" /&gt; Subsequently, ''Release H'' was published, which supported the November 2017 Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade, followed by ''Release I'', which supported the May 2018 Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade.

'''Black separatism''' is a [[Separatism|separatist]] political movement that seeks separate economic and cultural development for those of [[Africa]]n descent in societies, particularly in the [[United States]]. Black separatism is a subcategory of [[black nationalism]], stemming from the idea of racial solidarity, and implies that blacks should organize themselves on the basis of their common experience of oppression as a result of their blackness, culture, and African heritage.{{sfn|Hall|1978|p=1}} Black separatism in its purest form, as a subcategory of black nationalism, asserts that blacks and whites ideally should form two independent nations.{{sfn|Hall|1978|p=3}} Black separatists also often seek their original cultural homeland. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in their advancement in a society dominated by a white majority.

==Black nationalism vs. black separatism==
There are similarities between [[black nationalism]] and black separatism. They both aim for the rights of blacks, but there are a few differences. All black separatists are black nationalists, but not all black nationalists are black separatists. Black separatists believe that black people should be physically separated from other races, primarily whites; black separatists would want a separate nation for black people. This is slightly different from black nationalists because black nationalists don't always believe in a physical separation of black people. In some form, black nationalists do believe in separation, but not physical separation. Black nationalists focus more on black pride, justice, and identity. Their belief is that blacks should be proud of their own skin, heritage, and beauty. They also believe that there should be justice for black people especially in America. Examples of black nationalist organizations include the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. A specific example of a separatist movement is the [[Pan-Africanism]] movement.{{sfn|Hall|1978|p=2}}

==Concepts==
[[File:Solidarity.jpg|framed|center|Conceptual Breakdown of Black Separatism]]
In his discussion of [[black nationalism]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the historian [[Wilson Jeremiah Moses]] observes that "black separatism, or self-containment, which in its extreme form advocated the perpetual physical separation of the races, usually referred only to a simple institutional separatism, or the desire to see black people making independent efforts to sustain themselves in a proven hostile environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moses|1988|p= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars Talmadge Anderson and James Stewart further make a distinction between the "classical version of Black separatism advocated by [[Booker T. Washington]]" and "modern separatist ideology." They observe that "Washington's accommodationist advice" at the end of the nineteenth century "was for Blacks not to agitate for social, intellectual, and professional equality with Whites."  By contrast, they observe, "contemporary separatists exhort Blacks not only to equal Whites but to surpass them as a tribute to and redemption of their African heritage."&lt;ref name="anderson203"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stewart|2007|p= 203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson and Stewart add, moreover, that in general "modern black separatism is difficult to define because of its similarity to black nationalism."&lt;ref name="anderson203" /&gt;

Indeed, black separatism's specific goals were historically in flux and varied from group to group. [[Martin Delany]] in the 19th century and [[Marcus Garvey]] in the 1920s outspokenly called for African Americans to return to [[Africa]], by moving to [[Liberia]]. [[Benjamin "Pap" Singleton]] looked to form separatist colonies in the American West. The [[Nation of Islam]] calls for several independent black states on American soil. More mainstream views within black separatism hold that black people would be better served by schools and businesses exclusively for black people, and by local black politicians and police.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Causation in Sciences Project''' ('''CauSci''') is a 4-year interdisciplinary research project on the field of [[Causality|causation]] in the [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]], funded by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] (NFR) and hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073703/http://www.umb.no/ior-en School of Economics and Business] at the [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (NMBU).

[[Causality]] is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is [[Philosophy|philosophers]] who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.

[http://www.umb.no/causci/article/about-causci CauSci] is based on a [[Disposition (philosophy)|dispositional]] theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as [[Event (philosophy)|event]] that disposes towards an [[result|effect or outcome]]. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely [[Reductionism]] versus [[holism]] in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of [[Subatomic particle|subatomic particles.]] But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers’ fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new [[causality|causal powers]] emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified.

The project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/people Norwegian and international] researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.

== Methodology ==
The methodological basis of the project is that [[philosophy]] should not dictate to [[science]] and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and [[empirically]] satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete.

Four central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/causal-dispositionalism causal dispositionalist] hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.

==The problem==
===Chloroplasts and mitochondria===
[[Chloroplasts]] and [[mitochondria]] are energy-converting organelles in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[eukaryotic cells]].  Chloroplasts in [[plant cells]] perform [[photosynthesis]]; the capture and conversion of the energy of [[sunlight]].  Mitochondria in both plant and [[animal cells]] perform [[cellular respiration|respiration]]; the release of this stored energy when work is done.  In addition to these key reactions of [[bioenergetics]], chloroplasts and mitochondria each contain specialized and discrete genetic systems.  These genetic systems enable chloroplasts and mitochondria to make some of their own [[proteins]].

Both the genetic and energy-converting systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria are descended, with little modification, from those of the free-living bacteria that these organelles once were.  The existence of these cytoplasmic [[genomes]] is consistent with, and counts as evidence for, the [[endosymbiont hypothesis]].  Most genes for proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are, however, now located on [[chromosomes]] in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.  There they code for protein precursors that are made in the [[cytosol]] for subsequent import into the organelles.

===Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genetic systems?===
{{quote|text=Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts require their own separate genetic systems, when other organelles that share the same cytoplasm, such as peroxisomes and lysosomes, do not? The question is not trivial, because maintaining a separate genetic system is costly: more than 90 proteins ... must be encoded by nuclear genes specifically for this purpose. ... The reason for such a costly arrangement is not clear, and the hope that the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes would provide the answer has proved to be unfounded. We cannot think of compelling reasons why the proteins made in mitochondria and chloroplasts should be made there rather than in the cytosol.|sign= Alberts et al. |source= ''The Molecular Biology of the Cell''. Garland Science. All editions (pgs 868-869 in 5th edition)&lt;ref name="AlbertsJohnson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Alberts|author2=Alexander Johnson|author3=Julian Lewis|author4=Martin Raff|author5= Keith Roberts|author6= Peter Walter|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjMmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA869&amp;q=The+reason+for+such+a+costly+arrangement+is+not+clear#v=snippet|date=16 November 2007|publisher=Garland Science|pages=868–869|isbn=9781136844423}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cytoplasmic inheritance===
CoRR seeks to explain why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain [[DNA]], and thus why some characters are inherited through the cytoplasm in the phenomenon of cytoplasmic, non-[[Mendelian]], uniparental, or [[maternal inheritance]].  CoRR does so by offering an answer to this question: why, in [[evolution]], did some bacterial, [[endosymbiont]] genes move to the [[cell nucleus]], while others did not?

==Proposed solution==
CoRR states that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain those [[genes]] whose expression is required to be under the direct, regulatory control of the redox state of their gene products, or of [[electron]] carriers with which those gene products interact.  Such genes comprise a core, or primary subset, of organellar genes.  The requirement for redox control of each gene in the primary subset then confers an advantage upon location of that gene within the organelle.  [[Natural selection]] therefore anchors some genes in organelles, while favouring location of others in the cell nucleus.

Chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also contain genes for components of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genetic systems themselves.  These genes comprise a secondary subset of organellar genes: genetic system genes.  There is generally no requirement for redox control of expression of genetic system genes, though their being subject to redox control may, in some cases, allow [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] of redox signals acting upon genes in the primary subset (bioenergetic genes).

Retention of genes of the secondary subset (genetic system genes) is necessary for the operation of redox control of expression of genes in the primary subset.  If all genes disappear from the primary subset, CoRR predicts that there is no function for genes in the secondary subset, and such organelles will then, eventually, lose their genomes completely.  However, if even only one gene remains under redox control, then an organelle genetic system is required for the synthesis of its single gene product.

==Evidence==
* Different products of [[protein synthesis]] in isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria are obtained in the presence of redox reagents with different [[redox potential]]s.&lt;ref name="Allen_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen CA, Hakansson G, Allen JF | title = Redox Conditions Specify the Proteins Synthesized by Isolated-Chloroplasts and Mitochondria | journal = Redox Report | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–123 | year = 1995  | pmid = | doi = | url = http://jfallen.org/publications/pdf/Allen_1995_RR.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mitochondria, the effect results from a redox signal at the level of respiratory [[complex II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7716">'''Contemplative Outreach''' was established in 1983 to help develop a network of individuals interested in the practice of [[Centering Prayer]] as taught by Father [[Thomas Keating]]. Three monks of [[St. Joseph's Abbey]] in Spencer, Massachusetts are attributed with developing the practices used by Contemplative Outreach; Fathers [[Thomas Keating]], [[William Meninger]], and [[Basil Pennington|M. Basil Pennington]]. Fathers Meninger and Pennington began giving retreats to priests and nuns based on the 14th-century text ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', considered a classic in many cloistered monastic traditions. Father Keating was serving as the abbot at Spencer Monastery and encouraged this work. In 1983, Father Thomas Keating had retired to live at [[St. Benedict's Monastery (Colorado)|St. Benedict's Monastery]] in Snowmass, Colorado. After giving a retreat on Centering Prayer at the [[Lama Foundation]] the seeds of Contemplative Outreach were planted. 

==Contemplative Outreach today==
{{update section|date=November 2017}}
Contemplative Outreach is an ecumenical, international organization today, whose stated purpose is to:
# Bring the experience of the love of God into the world
# Renew the contemplative dimension of life
# Renew the roots of the tradition, engendering attitudes of respect, collaboration, and love among the world's religions
# Transform human consciousness for our time
# Support all sincere seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517003134/http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer |archivedate=2009-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The stated intent of Contemplative Outreach is to foster the process of transformation in Christ in one another through the practice of [[Centering Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_vision |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819000910/http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_vision |archivedate=2009-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemplative Outreach offers a number of different retreats and teachings with Centering Prayer and [[Lectio Divina]] as the primary methods used to enter into contemplative prayer.

Centering Prayer is a generic term used today for many different methods of prayer and meditation. In Contemplative Outreach it is based on the four guidelines developed by Father Meninger and based on ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]''. 

As abbot of St. Joseph's Abbey, Fr. Keating attended a meeting in Rome in 1971. At the meeting, Pope Paul VI called on the members of the clergy to revive the contemplative dimension of the Gospel in the lives of both monastic and laypeople. Believing in the importance of this revival, Fr. Keating encouraged the monks at St. Joseph's to develop a method of Christian contemplative prayer with the same appeal and accessibility that Eastern [[meditation]] practices seemed to have for modern people. A monk at the abbey named William Meninger found the background for such a method in the anonymous fourteenth-century classic ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]''. Using this and other contemplative literature, Meninger developed a simple method of silent prayer he called The Prayer of the Cloud.

Meninger began to offer instruction on The Prayer of the Cloud to priests who came to the monastery for retreats. The prayer was well received and, as word got out, more people wanted to learn the prayer, so Fr. Keating began to offer workshops to the lay community in Spencer. Another monk at the abbey, Basil Pennington, also began to teach The Prayer of the Cloud to priests and sisters at retreats away from St. Joseph's. At one retreat, someone suggested that the name of the prayer be changed to Centering Prayer, alluding to Thomas Merton's description of contemplative prayer as prayer that is "centered entirely on the presence of God...His will...His love...[and] Faith by which alone we can know the presence of God." From then on, the prayer was called Centering Prayer.

In 1983, Fr. Keating gave the first "intensive" Centering Prayer retreat at the Lama Foundation in San Cristobal, New Mexico. One of the participants in the retreat, Gustave Reininger, previously had met with Fr. Keating and a man named Edward Bednar to discuss starting a contemplative network. After their meeting, Bednar wrote a grant proposal, which he called Contemplative Outreach, and received funds to start parish-based programs in New York City that offered introductions to Centering Prayer. This marked the beginning of the Contemplative Outreach Centering Prayer Program and a milestone in Contemplative Outreach's birth as an organization.

Other participants in the retreat at the Lama Foundation also played a large part in the growth of Contemplative Outreach. In 1985, participants David Frenette and Mary Mrozowski, along with Bob Bartel, established a live-in community in the eastern United States called Chrysalis House. For 11 years, Chrysalis House provided a consistent place to hold Centering Prayer workshops and retreats. Many Centering Prayer practitioners and teachers who now carry on the work of Contemplative Outreach were trained and inspired at Chrysalis House.

In 1986, the three monks' experiment was incorporated as Contemplative Outreach, Ltd., and the first official board of directors was named. Fr. Keating served as the first president, Fr. Carl Arico as vice president, Gustave Reininger as treasurer, and Mary Mrozowski and Gail Fitzpatrick-Hopler as directors. At first, the organization was run from Gail Fitzpatirick-Hopler's dining room table. After several necessary expansions, the network's international headquarters now has offices in {{convert|2000|sqft|m2}} of space in downtown Butler, New Jersey, with  seven full-time employees, two part-time employees, and five volunteers.

[[File:Inner Sanctum of Sri Chalukya Kumara Rama Bheemeshwara Swamy Temple in SAMALKOT.jpg|thumb|360px|A ''darśana'' literally a means glimpse or view. In a [[Hindu temple]], the term refers to viewing the inner sanctum under the main [[Shikhara]] or [[Gopuram]] of the temple, which hosts the [[murti]] (image of a god). The above arrangement is for darśana at the [[Chalukya Kumararama Bhimeswara Temple]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

'''Darśana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दर्शन, lit. ''view, sight'') is the auspicious sight of a deity or a holy person.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} The term also refers to six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] and their literature on spirituality and [[soteriology]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word, also in the forms of ''darśana'' or ''darshanam'', comes from [[Sanskrit]] दर्शन, from ''dṛś'', "to see", [[vision (spirituality)|vision]], apparition or glimpse.

==Definition==
''Darśana'' is described as an "auspicious sight" of a holy person, which bestows merit on the person who is seen.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} "Sight" here means seeing or beholding, and/or being seen or beheld.

It is most commonly used for [[theophany]], "manifestation / visions of the divine", in [[Hindu worship]], e.g. of a deity (especially in image form), or a very holy person or artifact. One can receive ''darśana'' or a glimpse of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great [[guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Darshan |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151828/darshan |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
The term ''darśana'' also refers to the six systems of thought, called ''darśanam'', that comprise classical [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett284&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, pages 88, 284&lt;/ref&gt; The term therein implies how each of these six systems distinctively look at things and the scriptures in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=royperrett284/&gt;&lt;ref name=britdarshan/&gt; The six orthodox Hindu ''darśana'' are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta]]. Buddhism and Jainism are examples of non-Hindu ''darśana''s.&lt;ref name=britdarshan&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/darshan Darshan - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Mahayana Buddhism ==
&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Mahāyāna Buddhism" links here. Please adjust accordingly if renaming or removing section.--&gt;
On the significance of ''darśana'' in [[Mahayana]] thought, Paul Harrison writes: "By the second century CE... the vision of the [[Buddha]] (''buddha-darśana'') and the accompanying hearing of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-śravaṇa'') are represented as a transformation experience of decisive importance for practitioners, be they who have renounced (mundane life) "ascetics" or householders."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harrison, "Commemoration and identification in Buddhanusmṛti", in {{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharma]], collections of systematic summaries of the [[sutra]]s, mention ''Darśana-[[citta]], i.e.'' [[vision (spirituality)|visions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Mahayana philosophers [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] acknowledged [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#Five Paths|five paths to liberation]], of which the third is ''darśana-marga'', the "path of seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gethin|1998|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarjuna]], a prominent philosopher of the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Mahayana Buddhism, wrote that the wise person perceives ''[[tattva]]-darśana,'' true reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] |trans-title=Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way |chapter=Chapter 26 |at=verse 10 |nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unno|1993|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}

==Other meanings==
''Darśana'' also sometimes has a more mundane meaning. For example, [[Sivananda Saraswati]] wrote in his book ''The Practice of Brahmacharya'' that one of the eight aspects of [[brahmacharya]] ([[Celibacy#Hinduism|celibacy]]) is not to look lustfully at women: "You should carefully avoid... Darshana or looking at women with passionate resolve".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sivananda|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar of religion Richard H. Davis has said that ''darśana'' (viewpoint, philosophical school) is one of three terms in classical Indian discourse that could be considered roughly analogous to what today's English-speakers understand as "religion." The other two terms are ''[[dharma]]'' (duty, morality, a code of proper conduct) and ''[[Buddhist Paths to liberation|marga]]'' (route, spiritual path). According to Davis, "most Hindu texts accepted that religious paths (''marga'') are relative to the points of view (''darśana'') and moral responsibilities (''dharma'') of practitioners, whose individual circumstances may make one or another course of action more appropriate in their particular situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2008|pp=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet [[Gary Snyder]] has given a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] meaning to ''darśana'': 
{{quote|It's a gift; it's like there's a moment in which the thing is ready to let you see it. In India, this is called ''darshan''. Darshan means getting a view, and if the clouds blow away, as they did once for me, and you get a view of the [[Himalayas]] from the foothills, an Indian person would say, 'Ah, the Himalayas are giving you their darshana'; they're letting you have their view. This comfortable, really deep way of getting a sense of something takes time. It doesn't show itself to you right away. It isn't even necessary to know the names of things the way a botanist would. It's more important to be aware of the '[[suchness]]' of the thing; it's a reality. It's also a source of a certain kind of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for [[creativity]]. I see it in the work of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1994|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Sikh culture, folios or manuscripts that depict all ten Gurus on a single page are called ''darśana'' paintings, simply because they offer a vision of all ten sacred Gurus in one glance.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">The '''Donglin Academy''' ({{zh|c=東林書院|p=Dōnglín Shūyuàn|l=Eastern Grove Academy}}, Wade–Giles ''Tung-lin''), also known as the '''Guishan Academy''' (龜山書院 ''Guīshān Shūyuàn''), was a former Chinese educational institution in [[Wuxi]], [[China]]. It was originally built in 1111 during the [[Northern Song dynasty]]; the [[neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Yang Shi (Song dynasty)|Yang Shi]] (楊時) taught there, but the academy later fell into disuse and disrepair. The name "Donglin" was inspired by the [[Donglin Temple (Jiangxi)|Donglin Temple]] at the base of [[Mount Lu]], [[Jiangxi]]. Yang Shi visited the Donglin Temple and felt that it was a good place for teaching. When he finished his scholarship, he travelled to Wuxi and saw that the layout of the academy was similar to the Donglin Temple, so he taught at that site for 18 years. The academy was thus called "Donglin Academy".

[[File:Donglin school in Wuxi.jpg|thumb|right|An old stone memorial arch in the Donglin Academy]]

In 1604, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli era]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Gu Xiancheng]] (1550–1612), a [[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secretary]], along with the scholar [[Gao Panlong]] (高攀龍; 1562–1626), and fellow scholars [[Qian Yiben]] (錢一本) and [[Yu Kongjian]] (余孔兼) restored the Donglin Academy with financial backing from the local gentry and officials such as Ouyang Dongfeng (歐陽東風), the governor of Changzhou, and Lin Zai (林宰), the county magistrate of Wuxi. The academy gave its name to the resulting [[Donglin movement]].

In 1626, the academy was brutally destroyed, leaving only part of the stone memorial arch. The contemporary academy was a reconstruction during the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng]] and [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] emperors to win the support of [[Han Chinese]] scholars living in Wuxi.&lt;ref name="dlsy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.synyan.net/2011/%E6%A2%81%E6%BA%AA%E6%BC%AB%E5%BF%9733%E4%B8%9C%E6%9E%97%E4%B9%A6%E9%99%A2%E4%B8%BA%E6%B8%85%E6%B5%81/ |script-title=zh:东林书院为清流 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |author=老虎 |date=2011-02-19 |language=zh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the People's Republic of China redecorated the academy between 1981 and 1982.

'''Edward Abramowski''' (17 August 1868 – 21 June 1918) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[philosopher]], libertarian socialist,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Polski Słownik Biograficzny]]''. T. 1. [[Polska Akademia Umiejętności]] – Skład Główny w Księgarniach Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1935. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchist]], [[psychologist]], [[ethics|ethician]], and supporter of [[cooperative]]s. Abramowski is considered to be a spiritual father of [[Anarchism in Poland]].

Abramowski was born in Stefanin, in the [[Kiev Governorate]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) to Jadwiga and Edward. After his mother died (in 1878), he moved to [[Warsaw]] in 1879, where his teacher, [[Maria Konopnicka]], introduced him to the members of the [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Krystyna | last = Najder-Stefaniak | title = Specyfika i wartość sztuki w ujęciu anarchisty | year = 2011 | publisher = Universitas | url = http://www.publio.pl/files/samples/8b/7c/db/60513/Wybor_pism_estetycznych_demo.pdf | work = Wybór pism estetycznych | accessdate = 2012-09-05 | language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Leo Tolstoy]], Abramowski called himself a "state-rejecting socialist" in his most important work, ''Socialism &amp; State''. He went on to further his political philosophy in other works, such as ''The Republic of Friends'', and ''General Collusion Against the Government''. In later years, his thought increasingly tended towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]], emphasising the importance of co-operative organization of the work force.

Abramowski is considered the founder of the Polish co-operative movement, promoting economic associations &amp; initiatives. As a cooperativist, he founded the biggest countrywide consumer cooperative "Spolem" (''Together''), and cofounded the [[Polish Socialist Party]].

Alongside this politico-social theorising, he also conducted an intense research activity in the field of experimental psychology, showing particular interest in the subconscious. This gave him a certain notoriety abroad &amp; in 1916 he was given a chair in [[Experimental Psychology]] at the [[University of Warsaw]], which he occupied until his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">The '''equal authenticity rule''' is a rule of judicial interpretation developed by Canadian courts as a way of interpreting laws which are written in two parallel texts in English and French. The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each Canadian law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions do not say exactly the same thing. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', which states, ''inter alia'', "The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [i.e. both English and French]."

==History==
The rule requires courts to treat "both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law,"&lt;ref&gt;This definition of the equal authenticity rule is from Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule holds that both versions are equally authoritative even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible.

An early version of the principle may be found a statute of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, enacted in 1857. The ''Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure'' requires that the Civil Code of Lower Canada be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: "[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side." It has been suggested that this provision of the 1857 Act is "best understood as a non-verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically." &lt;ref&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Toronto: LexisNexis, 2008, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this is an overstatement, it is certainly true that side-by-side publication was the first step towards the eventual adoption of the Equal Authenticity Rule for interpreting bilingual statutes.

The equal authenticity rule was developed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1891, in the court’s ruling in ''[[CPR v. Robinson]]''. This case dealt with the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'', which is enacted in both French and English.

By implication, the rule also related to all laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada, as section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' is equally binding upon the federal Parliament and Quebec legislation.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] first applied this rule of judicial interpretation to Acts of Parliament in 1935, in its ruling in the case of ''[[R. v. DuBois]]''

The rule was reaffirmed as section 18(1) in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], when the constitution was repatriated in 1982.

==Unresolved issue regarding the application of the rule==
Some Canadian provinces (Quebec and Manitoba from the time of their establishment, and since 1982 New Brunswick) are constitutionally obligated to enact all laws in both official languages. However, a number of other provinces, such as Ontario, have opted to enact their laws in both English and French, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. One question, not yet tested in the courts, "arises...as to whether both versions of bilingual legislation enacted in a province where there is no constitutional requirement to do so would be considered equally authoritative in the absence of an express Equal Authenticity Rule."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; (An "express" equal authenticity rule would presumably take the form of such a rule in the relevant province's ''Interpretation Act'' or some other piece of [[Quasi-constitutionality|quasi-constitutional legislation]].

Bastarache ''et al.'', who raise this question, answer it in the affirmative, explaining that in their view, "the logic applicable to federal, Quebec and Manitoba legislation under the Constitution would also apply [even in the absence of a legislated statement of this logic]: that is, where two languages [sic] versions of a statute are enacted simultaneously both versions will be considered equally authoritative."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Fediverse''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "federation" and "universe") is the ensemble of [[Federation_(information_technology) |federated]] servers that are used for [[web publishing]] (i.e. [[social networking]], [[microblogging]] or [[websites]]) and file hosting. 
On different servers (instances), users can create so called identities. These identities are able to communicate over the boundaries of the instances because the softwares running on the servers support one or more [[Communication protocol|communication protocols]] which follow the [[open standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastoguide.info/Pages/fedFAQ.html|title=Mastodon User Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409030653/http://mastoguide.info/Pages/fedFAQ.html|archive-date=2017-04-09|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an identity on the fediverse, you are able to exchange private messages or other data with other identities or to follow posts by other identities. In some cases, you can even show or share data (video, audio, text and other files) publicly or to a selected group of identities and allow other identities to edit your data (i.e. a calendar or an address book).  

== History ==
In 2008, the social network [[identi.ca]] was founded by [[:en:Evan Prodromou|Evan Prodromou]]. He published the software [[GNU Social]] under a [[free license]] ([[GNU Affero General Public License|GNU Affero General Public License, AGPL]]). Besides the server, identi.ca, there were only few other instances existing, run by persons for their own use. This changed in 2011/2012 when identi.ca switched to another software called [[pump.io]]. Several new GNU Social instances were created.
At the same time as GNU Social, other projects like [[Friendica]], Hubzilla,&lt;ref name="Hubzilla gnusoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://framagit.org/hubzilla/addons/tree/master/gnusoc |title=gnusoc · master · hubzilla / addons |access-date=2018-07-17 |author=framagit.org/hubzilla/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]] and Pleroma &lt;ref name="Pleroma"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pleroma.social/ |author=pleroma.social|title=Pleroma |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated the [[OStatus]] protocol, thus extending the fediverse.

In the meantime, other communication protocols have evolved which are integrated to different degrees into the platforms. In January 2016, the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] presented the [[ActivityPub|ActivityPub]] protocol, aiming to improve the interoperability between the platforms. At the present time (August 2018), this protocol is supported by thirteen platforms (see the table below).

== Communication protocols used in the fediverse ==
These [[Communication protocol|communication protocols]] which follow the [[open standard]] are used in the fediverse:

Some of them vaguely resemble [[Twitter]] in style (for example, [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]] and [[GNU social|GNU Social]], which are similar in their [[microblogging]] function), while others include more communication and transaction options that are instead comparable to Google+ or Facebook (such as is the case with [[Friendica]] and Hubzilla).

The following software platforms span the fediverse by using the listed communication protocols:

'''George Boas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|æ|z}}; 28 August 1891 &amp;ndash; 17 March 1980) was a Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He received his education at [[Brown University]], obtaining both a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Philosophy there, after which he studied shortly at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and finally at [[UC Berkeley]], where he earned his [[PhD]] in 1917.

In 1921, Boas was hired at Johns Hopkins by Professor [[A.O. Lovejoy]] as an historian of philosophy. Boas' tenure at Hopkins was interrupted by the [[Second World War]], in which he served as a [[Commander]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]]. One of his undergraduate students was [[Alger Hiss]], with whom he kept in contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hiss |first=Tony | date=1997 |title=The View from Alger's Window}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 at John Hopkins, [[Owen Lattimore]] was indicted by the [[McCarran Committee]] for [[perjury]]. At Boas' initiative, a Lattimore Defense Fund was set up in January 1953 with the goal to gather funds to pay for the legal fees of the defense.&lt;ref name="Levallois2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levallois|first1=Clement|title=Why Were Biological Analogies in Economics “A Bad Thing”?

He retired from the school in 1956, continuing his scholarly career with a fellowship at the Center for the Humanities at [[Wesleyan University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958 - 1969] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=2017-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as visiting [[Andrew W.

The '''Gukhak''', was the sole recorded institution of higher learning in the [[Silla]] period of medieval [[History of Korea|Korean history]].&lt;ref name="Gyeongju City"&gt;[http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8283&amp;tab=1 ''Gyeongju Hyanggyo (a local school annexed to the Confucian shrine)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140259/http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8283&amp;tab=1 |date=2011-07-22 }} Gyeongju City-Transportation System, Retrieved on August 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It provided training in the [[Chinese classics]].  An earlier institution, the [[Taehak]], had been founded in 372.

The Gukhak was established early in the [[Unified Silla]] period, in 682 (the second year of [[Sinmun of Silla|King Sinmun]]).&lt;ref name="Gyeongju City" /&gt; During the reign of King [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|Gyeongdeok]] (r. 742-765) its name was changed briefly to ''Daehakgam'' (대학감, 大學監) but reverted to ''Gukhak'' during the following reign of King [[Hyegong of Silla|Hyegong]] (r. 765-780). Like its counterpart in Tang China, the Gukhak was established primarily to train local officials in the Confucian classics and the composition skills requisite for the governance of an enlarged Silla state. The establishment of such an institution was increasingly critical by the 7th century with the maturation of Silla's bureaucratic system modeled upon that of Tang China.

The Gukhak was superseded by the [[Gukjagam]], which was established in [[Gaegyeong]] in 992 during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

== Entrance qualifications ==
In the Gukhak, people who have less than an ambassador or who can have a degree even if they do not. It was able to enter Gukhak from 15 to 30 years old. When they graduated from the Gukhak, they was given the title of Nama or 'Daema'. It is estimated that most of the students were six-dupum. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EA%B5%AD%ED%95%99&amp;ridx=2&amp;tot=58|title=국학(國學) - 한국민족문화대백과사전|website=encykorea.aks.ac.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism |schools}}
'''Hatha yoga''' is a branch of [[Yoga]], one of the six schools of [[Hinduism]]. The word ''haṭha'' literally means "force" and thus alludes to a system of physical techniques.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[[James Mallinson (author)|Mallinson, James]] (2011). [https://www.academia.edu/1317005/Ha_ha_Yoga ''Hatha Yoga''] Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism Vol. 3 (pp. 770-781). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|770}}&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;Birch, Jason (2011). [https://www.academia.edu/1539699/Meaning_of_ha%E1%B9%ADha_in_Early_Ha%E1%B9%ADhayoga ''The Meaning of haṭha in Early Haṭhayoga''] Journal of the American Oriental Society
131.4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|527}}

In India hatha yoga is associated in popular tradition with the 'Yogis' of the [[Natha Sampradaya]] through its mythical founder [[Matsyendranath]]. Matsyendranath, also known as Minanath or Minapa in Tibet, is celebrated as a saint in both Buddhist and Hindu tantric and hatha yoga schools. However, James Mallinson associates hatha yoga with the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] and the mystical figure of [[Dattatreya]].&lt;ref&gt;James Mallinson (2014). [https://www.academia.edu/5304343/The_Yog%C4%ABs_Latest_Trick The Yogīs’ Latest Trick]. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (Third Series), 24, pp 165-180. doi:10.1017/S1356186313000734.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3490868/Yoga_and_Yogis Yoga and Yogis]. March 2012. James Mallinson. pg. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dattatreya Yoga Śastra, there are two forms of hatha yoga: one practiced by [[Yajñavalkya]] consisting of the eight limbs of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|ashtanga yoga]] and another practiced by [[Kapila]] consisting of eight [[mudra]]s. Currently, the oldest dated text to describe hatha yoga, the 11th century CE ''Amṛtasiddhi'', comes from a tantric Buddhist milieu.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James (2016). [https://www.academia.edu/26700528/The_Am%E1%B9%9Btasiddhi_Ha%E1%B9%ADhayogas_Tantric_Buddhist_Source_Text] ''The Amṛtasiddhi: Hathayoga's tantric Buddhist source text''&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest texts to use the actual verbiage of ''hatha'' are also [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist.&lt;ref name="JB"/&gt;

In the 20th century, hatha yoga, particularly [[asana]]s (the physical postures), became popular throughout the world as a form of [[physical exercise]], and is now colloquially termed simply as "yoga."

==Origins==
[[File:Практика туммо.jpg|thumb|Tibetan depiction of [[Tummo]] (''candali'', inner heat) practice showing the location of the central channel]]
===Earliest textual references===
According to [[James Mallinson (author)|Mallinson]], some Hatha Yoga techniques can be traced back at least to the 1st-century CE, in texts such as the [[Itihasa|Sanskrit epics]] (Hinduism) and the [[Pali canon]] (Buddhism).&lt;ref name="Mallinson 770"&gt; Mallinson, James (2011). Hatha Yoga Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism Vol. 3 (pp. 770-781). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pali canon contains three passages in which the [[Buddha]] describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James. 2007. ''The Khecarīvidyā of Adinathā.'' London: Routledge. pg.17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the [[nasopharynx]] as in true [[khecarī mudrā]]. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to modern postures used to stimulate [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James. [http://www.khecari.com/resources/SaktismHathayoga.pdf "Śāktism and Haṭhayoga."] In: Goddess Traditions in Tantric Hinduism: History, Practice and Doctrine, edited by Bjarne Wernicke Olesen London: Routledge, 2016. pp. 109-140. pg.120:"The Buddha himself is said to have tried both pressing his tongue to the back of his mouth, in a manner similar to that of the hathayogic khecarīmudrā, and ukkutikappadhāna, a [[squatting posture]] which may be related to hathayogic techniques such as mahāmudrā, mahābandha, mahāvedha, mūlabandha, and vajrāsana in which pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, in order to force upwards the breath or Kundalinī."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Birch, the earliest mentions of Haṭha Yoga specifically are also from Buddhist texts, mainly Tantric works from the 8th century onwards, such as Puṇḍarīka’s ''Vimalaprabhā'' commentary on the ''[[Kalacakra Tantra|Kālacakratantra]]''.&lt;ref name="Birch 542"&gt;Birch, Jason (2011). The Meaning of haṭha in Early Haṭhayoga Journal of the American Oriental Society 131.4.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, Haṭha Yoga is defined within the context of tantric sexual ritual: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"when the undying moment does not arise because the breath is unrestrained [even] when the image is seen by means of withdrawal ([[pratyahara]]) and the other (auxiliaries of yoga, i.e. [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]], [[pranayama]], [[dharana]], anusmrti and [[samadhi]]), then, having forcefully (''hathena'') made the breath flow in the [[Nadi (yoga)|central channel]] through the practice of ''nada'', which is about to be explained, [the yogi] should attain the undying moment by restraining the ''bindu'' of the [[bodhicitta]] [i.e. semen] in the [[vajra]] [i.e. penis] when it is in the lotus of wisdom [i.e. vagina]".&lt;ref name="Birch 542"&gt;Birch, Jason (2011). The Meaning of haṭha in Early Haṭhayoga Journal of the American Oriental Society 131.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the actual means of practice are not specified, the forcing of the breath into the central channel and the restraining of ''bindu'' are central features of later haṭhayoga practice texts.&lt;ref name="Birch 542-545"&gt;Birch, Jason (2011). The Meaning of haṭha in Early Haṭhayoga Journal of the American Oriental Society 131.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval systematization===
[[File:Female Ascetics (Yoginis) LACMA M.2011.156.4 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|18th century [[yogini]]s in [[Rajasthan]]]]

In medieval times, teachings on Yoga were systematized in several texts:

* The ''Amṛtasiddhi'', which dates to the 11th century CE, teaches [[Maha Bandha|mahābandha]], [[Mahamudra (Hatha Yoga)|mahāmudrā]], and mahāvedha.&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt;{{rp|771}}
* The ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra'', probably composed in the 13th century CE, teaches an eightfold yoga identical with Patañjali's 8 limbs that it attributes to [[Yajnavalkya]] and others as well as eight mudras that it says were undertaken by the [[rishi]] [[Kapila]] and other ṛishis.&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt;{{rp|771}} The ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra'' teaches mahāmudrā, mahābandha, [[Khecarī mudrā|khecarīmudrā]], [[Jalandhara Bandha|jālandharabandha]], [[Uddiyana bandha|uḍḍiyāṇabandha]], [[Mula Bandha|mūlabandha]], [[Viparita Karani|viparītakaraṇī]], vajrolī, amarolī, and sahajolī.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}}
* The ̣''[[Śārṅgadharapaddhati]]'' is an anthology of verses on a wide range of subjects compiled in 1363 CE, which in its description of Hatha Yoga includes ̣the ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra’s'' teachings on five mudrās.&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt;{{rp|772}}
* The ''Vivekamārtaṇḍa'', which is contemporaneous with the ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra'', teaches nabhomudrā (i.e. [[Khecarī mudrā|khecarīmudrā]]), mahāmudrā, viparītakaraṇī and the three bandhas.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}}
* The ''Goraksaśatakạ'', which is also contemporaneous with the ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra'', teaches śakticālanīmudrā along with the three bandhas.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}}
* The ''Khecarīvidyā'' teaches only the method of [[Khecarī mudrā|khecarīmudrā]].&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}}

The methods of the ''Amṛtasiddhi'', ''Dattātreyayogaśāstra''  and ''Vivekamārtaṇḍa'' are used to raise and conserve bindu ([[semen]], and in women ''rajas -'' menstrual fluid) which was seen as the physical essence of life that was constantly dripping down from the head and being lost.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770}} These techniques sought to either physically reverse this process (by headstand postures like the ''viparītakaraṇī'') or to use the breath to force bindu upwards through the [[Susumna|central channel]].&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770}} Other texts like the ''Vivekamārtaṇḍa,'' ''Goraksaśataka''̣ and ''Khecarīvidyā'' also teach the raising of [[kuṇḍalinī]].&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}} The aims of these practices were [[Siddhi|siddhis]] (supranormal powers such as levitation) and mukti (liberation).&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771}}  

The only other texts older than the Hathapradīpikạ̄ to teach Hatha Yoga ̣ mudrās are the [[Shiva Samhita]], ''Yogabīja'', ''Amaraughaprabodha'', and ''Śārṅgadharapaddhati''.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|771-772}}

===Classical Hatha yoga===
====Hathapradīpikạ̄====
The ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Hathapradīpikạ]]'', also called ''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'', is an important and one of the most influential texts of the Hatha yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bjarne Wernicke Olesen|title=Goddess Traditions in Tantric Hinduism: History, Practice and Doctrine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfmPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147|year=2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-58521-3|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was compiled by Svātmārāma in the 15th century CE from earlier hatha yoga texts.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|772}} These earlier texts were of [[Vedanta]] or non-dual [[Shaiva]] orientation.&lt;ref name=mallinson225/&gt; From both, the ''Hathapradīpikạ̄'' borrowed non-duality (advaita) philosophies. According to James Mallinson, this reliance on non-dualism helped Hatha Yoga thrive in the medieval period as non-dualism became the "dominant soteriological method in scholarly religious discourse in India".&lt;ref name=mallinson225&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=James | title=Hathayoga's Philosophy: A Fortuitous Union of Non-Dualities | journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=42 | issue=1 | year=2013 | pages=225–247 | doi=10.1007/s10781-013-9217-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'' lists 35 great yoga [[siddhas]] starting with [[Adi Natha]] (Hindu god Shiva) followed by Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath.&lt;ref name=svatmarama1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Svatmarama (Sanskrit)|author2=Brian Akers (English Transl)|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6RVDQAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Yoga Vidya|isbn=978-0-9899966-4-8|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes information about [[shatkarma]] (six acts of self purification), 15 [[asana]] (postures: seated, laying down, and non-seated), [[pranayama]] (breathing) and kumbhaka (breath retention), [[mudra]]s (internalized energetic practices), meditation, [[chakra]]s (centers of energy), [[kundalini]], nadanusandhana (concentration on inner sound), and other topics.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|pp=772-773}}

''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'' is the best known and most widely used Hatha yoga text. It consists of 389 ''[[shloka]]s'' (verses) in four chapters:{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=6-7}}
* Chapter 1 with 67 verses deals with setting the proper environment for yoga, ethical duties of a yogi, and ''asanas'' (postures)
* Chapter 2 with 78 verses deals with the ''pranayama'' (breathing exercises, control of vital energy within) and the ''satkarmani'' (body cleansing)
* Chapter 3 with 130 verses discusses the mudras and their benefits.
* Chapter 4 with 114 verses deals with meditation and ''samadhi'' as a journey of personal spiritual growth.
&lt;!--
The ''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'' and the ''Gheranda samhita'' are derived from older [[Sanskrit]] texts. In Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Swatmarama introduces his system as a preparatory stage for physical purification that the body practices for higher [[meditation]] or [[Raja Yoga|Yoga]]. It is based on [[asana]]s (postures) and [[pranayama]] (breathing techniques).{{cn|date=March 2017}}--&gt;

====Post-Hathapradīpikạ̄ texts====
Post-Hathapradipika texts on Hatha yoga include:&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|773-774}}{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=27-28}}
*''Amaraughasasana'': a Sharada script manuscript of this Hatha yoga text was copied in 1525 CE. It is notable because fragments of this manuscript have also been found near [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]] in [[Xinjiang]] (China). The text discusses ''khecarimudra'', but calls it ''saranas''.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=773}}
*''Hatha ratnavali'': a 17th-century text that states Hatha yoga consists of ten mudras, eight cleansing methods, nine kumbhakas and 84 asanas (compared to 15 asanas of ''Hathapradīpikạ̄''). The text is also notable for dropping the nadanusandhana (inner sound) technique.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=773}}
*''Hathapradipika Siddhantamuktavali'': an early 18th-century text that expands on ''Hathapradīpikạ̄'' by adding practical insights and citations to other Indian texts on yoga.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=774}}
*''Gheranda samhita'': a 17th or 18th-century text that presents Hatha yoga as "ghatastha yoga", according to Mallinson.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=774}}{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|p=28}} It presents 6 cleansing methods, 32 asanas, 25 mudras and 10 pranayamas.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=774}} It is one of the most encyclopedic texts on Hatha yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Mallinson|title=The Gheranda Samhita: The Original Sanskrit and an English Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73DzK3kTIgEC|year=2004|publisher=Yoga Vidya|isbn=978-0-9716466-3-6|pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Jogpradipaka'': an 18th-century Braj-language text that presents Hatha yoga simply as "yoga", composed by Ramanandi Jayatarama. It presents 6 cleansing methods, 84 asanas, 24 mudras and 8 kumbhakas.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=774}}

===Modern era===
Historically, Hatha yoga has been a broad movement across the Indian traditions, openly available to anyone.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2012|p=26}}

{{quote|
Hatha Yoga, like other methods of yoga, can be practiced by all, regardless of sex, caste, class, or creed. Many texts explicitly state that it is practice alone that leads to success. Sectarian affiliation and philosophical inclination are of no importance. The texts of Hatha Yoga, with some exceptions, do not include teachings on metaphysics or sect-specific practices.
|James Mallinson|Hatha Yoga, Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=778}}}}

According to Mallinson, the Hatha yoga represented a trend towards the democratization of yoga insights and religion similar to the [[Bhakti movement]]. It eliminated the need for "either ascetic renunciation or priestly intermediaries, ritual paraphernalia and sectarian initiations".{{sfn|James Mallinson|2012|p=26}} This led to its broad historic popularity in India. Later in the 20th-century, states Mallinson, this disconnect of Hatha yoga from religious aspects and the democratic access of Hatha yoga enabled it to spread worldwide.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|pp=778-779}}

Between the 17th and 19th-century, however, the various urban Hindu and Muslim elites and ruling classes viewed Yogis with derision.{{sfn|David Gordon White|2012|pp=8-9}} They were persecuted during the rule of [[Aurangzeb]], who ended a long period of religious tolerance that had defined the rule of his predecessors beginning with Akbar, who famously studied with the yogis and other mystics.{{sfn|Shail Mayaram|2003|pp=40-41}} Hatha yoga remained popular in rural India. Negative impression for the Hatha yogis continued during the British colonial rule era. According to Mark Singleton, this historical negativity and colonial antipathy likely motivated Swami Vivekananda to make an emphatic distinction between "merely physical exercises of Hatha yoga" and the "higher spiritual path of Raja yoga".{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=69-72, 77-79}} This common disdain by the officials and intellectuals slowed the study and adoption of Hatha yoga.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=77-78}}{{sfn|White|2011|pp=20-22}}{{refn|group=note|Cartoons in the first half of the 20th century mocked "Hindu holy men" in Hatha yoga poses, accompanied with stories of weaknesses of Western women who fall for their yoga routines.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=78-81}}}}

[[File:Kailash Integral Yoga.jpg|thumb|Hatha yoga has spread in different branded forms, such as the Integral Yoga (above).]]
Modern hatha yoga, of the type seen in the West, has been greatly influenced by the school of [[Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]], who taught from 1924 until his death in 1989. Among his students prominent in popularizing yoga in the West were [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] famous for popularizing the vigorous [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]] style, [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] who emphasized alignment and the use of props, [[Indra Devi]] and Krishnamacharya's son T. K. V. Desikachar.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=779}}

Another well-known school of Hatha yoga in the 20th-century has been the Divine Life Society founded by [[Sivananda Saraswati|Swami Sivananda]] of [[Rishikesh]] (1887–1963) and his many disciples including, among others, [[Swami Vishnu-devananda]]&amp;nbsp;– founder of International [[Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres]]; [[Satyananda Saraswati|Swami Satyananda]]&amp;nbsp;– of the Bihar School of Yoga; and [[Swami Satchidananda]] of Integral Yoga.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=779}} After about 1975, yoga techniques have become increasingly popular globally, in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Michelis | first=Elizabeth De | title=A Preliminary Survey of Modern Yoga Studies | journal=Asian Medicine | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=1–19 | doi=10.1163/157342107x207182 }}, Quote: "Modern yoga has emerged as a transnational global phenomenon during the course of the twentieth century and from about 1975 onwards it has progressively become acculturated in many different developed or developing societies and milieus worldwide."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bihar School of Yoga has been one of the largest Hatha yoga teacher training centers in India but is little known in Europe and the Americas. In the West, Krishnamarcharya-linked schools have been more widely known.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|p=213 note 14}} Examples of other branded forms of yoga, with some controversies, that contain Hatha yoga methodologies include Anusara Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Bikram Yoga, Integral Yoga, Iyengar Yoga, Jivanmukti Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Kripalu Yoga, Kriya Yoga, Siddha Yoga, Viniyoga, Vinyasa Yoga and White Lotus Yoga.{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|pp=151-159}}

==Practice==
Hatha yoga practice has many elements, both behavioral and of practice. The Hatha yoga texts state that a successful yogi has certain characteristics. Section 1.16 of the ''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'', for example, states these characteristics to be ''utsaha'' (enthusiasm, fortitude), ''sahasa'' (courage), ''dhairya'' (patience), ''jnana tattva'' (essence for knowledge), ''nishcaya'' (resolve, determination) and ''tyaga'' (solitude, renunciation).&lt;ref name=svatmarama1/&gt; 

In the Western culture, Hatha yoga is typically understood as ''asanas'' and it can be practiced as such.{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|pp=3-4}} In the Indian and Tibetan traditions, Hatha yoga is much more. It extends well beyond being a sophisticated physical exercise system and integrates ideas of ethics, diet, cleansing, pranayama (breathing exercises), meditation and a system for spiritual development of the yogi.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=ix-x, 6-12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thubten Yeshe|title=The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhPtIBEhGtYC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-978-5|pages=97–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proper diet===
{{main|Mitahara}}
The Hatha yoga texts place major emphasis on ''[[mitahara]]'', which connotes "measured diet" or "moderate eating". For example, sections 1.58 to 1.63 and 2.14 of the ''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'' and sections 5.16 to 5.32 of ''Gheranda samhita'' discuss the importance of proper diet to the body.{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|p=231 with footnote 78}} They link the food one eats and one's eating habits to balancing the body and to gaining most benefits from the practice of Hatha yoga. Eating, states ''Gheranda samhita'', is a form of a devotional act to the temple of body, as if one is expressing affection for the gods.{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|pp=25-26}} Similarly, sections 3.20 and 5.25 of the ''Shiva Samhita'' text on Hatha Yoga includes ''mitahara'' as an essential part of a Hatha yoga holistic practice.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2007|pp=44, 110}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;ब्रह्मचारी मिताहारी तयागी योग-परायणः |  अब्दादूर्ध्वं भवेद्सिद्धो नात्र कार्या विछारणा ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A brahmachari, practicing '''mitahara''' (moderate diet) and [[tyaga]] (renunciation, solitude), devoted to yoga achieves success in his inquiry and effort within half a year.|Hathayoga Pradipika|1.57&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hathayogapradipika/hatha_yoga_pradipika#page/n45/mode/2up Hathayoga Pradipika] Brahmananda, Adyar Library, The Theosophical Society, Madras India (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one’s eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one’s body and for one’s inner self.&lt;ref name=ksj /&gt; It recommends that one must “eat only when one feels hungry” and “neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one’s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water”.&lt;ref name=ksj&gt;KS Joshi, Speaking of Yoga and Nature-Cure Therapy, Sterling Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1-84557-045-3}}, page 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another Hatha Yoga classic ''Gorakshasataka'', eating a controlled diet is one of the three important parts of a complete and successful practice. The text does not provide details or recipes. The text states, according to Mallinson, "food should be unctuous and sweet", one must not overeat and stop when still a bit hungry (leave a quarter of the stomach empty), and whatever one eats should aim to please the [[Shiva]].{{sfn|White|2011|pp=258-259, 267}}

===Proper body cleansing===
{{main|Shatkarma}}
Hatha yoga teaches various steps of inner body cleansing with consultations of one's yoga teacher. Its texts vary in specifics and number of cleansing methods, ranging from simple hygiene practices to the peculiar exercises such as reversing seminal fluid flow.{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|p=141}} The most common list is called ''shat-karmani'', or six cleansing actions: ''dhauti'' (cleanse teeth and body), ''vasti'' (cleanse bladder), ''neti'' (cleanse nasal passages), ''trataka'' (cleanse eyes), ''nauli'' (abdominal massage) and ''kapala-bhati'' (cleanse phlegm).{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|p=141}} The actual procedure for cleansing varies by the Hatha yoga text, with some suggesting water wash and others describing the use of cleansing aids such as cloth.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=28-30}}

===Proper breathing===
{{main|Pranayama}}
[[File:Siddhasana mulher.jpg|thumb|[[Siddhasana]] is recommended for breathing exercises by ''Hatha yoga pradipika'' text.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=199-200}}]]

Prāṇāyāma is made out of two Sanskrit words ''prāṇa'' (प्राण, breath, vital energy, life force)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=prANa&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 prAna] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|p=220}} and ''āyāma'' (आयाम, restraining, extending, stretching).&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0100/mw__0181.html Āyāma], Sanskrit-English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|p=220}}

Some Hatha yoga texts teach breath exercises but do not refer to it as Pranayama. For example, ''Gheranda samhita'' in section 3.55 calls it ''Ghatavastha'' (state of being the pot).{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|p=213 note 12}} In others, the term ''Kumbhaka'' or ''Prana-samrodha'' replaces Pranayama.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=9, 29}} Regardless of the nomenclature, proper breathing and the use of breathing techniques during a posture is a mainstay of Hatha yoga. Its texts state that proper breathing exercises cleanses and balances the body.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=29, 146-153}}

''Pranayama'' is one of the core practices of Hatha yoga, found in its major texts as one of the limbs regardless of whether the total number of limbs taught are four or more.{{sfn|Alain Daniélou|1955|pp=57-62}}{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=8-10, 59, 99}}{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|pp=220-223}} It is the practice of consciously regulating breath (inhalation and exhalation), a concept shared with all schools of yoga.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=8-10, 59-63}}&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (1983), ''Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873957281}}, pages 230-236&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is done in several ways, inhaling and then suspending exhalation for a period, exhaling and then suspending inhalation for a period, slowing the inhalation and exhalation, consciously changing the time/length of breath (deep, short breathing), combining these with certain focussed muscle exercises.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=202-219}} ''Pranayama'' or proper breathing is an integral part of ''asanas''. According to section 1.38 of ''Hatha yoga pradipka'', ''[[Siddhasana]]'' is the most suitable and easiest posture to learn breathing exercises.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=199-200}}

The different Hatha yoga texts discuss ''pranayama'' in various ways. For example, ''Hatha yoga pradipka'' in section 2.71 explains it as a threefold practice: ''recaka'' (exhalation), ''puraka'' (inhalation) and ''kumbhaka'' (retention).{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=202-203}} During the exhalation and inhalation, the text states that three things move: air, prana and yogi's thoughts, and all three are intimately connected.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=202-203}} It is ''kumbhaka'' where stillness and dissolution emerges. The text divides ''kumbhaka'' into two kinds: ''sahita'' (supported) and ''kevala'' (complete). ''Sahita kumbhaka'' is further sub-divided into two types: retention with inhalation, retention with exhalation.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=202-205}} Each of these breath units are then combined in different permutations, time lengths, posture and targeted muscle exercises in the belief that these aerate and assist blood flow to targeted regions of the body.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=202-219}}{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|pp=55-60}}

===Proper postures===
{{main|Asanas}}
Before starting yoga practice, state the Hatha yoga texts, the yogi must establish a suitable place for the yoga practice. This place is away from all distractions, preferably a ''mathika'' (hermitage) that is distant from falling rocks, fire and a damp shifting surface.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=34-35}}

Once a peaceful stable location has been set, the yogi begins the posture exercises called ''asanas''. These Hatha yoga postures come in numerous forms. For a beginner yogi, states Mircea Eliade, these ''asanas'' are uncomfortable, typically difficult, cause the body shakes and typically unbearable to hold for extended periods of time.{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|p=53}} However, with repetition and persistence, as the muscle tone improves, the effort reduces and posture improves. According to the Hatha yoga texts, each posture becomes perfect when the "effort disappears", one no longer thinks about the posture and one's body position, breathes normally per ''pranayama'', and is able to dwell in one's meditation (''anantasamapattibhyam'').{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|pp=53-54, 66-70}}

The ''asanas'' discussed in different Hatha yoga texts vary significantly.{{sfn|Richard Rosen|2012|pp=78-88}} Unlike ancient yoga texts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it is the Hatha yoga texts that provide step by step methodology on how to enter into an ''asana''. The Hindu text ''Gheranda samhita'', for example, in section 2.8 describes the ''padmasana'' for meditation.{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|pp=53-54}} Most ''asanas'' are inspired by nature, such as a form of union with symmetric, harmonious flowing shapes of animals, birds or plants.{{sfn|Mircea Eliade|2009|pp=54-55}}

===Kundalini in later hatha yoga===
[[File:SahajaSubtleSystem.svg|thumb|Hatha yoga texts discuss sahaja and chakras.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2008|pp=231-237 notes 400, 433-434}}]]
{{main|Kundalini}}
Early hatha yoga was used to prevent the dripping of bindu (semen) from the heads of men.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770}} The two early hatha yoga techniques were to stand on one's head (viparītakaranī) or make breath flow into the center channel which forces bindu up.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770}}

However, in later hatha yoga, the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] visualization of Kuṇḍalini rising through a system of chakras is overlaid onto the earlier bindu-oriented system.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770, 774}} The aim was to access amṛta (the nectar of immortality) situated in the head, which subsequently floods the body.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770, 774}} This goal is in contradiction with the early hatha yoga goal of preserving bindu.&lt;ref name="JM" /&gt;{{rp|770, 774}}

===Meditation===
The ''Hatha yoga pradipika'' text dedicates almost a third of its verses to meditation.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=6-7}} Similarly, other major texts of Hatha yoga such as ''Shiva samhita'' and ''Gheranda samhita'' discuss meditation.{{sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=102-103}} In all three texts, meditation is the ultimate goal of all the preparatory cleansing, asanas, pranayama and other steps. The aim of this meditation is to realize ''Nada-[[Brahman]]'', or the complete absorption and union with the Brahman through inner mystic sound.{{sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=102-103}} According to [[Guy Beck]] – a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Yoga and music, a Hatha yogi in this stage of practice seeks "inner union of physical opposites", into an inner state of [[samadhi]] that is described by Hatha yoga texts in terms of divine sounds, and as a union with ''Nada-Brahman'' in musical literature of ancient India.{{sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=107-110}}

===Goals===
The aims of Hatha yoga in various Indian traditions have been the same as those of other varieties of yoga. These include physical ''siddhis'' (special powers, bodily benefits such as slowing age effects, magical powers) and spiritual liberation ([[moksha]], mukti).{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=770}}{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=44-50, 99-100, 219-220}} According to Mikel Burley, some of the ''siddhis'' are symbolic references to the cherished soteriological goals of Indian religions. For example, the ''Vayu Siddhi'' or "conquest of the air" literally implies rising into the air as in levitation, but it likely has a symbolic meaning of "a state of consciousness into a vast ocean of space" or "voidness" ideas found respectively in Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=203-204}}

Some traditions such as the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tantric sect of Hinduism and Sahajiya tantric sect of Buddhism pursued more esoteric goals such as alchemy (Nagarjuna, Carpita), magic, ''kalavancana'' (cheating death) and ''parakayapravesa'' (entering another's body).{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=770}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul E. Muller-Ortega|title=Triadic Heart of Siva, The: Kaula Tantricism of Abhinavagupta in the Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2maVlGOSdlMC&amp;pg=PA55|date=31 March 2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1385-3|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=10–12}} James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=James | title=The Yogīs' Latest Trick | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=24 | issue=1 | year=2013 | pages=165–180 | doi=10.1017/s1356186313000734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of historic Hatha yoga texts do not give any importance to ''siddhis''.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011b|pp=329-330}} The mainstream practice considered the pursuit of magical powers as a distraction or hindrance to Hatha yoga's ultimate aim of spiritual liberation, self-knowledge or release from rebirth that the Indian traditions call ''mukti'' or ''[[moksha]]''.{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|p=770}}{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=44-50, 99-100, 219-220}}

The goals of Hatha yoga, in its earliest texts, were linked to ''mumukshu'' (seeker of liberation, moksha). The later texts added and experimented with the goals of ''bubhukshu'' (seeker of enjoyment, bhoga).{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011b|p=328}}

==Differences from Patanjali yoga==
Hatha yoga is a branch of yoga. It shares numerous ideas and doctrines with other forms of yoga, such as the more ancient Yoga system taught by [[Patanjali]]. The differences are in the addition of some aspects, and different emphasis on other aspects.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|p=10}} For example, ''pranayama'' is crucial in all yogas, but it is the mainstay of Hatha yoga.{{sfn|Mark Singleton|2010|pp=29, 146-153}}{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=10, 59-61, 99}} Mudras and certain kundalini-related ideas are included in Hatha yoga, but not mentioned in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=6-12, 60-61}} Patanjali yoga considers ''asanas'' important but dwells less on various ''asanas'' than the Hatha yoga texts. In contrast, the Hatha yoga texts consider meditation as important but dwell less on meditation methodology than Patanjali yoga.{{sfn|Mikel Burley|2000|pp=10, 59-63}}

The Hatha yoga texts acknowledge and refer to Patanjali yoga, attesting to the latter's antiquity. However, this acknowledgment is essentially only in passing, as they offer no serious commentary or exposition of Patanjali's system. This suggests that Hatha yoga developed as a branch of the more ancient yoga.{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|pp=139-147}} According to P.V. Kane, Patanjali yoga concentrates more on the yoga of the mind, while Hatha yoga focuses on body and health.{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|p=140}} Some Hindu texts do not recognize this distinction. For example, the ''[[Yogatattva Upanishad]]'' teaches a system that includes all aspects of the ''[[Yogasutras]]'' of Patanjali, and all additional elements of Hatha yoga practice.{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|pp=140-141}}

'''Henotheism''' ({{ety|ell|''ἑνός θεός'' (henos theos)|one god}}) is the worship of a single [[god]] while not denying the existence or possible existence of other [[Deity|deities]].&lt;ref name=britannicamonolatry/&gt;&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt; [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] (1775&amp;ndash;1854) coined the word, and [[Friedrich Welcker]] (1784&amp;ndash;1868) used it to depict primitive [[monotheism]] among ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Karl Gnuse |title= No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC |year= 1997|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn= 978-1-85075-657-6 |pages= 132–133 with footnote 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Müller]] (1823&amp;ndash;1900), a German philologist and orientalist, brought the term into wider usage in his scholarship on the [[Indian religions]],&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Max. (1878) ''Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion: As Illustrated by the Religions of India.'' London:Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alonp370/&gt; particularly Hinduism whose scriptures mention and praise numerous deities as if they are one ultimate unitary divine essence.&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt; Müller made the term central to his criticism of [[Western world|Western]] [[Theology|theological]] and [[Religion|religious]] [[exceptionalism]] (relative to [[Eastern religion]]s), focusing on a cultural [[dogma]] which held "monotheism" to be both fundamentally well-defined and inherently superior to differing [[conceptions of God]].

==Definition and terminology==
Friedrich Schelling coined the term henotheism, from ''heis'' or ''heno'' which literally means "single, one".&lt;ref name=britannicamonolatry/&gt;&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt;&lt;ref name=fahlbusch524/&gt; The term refers to a form of theism focused on a single god. Related terms are [[monolatrism]] and [[kathenotheism]].&lt;ref name=britannicamonolatry/&gt; The latter term is an extension of "henotheism", {{ety||''καθ' ἕνα θεόν'' (kath' hena theon)|one god at a time}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kathenotheism Online Etymology Dictionary: kathenotheism]&lt;/ref&gt; Henotheism refers to a pluralistic theology wherein different deities are viewed to be of a unitary, equivalent divine essence.&lt;ref name=taliaferro78&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Taliaferro |author2=Victoria S. Harrison |author3=Stewart Goetz |title=The Routledge Companion to Theism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ct7fCgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-33823-6 |pages=78–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term related to henotheism is "equitheism", referring to the belief that all gods are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson |title=The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC |date=2007 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the term henotheism does not exclude [[monism]], [[nondualism]] or [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref name=alonp370&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ilai Alon |author2= Ithamar Gruenwald|author3=Itamar Singer |title= Concepts of the Other in Near Eastern Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1-l66daLgYC|date=1994 |publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-9004102200 |pages=370–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars prefer the term monolatrism to henotheism, to discuss religions where a single god is central, but the existence or the position of other gods is not denied.&lt;ref name=britannicamonolatry/&gt;&lt;ref name=fahlbusch524&gt;{{cite book|author = Christoph Elsas|editor=Erwin Fahlbusch |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC |year=1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |isbn=978-90-04-11695-5 |pages=524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christoph Elsas, henotheism in modern usage connotes a syncretic stage in the development of religions in late antiquity. A henotheist may worship a single god from a [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of deities at a given time, depending on his or her choice, while accepting other deities and concepts of god.&lt;ref name=alonp370/&gt;&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt; Henotheism and inclusive monotheism are terms that refer to a middle position between unlimited polytheism and exclusive monotheism.&lt;ref name=britannicamonolatry&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/monotheism Monotheism] and [https://www.britannica.com/topic/polytheism Polytheism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrianism==
{{further|Zoroastrianism|Iranian studies}}
[[Ahura Mazda]] is the supreme god, but Zoroastrianism does not deny other deities. Ahura Mazda has [[yazatas]] ("good agents") some of which include [[Anahita]], [[Sraosha]], [[Mithra]], [[Rashnu]], and [[Tishtrya]]. [[Richard Foltz]] has put forth evidence that [[History of Iran|Iranians of Pre-Islamic era]] worshiped all these figures, especially Mithra and Anahita.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present", Oneworld Publications, 2013, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prods Oktor Skjærvø]] states Zoroastrianism is henotheistic, and "a dualistic and polytheistic religion, but with one supreme god, who is the father of the ordered cosmos".&lt;ref&gt;Prods Oktor Skjærvø (2006), ''[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Zoroastrianism/Zoroastrianism1_Intro.pdf Introduction to Zoroastrianism]'', 2005, Harvard University Archives, p. 15 with footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars state that this is unclear, because historic texts present a conflicting picture, ranging from Zoroastrianism's belief in "one god, two gods, or a best god henotheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Four Testaments: Tao Te Ching, Analects, Dhammapada, Bhagavad Gita: Sacred Scriptures of Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MsvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347|year=2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-6578-3|pages=347–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henotheism was the term used by scholars such as [[Max Müller]] to describe the theology of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].&lt;ref name = "max"&gt;Sugirtharajah, Sharada, ''Imagining Hinduism: A Postcolonial Perspective'', Routledge, 2004, p.44;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt; Müller noted that the hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the oldest scripture of Hinduism, mention many deities, but praises them successively as the "one ultimate, supreme God", alternatively as "one supreme Goddess",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Graham |title=Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX0T-ZqTcC |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44820-8 |pages=70–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby asserting that the essence of the deities was unitary (''[[ekam]]''), and the deities were nothing but pluralistic manifestations of the same concept of the divine (God).&lt;ref name=taliaferro78/&gt;&lt;ref name=alonp370/&gt;&lt;ref name=fahlbusch524/&gt;

The Vedic era conceptualization of the divine or the One, states Jeaneane Fowler, is more abstract than a monotheistic God, it is the Reality behind and of the phenomenal universe.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefowler43/&gt; The Vedic hymns treat it as "limitless, indescribable, absolute principle", thus the Vedic divine is something of a [[panentheism]] rather than simple henotheism.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefowler43/&gt; In late Vedic era, around the start of Upanishadic age (~800 BCE), theosophical speculations emerge that develop concepts which scholars variously call [[nondualism]] or [[monism]], as well as forms of non-theism and [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=jeaneanefowler43&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Ishwar Chandra Sharma describes it as "Absolute Reality, beyond all dualities of existence and non-existence, light and darkness, and of time, space and cause."&lt;ref&gt;Ishwar Chandra Sharma, ''Ethical Philosophies of India'', Harper &amp; Row, 1970, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic religion==
{{further|Hellenistic religion}}
While [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] religion began as [[polytheism]], during the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] period, under the influence of philosophy, differing conceptions emerged. Often [[Zeus]] (or [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]) was considered the supreme, all-powerful and all-knowing, king and father of the Olympian gods. According to Maijastina Kahlos "monotheism was pervasive in the educated circles in Late Antiquity" and "all divinities were interpreted as aspects, particles or epithets of one supreme God".&lt;ref name ="maij"&gt;Maijastina Kahlos, ''Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures C. 360-430'', Ashgate Publishing, 2007, p.145; p.160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maximus Tyrius]] (2nd century A.D.) stated: "In such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one god, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of god, ruling together with him."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition, Maximus Tryius.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] taught that above the gods of traditional belief was "The One",&lt;ref name ="maij"/&gt; and polytheist&lt;ref&gt;Maijastina Kahlos, Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures C. 360-430, Ashgate Publishing, 2007, P.70&lt;/ref&gt; grammarian Maximus of [[Madauros]] even stated that only a madman would deny the existence of the supreme God.&lt;ref name ="maij"/&gt;

==Canaanite religion and early Judaism==
[[Rabbinical Judaism]] as it developed in [[Late Antiquity]] is emphatically monotheistic. However, its predecessor—the various schools of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and [[Second Temple Judaism]], and especially the cult of [[Yahweh]] as it was practiced in  [[ancient Israel and Judah]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC—have been described as henotheistic.

For example, the [[Moab]]ites worshipped the god [[Chemosh]], the [[Edom]]ites, [[Qaus]], both of whom were part of the greater [[Canaan]]ite pantheon, headed by the chief god, [[El (Canaanite god)|El]]. The Canaanite pantheon consisted of El and [[Asherah]] as the chief deities, with 70 sons who were said to rule over each of the nations of the earth. These sons were each worshiped within a specific region. [[Kurt Noll]] states that "the Bible preserves a tradition that Yahweh used to 'live' in the south, in the land of Edom" and that the original god of Israel was [[El Shaddai]].&lt;ref name = "noll"&gt;[[Kurt Noll|K. L. Noll]] ''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: An Introduction'', Continuum, 2002, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Biblical stories{{Which|date=April 2016}} allude to the belief that the Canaanite gods all existed and were thought{{By whom|date=April 2016}} to possess the most power in the lands by the people who worshiped them and their sacred objects; their power was believed to be real and could be invoked by the people who patronized them. There are numerous accounts{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} of surrounding nations of Israel showing fear or reverence for the Israelite God despite their continued polytheistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;David Bridger, Samuel Wolk et al., ''The New Jewish Encyclopedia'', Behrman House, 1976, pp.326-7&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 1 Samuel 4, the [[Philistines]] fret before the second battle of [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]] when they learn that the Israelites are bearing the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and therefore Yahweh, into battle. The Israelites were forbidden&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=exodus+20:1-20:17&amp;version=nrsv Exodus Chapter 20 Verse 3]&lt;/ref&gt; to worship other deities, but according to some interpretations{{Which|date=April 2016}} of the Bible, they were not fully monotheistic before the [[Babylonian captivity]].  Mark S. Smith refers to this stage as a form of monolatry.&lt;ref name = "smith"&gt;Mark S. Smith, ''The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel'', Eerdmans Publishing, 2002, pp.58, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argues that Yahweh underwent a process of merging with El and that acceptance of cults of [[Asherah]] was common in the period of the Judges.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt; 2 Kings 3:27 has been interpreted as describing a human sacrifice in Moab that led the invading Israelite army to fear the power of Chemosh.&lt;ref name = "boyd"&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'', InterVarsity Press, 1997, p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

Some scholars have written that [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) can be characterized as henotheistic, but others have rejected this stance.

[[Eugene England]], a professor at [[Brigham Young University]], asserted that LDS Presidents [[Brigham Young]] and [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] along with LDS scholar [[B. H. Roberts]] used the LDS interpretation of 1 Corinthians 8:5–6 as "a brief explanation of how it is possible to be both a Christian polytheist (technically a henotheist) and a monotheist".&lt;ref&gt;Englund, Eugene. "The Weeping God of Mormonism". ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 35(1), Spring 2002, pp. 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt; BYU Professor Roger R. Keller rejected descriptions of the LDS Church as polytheistic by countering, as summarized by a reviewer, "Mormons are fundamentally monotheistic because they deal with only one god out of the many which exist."&lt;ref&gt;Sillman, H. Jeffrey. "A One-Sided Dialogue", ''Sunstone'', June 1989, pp. 48–49 (review of Roger R. Keller's "Reformed Christians and Mormon Christians: Let's Talk",  Ann Arbor, MI: Pryor Pettengill, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book, ''Mormon America: The Power and the Promise'', [[Richard and Joan Ostling]], wrote that some Mormons are comfortable describing themselves as henotheists.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, Richard and Joan Osterline.  ''Mormon America: the power and the promise'', Harper Collins, 2007,HarperCollins, 2007, p 310&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Widmer, professor at the [[University of Lethbridge]], described LDS beliefs as a "cosmic henotheism".&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Widmer. ''Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830–1915''. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2000., p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; A review of Widmer's book by Bruening and Paulsen in the ''FARMS Review of Books'' countered that Widmer's hypothesis was "strongly disconfirmed in light of the total evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Bruening, Ari D. and David L. Paulsen. "The Development of the Mormon Understanding of God: Early Mormon Modalism and Early Myths". ''FARMS Review of Books'' 13/2 (2001), pp. 109–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Hale has written, "Mormonism teaches the existence of gods who are not the Father, Son, or Holy Ghost" and "the existence of more than one god [is] clearly a Mormon doctrine", but he also said that defining this belief system in theological terms was troublesome. Henotheism might appear to be "promising" in describing LDS beliefs, Hale wrote, but it is ultimately not accurate because henotheism was intended to describe the worship of a god that was restricted to a specific geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Van. "Defining the Mormon Doctrine of Deity: What Can Theological Terminology Tell Us About Out Own Beliefs?" ''Sunstone 10'' (Jan. 1985), pp. 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12838">The '''hermeneutic circle''' ({{lang-de|hermeneutischer Zirkel}}) describes the process of understanding a text [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]]. It refers to the idea that one's understanding of the text as a whole is established by reference to the individual parts and one's understanding of each individual part by reference to the whole. Neither the whole text nor any individual part can be understood without reference to one another, and hence, it is a circle. However, this circular character of interpretation does not make it impossible to interpret a text; rather, it stresses that the meaning of a text must be found within its cultural, historical, and literary context.

==History==
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s approach to interpretation focuses on the importance of the interpreter ''[[Verstehen|understanding]]'' the text as a necessary stage to interpreting it. Understanding involved repeated circular movements between the parts and the whole. Hence the idea of an interpretive or hermeneutic ''circle.'' Understanding the meaning of a text is not about decoding the author's intentions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Authorial intent|Intentionalism]], however, does not necessarily exclude an embrace of the notion of the hermeneutic circle, as Søren Harnow Klausen shows in "Levels of Literary Meaning," ''Philosophy and Literature'', Vol. 41, No. 1 (April 2017): 70-90.  "I conclude, almost to my own surprise, that something like the traditional idea of the hermeneutic circle is indispensable.  We must work back and forth among intentions of lower and higher order, assigning to them varying relative weights as we go along, striving for some kind of balance, coherence, or overall appropriateness that cannot, however, be defined in advance or analyzed in terms of more basic principles.&lt;/ref&gt; It is about establishing real relationships between reader, text, and context."&lt;ref&gt;Ramberg, Bjørn and Kristin Gjesdal, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/#Continuations "Hermeneutics: Continuations"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2003, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Even reading a sentence involves these repeated circular movements through a hierarchy of parts–whole relationships. Thus, as we are reading this sentence, you are analysing single words as the text unfolds, but you are also weighing the meaning of each word against our changing sense of the overall meaning of the sentence you are reading, or perhaps misunderstanding, or maybe this sentence is reminding you of, or clashing with, another view about interpretation you have, in the past, advocated or disparaged. Hence we are brought to the sentence's larger historical context, depending on its location, and our own circumstances.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] used the example of understanding a sentence as an example of the circular course of hermeneutic understanding. He particularly stressed that meaning and meaningfulness were always contextual. Thus the meaning of any sentence cannot be fully interpreted unless we know the historical circumstances of its utterance. And this means that interpretation is always linked to the situation of the interpreter, because one can only construct a history from the particular set of circumstances in which one currently exists. Thus Dilthey says: "Meaningfulness fundamentally grows out of a relation of part to whole that is grounded in the nature of living experience."&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite news | author = Richard Palmer | title = Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer | quote = | newspaper = Evanston: Northwestern University Press | date = 1969 | pages = 120| url = | accessdate =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Dilthey, "Meaning is not subjective; it is not projection of thought or thinking onto the object; it is a perception of a real relationship within a nexus prior to the subject-object separation in thought."&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidegger"&gt;Heidegger, Martin. "The Origin of the Work of Art." ''Poetry, Language, Thought.'' Trans. Albert Hofstadter. NY: Harper Collins, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] (1927) developed the concept of the ''hermeneutic circle'' to envision a whole in terms of a reality that was situated in the detailed experience of everyday existence by an individual (the parts). So understanding was developed on the basis of "fore-structures" of understanding, that allow external phenomena to be interpreted in a preliminary way.

Another instance of Heidegger's use of the hermeneutic circle occurs in his examination of ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'' (1935–1936). Here Heidegger argues that both artists and art works can only be understood with reference to each other, and that neither can be understood apart from 'art,' which, as well, cannot be understood apart from the former two. The 'origin' of the work of art is mysterious and elusive, seemingly defying logic: "thus we are compelled to follow the circle. This is neither a makeshift or a defect. To enter upon the path is the strength of thought, to continue on it is the feast of thought, assuming thinking is a craft. Not only is the main step from work to art a circle like the step from art to work, but every separate step that we attempt circles this circle. In order to discover the nature of the art that really prevails in the work, let us go to the actual work and ask the work what and how it is."&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Heidegger continues, saying that a work of art is not a simple thing (as a doorknob or a shoe is, which do not normally involve [[aesthetic emotions|aesthetic experience]]), but it cannot escape its "thingly character," that is, being part of the larger order of things in the world, apart from all aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|19}} The synthesis of thingly and artistic is found in the work's allegorical and symbolic character, "but this one element in a work that manifests another, this one element that joins another, is the thingly feature in the art work".&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|20}} At this point, however, Heidegger raises the doubt of "whether the work is at bottom something else and not a thing at all." Later he tries to break down the metaphysical opposition between form and matter, and the whole other set of dualisms which include: rational and irrational, logical and illogical/alogical, and subject and object. Neither of these concepts is independent of the other, yet neither can be reduced to the other: Heidegger suggests we have to look beyond both.&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (1975) further developed this concept, leading to what is recognized as a break with previous hermeneutic traditions. While Heidegger saw the hermeneutic process as cycles of self-reference that situated our understanding in ''a priori'' prejudices, Gadamer reconceptualized the hermeneutic circle as an iterative process through which a new understanding of a whole reality is developed by means of exploring the detail of existence. Gadamer viewed understanding as linguistically mediated, through conversations with others in which reality is explored and an agreement is reached that represents a new understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/gadamer/ "Hans-Georg Gadamer"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The centrality of  conversation to the hermeneutic circle is developed by [[Donald Schön]], who characterizes design as a hermeneutic circle that is developed by means of "a conversation with the situation."&lt;ref&gt;Schön 1983: {{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul de Man]], in his essay "Form and Intent in the American New Criticism," talks about the hermeneutic circle with reference to paradoxical ideas about "textual unity" espoused by and inherited from American criticism. De Man points out that the "textual unity" [[New Criticism]] locates in a given work has only a "semi-circularity" and that the hermeneutic circle is completed in "the act of interpreting the text." Combining Gadamer and Heidegger into an epistemological critique of interpretation and reading, de Man argues that with New Criticism, American Criticism "pragmatically entered" the hermeneutic circle, "mistaking it for the organic circularity of natural processes."&lt;ref&gt;de Man 1983: 29&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[postmodernists]], the hermeneutic circle is especially problematic. Not only do they believe one can only know the world through the words one uses to describe it, but also that "whenever people try to establish a certain reading of a text or expression, they allege other readings as the ground for their reading".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, E. 1997. "[http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla64/077-155e.htm Seizing the Middle Ground: Constructivism in World Politics]", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 3: 321–322&lt;/ref&gt; For postmodernists, in other words, "All meaning systems are open-ended systems of signs referring to signs referring to signs. No concept can therefore have an ultimate, unequivocal meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Waever 1996: 171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
[[Judith N. Shklar]] (1986) points out the ambiguity in the meaning and function of the "circle" as a metaphor for understanding. It is taken to refer to a geometric circle, rather than a circular process, it seems to imply a center, but it is unclear whether the interpreter him/herself stands there, or whether, on the contrary, some "organizing principle and illuminating principle apart from him [is] there waiting to be discovered."&lt;ref name="Shklar"&gt;Shklar, Judith N. "Squaring the Hermeneutic Circle." ''Social Research.'' 71 (3), 2004, pg. 657–658 (Originally published Autumn 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, and more problematic for Shklar, "the hermeneutic circle makes sense only if there is a known and closed whole, which can be understood in terms of its own parts and which has as its core God, who is its anchor and creator. Only the Bible really meets these conditions. It is the only possibly wholly self-sufficient text."&lt;ref name="Shklar"/&gt; A further problem relates to the fact that Gadamer and others assume a fixed role for tradition (individual and disciplinary/academic) in the process of any hermeneutic understanding, while it is more accurate to say that interpreters have multiple and sometimes conflicting cultural attachments, yet this does not prevent intercultural and/or interdisciplinary dialogue. Finally, she warns that, at least in social science, interpretation is not a substitute for explanation.

Heidegger (1935–1936)&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|18}} and Schockel (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Schokel, Luis Alonso and Jose Maria Bravo. ''A Manual of Hermeneutics (Biblical Seminar).'' Trans. Liliana M. Rosa. Brook W. R. Pearson (Ed.). Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998, pg. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; respond to critics of this model of interpretation who allege it is a case of invalid reasoning by asserting that ''any'' form of reflection or interpretation must oscillate between particular and general, part and whole. It does not '[[beg the question]]' because it is a different approach than formal logic. While it does imply presuppositions, it does not take any premise for granted. Schokel suggests a spiral as a better metaphor for interpretation, but admits that Schleiermacher's influence may have 'acclimatized' the term.

'''''Idealistic Studies''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] for the publication of studies of [[idealism|idealistic]] themes. Both historical and contemporary statements of idealistic argumentation are published, as are also [[history of philosophy|historico-philosophical]] studies of idealism. The journal was established in 1972 by Robert N. Beck with the assistance of the [[Clark University]] philosophy department. While it initially focused on American [[personalism]] and post-[[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] idealism, the journal's mission has broadened to include other topics, including historically earlier expressions as well as developments of the late 19th to mid-20th century. The journal has become a venue for a number of philosophical movements that share Idealism in their genealogies, including [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[historicism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[Lebensphilosophie|life philosophy]], [[existentialism]], and [[pragmatism]]. The journal is published by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]] and the current [[editor-in-chief]] is Jennifer Bates, Professor of Philosophy, Duquesne University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding''' ('''ICP''') is a Swiss non-governmental organization specialized in the promotion of non-violent conflict transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ICP approach to Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Pascal Gemperli and Uri Ziegele in 2007, the organization focuses on promoting [[conflict transformation]] and [[peacebuilding]] through peace mediation courses and trainings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/content/trainings-overview Education and training organized by ICP]&lt;/ref&gt; Its comprehensive approach is based on interdisciplinary practice and research in the areas of international peace and conflict research, critical systems theory, culture and communication studies, political psychology, group psychotherapy and other related fields. The ICP has offices in both Bern and Morges (Switzerland). It is accredited ECOSOC &lt;ref name=ECOSOC&gt;[http://csonet.org/content/documents/e2013inf6.pdf Database of NGOs granted with consultative status with ECOSOC]&lt;/ref&gt; and certified EDUQUA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduqua.ch List of all certified EDUQUA institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; It is active in the following countries: Switzerland, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;KOFF (Swisspeace) Interactive Map and Database on NGOs' regions of action [http://koff.swisspeace.ch/who-is-involved/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The ICP offers mediation services on the one hand, and organizes peace mediation trainings and workshops on the other hand. Hence it is active both in mediation and in the promotion of peacebuilding through education, in Switzerland and abroad.

The ICP holds a Konfliktbüro (conflict office) in Bern. The office proposes mediation services to enterprises, institutions and administrations as well as to individuals. The advanced training Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung (The Art of Conflict Transformation) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/cas ICP's Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung website]&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations (SDM-FSM) &lt;ref&gt;Organizations recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations [http://www.infomediation.ch/cms/tab_ausbildungslehrgaenge.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and organized in partnership with the University of Basel.

Every summer since 2008, the ICP organizes the International Summer Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;International Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue website [http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a mediation and peacebuilding training taking place in Caux (Montreux, Switzerland). This one-week course allows participants to attend classes about peace mediation and to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of international experts in the field. Participants also acquire practical skills through peace mediation simulations. Each year, the focus of the course changes slightly: new topics are introduced and other perspectives presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy/history-overview International Summer Academy and Forum: History Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Summer Academy can also decide to attend the International Peace-builders' Forum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caux.ch/en/International-Peacebuilders-Forum-IPF The International Peacebuilders Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in Caux, usually just before the beginning of the Summer Academy.

The Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding is jointly involved with the Universities of Basel, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the creation of a regional Master in Peace Studies in South-East Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://see-peace.net Regional Master's in Peace Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Hertrich-Woleński''' (also known as '''Jan Woleński'''; born 21 September 1940) is a [[Poles|Polish]] [[philosopher]] specializing in the history of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] and in [[analytic philosophy]].

He has spent most of his academic career at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], where he is currently professor [[emeritus]]. His main fields of research are the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and the [[history of philosophy in Poland]].

==Life==
Jan Woleński was born in [[Radom]], Poland on 21 September 1940. His first interest was [[law]] and he began studies at [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1958. Soon [[philosophy]] drew his attention and by 1963 he was employed in the Department of State and Law as an assistant professor. He looked to [[analytical jurisprudence]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and with the guidance of Professor Kazimierz Opalek, in 1968 he produced his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;''Linguistic philosophy and contemporary analytic jurisprudence in the United Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing his ascent, he produced a [[Habilitation]] in 1972: ''Problems in the Interpretations of Law''. In 1974 he straddled two positions: the Institute of Social Sciences at the Academy of Mining and Metallurgy, and lecturer on [[philosophy of science]] at the Institute of Philosophy at Jagiellonian University.&lt;ref name=AR&amp;TP/&gt;

[[Wroclaw Polytechnic]] called him to teach in their Institute of Social Sciences in 1979. As an opponent of the [[state socialism]] governing Poland, Woleński edited an underground bulletin ''Riposte''. Though he was appointed director of the Institute, he was removed after four months for his resistance. The journal [[Studia Logica]] engaged him as editor from 1987 to 1993. It was in 1988 that he gained appointment to the Institute of Philosophy at his alma mater. He became ''professor ordinarius'' in 1990 and chair of the Department of Epistemology in 1994.&lt;ref name=AR&amp;TP/&gt;

Other editing positions include [[Synthese]] from 1990, [[The Monist]] from 1993, ''Studies in Eastern European Thought'' from 1993, ''Axiomathes'' from 1992, and the ''Synthese Library'' of [[Kluwer Academic]]. Woleński was president of the Polish Society of Logic and Philosophy of Science (1999 to 2002). "Jan Woleński has achieved success as a teacher and advisor, encompassing the supervision of fourteen doctoral dissertations. Among his graduates are professors of philosophy as well as of law."&lt;ref name=AR&amp;TP&gt;Artur Rojszczak &amp; Tomas Placek (2003) Preface to ''Philosophy and Logic in Search of the Polish Tradition: Essays in Honor of Jan Woleński on the Occasion of his 60 Birthday'', edited by [[Jaakko Hintikka]], Springer {{ISBN|90-481-6471-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

He is on the consulting board of the philosophy journal, ''[[Theoria (philosophy journal)|Theoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1755-2567/homepage/EditorialBoard.html|title=Theoria|website=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com|accessdate=20 May 2018|issn=1755-2567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Institute Vienna Circle]] held a conference in 1997 on the Austro-Polish connections in [[logical empiricism]]. Woleński described the [[semantic theory of truth]] in his introductory essay, "Sematic Revolution – Rudolf Carnap, Kurt Gödel, Alfred Tarski". It was followed by a score of contributions from [[philosopher]]s. Working with Eckehart Köhler, Wolenski edited the papers and the collection was published as ''Alfred Tarski and the Vienna Circle''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Woleński &amp; Eckehart Köhler (1999) ''Alfred Tarski and the Vienna Circle'', {{ISBN|0-7923-5538-5}} {{mr|id=1752707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Woleński was awarded the [[Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science]] for a comprehensive analysis of the work of the [[Lwów-Warsaw school]] and for placing its achievements within the context of international discourse in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnp.org.pl/en/prof-dr-hab-jan-wolenski-laureat-nagrody-fnp-2013/|title=Prof. Jan Woleński, PhD hab. – FNP Prize 2013 laureate|accessdate=2016-08-11| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319165243/http://www.fnp.org.pl/en/prof-dr-hab-jan-wolenski-laureat-nagrody-fnp-2013/| archivedate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woleński was a plenary speaker at the second world congress on religion and logic held in Warsaw, June 18 to 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://logicandreligion.uw.edu.pl/ World Congress II on Logic and Religion] from [[University of Warsaw]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued academic involvement at the University of Information Technology and Management in [[Rzeszów]] Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wsiz.rzeszow.pl/pl/Uczelnia/Wydarzenia/Strony/pracownicy-WSIiZ-uczestnikami-The-2nd-World-Congress-on-Logic-and-Religion.aspx World Congress II on Logic and Religion] from Rzeszów.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal===
Woleński is active in Poland's [[atheist]] movement.  In the 1960s he was a member of the government-sponsored  [[Association of Atheists and Freethinkers]], and since 2007 he is a member of the Honorary Committee of the Polish Rationalist Association.  He is widely recognized in Poland as an atheist and has promoted the replacement of religion classes with philosophy classes in Polish schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75400,15076082,Prof__Wolenski__jestem_za_tym__zeby_filozofia_zastapila.html|title=Prof. Woleński: jestem za tym, żeby filozofia zastąpiła religię w szkole|website=Wyborcza.pl|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woleński is involved in the secular Jewish movement, writing on the common Polish-Jewish past and on today's Polish-Jewish relations.  He is a member of [[B'nai B'rith]] and was deputy president of its Polish chapter from 2007 to 2012.

He was a member of the [[Polish United Workers Party]] (the Polish communist party) from 1965 to 1981.  From 1980 to 1990 he was a member of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)]] movement.

'''Józef Kremer''' (February 22, 1806, Kraków - June 2, 1875 Kraków), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[history of art|historian of art]], a philosopher, an aesthetician and a [[psychologist]].

==Life==
He studied at Kraków, Berlin, Heidelberg and Paris.

He was a professor of philosophy and rector of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków: 1847, assistant professor; 1850, full professor; 1865, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy; in academic year 1870–71, rector.

He was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] from the day of its founding (1872). Professor of art history and [[aesthetics]] of [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Kraków.

Kremer was the first proponent of [[Hegelianism]] in Poland. In 1843 he published the first volume of ''Listy z Krakowa'' (Letters from Kraków), a dissertation in aesthetics in the Hegelian spirit (vols. 1-3, Vilnius 1855-1856), which brought him recognition and renown. Also his ''Wykład systematyczny filozofii'' [''A systematic course of philosophy''] (vol. 1, Kraków 1849; vol. 2, Vilinius 1852), apart from the work of [[Karol Libelt]], the first systematic textbook of philosophy in 19th-century Poland, was well received.

Kremer's popularity and fame was, however, ensured primarily by his ''Podróż do Włoch'' (Journey to Italy; vols. 1-5, Vilnius 1859-64), which soon found place among the classics of Polish literature, and its excerpts were included in textbooks and anthologies of the day. Thanks to the efforts of [[Henryk Struve]], in 1877-80 a twelve-volume edition of Kremer's collected works was published in Warsaw. No other Polish philosopher contemporary of Kremer's could boast such a publication.

Kremer's most important achievement in [[psychology]] was the systematic division of psychic phenomena into the conscious and the unconscious, and the treatment of [[anthropology]] as a science which probes the mutual relations between these two. By considering the act as the best source of information about a person, Kremer anticipated [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s position.

==Etymology==
Because of the linguistic similarities and shared etymology between the name "al-Khiḍr" and the Arabic word for green ("al-akhḍar" or "al-khaḍra" as in ''Gubbat al-khaḍra'' or the [[Green Dome]]), and the fact that the name "al-Khiḍr" shares exactly the same triliteral root as the word "al-khaḍra" - a root found in multiple [[Semitic languages]] meaning "green" or "verdant", the meaning of the name has traditionally usually been taken colloquially and academically to be "the Green One" or "the Verdant One." Some contemporary scholars have disagreed with this assessment,&lt;ref&gt;Gürdal Aksoy, ''Dersim Alevi Kürt Mitolojisi'', İstanbul, 2006, Komal yayınevi, {{ISBN|975710213X}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some others point to a possible reference to the Mesopotamian figure [[Utnapishtum]] from the Epic of [[Gilgamesh]] through the Arabization of his nickname, "Hasisatra".&lt;ref&gt;see A. J. Wensinck, "al-Khaḍir," in ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', IV, pp. 902-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to one recent view the name Khidr is not an Arabic variant or an abbreviation of Hasisatra, it directly comes from the name of the Canaanite god [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]]&lt;ref&gt;Dalley defends traditional opinion: "The name or epithet of Atrahasis is used for the skillful god of craftmanship Kothar-wa-hasis in Ugaritic mythology, and is abbreviated to Chousor in the Greek account of Syrian origins related by Philo of Byblos. A similar abbreviation is used in the name of the Islamic sage Al-khidr..."

== Quranic narrative ==
{{Quran}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam#Meeting with Khidr}}

In [[Sura 18]], [[ayat]] (verses) 65–82 ''Al Kahf'', Moses meets the Servant of God, referred in the Quran as "one of our slaves whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|18|65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim scholars identify him as [[Al Khiḍr|Nabi Khadra]], although he is not explicitly named in the Quran and there is no reference to him being immortal or being especially associated with esoteric knowledge or fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Brannon M.|title=Moses in the Quran and Islamic Exegesis|year=2002|publisher=Routledge Curzon|location=London|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These associations come in later scholarship on al-Khiḍr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Brannon M.|title=Moses in the Quran and Islamic Exegesis|year=2002|publisher=Routledge Curzon|location=London|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states that they meet at the junction of the two seas (which can be a river-tributary) and Moses asks for permission to accompany the Servant of God so Moses can learn "right knowledge of what [he has] been taught".&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|18|66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Servant informs him in a stern manner that their knowledge is of different nature and that "Surely you [Moses] cannot have patience with me. And how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding is not complete?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|18|68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moses promises to be patient and obey him unquestioningly, and they set out together. After they board a ship, the Servant of God damages the vessel. Forgetting his oath, Moses says, "Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates? Certainly you have done a grievous thing." The Servant reminds Moses of his warning, "Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me?" and Moses pleads not to be rebuked.

Next, the Servant of God kills a young man. Moses again cries out in astonishment and dismay, and again the Servant reminds Moses of his warning, and Moses promises that he will not violate his oath again, and that if he does he will excuse himself from the Servant's presence. They then proceed to a town where they are denied hospitality. This time, instead of harming anyone or anything, the Servant of God restores a decrepit wall in the village. Yet again Moses is amazed and violates his oath for the third and last time, asking why the Servant did not at least exact "some recompense for it."

The Servant of God replies, "This shall be separation between me and you; now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience. Many acts which seem to be [[evil]], malicious or somber, actually are merciful. The boat was damaged to prevent its owners from falling into the hands of a king who seized every boat by force. And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them. God will replace the child with one better in purity, affection and obedience. As for the restored wall, the Servant explained that underneath the wall was a treasure belonging to two helpless orphans whose father was a righteous man. As God's envoy, the Servant restored the wall, showing God's kindness by rewarding the piety of the orphans' father, and so that when the wall becomes weak again and collapses, the orphans will be older and stronger and will take the treasure that belongs to them."

== Reports in the Hadith ==
[[File:Khidr and elijah.jpg|thumb|A [[Persian miniature|Persian]] manuscript depicting [[Elijah]] and al-Khiḍr praying together from an [[illuminated manuscript]] version of [[Stories of the Prophets]]]]
Among the strongest transmitted proofs about the life of al-Khiḍr are two reports, one narrated by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] in ''Al-Zuhd'' whereby Muhammad is said to have stated that [[Elijah]] and al-Khiḍr meet every year and spend the month of [[Ramadan]] in [[Jerusalem]]{{cn|date=November 2017}} and the other narrated by Ya'qub ibn Sufyan from [[Umar II]] whereby a man he was seen walking with was actually al-Khiḍr. Ibn Hajar declared the claim of the first fair and that of the second sound in ''Fath al-Bari'' (1959 ed. 6:435). He goes on to cite another sound report narrated by [[Ibn 'Asakir]] from [[Abu Zur’a al-Razi]] whereby the latter met al-Khiḍr twice, once in his youth, the other in old age, but al-Khiḍr himself had not changed.
Islamic scholar Bediuzzaman Said Nursi also contends that Khidr is alive, but that there are five degrees of life; Khidr is
at the second degree of life, thus some religious scholars have been doubtful about it. Khidr and Ilyas (May God grant them peace), are free to an extent. That is to say, they can be present in numerous places at the same time. They are not permanently restricted by the requirements of humanity like us. They can eat and drink like us when they want to, but are not compelled to be like we are. The saints are those who uncover and witness the realities of creation, and the reports of their adventures with Khidr are unanimous and elucidate and point to this level of life. There is even one degree of sainthood which is called 'the degree of Khidr.' A saint who reaches this degree receives instruction from Khidr and meets with him. But sometimes the one at that degree is mistaken to be Khidr himself.&lt;ref&gt;Nursi, S., &amp; Vahide, S. (2001). Letters. İstanbul: Sözler Neşriyat.&lt;/ref&gt;

al-Khiḍr is believed to be a man who has the appearance of a young adult but a long, white beard. According to some authors like Abdul Haq Vidhyarthi, al-Khiḍr is Xerxes (a 6th-century Sasanian prince, not to be confused with [[Xerxes I]]), who disappeared after being in the lake regions of [[Sistan]] that comprise the wetlands of the Irano-Afghan border today, and after finding the fountain of life, sought to live his entire remaining life in service of God and to help those in their path/journey to Him.

[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] reports that al-Khiḍr got his name after he was present over the surface of some ground that became green as a result of his presence there. There are reports from [[al-Bayhaqi]] that al-Khiḍr was present at the funeral of Muhammad and was recognized only by [[Ali]] from amongst the rest of the companions, and where he came to show his grief and sadness at the death of Muhammad. Al-Khiḍr's appearance at Muhammad's funeral is related as follows: ''A powerful-looking, fine-featured, handsome man with a white beard came leaping over the backs of the people till he reached where the sacred body lay. Weeping bitterly, he turned toward the Companions and paid his condolences. Ali said that he was Khiḍr''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Jazari, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;228&lt;/ref&gt;

In another narration al-Khiḍr met with Ali by the [[Kaaba]] and instructed him about a supplication that is very meritorious when recited after the obligatory prayers. It is reported by Imam Muslim that during the time when the false Messiah appears and as he approaches at the outskirts of the city of [[Medina]], a believer would challenge him, whom the false Messiah will slice into two piece and rejoin, making it appear that he caused him to die and be resurrected, to which this man would proclaim the falsehood of the [[Dajjal]] who would try again to kill him (or make show of it) but would fail and thus his weakness and inability being made revealed. According to the commentators and transmitters of this narration the person who will challenge the Antichrist and humiliate him will be al-Khiḍr.

[[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] narrates in [[Kitab al-Kafi]] that after entering the sacred Mosque in Mecca, Ali, [[Hasan ibn Ali]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] were visited by a good looking, well dressed man who asked them a series of questions. Hasan answered the questions and upon this, the man testified to the prophet-hood of Muhammad followed by testifying that Ali and his [[Ahl al-Bayt]] are the successors and heir to his message. Ali asked Hasan to track the whereabouts of the visitor, but when he could not, Ali revealed the identity of the man to be Khidr. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Islamic perspectives ==
{{Islam}} 
===In Shia Islam ===
Many [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] believe al-Khiḍr accompanied the [[Mahdi]], in meeting one Sheikh Hassan ibn Muthlih Jamkarani, on 22 February 984 CE (17 Ramadan 373 A.H.) and instructing him to build a mosque at that site of their meeting, known as [[Jamkaran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafariyanews.com/oct2k2/22_jamkran.htm |title=History of Jamkaran Mosque |publisher=Jafariya News |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209112820/http://www.jafariyanews.com/oct2k2/22_jamkran.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, six kilometers east of [[Qom]], [[Iran]], has been a pilgrimage destination for the Shia for some time. In the last few years, however, it has become very popular, particularly with young people, and drawn crowds of tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', (Norton, 2006), p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ismailism]], al-Khiḍr is considered as one of the 'permanent Imams'; that is, those who have guided people throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, C. Glasse, Ismailis: "[Ismailis believe in] a 'permanent Imam'."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Sufism ===
To [[Sufism|Sufis]], al-Khiḍr holds a distinguished position. Although amongst the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars there is a difference of opinion about him being still alive, amongst Sunni Sufis there is almost a consensus that al-Khiḍr is still alive, with many respected figures and shaykhs, and prominent leaders claiming having had personal encounters with him. Examples of those who have claimed this are [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[al-Nawawi]], [[Ibn Arabi]], Sidi Abdul Aziz ad-[[Debbagh|Dabbagh]] and [[Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi]]. [[Ibn Ata Allah]]'s ''Lata'if al-Minan'' (1:84-98) states that there is consensus among the Sufis that al-Khiḍr is alive. In fact there are orders that claim origin with al-Khiḍr himself, or that al-Khiḍr was part of their [[silsila|chain]], for example some of the [[Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order]], the [[Muhammadiyah]], the [[Idrisiyya]], and the [[Senussi]] are [[tariqat]] that had al-Khiḍr as one of the central figures connecting them to the spiritual outflow of Muhammad.

In Sufi tradition, al-Khiḍr has come to be known as one of those who receive illumination direct from God without human mediation. He is the hidden initiator of those who walk the mystical path, like some of those from the [[Uwaisi]] tariqa. Uwaisis are those who enter the mystical path without being initiated by a living master. Instead they begin their mystical journey either by following the guiding light of the teachings of the earlier masters or by being initiated by the mysterious prophet-saint al-Khiḍr.

Al-Khiḍr has had thus gained enormous reputation and popularity in the Sufi tradition due to his role as an initiator. Through this way come several Sufi orders which claim initiation through al-Khiḍr and consider him their master. Al-Khiḍr had thus come to symbolize access to the divine mystery (''ghayb'') itself. In the writings of Abd al-Karim al-Jili, al-Khiḍr rules over ‘the Men of the Unseen' (''rijalu’l-ghayb'')— the exalted saints and angels. Al-Khiḍr is also included among what in classical Sufism are called the ‘’[[abdal|abdāl]]’’ (‘those who take turns’). In Sufi hierarchy, ‘’abdāl’’ is a mysterious rank. It is thought in Sufism that God decides who will be abdal for a decade before an abdal is born. Adbals are thought as the gainers of mysterious power that is knowing the future also called Ilm-e-ladunni. They are deployed to protect Islam from some unwanted evil activities that threaten the existence of Islam. In a divinely-instituted hierarchy of such saints, al-Khiḍr holds the rank of their spiritual head.

The Sri Lankan Sufi [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]] gives a unique account of al-Khiḍr. Al-Khiḍr was on a long search for God, until God, out of his mercy, sends the Archangel [[Holy_Spirit_in_Islam|Gabriel]] to guide him. Gabriel appears to al-Khiḍr as a wise human sage, and al-Khiḍr accepts him as his teacher. Gabriel teaches al-Khiḍr much in the same way as al-Khiḍr later teaches [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] in the [[Quran]], by carrying out seemingly unjust actions. Al-Khiḍr repeatedly breaks his oath not to speak out against Gabriel's actions, and is still unaware that the human teacher is actually Gabriel. Gabriel then explains his actions, and reveals his true angelic form to al-Khiḍr. Al-Khiḍr recognises him as the Archangel Gabriel, and then Gabriel bestows a spiritual title upon al-Khiḍr, by calling him ''Hayat Nabi'', the Eternal Life Prophet.

The French scholar of Sufism, [[Henry Corbin]], interprets al-Khiḍr as the mysterious prophet, the eternal wanderer. The function of al-Khiḍr as a 'person-archetype' is to reveal each disciple to himself, to lead each disciple to his own theophany, because that theophany corresponds to his own 'inner heaven,' to the form of his own being, to his eternal individuality. Accordingly, al-Khiḍr is Moses' spiritual guide, who initiates Moses into the divine sciences, and reveals to him the secret mystic truth.

=== In Ahmadiyya ===
[[Ahmadiyya]] identifies al-Khiḍr to be the symbolic representation of [[Muhammad]] himself. Ahmadis believe that the Quranic passage of [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]]’ encounter with the "Servant of God" is closely linked, contextually to the subject matter of surah [[Al Kahf]] in which his story or parable is cited. According to Ahmadi exegesis on al-Kahf, which draws upon external and internal, religious and historical evidence to show that Moses' journey towards, and his experience with the "servant of God" was not physical but by way of vision, similar to the [[Mi'raj]] (ascension) of [[Muhammad]].

The righteous 'servant of God' otherwise known as al-Khiḍr is not believed to be a historical figure but rather a symbolic figure who signifies the person of Muhammad whom Moses had desired to see and whom he saw in this vision. Muhammad has been called the 'servant of God' in many places within the Quran and is believed to be the servant of God par excellence who has been called a mercy to the whole world;&lt;ref&gt;Quran 21:108&lt;/ref&gt; he is also believed to have been vouchsafed divine knowledge in a very large measure.

The place of the meeting of the two seas signifies the time when the Mosaic dispensation meets the Islamic dispensation, i.e. when the Judaic dispensation will be superseded by the Islamic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1474&amp;region=E1 |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Moses and the "servant of God" approach a town, ask its people for food and are refused to be accepted as guests. This signifies that both Moses and Muhammad would seek co-operation from Jews and Christians but it would be denied. The two orphan boys to whom the wall belonged are [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and their 'righteous' father is [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]. Their treasure was the true teaching bequeathed by them to their peoples, which was in danger of being lost due to the latter's irreligiousness. Thus the third act of the 'servant of God' (Muhammad) of rebuilding the wall signifies that the treasure or true teachings were to be safeguarded in the Quran, so that they (the people of Moses and Jesus) may accept it after having awakened to a realization of the truth of the Quranic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1522&amp;region=E1 |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Zoroastrianism ==

There are many figures in Iran whose place Khidr took by the Islamization process. One of them is paradoxically a female figure [[Anahita]]. The most popular shrine in Yazd is dedicated to Anahita. Among the Zoroastrians, for the pilgrims to Yazd, the most important of the six ''pir''s is ''Pir-e Sabz''. It is still a functional temple and the holiest site for present-day Zoroastrians living in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Strausberg, ''Zoroastrian Rituals in Context'', Leiden, 2004: Brill, p. 563; Payam Nabarz, ''The Mysteries of Mithras. The Pagan Belief That Shaped the Christian World'', foreword C. Matthews, CANADA, 2005, p. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each year from 14–18 June, many thousands of [[Zoroastrian]]s from Iran, India and other countries make a pilgrimage to Yazd in Iran to worship at a hillside grotto containing the sacred spring dedicated to ''Pir e Sabz''. Here the worshippers pray for the fertilising rain and celebrate the greening of nature and the renewal of life. It generally refers to the sacred meal made from wheat, barley or lentil sprouts ceremoniously consumed in honour of Pir e Sabz.

In [[Persian language|Persian]] the term ''sabz'' means 'green' and ''pir'' means 'shrine' among the Zoroastrians of Iran. The name of the shrine derives from the greenness of the foliage growing around the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Rose, ''Zoroastrianism: An Introduction'', India, 2010: I.B. Tauris, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; It is actually known ''Pir-e Sabz Banu'' 'the old woman in the mountain' or ''Chek Chek'', but also ''Pir-e Sabz'' 'the green saint'. Because ''pir'' means also 'elder' in Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Nabarz 2005: 100.&lt;/ref&gt; As Babayan says, "''Khizr is related to the Zoroastrian water goddess Anahita, and some of her former sanctuaries in Iran were rededicated to him (Pir-e Sabz)''".&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Babayan, ''Mystics, Monarchs and Messiahs: Cultural Landscapes of Early Modern Iran'', USA, 2002, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Al-Khiḍr in "The History of al-Tabari" ==
Persian scholar, historian and exegete of the Qur'an [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], writes about Khidr in a chapter of his ''The History of al-Tabari'', called "The Tale of al-Khiḍr and His History; and the History of Moses and His Servant Joshua."   Al-Tabari describes several versions of the traditional story surrounding al-Khiḍr. At the beginning of the chapter, al-Tabari explains that in some variations, al-Khiḍr is a contemporary of the mythical Persian king Afridun, who was a contemporary of Abraham, and lived before the days of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khiḍr is also said to have been appointed to be over the vanguard of the king [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] the Elder, who in this version is identified as the king Afridun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this specific version, al-Khiḍr comes across the River of Life and, unaware of its properties, drinks from it and becomes immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Tabari also recounts that al-Khiḍr is said to have been the son of a man who believed in [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], and who emigrated with Abraham when he left [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="Al-Tabari 1991 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khiḍr is also commonly associated with [[Elijah]], even equated with him, and al-Tabari makes a distinction in the next account in which al-Khiḍr is [[Persian people|Persian]] and Elijah is an [[Israelites|Israelite]]. According to this version of al-Khiḍr's story, al-Khiḍr and Elijah meet every year during the annual festival season.&lt;ref name="Al-Tabari 1991 3" /&gt;

Al-Tabari seems more inclined to believe that al-Khiḍr lived during the time of Afridun before Moses, rather than traveled as Abraham's companion and drank the water of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not state clearly why he has this preference, but rather seems to prefer the chain of sources (the ''isnad'') of the former story rather than the latter.

The various versions in al-Tabari's ''History'' more or less parallel each other and the account in the Quran. However, in the stories al-Tabari recounts, Moses claims to be the most knowledgeable man on earth, and God corrects him by telling him to seek out al-Khiḍr. Moses is told to bring a salted fish, and once he found the fish to be missing, he would then find al-Khiḍr. Moses sets out with a travel companion, and once they reach a certain rock, the fish comes to life, jumps into the water, and swims away. It is at this point that Moses and his companion meet al-Khiḍr.

Al-Tabari also adds to lore surrounding the origins of al-Khiḍr's name. He refers to a saying of [[Muhammad]] that al-Khiḍr ("the Green" or "the Verdant") was named because he sat on a white fur and it shimmered green with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary theories on the origins of Khidr ==

A contemporary hypothesis on Khidr's prototype compares him with the Ugaritic god [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]].&lt;ref name="Gürdal Aksoy 2006, p. 215-93"&gt;Gürdal Aksoy 2006, p. 215–93&lt;/ref&gt; First of all, both figures possess wisdom and secret knowledge. According to the Quran, "Khidr" (although not named directly) has a special wisdom and esoteric knowledge ('''hikmah''' and '''ilm al-ladun'''). Kothar has also special wisdom and his name means "Skillful and Wise" or "Adroit and Perceptive" or "Deft and Clever".&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Ford, ''Dragon of the Two Flames. Demonic Magick &amp; the Gods of Canaan'', Houston, 2012, Succubus Productions, p. 271-2, {{ISBN|978-1-105-71034-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Hasisu''' means wisdom, intelligence in Babylonian, also in some ancient Near Eastern languages.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian'', ed. by J. Black, A. George, N. Postgate, second (corrected) printing, 2000, Harrasowitz verlag, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Not only his name, but according to some scholars Kothar's epithet '''hyn''' also means wise or clever (Syrian ''hawna'': intelligence or ability).&lt;ref&gt;Ayali-Darshan points that ''hyn'' is connected with the name of Mesopotamian god Ea and the terms derived from the Akkadian form ''ḫasīsu'', frequently occurs in Hurrian and Hurro-Hittite material as a customary epithet for Ea (Noga Ayali-Darshan, 'The Meaning of ''Hyn dḥrš ydm'' in Light of a Parallel from Emar', ''Ugarit-Forschungen'', Band 43, 2011, p. 1-6). This connection makes strong the continuity between Kothar and Khidr. Because Ea is almost same type god with Kothar. He is wise figure among the gods and at least he has more than twenty epithets which mean wise, clever, intelligent etc (for some epithets, see Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Sümerlerin Kurnaz Tanrısı Enki'', çev. H. Koyukan, İstanbul, 2000: Kabalcı, p. 417 {{ISBN|975-8240-33-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Kothar is a craftsman god and almost all [[blacksmith]]s and craftsmen are wise, clever and skillful figures in the mythology. Because people believed that they have some secret powers and wisdom to work metals;&lt;ref&gt;for details see Aksoy 2006, p. 237-9; about blacksmiths and craftsmen, see Mircea Eliade, ''[[The Forge and the Crucible]]: The Origins and Structure of Alchemy'', Chicago, 1978: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; for example in Greek epic, Hephaistos is praised not only for his craftsmanship, but with intellectual epithets appropriate to Odysseus.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah P. Morris, ''Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art'', New Jersey, 1992, Princeton Univ. Press, p. 85-6&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as ''klytomētis'' (renowned for mind) and ''klytotechnēs'' (renowned for skill) by Homeros.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor H. Gaster, ''Thespis; Ritual, Myth and Drama in the Ancient Near East'', foreword by G. Murray, New York, 1950, Henry Schuman, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Blacksmiths and craftsmen played a central role in ancient society. They made many tools that people needed, from agricultural tools like the reaping-hook (the sickle or scythe) to weapons like arrows, spears, axes and swords. They made musical instruments, too.&lt;ref&gt;James Blades, ''Percussion Instruments and Their History'', London, 2005, The Bold Strummer, p. 81-2, {{ISBN|0-933224-61-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the metalworkers or craftsmen were considered the lords of many social inventions like agriculture, music, writing, fire, etc.&lt;ref&gt;see Eliade 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result of their social status, they were seen as wise, intelligent figures in mythology, Kothar too.

Secondly, Kothar and Khidr are dragon slayers or they help some figures to kill a dragon. Kothar helps [[Baal]] to kill [[Yam-Nahar]] by making weapons for him.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ford, ''Dragon of the Two Flames, Demonic Magick and the Gods of Canaan'', Houston, 2012, Succubus, {{ISBN|978-1-105-71034-6}}, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Khidr helps Sufis or ''wali's'' like [[Sarı Saltuk]] to struggle with a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Helga Anetshofer, "Legends of Sarı Saltık in the Seyahatnâme and the Bektashi Oral Tradition", ''Evliyâ Çelebi: Studies and Essays Commemorating the 400th Anniversary of his Birth'', editors Nuran Tezcan, et al. Istanbul, 2012, p. 296-7 footnote 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6148212/Legends_of_Sari_Saltik_in_the_Seyahatname_and_the_Bektashi_Oral_Tradition |title=Legends of Sarı Saltık in the Seyahatnâme and the Bektashi Oral Tradition &amp;#124; Helga Anetshofer |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some other stories he plays a central role, not that of a helper, and slays the dragon himself.&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Hasluck, ''Christianity and Islam under the Sultans'', 2 vols.

Strabo tells the same story, but his characters are different; [[Zeus]] and [[Typhon]].&lt;ref&gt;The myth of Khidr and the dragon which, mentioned by the people of Antakya, can be traced to ancient times. This myth tells a story about the origin of the [[Orontes river]]. About its origin, see Ulf Oldenburg, ''The Conflict between El and Ba'al in Canaanite Religion'', Leiden, 1969, E.J. Brill, p. 32-3&lt;/ref&gt; Another one which mentioned Khidr himself as a dragon slayer, quoted by Flemish ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]] (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Oya Pancaroglu, "The Itinerant Dragon-Slayer: Forging Paths of Image and Identity in Medieval Anatolia", GESTA XLIII/2, 2004, pp. 151-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imtlucca.it/attachments/gerevini_pancaroglu_dragon_slayer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927083149/http://www.imtlucca.it/attachments/gerevini_pancaroglu_dragon_slayer.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions, especially in the frontiers of Asia Minor, Khidr is seen as a dragon slayer, because he took the place of Saint George or other warrior saints like Saint Theodore ([[Theodore of Amasea]]) who fights against the dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Sara Wolper, "Khidr, Elwan Çelebi and the Conversion of Sacred Sanctuaries in Anatolia", ''The Muslim World'', Vol. 90, issue 3-4, 2000, p. 309-322; Pancaroglu 2004; see also Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'', Great Britain, 2003: Ashgate {{ISBN|184014694X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can't be explained only by this continuity. The myth of the dragon slayer was very popular in the ancient Near East and the divine smiths were usually assistant figures to make weapons for the chief gods of this mythological scenario, but they were also seen as a dragon slayer in some myths. In Kurdish mythology [[Kaveh the blacksmith]] (''Kawa'') kills an evil king [[Zahhak]] who was only a personification of the Avestan dragon Azhi Dahaka. According to a Scottish tale, from another side of the world, the blacksmith of [[Kirkcudbright]] defeated the White Snake of Mote Hill. Moreover, Kothar has fought against [[Behemoth]] and some other monstrous beings in Ugaritic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;'BEHEMOTH was a terrifying monster of Hebrew mythology, the dry-land equivalent of the monstrous sea serpent LEVIATHAN' (Arthur Cotterell-Rachel Storm, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology'', London, 1999, Lorenz Books, p. 272 {{ISBN|0-7548-0091-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; A Ugaritic text tells it: ''In the sea are Arshu and the dragon, May Kothar and Hasis drive (them) away, May Kothar-and-Hasis cut (them) off''.&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Batto, 'Behemoth', in ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible'', ed. by K. van der Toorn, B. Becking, Pieter W. van der Horst, second extensively revised edition, Leiden, Boston, Köln, 1999, Brill, p. 168 {{ISBN|90-04-11119-0}}; John Day, ''God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament'', Cambridge, Univ. Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-521-25600-3}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Kothar and Khidr are known as "sailor" figures who are symbolically associated with sea, lake and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Robertson, ''Religion and Reconciliation in Greek Cities: The Sacred Laws of Selinus and Cyrene'', Oxford, 2010, Oxford Univ. Prees, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539400-9}}, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; '''Chusor''' is an inventor of the boat and he saves sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Albert I. Baumgarten, ''The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos: A Commentary'', Leiden, 1981, Brill, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; It believed that he was the first voyager on a boat. Khidr helps people when they need help and the most of these dangerous conditions are about seas, lakes and rivers, etc. For example, he sometimes helps children when they are drowning in the water or he helps boatmen during stormy weather. The Alevi Kurds of Dersim saw him as a savior and describe him as a "sovereign of the seas".&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He is a patron "saint" of the rivers in India.&lt;ref&gt;Longworth Dames, M. "Khwadja Khidr", ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', second edition, retrieved 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic feature of Khidr is not only from new syncretisms, it is basically connected with Kothar's characteristic features. Because Chusor (''Kothar'') was inventor of the boat and sailors believe that he protects them when they voyage. One of his epithets was '''bn ym''' (son of the sea).&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 223-25, 236&lt;/ref&gt; Khidr often has some characteristics of a sailor, even in cultural areas which are not directly linked to the sea, like mountainous Dersim. It may be evident that Khidr originally comes from the culture of a people who inhabited the seashore. He has transformed to a wanderer by the cultural effects of [[darwish]]s and wanderer Sufis.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 239-40 and [[Pertev Naili Boratav]], "Hızır (Türklerde)", ''İslâm Ansiklopedisi'', V/l, 1967, p. 465–66 (in Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Above their all characteristics, the status of Kothar can't be denied to show this continuity. Kothar is an assistant or "''a servant god''" in Ugaritic mythology. He helps [[Baal]] and builds a palace for him, but he is actually a "''servant of supreme god EL''".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cotterell-Rachel Storm, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology'', ''An A-Z Guide To The Myths And Legends Of The Ancient World'', 1999, p. 293, Lorenz Books, {{ISBN|0-7548-0091-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he is accepted as one of the divine servants in Ugarit, because Keret, son of El, is also called a "''servant of El''".&lt;ref&gt;for the ''divine servants'', see Mark Smith-Wayne T. Pitard, ''The Ugaritic Baal Cyle'', Vol. II, Leiden, 2009, p.50-1, 452, 577: Brill {{ISBN|9789004153486}}; for Keret, see T. Kleven, "Kingship in Ugarit", in ''Ascribe to the Lord, Biblical and Other Studies in Memory of Peter C. Craigie'', ed. by Lyle Eslinger-Glen Taylor, 1988: Sheffield Academic Press, {{ISBN|1-85075-189-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Quran, Khidr is "a servant of Allah" (''''abd min 'ibādinā''').&lt;ref&gt;In Arabic ''''abd min 'ibādinā''' means "one of our servants/worshippers". The Arabic word for worship, ''ibadah'', comes from the Arabic word ''abd'' which means "servant or slave".&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the names of ''Allah'' and ''El'' are very similar to each other. It is known that they come from a common root. By the similar or common elements, it can be seen as part of their continuity.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Bussell, "The Persistence of Primitive Beliefs of Theology: A Study of Syrian Syncretism: 'Ali, Elyun, El, Helioss and Eliyah", ''Folklore ''28, No. 3, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Kothar and Khidr bring fertility. Kothar controls and customizes the seasons. Like some craftsmen or blacksmiths, Kothar is associated with agriculture. Among the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]] the heavenly smith has a role of civilizing hero; he brings down grain from heaven and reveals agriculture to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;"''All the entire mass of palaeo-Nigritian culture bears witness to a whole complex of religious activities concerning the smith, whose ideological foundations are to be found in the myth of the Celestial Smith and the Civilizing Hero. It would nevertheless be an error to explain this ritual significance of the smith solely on the basis of his role in the making of agricultural tools. Neither iron itself nor the smithy is necessarily exalted in agricultural civilizations''..." Eliade 1978, p. 30, 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bible '''Cain '''(meaning perhaps ''smith'') was a farmer and 'blacksmith', although he was not the inventor of agriculture. The Welsh smith ''Govannon ''had agricultural powers as well, for it was he who cleaned the plows at the end of planting, to ensure that the tools abundance would serve another year.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan, ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore'', New York, 2004, p. 225 {{ISBN|0-8160-4524-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, Kothar's profession, which is associated with agriculture among some cultures, has a good reason for him to get a new position in time. Some peoples of the Levant, especially the people of ancient Cyprus, believed that '''Kautar''' (that is Kothar) was father of '''Tamoza'''/[[Tammuz (deity)]], the god of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Kothar is the Phoenician Chusor mentioned by [[Sanchuniathon]] and by Mochos of Sidon. According to Albright, he is also ''Kautar'' said by [[Melito of Sardis]] to have been the father of Tammuz (Gaster, p. 154 fn).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Khidr became a special figure of new syncretisms in late periods. Because Kautar (later Khidr) and his son Tamoza ([[Adonis]])&lt;ref&gt;The epithet of ''Tammuz'' is from ''adon'' which means lord in Semitic languages.&lt;/ref&gt; have been compared with [[Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;''cousin of Mohammad''.&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[Hussein]] ('''Husayn'''). In some contexts they identified with each other. Khidr and Ali have almost the same position in Islamic mystic thought and some Shiite beliefs and they can take the place of each other. In some contexts Khidr is identified with Husayn, sometimes with the last imam or '''Mahdi'''. The mythological scene show very strong syncretisms. It can be described like this: [[El (deity)]] and his son Baal,&lt;ref&gt;''Baal'' means lord like ''adon''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kautar (Kothar) and his son Tamoza (''Adonis''), Ali and his son Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;His epithet ''al-Sayyid'' also means lord in Arabic, as Adonis in Syriac. Moreover, Adonis is known as a handsome god and Husayn is an Arabic name which is the diminutive of Hassan, meaning "good", "handsome" or "beautiful". Gürdal Aksoy writes that it could be an easy way to mythologize Husayn by this common elements (also about the origins of [[Ta'zieh]] ritual, see Aksoy 2009, p. 222).&lt;/ref&gt; The names of [[El (deity)]] and Ali are similar to each other and it was an onomastic invitation for some new beliefs about Ali, Husayn and Khidr. There are many other connection points like their abodes. El's abode is at the source of two rivers. According to the Quran "Khidr"s abode is '''majma-ul bahrayn'''; that is, the junction of two seas. In ancient texts El's abode is described as ''the stream of two seas''. Kothar constructs a house from Lebanon trees for El and then burns a fire in the house for seven days. After the fire has transformed and refined the form of the palace, it is mimetically identical with its archetype on the [[axis mundi]], where El resides.&lt;ref&gt;Christine C. Schnusenberg, ''The Mythological Traditions of Liturgical Drama: The Eucharist as Theater'', foreword by L.E. Sullivan, New Jersey, 2010, Paulist Press, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Majma-ul bahrayn is also on ''axis mundi'' and may be therefore some scholars like Du Buission pointed to parallelism between El's abode and ''majma-ul bahrayn''.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006; for [[Ta'zieh]] ceremony and its origins, see Aksoy 2009, p. 212-22; Robert Du Mesnil Du Buission, ''Nouvelles Etudes sur les Dieux et les Mythes de Canaan'', Leiden, 1973, p. 4, E. J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic ''al-Kawthar'', which means a river of the paradise, is etymologically connected with the name of the Ugaritic divine craftsman, Kothar.&lt;ref&gt;John Pairman Brown, "Kothar, Kinyras and Kythereia", ''Journal of Semitic Studies'', Vol. X, ed. by C.F. Beckingham, 1965, p. 199-200 and D. Pardee, "Kothar", ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible'', edited by Karel Van Der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem Van Der Horst, 1995, p. 914, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|9789004111196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover like Ea and El, Kothar's dwelling is also associated with waters.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith, ''God in Translation: Deities in Cross-cultural Discourse in the Biblical World'', Michigan, 2010, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6433-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kothar was the lord of wise words and good speech. According to Phoenician tradition, Kothar was also inventor of magical incantations; in addition, he was believed to have been the first poet.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (consulting editor), ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'', 1999, Merriam-Webster, ISBN p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; He is a soothsayer and magician, creating sacred words and spells, in part because there is an association in many cultures of metalworking deities with magic. [[Sanchuniathon]] says that Chusor invented the art of composing chants and incantations.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In Ugaritic texts '''kotharat''' means singer women.&lt;ref&gt;In Ugaritic texts the ''knr'' which was a type of lyre, appears with the other names of musical instruments. In an Ugaritic text, the ''knr'' is listed first among an ensemble of instruments which seem to be described as the 'beloved companions' of Kothar. The ''knr'' (Hebrew ''kinnôr''), once divinized, itself becomes a god, ''Kinyras'' ([[Cinyras]]). He was a priest-king,  lover of Aphrodite and also father of Adonis. By this characteristic he seems like Kothar. Because Kothar is accepted as father of ''Tamoza'' (Tammuz/Adonis). Besides, its translation is ''kithara'' in the [[Septuagint]] and some scholars think that it come from ''ktr'', that is Kothar (see J. C. Franklin, "Lyre Gods of Bronze Age Musical Koine", JANER 6, nr. 1, 2006, p. 39-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingmixers.com/FranklinPDFfilescopy/LyreGodsWeb.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vyacheslav V.

The same associations are to be found among the Turco-Tartars and Mongols, where the smith is linked with heroes, singers and poets.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade 1978: 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Like them, Khidr teaches a kind of [[dhikr]] (Arabischذکر; "''remembrance'' (of God)", "''pronouncement''", "''invocation''") to some Sufis like Abdulhalik Gucduvani. But it seems that it was not only an echo of Kothar, it is also a strong effect of [[Surush]] (or ''Surosh'') who was originally a Zoroastrian divinity Sraosha and Khidr took his place when Islam was introduced to Iran and became the dominant religion there.&lt;ref&gt;The ''silence dhikr'' is associated with Zoroastrian ''baj''. It is a silence prayer. ''Srosh-baj'' is one of the daily prayers of Parsees.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Islamisation process in Iran, Surush (''Sraosha'') was accepted as a messenger angel and also identified with Jibrail ([[Gabriel]]). Because at the same time Surush was an inspirational figure to poets.&lt;ref&gt;J.-Christoph Bürgel, 'Nizāmī's World Order', in ''A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim, Artistic and Humanistic Aspects of Nizāmī Ganjavi's Khamsa'', Johann-Christoph Bürgel-Christine van Ruymbeke (eds.), Leiden, 2011, Leiden Univ. Press, p. 41, see www.oapen.org/download?type=document&amp;docid=401764&lt;/ref&gt; According to a rumor the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] has learned a devotion by Khidr.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 218, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It's more interesting that Khidr is seen as their ancestral master or [[pir (Sufism)]] among the [[ashik]]s. According to the ashiks' tradition, Khidr gives to apprentices the art of poetry and he helps them for their [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pertev Naili Boratav, ''Türk Mitolojisi (Oğuzların, Anadolu, Azerbaycan ve Türkmenistan Türklerinin Mitolojisi)'', 1. baski, Ankara, 2012, p. 71 {{ISBN|978-9944-795-41-8}}; Theo Maarten van Lint, p. 335-378; Aksoy 2012, p. 76-9&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity is comprehensible, because in mythic mentality the eloquence and especially the poem is associated with the rhythm and melody of craftsmen's work. Its echo can be understood with the origins of the English word ''poem'' (and [[poetry]]). It comes from Latin ''poēma'', from Ancient Greek ποίημα (''poiēma''), from ποιέω (''poiēo'', "I make").

On the other hand, the craftsmen or blacksmiths were seen the lord of writing and it is interesting that the master calligraphers of Ottoman Turkey were sure that their talent was the gift of otherworldly powers; they were iniated by Khidr or Hazret 'Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, 'Calligraphy and Sufism in Ottoman Turkey', Raymond Lifchez (ed.), ''The Dervish Lodge, Architecture, Art and Sufism in Ottoman Turkey'', Oxford, 1992, University of California Press, p. 245 {{ISBN|0-520-07060-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times the people thoughts that the writing was a magic work and it's often regarded at first as an instrument of the secret and magic power. Therefore, it might be created by craftsmen and blacksmiths who have same power. Besides, the cuneiform was a craft. First of all; it was not easy to write on a clay tablet and to produce a good clay tablet must have been one of the first tasks of an apprentice scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Robinson, ''The Story of Writing'', London, 2007, new edition, p. 82, Thames and Hudson {{ISBN|978-0-500-28660-9}}, {{ISBN|0-500-28660-4}} and Walter J. Ong, ''Orality and Literacy'', London and New York, 2002, p. 91, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Ong,_Walter_J_-_Orality_and_Literacy,_2nd_ed.pdf ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922232128/http://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Ong%2C_Walter_J_-_Orality_and_Literacy%2C_2nd_ed.pdf |date=2013-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kothar were indirectly associated with the art of writing. Although Kothar was not a patron of scribes, it is very important that [[Nabu]] [grandchild of Babylonian god [[Ea (god)]]] was known as a patron of the scribes, because some scholars think that Ea is a prototype of Kothar. According to another opinion, Kothar's prototype is Egyptian god [[Ptah]]. Ptah's son [[Imhotep]] was known as a patron of the scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 230-5&lt;/ref&gt; It points that the divine craftsmen and blacksmiths who were also gods of good speech or wise words in mythology, have been transformed to lords of the writing in time. It can be seen in some mythologies that the lord of eloquence is inventor of the writing, too. For example, Irish god [[Ogma]] was the lord of eloquence, poetry, and rhetoric. But he had a truly remarkable skill as a poet and he invented the earliest system of writing used in Ireland: [[Ogham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rjohnso/ancientirish.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rhetoric of Myth, Magic, and Conversion: Ancient Irish Rhetoric |website=Web.ics.purdue.edu |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another one, Sigurd who was one of the most famous mythological German heroes, had learned the skill of the rune writing by the smith Regin.&lt;ref&gt;C. Scott Littleton, ''Gods, Goddesses and Mythology'', Vol. 10, China, 2005, p. 1300, Marschall Cavendish, {{ISBN|0-7614-7569-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The another characteristic continuity between Kothar and Khidr is their soft and skilled hands. In Ugaritic texts, Kothar is mentioned as a skilled hand (''hrsh yd'').&lt;ref&gt;J.C.L. Gibson, ''Canaanite Myhts and Legends'', second edition, London, 2004, T&amp;T Clark International, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, most blacksmiths in mythology were described with such attributions. One of the epithets of the Greek blacksmith Hephaistos, which was used less frequently, was "''skilled with both hands''" or "''all-skilled hands''".&lt;ref&gt;S. Morris, 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; There are many linguistic remainders which show a symbolic connection between the smithy, skillfulness and hand. For example, in the Ethiopian language, '''äğāma''' or '''äğamma '''means blacksmith, skillful and it comes from '''äğ '''which means hand. In Ethiopian language, '''äğä wāxe''' and '''äğä wārq''' means also blacksmith, but literally of good or golden hand.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf Leslau, ''Etymological Dictionary of Gurage (Ethiopic)'', Vol. I, Wiesbaden, Otto Harrassowitz, p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Igbo language]] the word for arts and craft is '''nka '''which derives from another Igbo word '''aka '''and aka means hand.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Okoh, ''Fostering Christian Faith in Schools and Christian Communities through Igbo Traditional Values. Towards a Holistic Approach to Christian Religious Education and Catechesis in Igboland (Nigeria)'', Bonn, 2012, p. 117 {{ISBN|978-3-643-90168-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context it is very important that Khidr can be recognize by his soft hands among the people. Because the people of Levant and Asia Minor believe that he has boneless hands. Some Sufis teach that we will all meet Khidr at least once in our lifetime, that you will recognize him when you shake hands with a white bearded man with no bone in his thumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesoundjournal.org/archives-2/february-2010-issue/al-khidr-the-green-and-artistic-spiritual-guide-excerpt/ |title=thesoundjournal.org |website=Thesoundjournal.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224025126/https://thesoundjournal.org/archives-2/february-2010-issue/al-khidr-the-green-and-artistic-spiritual-guide-excerpt/ |archivedate=2016-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually hand or soft hands metaphorically refers skillfulness, generosity and abundance. There is a term in Arabic for skilled men and women which derived from Arabic hand (''yad'').&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Taşdelen, Arap Deyim ve Atasözlerinde ‘El’ Motifi, ''Uludağ Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakultesi Dergisi'' 18, sayı 2, 2009, p. 212 (in Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucmaz.home.uludag.edu.tr/PDF/ilh/2009-18(2)/M10.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arap Deyim ve Atasözlerinde ‘El’ Motifi |author=Hasan Taúdelen |website=Ucmaz.home.uludag.edu |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Arabic '''semahat '''used in Islamic mysticism for to be generous and to be soft.

Like some blacksmiths and craftsmen, Kothar indirectly, Khidr is directly associated with immortality. In mythology blacksmiths and craftsmen have secret power to get immortality and the healing powers were often attributed to them.&lt;ref&gt;Littleton 2005, p. 1426&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries the smith is seen as a medicine man. Vedic craftsman [[Tvastar]] is the former of the bodies of men and animals and invoked when desiring offspring, called '''garbha-pati''' or ''the lord of the womb''. He is also the guardian of [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] that conveys the experience of immortality, is a healer and gives absolution. He made of the goblet for Soma drink.&lt;ref&gt;About ''Soma'' or ''Haoma'', see David Stophlet Flattery and Martin Schwartz, ''Haoma and Harmaline: The Botanical Identity of the Indo-Iranian SacredHallucinogen "Soma" and its Legacy in Religion, Language, and Middle Eastern Folklore'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebookdb.org/reading/2CGC3BG81E6D34GD23342869/Haoma-And-Harmaline--The-Botanical-Identity-Of-The-Indo-Iranian-Sacred-Hallucino |title=Read Online: Haoma And Harmaline : The Botanical Identity Of The Indo-Iranian Sacred Hallucinogen "soma" And Its Legacy In Religion, Language, And Middle-Eastern Folklore -eBookDB-Download &amp; Read Free eBooks |website=Ebookdb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Welsh beliefs Govannon ([[Gofannon]]) yeasted a kind of immortality beer. In Yakut mythology '''K'daai Maksin''' ([[Kıdaai]]) is the divine blacksmith and he repairs the broken or amputated limbs of heroes. According to another Yakut belief their ancestor Elliei was the first blacksmith and he has been seen as a healer. Because they believe that smiths have the power to cure by natural means without the assistance of spirits, as do the Shamans. According to an Acanti myth a blacksmith sent by the God to Earth to make a dozen men and animals. Mircea Eliade shows in his work ''[[The Forge and the Crucible]]: The Origins and Structure of Alchemy'' that the divine blacksmith of mythology makes elixir of immortality as an alchemist. In Irish mythology, [[Cú Chulainn]] (''Culain'') made a new dog for himself after his savior dog was dead. Mcleish thinks that Ugaritic craftsman Kothar has also same feature. Khidr is described as a holding a cup/goblet in some Alevi divine songs. The cup or goblet symbolize the immortality. On the other hand, the [[Nusayris]] of Antakya (''Turkey'') believe that Khidr can operate men like a surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 240-5; Eliade 1978 and Kenneth Macleish, ''Myth: Myths and Legends of the World Explored'', London, 1996, p. 570, Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-3237-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some Islamic epic romances he repairs the broken limbs of warriors. It's told in ''Danishmendname'' that Khidr has repaired the broken hand of Artuhi who was a friend of Melik [[Danishmend Gazi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Yaşar Ocak, ''İslam-Türk Inançlarında Hızır yahut Hızır-İlyas Kültü'', İstanbul, 2012, p. 199-200 {{ISBN|978-605-5272-05-0}} (in Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt; He heals also mental illness. For example, the shrine of [[Beit Jala]] (near Bethlehem) is associated with Khidr by Muslims who believe it's miraculous cures of mental illness. Even more importantly Khidr known everywhere as an immortal figure, from Balkans to India.

== Hıdırellez and Khidr ==
A new hypothesis about the cultural origins of the figure of Khidr points to another common element relating to a religious tradition in Near East, the traditional celebration of [[Hıdırellez]].&lt;ref name="Gürdal Aksoy 2006, p. 215-93" /&gt; Like Alevis, people make flour of roasted wheat on the day before the festival for Khidr. They keep it somewhere in the kitchen to see later for Khidr's traces. Next day in the morning if they see some signs on the flour, it means that Khidr came there to bring abundance and blessing for them. Later they bake some kind of cake which is called ''Qāvut'', ''Kavut'', ''Köme'' or ''Göme''.&lt;ref name="ḴEŻR – Encyclopaedia Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 288-292; for ''qāvut'', see Anna Krasnowolska, ''ḴEZR'', Encyclopædia Iranica, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it takes different names among variously ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;"''qavut: 'toasted grain enriched with fat and sweetened''". Alan Davidson/editor, ''Food in Motion: The Migration of Foodstuffs and Cookery Techniques'', Proceedings, Oxford Symposium 1983, Volume 1, Oxford Univ. Press, 1983, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition for Khidr originated from the mythico-rituals of Ancient Near Eastern dying gods like [[Osiris]], Adonis (also [[Dionysos]], Melqart and [[Mithra]]) and the process which shows the transformation of the grain to flour symbolizes cremation (''death'') of the god.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy 2006, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's opinion about Adonis and Osiris rites indirectly clarifies this ritualistic acts. He writes: "The women bewail him (Adonis), because his lord slew him so cruelly, ground his bones in a mill, and then scattered them to the wind. The women (during this festival) eat nothing which has been ground in a mill, but limit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet vetches, dates, raisins, and the like".&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion, Part IV, Adonis Attis Osiris'', third edition, The Macmillan Co. p. 189-91.&lt;/ref&gt; It is actually associated with shamanistic initiations and also with smith's world. Eliade completes this analogy in his important work ''The Forge and the Crucible'': "''The identification of shamanism with the art of smith likewise appears in the ceremonial spectacles of certain shamanic initiations. In their dreams or initiatory hallucinations the future shamans watch themselves being torn to pieces by the 'demon'-masters of the initiation. Now these traditional spectacles entail, directly or otherwise, gestures, tools and symbols belonging to the sphere of the smith''..."&lt;ref&gt;for more information, see Eliade 1978, p. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Serbian tradition the blacksmith gives the water mill to people.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Ristic, 'Blacksmith as Magus', ''The Crocked Path, A Journal of the Nameless Art'', Issue 1, No. 1, Spring 2008, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This symbolic and cultural association between the smith and mill is remarkable for the continuity between Kothar and Khidr.

== Khidr in astrology ==
Astrologically, the planet Mercury represents the principals of communication, intelligence and elegance. Therefore, Khidr refers directly to Mercury in astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Guttman- Kenneth Johnson, ''Mythic Astrology Applied: Personal Healing Through the Planets'', 2004, USA: Llewellyn Publications, p. 112; Gürdal Aksoy, ''Khidr and Dhu’l Qarnayn in Astral Mythology/Astral Mitolojide Hızır ve Zülkarneyn'', 2015, p. 1-59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10361791/Khidr_and_Dhu_l_Qarnayn_in_Astral_Mythology_Astral_Mitolojide_H%C4%B1z%C4%B1r_ve_Z%C3%BClkarneyn |title=Khidr and Dhu’l Qarnayn in Astral Mythology/Astral Mitolojide Hızır ve Zülkarneyn &amp;#124; Gürdal Aksoy |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a typical Mercurial character, like Kothar wa Hasis, Nabu, Hermes, Odin etc. Firstly, he is lord of wisdom, he has '''hikmah''' and also knows '''ilm al-ladunni''' (a kind of esoteric knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicencyclopedia.org/public/index/topicDetail/id/420 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104212131/http://islamicencyclopedia.org/public/index/topicDetail/id/420 |archivedate=2015-01-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; According to the Quran, he is more intelligent than Moses (18: 65-82).
In ancient Greece, [[Hermes]] was Mercurial type and he has capacity to explain ('''hermeneus''') the secret (sacred) doctrines. He inspires the poets as '''oneiropompos''' (the guide of dreams). Same function is familiar among the other Mercurial divinities. Like them, Khidr inspires the poets (for example [[Hafez]] Shirazi) and teaches dhikr to some Sufis.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad, Khwaja Shamsuddin (2005) ''The Rubaiyat of Hafiz'', New York: Cosimo, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Khidr who is different in folk religions than the Quran, moves very fast, like other Mercurial types; [[Nabu]], Hermes, [[Odin]] and even Zoroastrian ''yazata'' Sraosha. This feature is originated from the rhythm of the planet Mercury. Because Mercury is known with his swiftness. In mythology, Mercury is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. It symbolizes the conjunction between the material and spiritual world. Therefore, Mercurial gods are [[psychopomp]], like Hermes. They bring some messages also in dreams. The position of Khidr is same in the folk beliefs. For example, according two different stories from Dersim Alevis, he introduces to dream of hero and says to the person what he must do.&lt;ref name="Aksoy 2015, p. 1-59"&gt;Aksoy 2015, p. 1-59&lt;/ref&gt;
Mercurial type of mythology is regarded as guide of travelers and the souls, like Hermes. Khidr is also known as a guide ([[murshid]]) among the Sufis and he saves the travelers in danger. Like Hermes, Khidr is mostly described with his staff. In some cultures, the people believes that his staff can sometimes turn to a snake, specially during the ritual. [[Caduceus]] is Hermes's staff and it's always described with two snakes. They are symbols of the healthy and the medicine.&lt;ref name="Aksoy, 2015, p. 1-59"&gt;Aksoy, 2015, p. 1-59&lt;/ref&gt;
Mercurial gods fight to dragons or evil spirits. They use their staff as a weapon. In some religious contexts, Khidr fights also to dragons or helps some Sufis for their struggle with the dragons.
The most of the gods which symbolize Mercury, are not only lords of the sacred or magic words, they are also related with the writing. This feature corresponds to the belief of Islamic calligraphers that Khidr is their patron. Khidr brings luck to the people, like Hermes as Mercurial.&lt;ref name="Aksoy, 2015, p. 1-59" /&gt;

The story of Quran over Moses and Khidr has some astrological representations. The fish which has been lost on a rock is symbol of the [[Pisces (astrology)]]. Pisces which twelfth sign of zodiac is described with two fish. One of them symbolizes the mortality and the other one, the immortality. Therefore, Pisces is not only the heavenly sign of dead, it is also the sign of resurrection. Thus it refers to the place of immortal Khidr. Besides Mercury is the ruler of third and twelfth house in astrology. Twelfth house is disappearance region and it can be its mythological echo's in the myths of twelve (''gayb'') imam of Shiites and the twelve (''lost'') tribe of Jews.&lt;ref name="Aksoy 2015, p. 1-59" /&gt;
The story of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] in the Quran refers also astral beings and movements. In this point, Solomon Gadz as a follower of R.N. Nicholson suggested in his article ‘''The Zodiacal Light in Semitic Mythology''’ (1943) that Dhul’ Qarnayn is personification of the [[zodiacal light]] and he is no one than the old Semitic deity Athtar.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Gandz, ‘The Zodiacal Light in Semitic Mythology’, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 13, 1943, p. 1-39 {{jstor|3622289}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the some scholars, the myths of [[Heracles]] and Gilgamesh is astral model of the story of Dhul Qarnayn and there are some common elements between these myths and Quranic story; like two mountain and darkness land (''Zulumat'').&lt;ref name="Aksoy 2015, p. 1-59" /&gt;

== Comparative mythology ==

[[File:Nizami Ganjavi - Alexander the Great and the Prophet Khidr (Khizr) in Front of the Fountain of Life - Walters W610320A - Full Page.jpg|thumb|al-Khiḍr and Alexander the Great in front of the Fountain of Life]]
There are several versions of the [[Alexander romance]] in which al-Khiḍr figures as a servant of [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]]. in one version, al-Khiḍr and Alexander — identified with Dhul-Qarnayn — cross the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. Dhul-Qarnayn gets lost looking for the spring but al-Khiḍr finds it and gains eternal life. In the ''Iskandarnamah'' by an anonymous author, al-Khiḍr is asked by Dhul-Qarnayn to lead him and his armies to the Water of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Iskandarnamah|year=1978|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khiḍr agrees, and eventually stumbles upon the Water of Life on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Iskandarnamah|year=1978|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars suggest that al-Khiḍr is also represented in the Arthurian tale [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] as the [[Green Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasater, Alice E. (1974). ''Spain to England: A Comparative Study of Arabic, European, and English Literature of the Middle Ages.'' University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, the Green Knight tempts the faith of Sir Gawain three times. The character of al-Khiḍr may have come into European literature through the mixing of cultures during the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Hadhrat al-Hajj Mirza Bashirudeen Mahmood -Khalifatul Masih II. ''Tafsir e Kabir'' iv. (10 Volumes.  Rabwah, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the story derives from an [[Irish mythology|Irish myth]] which predates the Crusades in which [[Cú Chulainn]] and two other heroes compete for the [[curadmír]], the select portion given to champions, at feasts; ultimately, Cú Chulainn is the only one willing to let a giant — actually a king who has magically disguised himself — cut off his head, as per their agreement.

The story is also similar to one told by Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob]] in the eleventh century of a journey made by Elijah and Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nissim ben Jacob ibn Shahin]], ''Sefer Ma'asiyyot ha-Hakhamim wehu Ḥibbur Yafeh meha-Yeshu'ah'', (Judeo-Arabic, 11th century);&lt;br /&gt; modern translation by William M. Brinner as ''An Elegant Composition concerning Relief after Adversity'': Yale 1977 (Yale Judaica Series vol 20), {{ISBN|978-0-300-01952-0}}; pbk 1996, {{ISBN|1-56821-984-9}}&lt;br /&gt; extracted in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/pol/pol47.htm Polano, H. (1876). ''The Talmud: Selections.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Wheeler, [https://archive.is/20120710064930/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_n2_v118/ai_n28711540/ The Jewish origins of Qur An 18:65-82? Reexamining Arent Jan Wensick's theory], ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', '''118''', 153–171, April–June 1998 (via findarticles.com)&lt;/ref&gt; The first house where they stay the night belongs to a pious old couple who give the prophet and the rabbi the best of their food and beds. However, the couple's cow dies in the night. Elijah later explains that the Angel of Death came and he persuaded the angel to take the cow instead of the wife. The next house, as in the al-Khiḍr story, is that of a rich miser, and Elijah repairs his wall so that he will not, in having it repaired, find the treasure hidden under it.

A third potential parallel to the legend surrounding al-Khiḍr is the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].&lt;ref name="al-Khadir al-Khidr"&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Khadir (al-Khidr)|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-khadir-al-khidr-COM_0483?s.num=4&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode in question takes place after the death of king [[Gilgamesh]]'s closest friend [[Enkidu]]. Gilgamesh goes on a journey to find his ancestor [[Utnapishtim]], a wise figure who was granted immortal life and who lives at the mouth of rivers.&lt;ref name="al-Khadir al-Khidr" /&gt; Ultimately, although Gilgamesh finds Utnapishtim, he is not able to attain immortality. Although the parallel is not exact, the story shares several major themes with both Surah 18 in the Quran and the Alexander romance, namely, the presence of a wise figure in all three stories, and the quest and ultimate failure to attain immortality in the epic of Gilgamesh and the Alexander romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Khidar (al-Khidr)|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-khadir-al-khidr-COM_0483?s.num=4&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain parts of [[India]], al-Khiḍr is also known as ''[[Khawaja]] Khidr'', a river spirit of wells and streams.&lt;ref name="Longworth Dames"&gt;{{cite web|last=Longworth Dames|first=M.|title=Khwadja Khidr|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khwadja-khidr-SIM_4126?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in the Sikandar-nama as the saint who presides over the well of immortality, and is revered by both Hindus and Muslims.&lt;ref name="Longworth Dames" /&gt; He is sometimes pictured as an old man dressed in green, and is believed to ride upon a fish.&lt;ref name="Longworth Dames" /&gt; His principal shrine is on an island of the [[Indus River]] by [[Bhakkar]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Longworth Dames" /&gt;

In ''The Unreasoning Mask'' by famed science fiction writer [[Philip José Farmer]], while Ramstan, captain of the [[Buraq|al-Buraq]], a rare model spaceship capable of instantaneous travel between two points, attempts to stop an unidentified creature that is annihilating intelligent life on planets throughout the universe, he is haunted by repeating vision of meeting al-Khiḍr.

'''Mir Damad''' ({{lang-fa|ميرداماد}}) (d. 1631 or 1632), known also as '''Mir Mohammad Baqer Esterabadi''', or '''Asterabadi''', was an [[Iran]]ian [[Philosophy|philosopher]] in the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonizing]] [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic Peripatetic traditions]] of [[Avicenna]] and [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]], a scholar of the traditional Islamic sciences, and foremost figure (together with his student [[Mulla Sadra]]), of the cultural renaissance of [[Iran]] undertaken under the [[Safavid]] dynasty. As such he was the central founder of the [[School of Isfahan]], noted by his students and admirers as the Third Teacher (mu'alim al-thalith) after [[Aristotle]] and [[al-Farabi]].

==Philosophy==
His major contribution to [[Islamic philosophy]] was his novel formulation regarding gradations of time and the emanations of the separate categories of time as descending divine hypostases. He resolved the controversy of the createdness or uncreatedness of the world in time by proposing the notion of ''huduth-e-dahri'' (atemporal origination) as an explanation grounded in Avicennan and Suhrawardian categories, whilst transcending them. In brief, excepting God, he argued all things, including the earth and all heavenly bodies, share in both eternal and temporal origination. He influenced the revival of al-falsafa al-yamani ([[Philosophy of Yemen]]), a philosophy based on revelation and sayings of prophets rather than the [[rationalism]] of the [[Greek philosophy|Greeks]], and he is widely recognized as the founder of the School of Isfahan, which embraced a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] outlook known as ''hikmat-i ilahi'' (divine wisdom).

Mir Damad’s many treatises on Islamic philosophy include ''[[Taqwim al-Iman]]'' (''Calendars of Faith'', a treasure on creation and divine knowledge), the ''[[Kitab Qabasat al-Ilahiyah]]'' (''Book of the Divine Embers of Fiery Kindling''), wherein he lays out his concept of atemporal origination, ''[[Kitab al-Jadhawat]]'' and ''[[Sirat al-Mustaqim]]''. He also wrote poetry under the pseudonym of ''Ishraq'' (Illumination). He also wrote a couple of books on mathematics, but with secondary importance.

Among his many other students besides [[Mulla Sadra]] were Seyyed Ahmad-ibn-Reyn-al-A’bedin Alavi, Mohammad ibn Alireza ibn Agajanii, [[Qutb-al-Din Mohammad Ashkevari]] and [[Mulla Shams Gilani]].

Mir Damad's philosophical prose is often accounted as being among the most dense and obstrusely difficult of styles to understand, deliberately employing as well as coining convoluted philosophical terminology and neologisms that require systematic unpacking and detailed commentary.
He was called Mir Damad (Groom of the King) because he married [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]]'s daughter and hence his fame was based on that event.

==Architecture==
Mir Damad was also the architect of the Masjide Shah ([[Shah Mosque]]) in Isfahan which employed highly advance mathematical calculations which required the knowledge of the speed of sound at that time. The geometry of the dome is as such that all sound dissipated from the base will echo in hundreds of carefully calculated and masterly executed interior corners of the dome which will ultimately collide in the center of the dome. The geometrical analysis of the dome is of absolute sophistication and the design of the dome is a magnificent piece of art and furthermore the construction of such dome in the 17th century to a precision where all sound waves must travel and collide in an imaginary point above.

:''For the books and comic strips by [[Tove Jansson]], see [[Moomin]].''

{{Islam and iman}}

'''Mumin''' or '''Momin''' ({{lang-ar|مؤمن}} ''mū‘min''; feminine مؤمنة ''mū‘mina'') is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Islam]]ic term, frequently referenced in the [[Quran]], meaning "believer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Mu'min|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=371|work=QTafsir.com|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It denotes a person who has complete submission to the Will of [[Allah]] and has faith firmly established in his heart, i.e. a "faithful Muslim". Also, it is used as a name and one of the [[names of God in Islam]]. 

== In the Quran ==
The Quran states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;([[An-Nisa]] {{cite quran|4|136|s=ns|b=n}}) O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him), and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-136/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 136 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This verse addresses the believers, exhorting them to believe, implying multiple stages of belief.

== Difference between Muslim and Mu'min ==
The term Mu'min is the preferred term used in the Qur'an to describe monotheistic believers.

The following verse makes a distinction between a Muslim and a '''believer''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;([[Al-Hujurat]] {{cite quran|49|14|s=ns|b=n}}) ''The Arabs of the desert say, "We believe." (tu/'''min'''oo) Say thou: Ye believe not; but rather say, "We profess Islam;" (a'''slam'''na) for the faith ([[Iman (concept)|al-'''iman'''u]]) hath not yet found its way into your hearts. But if ye obey God and His Apostle, He will not allow you to lose any of your actions, for God is Forgiving, Merciful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-49/verse-14/ The Holy Qu'ran, Al-Hujurat 49:014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Memon people ==
In [[South Asia]], the [[Muslim]] converts from [[Lohana]] tribe adopted the name ''Mumin'' pronounced as Memon (or Momin) as their community name&lt;ref name="goolam"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goolam |first=Vahed  |year=2006 | title= 'Unhappily Torn by Dissensions and Litigations': Durban's 'Memon' Mosque, 1880-1930  |journal=Journal of Religion in Africa  |volume=36 |pages= 23–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The [[Memon people]], a collection of ethnic groups from the north western part of the [[South Asia]] are located in [[Sindh]] province in [[Pakistan]] and neighboring [[Gujarat]] state in [[India]].

'''National Public Lands Day''' is celebrated annually at public lands in the [[United States]] on the fourth Saturday of September.  A signature event of the [[National Environmental Education Foundation]], it promotes both popular enjoyment and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] conservation of [[public land]]s.

Three federal agencies and 700 volunteers launched the first National Public Lands Day in 1994.  By 2010, participation grew to 170,000 volunteers at over 2,000 sites across the country, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.&lt;ref name="National Public Lands Day Draws Record Numbers of Volunteers Coast-to-Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neefusa.org/npld|title=National Public Lands Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NEEFusa.org|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to National Public Lands Day being a fee-free day (free entry day) at many federally managed lands, volunteers who participate at federal land sites are rewarded with coupons for free entry into their favorite federal public land areas that have entrance fees.&lt;ref name="BLM20080821"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/res/national_public_lands.html| title=Helping Hands for America's Lands| publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]| date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2008-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event featured an initiative to plant one million trees in honor of the 75th anniversary of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].&lt;ref name="Civilian Conservation Corps"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| title=Civilian Conservation Corps| publisher=PublicLandsDay.org| accessdate=2011-07-12| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060340/http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| archivedate=2011-10-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was exceeded, with more than 1.6 million trees planted. The 2009 event featured a [[Preview screening|preview]] of ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]'', which began airing the next night on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations nationwide.  The preview was sent to each [[national park (US)|national park]] on [[DVD]] and aired in their [[visitor center]] [[auditorium]]s. Other National Public Lands Day events occurred on September 24, 2011 and  September 29, 2012.

'''Patrick Baert''' (born 23 January 1961 in [[Brussels]]) is a Belgian sociologist and social theorist, based in Britain. He is Professor of Social Theory at the [[University of Cambridge]] and Fellow of [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]].

Baert studied at the [[Free University of Brussels]] and at [[Oxford University]] where he obtained his D.Phil. in 1990. In Oxford he studied with [[Rom Harré]] and wrote his dissertation on [[George Herbert Mead]]'s notion of time and its relevance for [[social theory]], subsequently published as ''Time, Self and Social Being''.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out postdoctoral work with Claude Javeau in Brussels and [[Anthony Giddens]] in Cambridge before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge. He has held various visiting positions, including [[Brown University]], the [[University of Cape Town]], the [[CNRS]]/[[EHESS]] and the [[University of British Columbia]]. His most recent books include ''The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual'' and (co-written with Marcus Morgan) ''Conflict in the Academy; A Study in the Sociology of Intellectuals''.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2015); Morgan, Marcus and Patrick Baert (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He also published ''Social Theory in the Twentieth Century and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick and Filipe Carreira da Silva (2010). First edition: Baert, Patrick (1998), ''Social Theory in the Twentieth Century''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism''.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2013, he is the Editor-in-Chief of the [[International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society]].

Baert's recent work lies at the intersection between the sociology of intellectuals and [[intellectual history]]. ''The Existentialist Moment'' explains the sudden rise of [[Sartre]] as a public intellectual in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Baert describes the reshaping of the intellectual and cultural field in France during WWII and he shows how Sartre was able to present a neat vocabulary to make sense of and come to terms with the trauma of the war. Baert pays particular attention to the trials of French collaborationist intellectuals in which the notion of responsibility loomed large - a notion which also became central in the broader cultural realm at the time. During this period, Sartre redefined his philosophy, making it simpler and more digestable, centring it around this notion of responsibility of the intellectual. Hence his idea of the engaged intellectual which also became a guiding principle of the journal ''Les Temps modernes''.

Towards the end of ''The Existentialist Moment'' Baert also discusses the gradual decline of interest in Sartre and [[existentialism]] from the early 1960s onwards. With the rise and institutionalisation of the social sciences, expert public intellectuals gained in significance in comparison with authoritative public intellectuals. Authoritative public intellectuals like Sartre rely on their privileged parcours and elite training to speak with moral vigour about a wide range of social and political issues without necessarily having expertise in them. Expert public intellectuals draw on methodological training and expertise in the social sciences to intervene politically. In this context, the rise of [[structuralism]] in the late 1950s and 1950s is particularly significant. In contrast with existentialism (which was very much embedded in the humanities), structuralism was compatible with the emerging social sciences (and indeed with other theoretical currents such as Marxism and psychoanalysis).

The last chapter of ''The Existentialst Moment'' develops the theoretical framework - positioning theory - that underpins the book. This frame of reference also guides partly ''Conflict in the Academy'' although the latter also draws explicitly on insights from cultural sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Marcus and Patrick Baert(2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baert's earlier work deals with the [[philosophy of social sciences]]. He argues against several existing contributions to the philosophy of social sciences. Against those philosophies of social science that infer prescriptions for the social sciences based on attempts to demarcate science from [[non-science]], he argues that developments in the history and [[sociology of science]] have undermined the validity of the notion of [[Demarcation problem|demarcation]]. Contrary to those social scientists who liken their empirical research to an arbitration court that helps to decide the fate of the theory or research programme under consideration, he contends that research in the social sciences relies on theoretical presuppositions which are contestable – and contested – to such an extent that empirical research cannot be regarded as a straightforward testing device. In opposition to what he coins ‘the social cartography model’ (according to which high-quality social research captures the inner essence of the social world as accurately and completely as possible and social theory provides the conceptual building blocks for this representation), he argues that it is not fruitful to conceive of research in terms of the passive recording of the external world, and that this representational model ultimately leads to theoretical ossification.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2006, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baert argues in favour of a [[neo-pragmatist]] philosophy of social science which promotes social research in the pursuit of self-referential knowledge. Whereas many contributions to the [[philosophy of social science]] assume that social research is primarily an explanatory (and possibly predictive) endeavor, Baert contends that this picture does not correspond to the actual practice of social research. He points out that few significant contributions to sociology - and social research in general - are straightforward explanatory works, and even fewer are exclusively explanatory. Baert's position is that most of those groundbreaking works involve ‘self-referential knowledge’: they enable communities to re-describe and re-conceptualise themselves and their presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick and Filipe Carreira da Silva (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;285–305&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Rorty]]'s neo-pragmatism, he has argued in favour of the pursuit of self-referential knowledge, and he has analysed the methodological strategies that make this possible in various disciplines, ranging from [[archaeology]] and [[social anthropology]] to [[sociology]] and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;146–169&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Nietzsche]]'s genealogical history can provide contemporary communities with tools that enable them to re-evaluate the moral and cognitive categories they use to describe the world and their place within it. Baer's notion of self-referential knowledge relates to the German notion of [[Bildung]] or self-edification and with a new role for [[intellectual]]s, whereby they facilitate envisaging alternative socio-political scenarios rather than presenting a set of normative or epistmeological foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, Patrick (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;45–68&lt;/ref&gt;

A special issue of the journal ''Human Studies'' was dedicated to a symposium around Baert's ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism''.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Studies'' (2009) 32 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this issue Stephen Turner questioned Baert's attempt to promote dialogue whilst holding onto a notion of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Stephen (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue Paul Roth &lt;ref&gt;Roth, Paul (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Baert contradicts himself: whilst rightly rejecting the notion of a scientific method, Baert then surprisingly suggests a method for pursuing self-referential knowledge. Bohman &lt;ref&gt;Bohman, James (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; contends that Baert underestimates the ability of social scientists to develop generalisations which can lead to emancipatory political agendas. For a critical exchange between Baert and [[Peter Manicas]], see the ''Journal of Critical Realism'';&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Critical Realism'' (2008) 7 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst sympathetic to Dewey, Manicas disagrees with Baert's neo-pragmatism. For a critical exchange between Patrick Baert/Filipe Carreira da Silva and Simon Susen (in relation to Baert and Silva's 2010 book), see the journal ''Distinktion; Scandinavian Journal of Social Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinktion'' 2012 Online first.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst sympathetic, Susen laments, for instance, Baert and Carreira da Silva's anti-foundationalism.

'''Peace Revolution''' is an online [[Meditation#Indian religions|meditation]] platform aimed at young adults. The platform's primary focus is on the teaching of [[samatha]] meditation but is also involved in other activities and events related to mindfulness and peace-building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larepublica.pe/07-01-2014/conozca-al-unico-artista-peruano-que-gano-la-beca-peace-revolution-y-viajara-a-tailandia|title=Conozca al único artista peruano que ganó la beca Peace Revolution y viajará a Tailandia|last=Varela|first=Daniel Rodriguez|date=2014-01-07|work=[[La Republica]]|access-date=2017-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110721/http://larepublica.pe/07-01-2014/conozca-al-unico-artista-peruano-que-gano-la-beca-peace-revolution-y-viajara-a-tailandia|archive-date=2016-11-25|dead-url=no|language=es|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=สมาธิในงานศิลป์|trans-title=Meditation used in art|language=th|work=Bangkok Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Youth Leader Preaches Peace to Cameroonian Youth|last=Fofung|first=Amos|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Samantha|last2=Thangsurbkul|first2=Worakate|last3=Dhanissaro|first3=Phra J.P.|year=2013|title=Peace Revolution's Online Social Platform: From Inner Revolution to Global Evolution of Ethical Media Production|url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/jmle/vol3/iss2/3/|journal=The Journal of Media Literacy Education|access-date=2017-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507010455/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/jmle/vol3/iss2/3/|archive-date=2017-05-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the platform has a secular orientation, it does draw on principles of Buddhism. Buddhist monks from Thailand are often invited to lead meditation and mindfulness activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=http://imedia.bnt.bg/predavanyia/denyat-zapochva/ochakvajte-denyat-zapochva-8-april-2014?108379|script-title=Денят започва|trans-title=Tackling Stress|date=8 April 2014|series=The Day Begins|network=[[Bulgarian National Television]]|station=1|language=bg|access-date=1 April 2017|title={title}|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126001549/http://imedia.bnt.bg/predavanyia/denyat-zapochva/ochakvajte-denyat-zapochva-8-april-2014?108379|archivedate=2016-11-26|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite website|url=http://urbantales.bg/article/monah-pasura-zabravili-sme-da-chakame/|script-title=Монах Пасура: Забравили сме да чакаме|trans-title=We have forgotten to wait|first=|date=11 April 2015|website=UrbanTales.bg|access-date=1 April 2017|language=bg|title={title}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421100102/http://urbantales.bg/article/monah-pasura-zabravili-sme-da-chakame/|archive-date=2017-04-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea the platform is built on is that sustainable world peace can only be established by first achieving [[mindfulness]], or "inner peace", at the individual level; after which peace can be achieved at the community level and greater. This is expressed through Peace Revolution's slogan ''Peace In, Peace Out'' (PIPO).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2016/05/11/peace-revolution-promoviendo-la-paz-en-el-mundo|title=Peace Revolution: promoviendo la paz en el mundo|trans-title=Peace Revolution: Promoting Peace in the World|last=Riveria|first=Silvia|date=11 May 2016|work=[[La Prensa Grafica]]|access-date=1 April 2017|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125174447/http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2016/05/11/peace-revolution-promoviendo-la-paz-en-el-mundo|archive-date=2016-11-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace Revolution offers a number of offline and online activities and programs to facilitate this goal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
Peace Revolution was established in 2008 by the World Peace Initiative Foundation (WPI), a non-profit organization which operates mainly from Thailand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpifoundation.org/|title=World Peace is Possible|publisher=World Peace Initiative|access-date=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419063819/http://www.wpifoundation.org/|archive-date=2017-04-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial idea for the creation of the website was that with current developments in modern education, the focus on mental well-being had become less important. With a growing availability of Internet connections throughout the world, meditation could be easily introduced in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=La gente joven se alejado de la meditación|last=Fernandez|first=Maria|date=2014|work=El Comercio|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y590n6AjNKI|series=New Day|script-title=يوم جديد - التأمل وأهميته الجسدية والنفسية مع أسيل نصار|trans-title=Meditation and its physical and psychological importance, with Aseel Nassar|language=Arabic|network=[[JRTV]]|via=Youm Jadded [account of host show]|date=8 March 2016|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform is known for introducing meditation as a secular hobby for people in regions where meditation is not widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/11/21/how-meditation-helping-middle-east-achieve-zen|title=How meditation is helping the Middle East achieve Zen|last=Noone|first=Yasmin|date=|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|access-date=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401145823/http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/11/21/how-meditation-helping-middle-east-achieve-zen|archive-date=2017-04-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=http://top-channel.tv/new/tv/tv.php?id=86456|series=Top Show Magazine|title=Murgj budiste per Tiranen|trans-title=Buddhist Monks at Tirana|network=[[Top Channel]]|number=4|date=16 December 2016|language=sq-AL|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Peace Initiative and Peace Revolution have partnerships with several  organizations internationally, including the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/youth/eu/news/43/37161_en|title=Join the Peace Revolution Summit 2017 in Thailand!|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cameroonpostline.com/do-state-security-chief-honoured-ahead-of-international-peace-day/|title=DO, State Security Chief Honoured Ahead Of International Peace Day|work=Cameroon Postline|last=Isadore|first=Abah|date=20 September 2016|access-date=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405044247/http://www.cameroonpostline.com/do-state-security-chief-honoured-ahead-of-international-peace-day/|archive-date=2017-04-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/chandigarh-at-youth-festival-delegates-talk-world-peace/|title=Chandigarh: At youth festival, delegates talk world peace|date=30 September 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|access-date=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125112032/http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/chandigarh-at-youth-festival-delegates-talk-world-peace/|archive-date=2016-11-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peacerevolution.net/index.php/docs/en/peace-partners|title=Peace Partners|website=peacerevolution.net|access-date=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401211136/https://peacerevolution.net/index.php/docs/en/peace-partners|archive-date=2017-04-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">A '''Pending Meal''' is one paid for at a restaurant or other food joint, to be made available to any future visitor who asks for it. The Pending Meal community [[initiative]] was started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including [[Sharjah]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan.

The Pending Meal movement encourages people to pay for someone else’s meal at a food outlet so the less fortunate can walk in and eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/your-say/your-view/pending-meal-pay-for-someone-else-s-food-1.1531685|title=Pending Meal: pay for someone else's food|first=Huda|last=Tabrez|date=8 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is not limited to [[United Arab Emirates]] only and the founder believes that wherever there is a hungry mouth, there is a Pending Meal to feed. The idea originated from the concept of [[suspended coffee]] practiced in some coffee shops in [[Naples]]. Customers would pay for their own coffee and when they wanted to, could pay for an extra ‘suspended coffee’ or a '[[suspended meal]]' which was meant for the less fortunate. Thus, a person who was hungry or thirsty could walk into the cafe and ask if there was a suspended coffee or suspended meal that they could drink or eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715055120/http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no limit to how much one can donate to the cause. “There have been people who have paid in advance for the meal of just one person and some have even paid for 15,” said Rizvi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/charity-begins-restaurants-043546130.html|title=Charity begins at restaurants|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pending Meal initiative is not a charity organization and does not collect funds (in any form). The initiative is purely encouraging people to give back to community by providing less fortunate with a meal so that no one has to stay hungry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20292">'''Protective autoimmunity''' is a condition in which cells of the [[adaptive immune system]] contribute to maintenance of the functional integrity of a tissue, or facilitate its repair following an insult. The term ‘protective autoimmunity’ was coined by Prof. [[Michal Schwartz]] of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] (Israel), whose pioneering studies were the first to demonstrate that autoimmune T lymphocytes can have a beneficial role in repair, following an injury to the central nervous system (CNS). Most of the studies on the phenomenon of protective autoimmunity were conducted in experimental settings of various CNS pathologies and thus reside within the scientific discipline of [[neuroimmunology]]. 

== Background ==

The adaptive immune system primarily consists of T and B cells ([[lymphocyte]]s), which can respond to specific [[antigen]]s and subsequently acquire an immunological memory. The activity of adaptive immunity is critically important for host defense against pathogens. Cells of the adaptive immunity that respond to self-antigens are termed ‘autoimmune cells’. [[Autoimmunity]], the activity of autoimmune cells, is generally considered in the context of an [[autoimmune disease]]—a pathological condition induced by an overwhelming activity of autoimmune cells. One of the hallmarks of immunity is the ability to transfer a substantial amount of lymphocytes or antibodies from one animal to another in a way that results in immunity to a certain pathogen (adaptive transfer). Similarly, autoimmune diseases can be induced experimentally by the adaptive transfer of autoimmune cells or antibodies from an animal that suffers from an autoimmune disease into a healthy animal. In a seminal study of 1999, Schwartz and colleagues demonstrated that the same autoimmune T cells that can cause an [[experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis]] (EAE, a common model for multiple sclerosis) can also be harnessed to protect injured CNS tissue from secondary degeneration following a traumatic insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moalem |first=G. |authorlink= |year=1999 |title=Autoimmune T cells protect neurons from secondary degeneration after central nervous system axotomy |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=49–55 |doi=10.1038/4734 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=9883839 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The experiment showed that after a partial crush injury of the [[optic nerve]], rats injected with activated T cells which are specific for [[myelin basic protein]] (MBP, a common protein in the CNS) retained 3-fold more retinal ganglion cells with functionally intact axons than did rats injected with activated T cells specific for other (control) antigens. These findings indicated that at least under certain circumstances, autoimmune activity could exert a beneficial effect by protecting injured neurons from the spread of damage. Additional work by the Schwartz group has shown that protective autoimmunity is a naturally occurring physiological phenomenon that takes place spontaneously following a CNS injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoles |first=E. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Protective autoimmunity is a physiological response to CNS trauma |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=3740–3748 |id= |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/11/3740 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=11356861 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutant mice which lack T cells (such as [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]] and nude), and mice that lack T cells that can recognize CNS antigens, exhibit reduced levels of neuronal survival following CNS injury relative to normal (wild type) mice. On the other hand, mice that were genetically engineered so that most of their T cells will recognize a CNS antigen—such as transgenic mice overexpressing a T cell receptor (TcR) for MBP—exhibit elevated rates of neuronal survival after CNS injury.

T cells that recognize CNS antigens have also been shown to be important for maintaining the functional integrity of the adult CNS under normal non-pathological conditions. Immune deficient mice and mice which lack T cells that recognize brain antigens exhibit impairments in spatial learning and memory, and have reduced levels of cell renewal in the [[hippocampus]] and sub-ventricular zone (the brain structures where [[neurogenesis]] takes place in the adult brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kipnis |first=J. |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=T cell deficiency leads to cognitive dysfunction: Implications for therapeutic vaccination for schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions |journal=PNAS |volume=101 |issue=21 |pages=8180–8185 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402268101 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=15141078 |pmc=419577 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ziv |first=Y. |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Immune cells contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=268–275 |doi=10.1038/nn1629 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16415867 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
An immune response that takes place following CNS injury elicits a cascade of molecular and cellular events that can eventually affect the organism’s functional recovery. Immediately after an injury to the CNS, there is a local innate immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanisch |first=U. K. |authorlink= |author2=Kettenmann, H.  |year=2007 |title=Microglia: active sensor and versatile effector cells in the normal and pathologic brain |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1387–1394 |doi=10.1038/nn1997 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=17965659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This response is mediated primarily by [[microglia]] cells, a population of CNS-resident immune cells, which can act as phagocytes, and [[antigen-presenting cell]]s. CD4+ [[T helper cell]]s that were specifically activated by antigens associated with the lesion, arrive at the site of injury and locally interact with microglia and other blood-derived antigen presenting cells (e.g. [[dendritic cell]]s). Local properties of antigen presenting cells (i.e. the levels of MHC-II-self antigen complexes and the type of co-stimulatory molecules) dictate the profile of the subsequent T cell response. The interaction between the T cells and the microglia/dendritic cells results in the production of a set of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s (such as interferon gamma) and chemokines (chemoatractant proteins) that, in turn, orchestrate the ensuing repair process in which many cell types participate. Microglia and myeloid cells recruited from the circulating blood restrict the spread of damage by buffering excessive levels of toxic self-compounds (such as the neurotransmitter [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]]), and by producing growth factors (such as [[insulin-like growth factor-1]]) that prevent neuronal death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butovsky |first=O. |authorlink= |year=2005 |title=Activation of microglia by aggregated beta-amyloid or lipopolysaccharide impairs MHC-II expression and renders them cytotoxic whereas IFN-gamma and IL-4 render them protective |journal=Mol Cell Neurosci |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=381–393 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/j.mcn.2005.03.005 |pmid=15890528 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and induce axonal re-growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rapalino |first=O. |authorlink= |year=1998 |title=Implantation of stimulated homologous macrophages results in partial recovery of paraplegic rats |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=814–821 |doi=10.1038/nm0798-814 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=9662373 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the chemokines produced at the site of injury attract endogenous [[stem cell|stem or progenitor cells]] that can further contribute to repair by providing a source for new neurons and glial cells, and by restricting the local immune response.

The mechanism by which protective autoimmunity maintains the brain’s functional integrity under non-injurious conditions is still not known. One model suggests that CNS-specific autoimmune T cells which constantly circulate through the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) interact with perivascular dendritic cells that reside at the [[choroid plexus]] and meninges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=M. |authorlink= |author2=Ziv, Y.  |year=2008 |title=Immunity to self and self-maintenance: a unified theory of brain pathologies |journal=Trends in Immunology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=211–219 |doi=10.1016/j.it.2008.01.003 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18328784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytokines and growth factors secreted into the CSF by the T cells and dendritic cells then diffuse into the neural parenchyma were they locally affect neurons, glial cells and stem cells.  This model infers that the level of antigen presentation (i.e. the amount of MHC-II-self antigen complexes) serves as an indicator of the level of immune activity required for maintenance of the uninjured brain.

==Regulation==
The outcome of autoimmune activity is determined by several factors, namely: the intensity, the location, and the duration of the autoimmune response. For an autoimmune response to be beneficial, its intensity, duration and site of activity must be tightly regulated. Although autoimmune T cells exist in all healthy individuals, a relatively small portion of the population develops autoimmune diseases. This is due to various mechanisms that constantly regulate the activity of autoimmune cells. One of the prominent autoimmune regulatory mechanisms is a sub-population of T cells called ‘[[regulatory T cell]]s’ (previously known as ‘suppressor T cells’), which restrict autoimmune activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shevach |first=E. M. |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=Regulatory T cells in autoimmunity |journal=Annual Review of Immunology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=423–449 |doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.18.1.423 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10837065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments in animal models of CNS injury have shown that depletion of regulatory T cells allows an enhanced neuroprotective autoimmune response to take place after the insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kipnis |first=J. |authorlink= |year=2002 |title=Neuroprotective autoimmunity: naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress the ability to withstand injury to the central nervous system |journal=PNAS |volume=99 |issue=24 |pages=15620–15625 |doi=10.1073/pnas.232565399 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=12429857 |pmc=137766 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, however, such an experimental manipulation can at the same time increase the susceptibility to development of an autoimmune disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McHugh |first=R. S. |authorlink= |author2=Shevach, E. M.  |year=2002 |title=Cutting edge: depletion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells is necessary, but not sufficient, for induction of organ-specific autoimmune disease |journal=Journal of Immunology |volume=168 |issue=12 |pages=5979–5983 |id= |url=http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/168/12/5979 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=12055202 |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.168.12.5979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain conditions, an initially protective autoimmune response can reach a tipping point, after which it will have a detrimental effect on the tissue, and might even develop into an autoimmune disease. Both genetic and environmental factors (such as infection) can underlie such a transition from a neuroprotective autoimmune response into an overwhelming and detrimental autoimmune disease.

Other cell types, such as B cells and even neural progenitor cells, can promote regulation of immune response in the CNS. Stem and progenitor cells are usually regarded with respect to their potential to serve as a source for newly differentiated cells, but recently stem and progenitor cells have also been acknowledged for their ability to modulate immune activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pluchino |first=S. |authorlink= |year=2005 |title=Neurosphere-derived multipotent precursors promote neuroprotection by an immunomodulatory mechanism |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7048 |pages=266–271 |doi=10.1038/nature03889 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16015332 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ziv |first=Y. |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Synergy between immune cells and adult neural stem/progenitor cells promotes functional recovery from spinal cord injury |journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=35 |pages=13174–13179 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0603747103 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16938843 |pmc=1559772 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have shown that injection of neural progenitor cells into the brain’s ventricles can modulate an immune response taking place at multiple inflammatory foci in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, or at a single site at the injured spinal cord.

==Therapeutic implications==
The concept of protective autoimmunity is relatively new, and it has been shadowed by the historic and yet dominant view of autoimmunity as a damaging factor. Skepticism towards protective autoimmunity has been further fueled by the general concept of the CNS as being an immune privileged site in which immune cell activity is observed only under pathological conditions. Nevertheless, studies during the last decade have established that the immune system has the capacity to orchestrate a multitude of beneficial effects in the adult CNS under both normal and pathological conditions.  Such effects range from the molecular level (growth factor production, buffering of toxic self compounds) through the cellular level (induction of axonal regrowth and neurogenesis) to the behavioral level (maintenance of spatial memory).  

Several approaches have been used experimentally in order to harness naturally occurring immune cell activity in CNS pathologies. Here are key examples:

1. Therapeutic [[vaccination]]: This approach utilizes a common immunological manipulation.  Inoculation of an antigen that is associated with the pathology, in this case the site of injury, evokes the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes which can specifically respond to the antigen used. For therapeutic purposes, vaccination with an antigen associated with the site of injury (for example peptides derived from myelin proteins)  is problematic, because it carries the risk of inducing, in individuals susceptible to autoimmune diseases, an overwhelming inflammatory response that is detrimental for recovery. To circumvent this problem researchers have been using lower affinity agonists (termed ‘altered peptide ligands’) which induce a weaker immune response. Experiments in animal models of spinal cord injury revealed that the use of such altered peptide ligands is effective in promoting functional recovery without the risk of inducing a deleterious autoimmune response.

2. Alteration of regulatory T cell activity:  Suppressing regulatory T cell activity following injury can allow a more robust autoimmune response to take place. For therapeutic purpose, the mere removal of regulatory T cells is, again, highly problematic because it increases the risk of inducing autoimmune diseases. Overcoming this limitation is possible using agents that transiently suppress regulatory T cell activity.  Such an agent has been used successfully in an animal model of ischemic stroke, where treated animals exhibited improved neurological recovery relative to non-treated animals.

'''Rune Slagstad''' (born 22 February 1945) is a Norwegian [[historian]], [[philosopher]], [[legal theorist]], professor and journal editor. In addition to professional work, he has since the late 1960s contributed actively to public debate on a variety of issues from Norway.

== Biography ==

Slagstad was editor of Pax Publishing (1971–1978) and the Norwegian University Press (1986–1989). He has held tenured professorships both at the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Norwegian Institute for Social Research]] and [[Oslo University College]] and headed [[The Research Council of Norway]] Program on Governance and Democracy ("LOS") (1990–1998).

He initiated and co-edited the [[encyclopedia]] ''[[PaxLeksikon]]'' (with i.a. [[Hans Fredrik Dahl]] and [[Jon Elster]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/paxlex/paxleksikon.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330061428/http://mediabase1.uib.no/paxlex/paxleksikon.html |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; co-edited  the leftist journal ''Kontrast'', and was editor-in-chief of the intellectual journal ''[[Nytt Norsk Tidsskrift]]''&lt;ref&gt; http://www.universitetsforlaget.no/?marketplaceId=200&amp;languageId=1&amp;siteNodeId=705238&lt;/ref&gt; from 1984 through 2009. Among his significant publications are the books ''Constitutionalism and democracy'' (co-edited with [[Jon Elster]]), ''De nasjonale strateger'' (”National strategists”),&lt;ref&gt;''De nasjonale strateger'' (1998) {{ISBN|82-530-2024-4}} (2. ed. 2001 {{ISBN|82-530-2336-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rettens ironi'' (”The Irony of Law”)&lt;ref&gt;''Rettens ironi'' (2001), {{ISBN|82-530-2337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sporten:&amp;nbsp;en idéhistorisk studie'' (”Sports”),&lt;ref&gt; ''(Sporten): en idéhistorisk studie'' (2008), {{ISBN|978-82-530-3095-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study of sports from a cultural historical point of view.

Slagstad has been a member of the [[Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature]] (1996-), the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] (2002-), and on the board of [[Morgenbladet]] (2003–2009) and The Danish-Norwegian Foundation (1998-). He was one of the founders of the Norwegian [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] (est. 1975), in which he through the 1970s also held several leading positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Rune_Slagstad/utdypning&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009-2013 Slagstad held a professorship at the Centre for the Study of Professions at [[Oslo University College]]. He is currently at [[The Institute for Social Research]] working on a study of Scandinavian social-democratic ''sittlichkeit''.

Slagstad was born and raised in [[Bergen]], but now lives in [[Oslo]] with his wife [[Anine Kierulf]]. He has three children.

He was in 2005 announced Norway’s leading [[intellectual]] by the daily newspaper [[Dagbladet]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/01/11/419957.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he received the [[Fritt Ord Honorary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fritt-ord.no/no/priser/category/fritt_ords_honnor/|title=Priser – Fritt Ords Honnør|publisher=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musician==
In 2006 he played flute in the church service for [[Jens Chr Hauge]]—a rendition of traditional [[folk tune]] "[[Jeg lagde mig saa sildig]]".&lt;ref name=n731&gt;Njølstad p.731&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vincenzo Gioberti''' ({{IPA-it|vinˈtʃɛntso dʒoˈbɛrti}}; 5 April 1801{{snd}}26 October 1852) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[clergyman]], [[philosopher]], [[publicist]] and politician.

==Biography==
Gioberti was born in [[Turin]], Italy. When still very young he lost his parents, and at the age of sixteen was admitted among the clerics of the court. He studied theology at the [[University of Turin]], and obtained his doctorate there.&lt;ref name = "Catholic"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06562b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Vincenzo Gioberti]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated by the fathers of the Oratory with a view to the priesthood and ordained in 1825. In 1828, he made a journey through Lombardy, and became friendly with [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref name = "Catholic"/&gt; Partly under the influence of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], the freedom of Italy became his ruling motive in life, its emancipation, not only from foreign masters, but from modes of thought alien to its genius, and detrimental to its European authority. This authority was in his mind connected with papal supremacy. Though in a way quite intellectual rather than political. This leitmotif informs nearly all his writings, and also his political position with respect to the ruling clerical party—the [[Jesuits]]—and the court of Piedmont after the accession of [[Charles Albert of Piedmont|Charles Albert]] in 1831.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gioberti, Vincenzo|volume=12|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gioberti was now noticed by the king and made one of his chaplains. His popularity and private influence, however, were reasons enough for the court party to mark him for exile; he was not one of them, and could not be depended on. Knowing this, he resigned his office in 1833, but was suddenly arrested on a charge of conspiracy, and after, an imprisonment of four months was banished without a trial. Gioberti first went to Paris, and a year later, to [[Brussels]] where he remained till 1845. In Brussels he taught philosophy and assisted a friend in the work of a private school. He nevertheless found time to write many works of philosophical importance, with special reference to his country and its position.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1841, on the appearance of his book "Del Buono", the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] offered him a chair at the [[University of Pisa]], but King Charles Albert objected, and the offer came to nothing. His fame in Italy dates from 1843 when he published his "Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani", which he dedicated to [[Silvio Pellico]]. Starting with the greatness of ancient Rome he traced history down through the splendors of the papacy, and recounting all that science and art owed to the genius of Italy, he declared that the Italian people were a model for all nations, and that their then insignificance was the result of their weakness politically, to remedy which he proposed a confederation of all the states of Italy with the pope as their head.&lt;ref name = "Catholic"/&gt;

An amnesty having been declared by Charles Albert in 1846, Gioberti (who was again in Paris) was at liberty to return to Italy, but refused to do so till the end of 1847. On his entrance into Turin on 29 April 1848 he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. He refused the dignity of senator offered him by Charles Albert, preferring to represent his native town in the Chamber of Deputies, of which he was soon elected president. At the close of the same year, a new ministry was formed, headed by Gioberti; but with the accession of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] in March 1849, his active life came to an end. For a short time indeed be held a seat in the cabinet, though without a portfolio; but an irreconcilable disagreement soon followed, and his removal from Turin was accomplished by his appointment on a mission to Paris, whence he never returned. There, refusing the pension which had been offered him and all ecclesiastical preferment, he lived frugally, and spent his days and nights as at Brussels in literary labour. He died suddenly, of [[apoplexy]], on 26 October 1852.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Works and Philosophy==
[[File:Gioberti - Del rinnovamento civile d'Italia, 1911 - 1832099.jpg |thumb|''Del rinnovamento civile d'Italia'', 1911]]
The following assessment is attributed to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]].

Gioberti's writings are more important than his political career. In the general history of European philosophy they stand apart. As the speculations of [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini-Serbati]], against which he wrote, have been called the last link added to medieval thought, so the system of Gioberti, known as [[Ontologism]], more especially in his greater and earlier works, is unrelated to other modern schools of thought. It shows a harmony with the Roman Catholic faith which caused [[Victor Cousin|Cousin]] to declare that Italian philosophy was still in the bonds of [[theology]], and that Gioberti was no philosopher.

Method is with him a synthetic, subjective and psychological instrument. He reconstructs, as he declares, ontology, and begins with the ideal formula, the "Ens" creates ''ex nihilo'' the existent. God is the only being (Ens); all other things are merely existences. God is the origin of all human knowledge (called lidea, thought), which is one and so to say identical with God himself. It is directly beheld (intuited) by reason, but in order to be of use it has to be reflected on, and this by means of language. A knowledge of being and existences (concrete, not abstract) and their mutual relations, is necessary as the beginning of philosophy.

Gioberti is in some respects a [[Plato]]nist. He identifies religion with civilization, and in his treatise ''Del primato morale e civile degli italiani'' arrives at the conclusion that the church is the axis on which the well-being of human life revolves. In it he affirms the idea of the supremacy of Italy, brought about by the restoration of the papacy as a moral dominion, founded on religion and public opinion. In his later works, the ''Rinnovamento'' and the ''Protologia'', he is thought by some to have shifted his ground under the influence of events.

His first work, written when he was thirty-seven, had a personal reason for its existence. A young fellow-exile and friend, Paolo Pallia, having many doubts and misgivings as to the reality of revelation and a future life, Gioberti at once set to work with ''La Teorica del sovrannaturale'', which was his first publication (1838). After this, philosophical treatises followed in rapid succession. The ''Teorica'' was followed by ''Introduzione allo studio della filosofia'' in three volumes (1839–1840). In this work he states his reasons for requiring a new method and new terminology. Here he brings out the doctrine that religion is the direct expression of the idea in this life, and is one with true civilization in history. [[Civilization]] is a conditioned mediate tendency to perfection, to which religion is the final completion if carried out; it is the end of the second cycle expressed by the second formula, the Ens redeems existences.

Essays (not published till 1846) on the lighter and more popular subjects, ''Del bello'' and ''Del buono'', followed the ''Introduzione''. ''Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani'' and the ''Prolegomeni'' to the same, and soon afterwards his triumphant exposure of the Jesuits, ''Il Gesuita moderno'', no doubt hastened the transfer of rule from clerical to civil hands. It was the popularity of these semi-political works, increased by other occasional political articles, and his ''Rinnovamento civile d'Italia'', that caused Gioberti to be welcomed with such enthusiasm on his return to his native country. All these works were perfectly orthodox, and aided in drawing the liberal clergy into the movement which has resulted since his time in the unification of Italy. The Jesuits, however, closed round the pope more firmly after his return to Rome, and in the end Gioberti's writings were placed on the Index. The remainder of his works, especially ''La Filosofia della Rivelazione'' and the ''Prolologia'', give his mature views on many points.

'''Viswamaanava''' is a [[Hindu]] cultural [[ideology]]. ''Viswa'' means [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] and ''maanava'' means [[human]].  This ideology is inherent in all Indian [[scripture]]s, [[culture]], and [[tradition]]s. It is extensively discussed and partially practised in [[Advaita Vedanta]] traditions.  Many great intellectuals lived by this principle and contributed to the welfare of the underprivileged sections of society.

In their view, western ideas such as [[industrialisation]] needed to be implemented throughout Russia to make it a more successful country. In Russian the term was known as ''zapadnichestvo'' (зáпадничество), which can be translated as "westernism", and its adherents were known as the ''zapadniki'', westernists in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9076673/Westernizer Westernizer - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some contexts of Russian history, ''zapadnichestvo'' can be contrasted with [[Slavophilia]]. Latter's proponents argued that the West should adopt Russian cultural values, rather than the other way around.

In modern usage, especially in the developing world, the term can refer to supporters of Western-style economic development.

Notable members included [[Vissarion Belinsky]] and [[Alexander Herzen]].

'''William Ford Gibson''' (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian [[speculative fiction]] writer and [[essayist]] widely credited with pioneering the [[science fiction]] subgenre known as [[cyberpunk]]. Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were [[noir fiction|noir]], near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, [[cybernetics]], and [[computer network]]s on humans—a "combination of [[low-life|lowlife]] and [[high tech]]"&lt;ref name=mao/&gt;—and helped to create an [[iconography]] for the [[information age]] before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schactman |first=Noah | website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=26 Years After Gibson, Pentagon Defines 'Cyberspace' |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html |date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson notably coined the term "[[cyberspace]]" in his short story "[[Burning Chrome]]" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984). These early works have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature.

After expanding on ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels to complete the [[dystopic]] [[Sprawl trilogy]], Gibson collaborated with [[Bruce Sterling]] on the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre [[steampunk]]. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the [[Bridge trilogy]] of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, [[postindustrial society]], and [[late capitalism]]. Following the turn of the century and the events of [[9/11]], Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly [[Literary realism|realist]] novels—''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007), and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, ''[[The Peripheral]]'' (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.

In 1999, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Gibson as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades," while the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' called him the "noir prophet" of cyberpunk.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 10 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians. His work has been cited as an influence across a variety of disciplines spanning academia, design, film, literature, music, [[cyberculture]], and technology.

=== Childhood, itinerance, and adolescence ===

The couple married and settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's teaching salary.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying [[English literature]], he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="crier"/&gt; It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, taught by [[Susan Wood (science fiction)|Susan Wood]], at the end of which he was encouraged to write his first short story, "[[Fragments of a Hologram Rose]]".&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt;

=== Early writing and the evolution of cyberpunk ===
After considering pursuing a master's degree on the topic of [[hard science fiction]] novels as [[Fascist (epithet)|fascist]] literature,&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt; Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records.&lt;ref name="calcutt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Calcutt | first = Andrew | title = Cult Fiction | publisher = Contemporary Books | location = Chicago | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8092-2506-4 |oclc = 42363052}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater.&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; Impatient at much of what he saw at a [[science fiction convention]] in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author [[John Shirley]].&lt;ref name="storming"&gt;{{cite book | last = McCaffery | first = Larry | title = Storming the Reality Studio: a casebook of cyberpunk and postmodern science fiction | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | location = [[Durham, North Carolina]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1168-3 | oclc = 23384573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.&lt;ref name="calcutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt;

And I began, then, to write.|salign=right|source=—William Gibson, "Since 1948"&lt;ref name="sourcecode"/&gt;}}

Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[Lewis Shiner]]; reading Gibson's work, they realized that it was, as Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward."&lt;ref name="nomaps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiner"/&gt; Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read "[[Burning Chrome]]"&amp;nbsp;– the first cyberspace short story&amp;nbsp;– to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling "completely got it".&lt;ref name="nomaps"/&gt;

In October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for [[ArmadilloCon]], at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called "Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF", where Shiner noted "the sense of a movement solidified".&lt;ref name="shiner"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Lewis |authorlink=Lewis Shiner |author2=George Edgar Slusser |author3=Tom Shippey  | title = Fiction 2000:Cyberpunk and the Future of Narrative | publisher = University of Georgia Press | location = Athens | year = 1992 | chapter=Inside the Movement: Past, Present and Future |isbn = 978-0-8203-1425-9 |oclc = 24953403}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that "a new axis has been formed."&lt;ref name="shiner"/&gt; Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with [[Rudy Rucker]], went on to form the core of the radical [[cyberpunk]] literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Literary career ==

=== Early short fiction ===
{{details|Burning Chrome (short story collection)}}
Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of [[cybernetics]] and [[cyberspace]] (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech [[shanty town]]s, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in ''Neuromancer''), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "Fragments of a Hologram Rose", in the Summer 1977 issue of ''[[Science fiction magazine#Defunct|Unearth]]''.&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection ''[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]]'', as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."&lt;ref name=mao&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |author2=[[Bruce Sterling]] | chapter= Introduction | title=Burning Chrome |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-053982-5 |oclc = 51342671|title-link=Burning Chrome (short story collection) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1981,&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; Gibson's stories appeared in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' and ''Universe 11'', wherein his fiction developed a bleak, ''[[film noir]]'' feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "[[The Gernsback Continuum]]"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor [[cult following|cult figure]], a sort of lesser [[J. G. Ballard|Ballard]]."&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt; When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled ... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs ... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp."&lt;ref name="nomaps"/&gt;

While [[Larry McCaffery]] has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has identified them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre.&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt; The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, [[the Sprawl]] setting of "[[Burning Chrome]]" and the character of [[Molly Millions]] from "[[Johnny Mnemonic]]" ultimately culminated in his first novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt;

=== ''Neuromancer'' ===
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.|salign=right|source=—opening sentence of ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984)}}

''Neuromancer'' was commissioned by [[Terry Carr]] for the second series of [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]], which was intended to exclusively feature [[debut novel]]s.

''Neuromancer'''s release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve,&lt;ref name="hollinger"/&gt; quickly becoming an underground [[word-of-mouth]] hit.&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt; It became the first winner of one science fiction "triple crown"&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt; —both [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Hugo Award]]s as the year's best novel and [[Philip K.

[[Lawrence Person]] in his "Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto" (1998) identified ''Neuromancer'' as "the archetypal cyberpunk work",&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Person |first=Lawrence |date=Winter–Spring 1998 |title=Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto |journal=Nova Express |volume=4 |issue=4 |url= http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/10/08/2123255 |accessdate= November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included it in its list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, opining that "[t]here is no way to overstate how radical [''Neuromancer''] was when it first appeared."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/neuromancer-1984-by-william-gibson/ |title=Neuromancer (1984) |accessdate=November 6, 2007 |last=Grossman |first=Lev |author2=Richard Lacayo |work=TIME Magazine All-Time 100 Novels |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Larry McCaffery]] described the concept of the matrix in ''Neuromancer'' as a place where "data dance with human consciousness ... human memory is literalized and mechanized ... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman."&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt; Gibson later commented on himself as an author, circa ''Neuromancer'', that "I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money," and referred to the novel as "an adolescent's book".&lt;ref name="nomaps"/&gt; The success of ''Neuromancer'' was to effect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt;

=== Sprawl trilogy, ''The Difference Engine'', and Bridge trilogy ===

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in ''Neuromancer'', his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically.&lt;ref name="spike"/&gt; Despite adding the final sentence of ''Neuromancer'', "He never saw Molly again", at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with ''[[Count Zero]]'' (1986), a character-focused work set in [[the Sprawl]] alluded to in its predecessor.&lt;ref name="sequel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_01_01_archive.asp#90158337 |title= (untitled weblog post) |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=January 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern [[space opera]], titled ''The Log of the Mustang Sally'', but reneged on the contract with [[Arbor House]] after a falling out over the [[dustjacket]] art of their hardcover of ''Count Zero''.&lt;ref name="mustang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2005_08_01_archive.asp#112417337358385397 |title=The Log of the Mustang Sally |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=August 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoning ''The Log of the Mustang Sally'', Gibson instead wrote ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery "turned off the lights" on cyberpunk literature.&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt; It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]] with shared characters, thereby completing the [[Sprawl trilogy]].

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]] novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with [[Bruce Sterling]]. Set in a technologically advanced [[Victorian era]] Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1991 and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent [[steampunk]] literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.&lt;ref name="steampunkt"&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | work = The Boston Globe | page = 3 | date = August 26, 2007 | accessdate = October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/07/steampunk-chiang-lake-macleod |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Steampunk: the future of the past |first=Damien G |last=Walter |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |publisher=Guardian Media Group | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson's second series, the "[[Bridge trilogy]]", is composed of ''[[Virtual Light]]'' (1993), a "darkly comic urban detective story",&lt;ref name="cyberhero"/&gt; ''[[Idoru]]'' (1996), and ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties (novel)|All Tomorrow's Parties]]'' (1999).

After ''All Tomorrow's Parties'', Gibson began to adopt a more [[realism (arts)|realist]] style of writing, with continuous narratives&amp;nbsp;– "speculative fiction of the very recent past."&lt;ref name="dueben"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://calitreview.com/2007/10/02/william-gibson-the-father-of-cyberpunk/ |title=An Interview With William Gibson The Father of Cyberpunk |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |last= Dueben|first= Alex |date=October 2, 2007 |website=California Literary Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction critic [[John Clute]] has interpreted this approach as Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible "in a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from", characterizing it as "SF for the new century".&lt;ref name="clute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue305/excess.html |title=The Case of the World |last=Clute |first=John |authorlink=John Clute |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |website=Excessive Candour |publisher=SciFi.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030090441/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue305/excess.html |archivedate = October 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's novels ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007) and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010) are set in the same contemporary universe — "more or less the same one we live in now"&lt;ref name="spook-country"&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2080922,00.asp |title=Q&amp;A: William Gibson |first=Angela |last=Chang |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |volume=26|issue=3| date=January 10, 2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; — and put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Books: Hardbacks|last = Hirst|first = Christopher|date = May 10, 2003|work = [[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the setting, the novels share some of the same characters, including [[Hubertus Bigend]] and Pamela Mainwaring, employees of the enigmatic marketing company Blue Ant.

When asked, on [[Twitter]], what this series of novels should be called ("The Bigend Trilogy? The Blue Ant Cycle? What?"), Gibson replied "I prefer 'books'. The Bigend books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=23:28 - 7 okt. 2010|url=https://twitter.com/greatdismal/status/26724447356|website=Twitter|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Blue Ant" rather than "Bigend" has become the standard signifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Ant Series|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/50543-blue-ant|website=Goodreads|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Ant Book Series|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CJ2XUKO/|website=Amazon|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date, Gibson stated that he did not name his trilogies, "I wait to see what people call them,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=19:26 - 30 dec. 2012|url=https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/status/285587655192887297|website=Twitter|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has in 2016 used "the Blue Ant books" in a tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=11:46 - 9 juli 2016|url=https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/status/751850008442380288|website=Twitter|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of [[annotation|annotating]] fansites, ''PR-Otaku'' and ''[[Node Magazine]]'', devoted to ''Pattern Recognition'' and ''Spook Country'' respectively.&lt;ref name="looking glass"/&gt; These websites tracked the references and story elements in the novels through online resources such as [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]] and collated the results, essentially creating [[hypertext]] versions of the books.&lt;ref name="now romancer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/08/11/william_gibson/index.html |title=Now Romancer |accessdate=October 30, 2007 |last=Lim |first=Dennis |date=August 11, 2007 |website=[[Salon.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501224918/http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/08/11/william_gibson/index.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] characterized this phenomenon as threatening "to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is conducted".&lt;ref name="node idea"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |authorlink=John Sutherland (author) |title=Node idea |url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2159309,00.html |work=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], with about 100 pages of ''Pattern Recognition'' written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, which had been suddenly rendered implausible; he called it "the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Lim |title=Think Different |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0307,lim2,41824,10.html |work=[[The Village Voice]] |publisher= [[Village Voice Media]] |date= February 18, 2003 |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the attacks as a nodal point in history, "an experience out of culture",&lt;ref name="nodal point"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/books/2003/02/13/gibson/index.html |title=Nodal point |accessdate=November 6, 2007 |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |date=February 13, 2003 |website=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116072741/http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/books/2003/02/13/gibson/index.html |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "in some ways ... the true beginning of the 21st century."&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html |title=A reality stranger than fiction |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |last=Bennie |first=Angela |date=September 7, 2007 |website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted as one of the first novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing.&lt;ref name="vancouver"/&gt; Examination of cultural changes in post-September 11 America, including a resurgent [[tribalism]] and the "[[infantilization]] of society",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetyee.ca/Books/2007/10/18/WillGibson/ |title=William Gibson Hates Futurists |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |website=TheTyee.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=actusf/&gt; became a prominent theme of Gibson's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/bc/bookclub/williamgibson2.html |title=William Gibson with Spook Country |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |work=Studio One Bookclub | publisher=CBC British Columbia| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013220206/http://www.cbc.ca/bc/bookclub/williamgibson2.html| archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his writing nevertheless remains "at the intersection of paranoia and technology".&lt;ref name="projo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/books/content/BOOK-GIBSON_09-16-07_376TE7P.53f53f.html |title=Gibson still scares up a spooky atmosphere |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |website=[[Providence Journal]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116112214/http://www.projo.com/books/content/BOOK-GIBSON_09-16-07_376TE7P.53f53f.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latest work===
William Gibson's most recent novel is titled ''[[The Peripheral]]''. He described the story briefly in an appearance he made at the New York Public Library on April 19, 2013, and read an excerpt from the first chapter of the book entitled "The Gone Haptics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fenlon |first=Wesley |url=http://www.tested.com/art/makers/455051-william-gibson-talks-sci-fi-and-his-next-novel-new-york-public-library/ |title=William Gibson Talks Sci-Fi and His Next Novel at New York Public Library |publisher=Tested |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place in two eras, one about thirty years into the future and the other further in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/watch-william-gibson-read-from-his-brand-new-science-fi-484885010 |title=Watch William Gibson read from his brand new science fiction novel |publisher=[[io9]] |date=April 29, 2013 |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Peripheral'' was released on October 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Sloan |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=William Gibson's 'The Peripheral' stars a plucky female gamer with 3D printing skills |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/william-gibsons-the-peripheral-stars-a-plucky-female-gamer-with-3d-printing-skills/2014/10/27/0dcf3eee-54b1-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html |date=October 27, 2014 |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its continuation, ''[[Agency (novel)|Agency]]'', is to be released on April 2, 2019, after being delayed from an initial announced release date of December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/530536/agency-by-william-gibson/9781101986936/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Gibson's comic/graphic novel ''[[Archangel (Gibson comic)|Archangel]]'' was published. Both ''Archangel'' and ''The Peripheral'' contain time travel (of sorts), but Gibson has clarified that the works are not related: "They're not "same universe". The Splitter and trans-continual virtuality are different mechanisms (different plot mechanisms too)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=To readers of both The Peripheral and Archangel|url=https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/status/930113645840707585|website=Twitter|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaborations, adaptations, and miscellanea ==
[[File:Bruce Sterling sn-ed.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bruce Sterling]], co-author with Gibson of the short story "[[Red Star, Winter Orbit]]" (1983) and the 1990 steampunk novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'']]

=== Literary collaborations ===
Three of the stories that later appeared in ''[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]]'' were written in collaboration with other authors: "[[The Belonging Kind]]" (1981) with [[John Shirley]], "[[Red Star, Winter Orbit]]" (1983) with Sterling,&lt;ref name="looking glass"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Garreau |title=Through the Looking Glass |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502582_pf.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Dogfight (short story)|Dogfight]]" (1985) with [[Michael Swanwick]]. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel ''City Come A-walkin{{'}}''&lt;ref name="ftccaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/gibson.html|title=Foreword to ''City Come a-walkin{{'}}''|date=March 31, 1996|accessdate=May 1, 2007|first=William|last=Gibson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626031709/http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/gibson.html|archive-date=June 26, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection ''Heatseeker'' (1989).&lt;ref name="locusmag"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.locusmag.com/index/s296.html |title = Stories, Listed by Author |accessdate = October 29, 2007 |last = Brown |first = Charles N. |authorlink = Charles N.

Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story "The Angel of Goliad" in 1990,&lt;ref name="locusmag"/&gt; which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate history story ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990). The two were later "invited to dream in public" (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 ("the [[Al Gore]] people"&lt;ref name="salza"/&gt;), in which they argued against the [[digital divide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/William_Gibson/sterling_gibson_nas.speeches |title = Speeches by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling at the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C |accessdate = October 29, 2007 |last = Sterling |first = Bruce |authorlink = Bruce Sterling |author2 = William Gibson |date = May 10, 1993 |publisher = The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081027165055/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/William_Gibson/sterling_gibson_nas.speeches |archivedate = October 27, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "appalled everyone" by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet.&lt;ref name="josefsson"/&gt; In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for "a second [[recursive science novel]] that was just a wonderful idea", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration because he was not creatively free at the time.&lt;ref name="dueben"/&gt;

In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s ''[[Technodon]]'' album,&lt;ref name="skier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/432896 |title=Yellow Magic Orchestra – Technodon |accessdate=January 10, 2008 |website=[[Discogs]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote lyrics to the track "Dog Star Girl" for Deborah Harry's ''[[Debravation]]''.&lt;ref name="debravation"&gt;{{cite news |first=Degen |last=Pener |title= EGOS &amp; IDS; Deborah Harry Is Low-Key – And Unblond |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DC1239F931A1575BC0A965958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/H/Harry,%20Debbie |work=The New York Times |date=August 22, 1993 |accessdate=November 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances ===
Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of ''Neuromancer'' on a beach at a [[Thailand|Thai]] resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |date=June 1992 |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.&lt;ref name="salza"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |title=William Gibson Interviewed by Giuseppe Salza|location=Cannes | date=May 1994 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/235 |accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of ''[[Alien 3]]'' (which he later characterized as "[[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovskian]]"), few elements of which survived in the final version.&lt;ref name="salza"/&gt;
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director [[Rashid Nugmanov]] after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician [[Viktor Tsoi]].&lt;ref name="victor tsoi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069
|title=Victor Tsoi |accessdate=December 3, 2007 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=March 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully odd project" which involved "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future [[Leningrad]]" and sent [[Jack Womack]] to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel ''[[Let's Put the Future Behind Us]]'' and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.&lt;ref name="victor tsoi"/&gt; A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt; a film they planned on shooting in the [[Walled City of Kowloon]] until the city was demolished in 1993.&lt;ref name="sogo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=July 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Neuromancer.jpg|thumb|left|Aside from his short stories and novels, Gibson has written several film screenplays and [[television episode]]s.]]
Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the [[Sprawl trilogy]] universe, have been loosely adapted as films: ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and [[Takeshi Kitano]], and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a [[CD-ROM]] interactive video game.&lt;ref name="mail&amp;guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/1996-09-03-blade-runner-on-electrosteroids |title=Blade Runner on electro-steroids |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |last=Walker |first=Martin |date=September 3, 1996 |website=[[Mail &amp; Guardian#The Mail &amp; Guardian Online|Mail &amp; Guardian Online]] |publisher= M&amp;G Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2013}}, [[Vincenzo Natali]] still hoped to bring ''Neuromancer'' to the screen, after some years in [[development hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39171 |title=Vincenzo Natali Still Hopeful For Neuromancer | date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |website=Empire | author=Williams, Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Count Zero]]'' was at one point being developed as ''The Zen Differential'' with director [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', has also been optioned and bought.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; An [[anime]] adaptation of ''[[Idoru]]'' was announced as in development in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cyberpunkreview.com/movie/upcoming-movies/william-gibsons-idoru-coming-to-anime |date= April 21, 2006 |title= William Gibson's Idoru Coming to Anime |publisher= cyberpunkreview.com |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070914195904/http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/movie/upcoming-movies/william-gibsons-idoru-coming-to-anime/ |archivedate= September 14, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Pattern Recognition'' was in the process of development by director [[Peter Weir]], although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.asp#2514436070772070825 |title=I've Forgotten More Neuromancer Film Deals Than You've Ever Heard Of |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced at [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story ''Dogfight'' by [[BAFTA]] award-winning writer and director [[Simon Pummell]]. Written by Gibson and [[Michael Swanwick]] and first published in [[Omni (magazine)|Omni]] in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer [[Janine Marmot]] at Hot Property Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/pummell-preps-william-gibson-adaptation/5082271.article |title=Simon Pummell preps William Gibson adaptation Dogfight |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |last=Macnab |first=Geoffrey |date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend [[Tom Maddox]], ''[[The X-Files]]'' episodes "[[Kill Switch (The X-Files)|Kill Switch]]" and "[[First Person Shooter (The X-Files)|First Person Shooter]]", broadcast in the U.S. on [[20th Century Fox Television]] in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref name="spike"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsbytes&gt;{{cite news |title="X-Files" Writer Fights For Online Privacy |last=Fridman |first=Sherman |date=February 24, 2000 |work=News Briefs |publisher=Newsbytes PM}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication ''Art of the X-Files''. Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries ''[[Wild Palms]]'' at the behest of creator [[Bruce Wagner]].&lt;ref name="holograms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115361118165031237 |title=Where The Holograms Go |first=William |last=Gibson |date=July 22, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Oliver Stone]] had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series,&lt;ref name="cyberhero"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Platt |title=Cyberhero |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/08/16/1993_08_16_024_TNY_CARDS_000364256 |work=The Talk of the Town |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=September 16, 1993 |page=24 |accessdate=November 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990223224043/http://multiweb.evolution.com/clients/mindvox/newyorker.html |archivedate=February 23, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, "Where The Holograms Go", to the ''Wild Palms Reader''.&lt;ref name="holograms"/&gt; He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside [[Douglas Coupland]] in the short film ''[[Mon Amour Mon Parapluie]]'' in which the pair played philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |title=Cast |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |website=Mon Amour Mon Parapluie |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040621004844/http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |archivedate = June 21, 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]''. The film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from ''Neuromancer'' by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]].&lt;ref name="nomaps"/&gt;

[[Last Studio Standing Inc.]], a Canadian-based animation studio, acquired the rights to "Hinterlands" in 2016 and announced that they will be creating both a theatrical short film and a television series. The studio, which specializes in adult and science fiction based animation, has the theatrical short slated for a 2018 release.

As of April 2018, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is developing a series based on Gibson's novel ''The Peripheral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/amazon-william-gibson/ |title=Amazon is developing a TV show based on William Gibson's 'The Peripheral'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art ===
[[File:La Fura Dels Baus Dreams In Flight.jpg|thumb|upright|Gibson has often collaborated with [[performance art]]ists such as theatre group [[La Fura dels Baus]], here performing at the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in May 2007.]]
Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of [[performance art]] pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' director [[Robert Longo]]&lt;ref name="remembering"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/gibson.html |title=Remembering Johnny |accessdate=January 10, 2008 |last=van Bakel |first=Rogier |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=June 1995 | issue=3.06}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes'', which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to "Memory Palace", a performance show featuring the theater group [[La Fura dels Baus]] at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by [[Karl Sims]], [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[Mark Pellington]] with music by [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.&lt;ref name="skier"/&gt; It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and "cyberprops" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of "Burning Chrome" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company [[Holy Body Tattoo]] and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.&lt;ref name="holybody"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200367789 |title=Holy Body Tattoo |last=Gibson |first=William |date=May 31, 2003 |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Gibson contributed to "Visionary San Francisco", an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] shown from June 14 to August 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polledri | first = Paolo | title = Visionary San Francisco | publisher = Prestal | location = Munich | year = 1990 |oclc=22115872 | isbn = 978-3-7913-1060-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a short story, "[[Skinner's Room]]", set in a decaying San Francisco in which the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] was closed and taken over by the homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the [[Bridge trilogy]]. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from "Skinner's Room".&lt;ref name=skier&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skierpage.com/gibson/biblio.htm |title= William Gibson Bibliography / Mediagraphy |accessdate= February 9, 2008 |author= S.

=== Cryptography ===
A particularly well-received work by Gibson was ''[[Agrippa (a book of the dead)]]'' (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5" [[floppy disk]] embedded in the back of an [[artist's book]] containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp |title=Introduction to Agrippa: A Book of the Dead |last=Gibson |first=William |year=1992 |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually "[[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]]"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the [[MindVox]] bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since its debut in 1992, the mystery of ''Agrippa'' remained hidden for 20 years. Although many had tried to hack the code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at "The Agrippa Files"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/ |title=The Agrippa Files |website=Agrippa.english.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They collaborated with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the [[Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities]] and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, in calling for the aid of cryptographers to figure out how the program works by creating "Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge",&lt;ref name=CAG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crackingagrippa.net/ |title=Cracking the Agrippa Code |website=Crackingagrippa.net |date=March 25, 1992 |accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enlisted participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Goodin | first = Dan | title = Solve 20-year-old mystery in William Gibson's "Agrippa"; win prizes | url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/william-gibsons-agrippa-mystery-challenge/ | publisher = Ars Technica | date = July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code was successfully cracked by Robert Xiao in late July 2012.&lt;ref name=CAG /&gt;

=== Essays and short-form nonfiction ===
Gibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and of [[op-ed]]s to ''[[The New York Times]]'', and has written for ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'', ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Details Magazine]]''. His first major piece of nonfiction, the article "[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]]" concerning the city-state of [[Singapore]], resulted in ''Wired'' being banned from the country and attracted a spirited critical response.&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite journal|title=Disneyland with the Death Penalty |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html |last=Gibson |first=William |issue=1.04 |date=September–October 1993 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&amp;&gt;{{cite news|title=Multimedia Animal Wired Visionary Nicholas Negroponte is MIT's Loud Voice of the Future |date=March 1, 1995 |first=David |last=Mehegan |work=[[Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290733867.html|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into his reaction to ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'', but abated in September of the same year owing to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative process.&lt;ref name="orlowski"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |title=William Gibson 'gives up blogging' |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/william_gibson_gives_up_blogging/ |work=Music and Media |publisher=The Register |date=April 25, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hacking the Gibson in Wagamamas.jpg|thumb|right|William Gibson in Bloomsbury, London in September 2007. His fiction is hailed by critics for its characterization of [[late capitalism]], [[postindustrial society]] and the portents of the [[information age]].]]

The novel won three major science fiction awards (the [[Nebula Award]], the [[Philip K.

=== Cultural significance ===
{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|William Gibson – the man who made us cool.|salign=right|source=—cyberpunk author [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard K Morgan]]&lt;ref name="morgan"/&gt;}}
In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' with effectively "renovating" science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely "insignificant",&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in [[science fiction studies]].&lt;ref name="hollinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hollinger |first=Veronica |date=July 1999 |title=Contemporary Trends in Science Fiction Criticism, 1980–1999 |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=78 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/78/hollinger78art.htm |accessdate= November 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature.&lt;ref name="mystic"&gt;Trench, Marianne and Peter von Brandenburg, producers. 1992. ''Cyberpunk. Mystic Fire Video'': Intercon Productions.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Neuromancer'' (1984) hit a cultural nerve,&lt;ref name="hollinger"/&gt; causing [[Larry McCaffery]] to credit Gibson with virtually launching the [[cyberpunk]] movement,&lt;ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/&gt; as "the one major writer who is original and gifted to make the whole movement seem original and gifted."&lt;ref name="storming"/&gt;{{Ref_label|G|VII|none}} Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and [[steampunk]] fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian [[Dwayne A. Day]] as some of the best examples of [[outer space|space-based]] science fiction (or "solar sci-fi"), and "probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking".&lt;ref&gt;

Gibson's early novels were, according to ''The Observer'', "seized upon by the emerging [[slacker]] and [[Hacker culture|hacker]] generation as a kind of road map".&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; 
Through his novels, such terms as ''[[cyberspace]]'', ''[[netsurfing]]'', ''[[Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics|ICE]]'', ''jacking in'', and ''[[neural implant]]s'' entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, virtual interaction and "the matrix".&lt;ref name="mcluhan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doherty |first=Michael E., Jr. |date=September 1995 |title=Marshall McLuhan Meets William Gibson in "Cyberspace" |journal=CMC Magazine |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/cmc/mag/1995/sep/doherty.html |accessdate= October 28, 2007 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Burning Chrome]]" (1982), he coined the term ''cyberspace'',{{Ref_label|E|V|none}} referring to the "mass consensual [[hallucination]]" of [[computer network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Poole]] claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web".&lt;ref name="nearing"/&gt; In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of ''Neuromancer'', fellow author [[Jack Womack]] suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of ''Neuromancer'' in 1984, asking "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, ''brought it about''?"&lt;ref name="neuromancer20th"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = William |author2=Jack Womack | title = Neuromancer | publisher = Ace Books | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-441-01203-9 |oclc = 55745255 |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Gibson's vision, generated by the monopolising appearance of the terminal image and presented in his creation of the cyberspace matrix, came to him when he saw teenagers playing in [[video arcade]]s.

In his [[Sprawl trilogy|Sprawl]] and [[Bridge trilogy|Bridge]] trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities.&lt;ref name="posturbanism"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dear |first=Michael |author2=Steven Flusty |date=March 1998 |title=Postmodern Urbanism |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=50–72 |doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all responses to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer [[Mark Pesce]], though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that "no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally affected the direction of the hacker community,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/pesce.html |title=Magic Mirror: The Novel as a Software Development Platform |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |last=Pesce |first=Mark |website=MIT Communications Forum |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; dismissed them as "adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment."&lt;ref name="pesce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/1998/06/13/feature947640934/ |title=3-D epiphany |accessdate=November 6, 2007 |last=Pesce |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Pesce |date=July 13, 1998 |publisher=[[Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'', the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet.

When an interviewer in 1988 asked about the [[Bulletin Board System]] jargon in his writing, Gibson answered "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote ''Neuromancer''"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community.

'''&lt;small&gt;VIII&lt;/small&gt;.''' {{Note_label|H|VIII|none}} Gibson wrote the following in the "Author's Afterword" of ''Mona Lisa Overdrive'', dated July 16, 1992.

''Neuromancer'' was written on a "clockwork typewriter," the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD &amp; Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the [[Macintosh SE/30]] I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black "crackle" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.

'''William Stanley Jevons''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|v|ən|z}};&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Jones, ''Everyman's English Pronouncing Dictionary'' (Dent, Dutton: 13th ed., 1967), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 September 1835 – 13 August 1882) was an English [[economist]] and [[logician]].

[[Irving Fisher]] described Jevons's book ''A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'' (1862) as the start of the mathematical method in economics.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Fisher, 1892. ''Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices'', Appendix III, "The Utility and History of Mathematical Method in Economics", p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMNGyKoJxv8C&amp;pg=PA109 109.]&lt;/ref&gt; It made the case that economics as a science concerned with [[quantities and prices|quantities]] is necessarily mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons, 1871.''The Principles of Political Economy'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, it expounded upon the "final" (marginal) [[utility theory]] of value. Jevons's work, along with similar discoveries made by [[Carl Menger]] in Vienna (1871) and by [[Léon Walras]] in Switzerland (1874), marked the opening of a new period in the history of economic thought. Jevons's contribution to the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics in the late 19th century established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time.

Jevons broke off his studies of the natural sciences in London in 1854 to work as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] in [[Sydney]], where he acquired an interest in [[political economy]]. Returning to the UK in 1859, he published ''General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'' in 1862, outlining the [[marginal utility theory]] of value, and ''A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold'' in 1863. For Jevons, the utility or value to a consumer of an additional unit of a product is inversely related to the number of units of that product he already owns, at least beyond some critical quantity.

Jevons received public recognition for his work on ''[[The Coal Question]]'' (1865), in which he called attention to the gradual exhaustion of Britain's [[coal]] supplies and also put forth the view that increases in energy production efficiency leads to more, not less, consumption.&lt;ref name=jm&gt;{{cite book |last=Martínez-Alier |first=Juan |authorlink=Joan Martinez Alier |date=1987 |title=Ecological Economics: Energy, Environment and Society. |location=Oxford |publisher=Basil Blackwell |isbn=0631171460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7f, 161f}} This view is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]], named after him. Due to this particular work, Jevons is regarded today as the first economist of some standing to develop an [[Ecological economics|'ecological' perspective on the economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|295f}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boulding |first=Kenneth E. |authorlink=Kenneth E.

The most important of his works on [[logic]] and [[scientific method]]s is his ''Principles of Science'' (1874),&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley, ''The Principles of Science: A Treatise on Logic and Scientific Method'', Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1874, 2nd ed. 1877, 3rd ed. 1879. Reprinted with a foreword by [[Ernst Nagel]], Dover Publications, New York, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The Theory of Political Economy'' (1871) and ''The State in Relation to Labour'' (1882). Among his inventions was the logic piano, a mechanical [[computer]].

==Background==
Jevons was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], England. His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant who wrote about legal and economic subjects as well. His mother [[Mary Anne Jevons]] was the daughter of [[William Roscoe]]. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to attend the [[University College School]]. Around this time, he seemed to have formed the belief that he was capable of important achievements as a thinker. Towards the end of 1853, after having spent two years at University College, where his favourite subjects were [[chemistry]] and [[botany]], he received an offer as [[Metallurgical assay|metallurgical assayer]] for the new mint in [[Australia]]. The idea of leaving the UK was distasteful, but pecuniary considerations had, in consequence of the failure of his father's firm in 1847, become of vital importance, and he accepted the post.

Jevons left the UK for [[Sydney]] in June 1854 to take up a role as an Assayer at the Mint. Jevons lived with his colleague and his wife first at Church Hill, then in Annangrove at Petersham and at Double Bay before returning to England. In letters to his family he described his life, took photographs and produced a social map of Sydney. Jevons returned to England via America five years later.&lt;ref&gt;William Stanley Jevons, Letters and Journal [1886] (viewed 3 Sep. 2016), http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2079#lf1357_head_007;Scan Journal,
http://scan.net.au/scan/journal/display.php?journal_id=62; WM Jevons Album, Rylands Collection, University of Manchester, http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk:8180/luna/servlet/s/2mh2g8&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned his appointment, and in the autumn of 1859 re-entered the [[University College London]] as a student. He was granted B.A. and M.A. degrees from the [[University of London]]. He now gave his principal attention to the [[moral science]]s, but his interest in natural science was by no means exhausted: throughout his life he continued to write occasional papers on scientific subjects, and his knowledge of the physical sciences greatly contributed to the success of his chief logical work, ''The Principles of Science''. Not long after taking his M.A. degree, Jevons obtained a post as tutor at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]], [[Manchester]].

In 1866, he was elected professor of logic and mental and moral philosophy and Cobden professor of political economy at Owens College. 

==Theory of utility==
[[File:William Stanley Jevons.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of W. Stanley Jevons at 42, by G. F. Stodart]]
Jevons arrived quite early in his career at the doctrines that constituted his most characteristic and original contributions to economics and logic. The theory of utility, which became the keynote of his general theory of political economy, was practically formulated in a letter written in 1860; and the germ of his logical principles of the substitution of similars may be found in the view which he propounded in another letter written in 1861, that "philosophy would be found to consist solely in pointing out the likeness of things." The theory of [[utility]] above referred to, namely, that the degree of utility of a commodity is some continuous mathematical function of the quantity of the commodity available, together with the implied doctrine that economics is essentially a mathematical science, took more definite form in a paper on "A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy", written for the British Association in 1862. This paper does not appear to have attracted much attention either in 1862 or on its publication four years later in the ''Journal of the Statistical Society''; and it was not till 1871, when the ''Theory of Political Economy'' appeared, that Jevons set forth his doctrines in a fully developed form.

It was not until after the publication of this work that Jevons became acquainted with the applications of mathematics to political economy made by earlier writers, notably [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|H.H. Gossen]]. The theory of utility was at about 1870 being independently developed on somewhat similar lines by [[Carl Menger]] in [[Austrian School|Austria]] and [[Léon Walras]] in [[Lausanne School|Switzerland]]. As regards the discovery of the connection between value in exchange and final (or marginal) utility, the priority belongs to Gossen, but this in no way detracts from the great importance of the service which Jevons rendered to British economics by his fresh discovery of the principle, and by the way in which he ultimately forced it into notice. In his reaction from the prevailing view he sometimes expressed himself without due qualification: the declaration, for instance, made at the commencement of the ''Theory of Political Economy'', that value depends entirely upon utility, lent itself to misinterpretation. But a certain exaggeration of emphasis may be pardoned in a writer seeking to attract the attention of an indifferent public. The [[Neoclassical Revolution]], which would reshape economics, had been started.

Jevons did not explicitly distinguish between the concepts of ordinal and cardinal utility. [[Cardinal utility]] allows the relative magnitude of utilities to be discussed, while [[ordinal utility]] only implies that goods can be compared and ranked according to which good provided the most utility. Although Jevons predated the debate about ordinality or cardinality of utility, his mathematics required the use of cardinal utility functions. For example, in ''"The Theory of Political Economy"'', Chapter II, the subsection on "Theory of Dimensions of Economic Quantities", Jevons makes the statement that "In the first place, pleasure and pain must be regarded as measured upon the same scale, and as having, therefore, the same dimensions, being quantities of the same kind, which can be added and subtracted...." Speaking of measurement, addition and subtraction requires cardinality, as does Jevons's heavy use of integral calculus. Note that cardinality does not imply direct measurability, in which Jevons did not believe.

==Practical economics==
[[File:Jevons - Principles of economics, 1905 - 5157364.tif|thumb|''Principles of economics'', 1905]]
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Jevons published in the ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]'' in 1877]]
It was not, however, as a theorist dealing with the fundamental data of economic science, but as a writer on practical economic questions, that Jevons first received general recognition. ''A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold'' (1863) and ''[[The Coal Question]]'' (1865) placed him in the front rank as a writer on applied economics and statistics; and he would be remembered as one of the leading economists of the 19th century even had his ''Theory of Political Economy'' never been written. His economic works include ''Money and the Mechanism of Exchange'' (1875) written in a popular style, and descriptive rather than theoretical; a ''Primer on Political Economy'' (1878); ''The State in Relation to Labour'' (1882), and two works published after his death, ''Methods of Social Reform" and "Investigations in Currency and Finance'', containing papers that had appeared separately during his lifetime. The last-named volume contains Jevons's speculations on the connection between commercial crises and sunspots. He was engaged at the time of his death upon the preparation of a large treatise on economics and had drawn up a table of contents and completed some chapters and parts of chapters. This fragment was published in 1905 under the title of ''The Principles of Economics: a fragment of a treatise on the industrial mechanism of society, and other papers''.

In ''The Coal Question'', Jevons covered a breadth of concepts on energy depletion that have recently been revisited by writers covering the subject of [[peak oil]]. For example, Jevons explained that improving energy efficiency typically reduced energy costs and thereby increased rather than decreased energy use, an effect now known as the [[Jevons paradox]]. ''The Coal Question'' remains a paradigmatic study of resource depletion theory. Jevons's son, H. Stanley Jevons, published an 800-page follow-up study in 1915 in which the difficulties of estimating recoverable reserves of a theoretically finite resource are discussed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, H. Stanley Jevons, (1915) ''[[The British Coal Trade]]''. London: Kegan Paul, Trench and Trübner; (complete text available at Google Books) see especially pp. 718 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a relatively minor work, "Commercial Crises and Sun-Spots",&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley (14 November 1878). "Commercial crises and sun-spots", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] xix, pp. 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jevons analyzed business cycles, proposing that crises in the economy might not be random events, but might be based on discernible prior causes. To clarify the concept, he presented a statistical study relating [[business cycles]] with [[Sunspots (economics)|sunspots]]. His reasoning was that sunspots affected the weather, which, in turn, affected crops. Crop changes could then be expected to cause economic changes. Subsequent studies have found that sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.&lt;ref&gt;Hirshleifer, David and Tyler Shumway (2003). "Good day sunshine: stock returns and the weather", ''[[Journal of Finance]]'' 58 (3), pp. 1009–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
[[File:Jevon's logic piano.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|The Logic Piano]]
In 1864 Jevons published a ''Pure Logic; or, the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity'', which was based on [[George Boole|Boole]]'s [[system of logic]], but freed from what he considered the false mathematical dress of that system. In the years immediately following he devoted considerable attention to the construction of a logical machine, exhibited before the [[Royal Society]] in 1870, by means of which {{Clarify|date=July 2015|text=the conclusion derivable from any given set of premises|reason=Which one of the many conclusions possible, and are we talking about theorem proving or theorem finding?}} could be mechanically obtained. In 1866 what he regarded as the great and universal principle of all reasoning dawned upon him; and in 1869 he published a sketch of this fundamental doctrine under the title of ''[[#Works|The Substitution of Similars]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDwdAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The%20substitution%20of%20similars&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=logical%20abacus&amp;f=false|title=The Substitution of Similars: The True Principle of Reasoning, Derived from a Modification of Aristotle's Dictum|last=Jevons|first=William Stanley|date=1869|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/substitutionofsi00jevorich|archive-date=July 15, 2008|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the principle in its simplest form as follows: "Whatever is true of a thing is true of its like", and he worked out in detail its various applications including the ''[[logical abacus]]'' (a cross between logical [[abacus]] and a [[piano]] – "Logic Piano"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQP-0_ZQxdsC&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=%22logic%20piano%22&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA359#v=onepage&amp;q=%22logic%20piano%22&amp;f=false|title=Designus Maximus Unleashed!|last=Maxfield|first=Clive|date=1998|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=9780750690898|location=|pages=359|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical computer he designed and had built in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The substitution of similars'', he gives a description of his "[[logical abacus]]" on pp. 55ff, which "is extracted from the Proceedings of the Society for 3d April, 1866, p. 161."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxI6AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=proceedings%20of%20the%20society%201866%20manchester%20literary&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q=logical%20abacus&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society|last=|first=|date=1866|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jevons's piano.jpg|220px|right|thumb|The Logic Piano keyboard]]
In the following year appeared the ''Elementary Lessons on Logic'', which soon became the most widely read elementary textbook on logic in the English language. In the meantime he was engaged upon a much more important logical treatise, which appeared in 1874 under the title of ''The Principles of Science''. In this work Jevons embodied the substance of his earlier works on pure logic and the substitution of similars; he also enunciated and developed the view that [[inductive reasoning|induction]] is simply an inverse employment of [[deductive logic|deduction]]; he treated in a luminous manner the general theory of [[probability]], and the relation between probability and induction; and his knowledge of the various natural sciences enabled him throughout to relieve the abstract character of logical doctrine by concrete scientific illustrations, often worked out in great detail. An example is his discussion of the use of [[one-way function]]s in cryptography, including remarks on the [[integer factorization]] problem that foreshadowed its use in [[public key cryptography]]. Jevons's general theory of induction was a revival of the theory laid down by [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and criticised by [[John Stuart Mill]]; but it was put in a new form, and was free from some of the non-essential adjuncts which rendered Whewell's exposition open to attack. The work as a whole was one of the most notable contributions to logical doctrine that appeared in the UK in the 19th century. "Though less attractively written than Mill's ''System of Logic'', ''Principles of Science'' is a book that keeps much closer to the facts of scientific practice."&lt;ref&gt;"Jevons, William Stanley", in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers'' (1960), New York: Hawthorn.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Studies in Deductive Logic'', consisting mainly of exercises and problems for the use of students, was published in 1880. In 1877 and the following years Jevons contributed to the ''Contemporary Review'' some articles on Mill, which he had intended to supplement by further articles, and eventually publish in a volume as a criticism of Mill's philosophy. These articles and one other were republished after Jevons's death, together with his earlier logical treatises, in a volume, entitled ''Pure Logic, and other Minor Works''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William Stanley Jevons | editor1=Robert Adamson | editor2=Harriet A. Jevons | title=Pure logic and other minor works | location=London | publisher=MacMillan | url=https://archive.org/details/purelogicandothe00jevouoft | year=1890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticisms on Mill contain much that is ingenious and much that is forcible, but on the whole they cannot be regarded as taking rank with Jevons's other work. His strength lay in his power as an original thinker rather than as a critic; and he will be remembered by his constructive work as logician, economist and [[statistician]].

On Jevons as logician, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).

== Jevons's number ==
Jevons wrote in his ''Principles of Science'': "Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8616460799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesofscie00jevorich#page/n165/mode/2up ''Principles of Science''], Macmillan &amp; Co., 1874, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as Jevons's number and was factored by [[Derrick Norman Lehmer]] in 1903&lt;ref&gt;Lehmer, D.N., [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183419373 "A Theorem in the Theory of Numbers"], read before the San Francisco Section of the American Mathematical Society, 19 December 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; and later on a pocket calculator by [[Solomon W. Golomb]].&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Solomon. "On Factoring Jevons' Number", ''Cryptologia,'' vol. XX, no. 3, July 1996, pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|JevonsNumber|Jevons' Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; It factors as 89681x96079.

==Geometry==
One of Jevons's contemporaries, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], who was interested in [[non-Euclidean geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| page =77}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed two groups of two-dimensional creatures with one group living in the plane while the other living in the surface of a sphere. He asserted that since these creatures were embedded in two dimensions, they would develop a planar version of [[Euclidean geometry]], but that since the nature of these surfaces were different, they would arrive at very different versions of this geometry. He then extended this argument into three dimensions, noting that this raises fundamental questions of the relationship of spatial perception to mathematical truth.&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz ''Axioms of Geometry''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| page =78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| page =84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jevons made an almost immediate response to this article. While Helmholtz focused on how humans perceived space, Jevons focused on the question of truth in geometry. Jevons agreed that while Helmholtz's argument was compelling in constructing a situation where the [[Euclid's Elements|Euclidean]] axioms of geometry would not apply, he believed that they had no effect on the truth of these axioms. Jevons hence makes the distinction between truth and applicability or perception, suggesting that these concepts were independent in the domain of geometry.

Jevons did not claim that geometry was developed without any consideration for spatial reality. Instead, he suggested that his geometric systems were representations of reality but in a more fundamental way that transcends what one can perceive about reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| pages =86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jevons claimed that there was a flaw in Helmholtz's argument relating to the concept of infinitesimally small. This concept involves how these creatures reason about geometry and space at a very small scale, which is not necessarily the same as the reasoning that Helmholtz assumed on a more global scale. Jevons claimed that the Euclidean relations could be reduced locally in the different scenarios that Helmholtz created and hence the creatures should have been able to experience the Euclidean properties, just in a different representation. For example, Jevons claimed that the two-dimensional creatures living on the surface of a sphere should be able to construct the plane and even construct systems of higher dimensions and that although they may not be able to perceive such situations in reality, it would reveal fundamental mathematical truths in their theoretical existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| pages =87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Helmholtz gave a response to Jevons, who claimed that Helmholtz failed to show why geometric truth should be separate from the reality of spatial perception. Helmholtz criticized Jevons's definition of truth and in particular, experiential truth. Helmholtz asserts that there should be a difference between experiential truth and mathematical truth and that these versions of truth are not necessarily consistent. This conversation between Helmholtz and Jevons was a microcosm of an ongoing debate between truth and perception in the wake of the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Richards| first =Joan| title =Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England| publisher =Academic Press| pages =88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1867, Jevons married Harriet Ann Taylor, whose father, [[John Edward Taylor]], had been the founder and proprietor of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. Jevons suffered from ill health and sleeplessness, and found the delivery of lectures covering so wide a range of subjects very burdensome. In 1876, he was glad to exchange the Owens professorship for the professorship of [[political economy]] in [[University College, London]]. Travelling and music were the principal recreations of his life; but his health continued to be bad, and he suffered from depression. He found his professorial duties increasingly irksome, and feeling that the pressure of literary work left him no spare energy, he decided in 1880 to resign the post. On 13 August 1882 he drowned whilst bathing near [[Hastings]].

Jevons was brought up a [[Christian]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Mosselmans, Bert, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-jevons/ "William Stanley Jevons"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from his journals indicate he remained committed to his Christian beliefs until death. He is buried in the [[Hampstead Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/~rutherfo/mr_grvs1.html UVic.ca – University of Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Jevons was a prolific writer, and at the time of his death was a leader in the UK both as a logician and as an economist. [[Alfred Marshall]] said of his work in economics that it "will probably be found to have more constructive force than any, save that of [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], that has been done during the last hundred years."

Jevons's theory of induction has continued to be influential: "Jevons's general view of induction has received a powerful and original formulation in the work of a modern-day philosopher, Professor [[Karl Popper|K. R. Popper]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Jevons, William Stanley", in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers'' (1960), New York: Hawthorn.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoophilia and the law''' looks at the laws governing humans performing sex acts with non-human  animals. Laws against humans performing sex acts on animals, where they exist, are concerned with the actual act, which it commonly refers to as ''[[bestiality]]'', rather than the sexual attraction to animals. For this reason, prohibitions of zoophilic pornography are more varied; they may be unlawful if an actual sex act with an animal is involved, but the status is not clear-cut if there is a mere representation, such as a painting or cartoon. In that case, normal [[obscenity law]]s will normally apply. All [[Animal pornography|zoophilic imagery]] is widely regarded as [[pornography]].

==Public opinion==

According to a 2014 poll carried out by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], 76% of [[Denmark]] supports banning bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indy100.com/article/denmark-has-somehow-only-just-outlawed-bestiality--g1fzm0dkxb Denmark has somehow only just outlawed bestiality]&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2017 [[Yougov]] poll found 75% of the [[United Kingdom]] think bestiality should be illegal, 11% didn't think bestiality should be illegal, and 14% don't know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/12/ukip-voters-most-supportive-of-bestiality/ UKIP voters most supportive of bestiality ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2015, the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] was the only party in the [[Folketing]] to oppose and vote against banning bestiality, while the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] abstained. Liberal Alliance MP [[Joachim Olsen]] said about the bill: "Best case, this is a superficial law. Worst case, it is political populism and moralism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelocal.dk/20150225/denmarks-bestiality-ban-moves-forward Denmark's bestiality ban moves forward]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelocal.dk/20150421/denmark-officially-bans-bestiality Denmark officially bans bestiality ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

Denmark's Animal Ethics Council opposed banning bestiality in Denmark in 2006 and 2015, saying existing laws which allow bestiality except in cases where the animal can be proved to have suffered were enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/denmark-outlaws-bestiality-in-narrow-vote/ Denmark outlaws bestiality in narrow vote]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dkjusticeanimalrights"&gt;[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Dyrevaernsraad/Udtalelser_og_tilhoerende_pressemeddelelser/Udtalelse_om_menneskers_seksuelle_omgang_med_dyr__november_2006_.pdf Det Dyreetiske Råd: Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr], ''The Animal Ethics Council: Statement on the sexual relations of humans with animals''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
Laws on bestiality tend to be shaped by animal welfare concerns, moral views, and cultural beliefs. In many cultures, humans are seen as fundamentally different from other animals and having sex with animals is seen as defilement.&lt;ref name="sciamer"/&gt;

One of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Globalize/West | section | date=March 2014}}

=== International differences ===
Some jurisdictions list laws very clearly, such as [[England and Wales]], which specifically prohibits penetration of a human being by the penis of an animal, and penetration of an animal by a human's penis.&lt;ref name="UKlaw69"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/69 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003, Section 69 |work=HM Government |year=2003 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, many countries and US states are less precise about the scope of law in that they outlaw sex with animals, without defining what constitutes "sex".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Even if bestiality is not explicitly prohibited, there are often many other laws which can be used to effectively prosecute cases. For example, most countries have [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] laws, and a prosecutor will argue that all zoophilia activity is animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;The argument that "all sexual activity with animals is automatically abuse" was made for example, in 1) the 2004 case of [http://pet-abuse.com/cases/2206/FL/US/1 State vs. Mitchell] (Florida), 2) the 2004 Pony case in Utrecht, Holland (cited below), and 3) the 2006 Washington state law which asserts as its foundational premise that "animal cruelty in the first degree is committed when a person knowingly engages in sexual conduct or sexual contact with an animal." [http://washingtonvotes.org/2006-SB-6417 SB-6417 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In some U.S. states, a person who engages in bestiality can be charged with animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="shelby"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2011/06/16/story-shelby-man-charged-with-animal-abuse-sex.html |title=Man Charged With Sexually Abusing Animals |work=WBNS-10TV |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibitions without specific bestiality statutes ===
Some countries have a range of laws on their books. Sometimes [[sodomy law]]s or "[[crime against nature]]" laws are used to prosecute people who have sex with animals.

In the case of [[Kenneth Pinyan]], who died from injuries sustained from receiving anal sex from a horse, local law enforcement found that there were no laws that allowed them to prosecute his friend, who had filmed the event and also allowed himself to be sodomized by the horse. The friend was prosecuted for trespassing. That case prompted the Washington State legislature to draw up legislation outlawing sex with animals.&lt;ref name="thestranger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30811|accessdate=2006-04-30|title=The Animal In You|publisher=The Stranger|date=February–March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 [[Florida]] case, a man who had sex with his dog was charged with disorderly conduct, since the state had no anti-bestiality laws on the books at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidehorse.org/news_guide_dog_abuse.htm |title=Man charged with having intercourse with his Guide Dog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521055021/http://www.guidehorse.org/news_guide_dog_abuse.htm |archivedate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2011, the state of Florida State Law 828.126, F.S went into effect, banning sex with animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/0344/BillText/er/PDF |title=Section 828.126, Florida Statutes |work=The Florida Senate |year=2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws against sex with animals ==
Aggrawal has discussed extensively on laws against bestiality.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal  | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-4200-4308-2 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is permitted in a few countries although ordinary animal treatment laws apply.

There are also commonly laws against forcing another person to engage in sexual activity with other animals, especially minors (usually considered equivalent to [[rape]]), and laws related to exposing others (either non-consensually or minors) to the sight of a sexual act. In some jurisdictions, laws against zoophilia conduct also include provisions for seizure of animals where convicted.

=== Exceptions ===
{{see also|Artificial insemination#In livestock and pets|Semen collection#By species|Horse sheath cleaning}}
Sexual handling of an animal for the purposes of [[Veterinarian|veterinary]] practice, or [[animal husbandry]] (breeding), is normally exempted where such laws exist. In public discussion for the recently passed Oregon law, however, one animal shelter's spokesperson wanted the husbandry exemption kept out, as he was concerned that someone might use these "accepted farming practices" as a legal loophole to then have (legal) sexual contact with an animal only for personal enjoyment. One of the legislators responded by asking if they were trying to outlaw an act (of sexual contact), or a state of mind. The veterinary and husbandry exemption was left out of Oregon's law in the final, enacted version. Because some alterations of animal genitalia (such as artificial insemination) are permitted but others (sex with animals) are not, concerns have been raised that this may violate [[due process]] and [[equality before the law]].&lt;ref name="interdis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=For the Love of Dog: On the Legal Prohibition of Zoophilia in Canada and the United States |first=Brian Anthony |last=Cutteridge |work=inter-disciplinary.net |year=2010 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mroberts"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1328310 |title=The Unjustified Prohibition against Bestiality: Why the Laws in Opposition Can Find No Support under the Harm Principle |year=2009 |last1=Roberts |first1=Michael |journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoophilic pornography==
{{main|Animal pornography}}
The legality of pornography has three components: legality of production, legality of sale and transportation, and legality of ownership. In general, animal pornography is legal to produce where both zoophilic activity and the creation of pornography in general are legal. Laws concerning sale, transmission and ownership vary more widely.

Erotic art, such as animal pornography in cartoons and the like, which does not require the recording of an actual sexual act, are not usually considered sex with animals by the law, and so their status depends upon more general laws such as legal limits upon obscenity or pornography alone, and the thin line between erotic art and pornography.

* ''"Freddie the Dolphin"'' (1991, UK) - man accused of masturbating a well known tame [[dolphin]] at sea. Charged with a "lewd act". Acquitted. Expert witnesses testified male dolphins use their [[erection]]s not just sexually, but socially as well, and no sexual inference could be drawn.

* [[Wisconsin, USA]] (2007) - Bryan James Hathaway was convicted for having sex with a dead deer. The court case raised some interesting legal issues because the statute prohibits sex with animals, but not carcasses.

He was sentenced to 6 months probation and labeled as a sex offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haines|first=Lester|title=Sex with dead deer is illegal, US man finds|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/22/deer_man_convicted/|newspaper=The Register|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
