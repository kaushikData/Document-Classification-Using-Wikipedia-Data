The '''A-Hmao language''', also known as '''Large Flowery Miao''' ({{zh|大花苗}}) or '''Northeast Yunnan Miao''' (''Diandongbei'', {{zh|苗语滇东北方言}}), is a [[Hmongic language]] spoken in China. It is the language the [[Pollard script]] was designed for,&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, Vang, &amp; Yang, 1990. ''Mother of writing: the origin and development of a Hmong messianic script''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, 2007. ''Writing from these roots: literacy in a Hmong-American community''&lt;/ref&gt; and displays extensive [[tone sandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, David. 2005. "A-Hmao Echo Reduplication as Evidence for Abstract Phonological Scales". LSA Annual Meeting&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high degree of literacy in Pollard among the older generation.

The standard written language, both in Pollard and in Latin script, is that of ''Shíménkǎn'' (石门坎) village in [[Weining County]].

== Classification ==
The A-Hmao language is a branch of the '''[[West Hmongic]]''' languages, also known as '''Chuanqiandian Miao''' (川黔滇方言: '''Sichuan–Guizhou–Yunnan Miao''') and '''Western Miao''', is the major branch of the Hmongic languages of China and Southeast Asia.

Wang Fushi (1985) grouped the Western Miao languages into eight primary divisions.&lt;ref&gt;王辅世主编，《苗语简志》，民族出版社，1985年。&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Miao was descended from the "Jiuli" tribe in the period of Yan Di and Huang Di, "Sanmiao" in the period of Yao and Shun.  "Jiuli" is a tribe, which lived in the middle and lower reaches of the [[Yellow River]] more than five thousand years ago. Then,  the "Jiuli" tribe were defeated at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]] by the military coalition of Huang Di and Yan Di. [[Chiyou]], the leader of the "Jiuli" tribe, was caught and killed by Huang Di. The rest of the "Jiuli" tribe retreated to the middle and lower reaches of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], and formed "Sanmiao" tribe, the established Sanmiao Country. Four thousand years ago, the [[Huaxia]] tribe of the North led by Yao, Shun, and Yu had been fighting with "Sanmiao" for nearly one thousand years. In the end, Xiayu defeated "Sanmiao" Country.  After defeated, one part of the "Sanmiao" were banished to "Sanwei" (the border of present provinces of [[Shanxi]] and [[Gansu]]). Then, they were forced to migrate to the southeast. After a long time of migration, they entered into the north of [[Sichuan]], northeast of [[Yunnan]], and northwest of [[Guizhou]]. Later, the present [[West Hmongic|Western Miao]] was developed. The descendant of "Sanmiao" which stationed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Central Plains Area, one part of them merged with Huaxia tribe, and another part developed to what was called "[[Nanman]]" in [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasty. While the part, which lived in the middle reaches of [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han River]], was called "Jingchu barbarians".  Later, the advanced part of the "Jingchu barbarians" gradually developed to Chu tribe, and then Chu was developed. While the less advanced part continued to immigrate to the adjacent mountainous area of [[Guizhou]], [[Hunan]], [[Guangxi]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hubei]] and [[Henan]] provinces, and the developed to the ancestor of present East and Central Miao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wenku.baidu.com/link?url=lNb6DF8Yuv9HRyXyohsMWChexZYQN7Gdt2jM0RiDZXAhKupBIT6g-1vxn_wkJyjwB5x-S0Zb_b2UFtoT3LfwxO7Puh2uzfl44w97deDD9u_|title = 关于苗族的调查报告|date = 2013-12-24|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
The A-Mao language is distributed in [[Zhaotong]], [[Kunming]], [[Qujing]] and [[Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture]] in the Northeast of [[Yunnan]] Province. And also [[Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County|Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao autonomous county]], [[Hezhang County|Hezhang county]], [[Liupanshui]], and [[Ziyun Miao and Buyei Autonomous County|Ziyun Miao and Buyi autonomous county]] in the West of [[Guizhou]] Province.

=== Tones ===
* On the basis of the 8 tones of A-Hmao language, in the eastern region, the 4th, 6th, and 8th tones are broken up partially or entirely into two categories.  At most, it can be up to 11 tones.  Basically, nouns and quantifiers are part of the first category, and they are higher in pitch. Other word classes are part of the second category, and they are lower in pitch.
* The A-Hmao language displays extensive [[tone sandhi]]. Similar to other branches of the West Hmongic languages, the tone sandhi happens on the second [[syllable]] when the first syllable of a disyllable word is level tone (1st and 2nd tone).&lt;ref&gt;刘援朝（1993）&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== morphology and vocabulary ===
The [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the three branches of the Hmong language is basically the same. The following examples are from Central Miao.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = 苗族语言与文化|last = 李|first = 锦平|publisher = 贵州民族学院学术|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A-Hmao is similar to [[Hmong language|Hmong]], which is an [[isolating language]] in which most [[morpheme]]s are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly [[Inflection|inflected]]. [[Grammatical tense|Tense]], [[Aspect (linguistics)|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and [[Grammatical case|case]] are indicated lexically.&lt;ref&gt;Strecker, David and Lopao Vang. White Hmong Grammar. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syntax ===
The syntax of Hmong languages, regardless of the type of part of speech or phrase and the division of constituents of the sentence and the sentence types, are basically the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 苗族语言与文化|last = 李|first = 锦平|publisher = 贵州民族学院学术|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic word order of Hmong is SVO. Within the noun phrase, possessors precede possessed nouns, and adjectives and relative clauses follow the nouns they modify. Noun phrases have the form as  (possessive) + (quantifier) + (classifier) + noun + (adjective) + ([[demonstrative]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Martha (1997). "Hmong–Mien demonstratives and pattern persistence" (PDF). ''Mon–Khmer Studies Journal'' '''27''': 317–328.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Chinese, question formation does not involve word order change. For wh- questions, the wh- word does not occupy a sentence-initial position in Hmong as in many other languages. (e.g. the English sentence ‘What are you doing?’ would be rendered ‘you do what’ in Hmong)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Writing system ==
A-Hmao is an ethnic group without their own writing system. Until the beginning of the 20th century, missionary [[Sam Pollard|Samuel Pollard]] invented the [[Pollard script]], which was based on the decorative symbols on their clothing. During the time without writing system, the way A-Hmao people recorded their history, besides passing down through their ancient songs, was that they weave the history of their past memories on their clothes. Those images became the historical memory of their national construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ndaip.sinica.edu.tw/content.jsp?option_id=2441&amp;index_info_id=7744|title = 写在衣服上的历史－大花苗族服饰里的故事|date = |accessdate = |website = Academia Sinica Digital Resources|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahwai''' is one of the [[Plateau languages]] of [[Nigeria]]. There are three [[mutually intelligible]] dialects, Ndun (Nandu), Nyeng (Ningon) and Shakara (Tari).

Blench (2008) classified them as distinct Ndunic languages. However, that same year ''Ethnologue'' merged them as a single language.

'''Apache cTAKES: clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System''' is an open-source [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) system that extracts clinical information from [[electronic health record]] [[unstructured data|unstructured text]]. It processes clinical notes, identifying types of clinical named entities — drugs, diseases/disorders, signs/symptoms, anatomical sites and procedures. Each named entity has attributes for the text span, the ontology mapping code, context (family history of, current, unrelated to patient), and negated/not negated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url={{google books|yVp4CgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}}|title=Health Web Science: Social Media Data for Healthcare|last=Denecke|first=Kerstin|date=2015-08-31|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-20582-3 |chapter=Tools and Resources for Information Extraction |page=[{{google books|yVp4CgAAQBAJ|page=67|plainurl=yes}} 67] |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

cTAKES was built using the  [[UIMA|UIMA Unstructured Information Management Architecture framework]] and [[OpenNLP]] natural language processing toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalifa|first=Abdulrahman|last2=Meystre|first2=Stéphane|date=2015-12-01|title=Adapting existing natural language processing resources for cardiovascular risk factors identification in clinical notes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046415001690|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|series=Proceedings of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth Shared-Tasks and Workshop on Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data|volume=58|issue=Supplement|pages=S128–S132|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2015.08.002|pmid=26318122|pmc=4983192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/04/25/970806/0/en/The-Apache-Software-Foundation-Announces-Apache-cTAKES-v4-0.html|title=The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® cTAKES™ v4.0|publisher=The Apache Software Foundation|first=Sally |last=Khudairi |date=2017-04-25 |location=Forest Hill, MD |agency=Globe Newswire |access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Components == 
Components of cTAKES are specifically trained for the clinical domain, and create rich linguistic and semantic annotations that can be utilized by clinical decision support systems and clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savova|first=Guergana K|last2=Masanz|first2=James J|last3=Ogren|first3=Philip V|last4=Zheng|first4=Jiaping|last5=Sohn|first5=Sunghwan|last6=Kipper-Schuler|first6=Karin C|last7=Chute|first7=Christopher G|date=2010|title=Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES): architecture, component evaluation and applications|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA|volume=17|issue=5|pages=507–513|doi=10.1136/jamia.2009.001560|issn=1067-5027|pmc=2995668|pmid=20819853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These components include:
* Named Section identifier
* Sentence boundary detector
* Rule-based tokenizer
* Formatted list identifier
* Normalizer
* Context dependent tokenizer
* Part-of-speech tagger
* Phrasal chunker
* Dictionary lookup annotator
* Context annotator
* Negation detector
* Uncertainty detector
* Subject detector
* Dependency parser
* patient smoking status identifier
* Drug mention annotator

== History ==
Development of cTAKES began at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 2006. The development team, led by Dr. Guergana Savova and Dr. [[Christopher G. Chute|Christopher Chute]], included physicians, computer scientists and software engineers. After its deployment, cTAKES became an integral part of Mayo's clinical data management infrastructure, processing more than 80 million clinical notes.&lt;ref name=cTAKES_history&gt;{{cite web |date=2015-06-22 |title=History |website=Apache cTAKES™ - clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System |url=http://ctakes.apache.org/history.html |access-date=2018-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dr. Savova's moved to [[Boston Children's Hospital]] in early 2010, the core development team grew to include members there. Further external collaborations include:&lt;ref name=cTAKES_history/&gt;
* University of Colorado
* Brandeis University
* University of Pittsburgh
* University of California at San Diego
Such collaborations have extended cTAKES' capabilities into other areas such as Temporal Reasoning, Clinical Question Answering, and coreference resolution for the clinical domain.&lt;ref name=cTAKES_history/&gt;

In 2010, cTAKES was adopted by the [http://www.i2b2.org i2b2] program and is a central component of the [https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/secondary-use-ehr-data SHARP Area 4].&lt;ref name=cTAKES_history/&gt;

In 2013, cTAKES released their first release as an Apache incubator project: [http://incubator.apache.org/ctakes/ cTAKES 3.0].

In March 2013, cTAKES became an Apache Top Level Project (TLP).&lt;ref name=cTAKES_history/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8989">{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}In [[linguistics]], '''areal features''' are elements shared by languages or dialects in a geographic area, particularly when the languages are not descended from a [[Language family|common ancestor language]].

==Characteristics==
Resemblances between two or more languages (whether in typology or in vocabulary) can be due to [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] relation (descent from a common ancestor language), to [[Loanword|borrowing]] between languages, to [[Stratum (linguistics)|retention of features]] when a population adopts a new language, or simply to chance. When little or no direct documentation of ancestor languages is available, determining whether a similarity is genetic or areal can be difficult. [[Edward Sapir]] notably used evidence of contact and diffusion as a negative tool for genetic reconstruction, treating it as a subject in its own right only at the end of his career (e.g., for the influence of [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] on [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]]).&lt;ref name="drechsel"&gt;Drechsel, Emanuel J. (1988). "Wilhelm von Humboldt and Edward Sapir: analogies and homologies in their linguistic thoughts", in

Genetic relationships are represented in the [[Tree model|family tree model]] of language change, and areal relationships are represented in the [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]. [[William Labov]] in 2007 reconciled these models in a general framework based on differences between children and adults in their language learning ability. Adults do not preserve structural features with sufficient regularity to establish a norm in their community, but children do. Linguistic features are diffused across an area by contacts among adults. Languages branch into dialects and thence into related languages through small changes in the course of children's learning processes which accumulate over generations, and when speech communities do not communicate (frequently) with each other, these cumulative changes diverge.&lt;ref&gt;

In some areas with high linguistic diversity, a number of areal features have spread across a set of languages to form a [[sprachbund]] (also known as a linguistic area, convergence area or diffusion area).  Some examples are the [[Balkan sprachbund]], the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], and the languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

* The spread of the [[guttural R]] from either German or French to several West European languages.
* The tendency to use a ''habeo'' (transitive, e.g. "I have") construction for possession in much of Europe, instead of a ''[[Dative case|mihi est]]'' (''to me is'') construction, which is more likely the original possessive construction in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], considering the lack of a common root for "have" verbs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X8UOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg= Winfred Philipp Lehmann, ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction'', Routledge, 1992, p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The development of a [[perfect aspect]] using "have" + past participle in many European languages (Romance, Germanic, etc.).
* A [[perfect aspect]] using "be" + past participle for intransitive and reflexive verbs (with participle agreement), present in French, Italian, German, older Spanish and Portuguese, and possibly even English, in phrases like "I am become[ death, destroyer of worlds]" and "The kingdom of this world is become".
* Presence of {{IPA|/ɫ/}} ([[dark L]]), usually contrasting with palatalized {{IPA|/lʲ/}} in Slavic, Baltic and Turkic languages of Eastern Europe.
* Possibly the [[Satem]] sound change.
* Postposed [[Article (grammar)|article]], avoidance of the [[infinitive]], merging of [[genitive]] and [[dative]], and superessive [[grammatical number|number]] formation in some languages of the [[Balkans]].
* Development of a three-tone system with no tones in words ending in -p, -t, -k, followed by a tone split; many other phonetic similarities; a system of classifiers/measure words; etc. in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]].
* [[Retroflex consonants]] in the [[Burushaski]],&lt;ref&gt;Berger, H. Die Burushaski-Sprache von Hunza und Nagar. Vols. I-III.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4971">The '''axiom of categoricity''' is a term coined by [[Jack Chambers (linguist)|J. K. Chambers]] in 1995 to refer to the once-widespread tenet of [[Linguistics|linguistic theory]] that in order to properly study language, linguistic data should be removed or abstracted from all real-world context so as to be free of any inconsistencies or variability. This principle was, for different theorists and schools of thought, taken as a prerequisite for linguistic theory,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Chomsky (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; or as a self-evident falsehood to be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Bakhtin (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It remains an influential idea in linguistics.

==History==

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] divided language into two categories, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' (the abstract grammatical system a language uses) and ''parole'' (language as it is used in real-life circumstances). Historically, the range of language study had been limited to ''langue'', since the data could easily be found in the linguist's own intuitions about language and there was no need to look at the often inconsistent and chaotic language patterns found in everyday [[society]].

In the 20th century, scholars began to further embrace the assumption that linguistic data should be removed from its social, real-life context. [[Martin Joos]] stated the axiom this way in 1950:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We must make our 'linguistics' a kind of mathematics within which inconsistency is by definition impossible." (Joos 1950: 701-2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965, [[Noam Chomsky]] offered a more substantial definition, incorporating his concepts of [[linguistic competence]] and [[linguistic performance]], terms that closely parallel Saussure's ''langue'' and ''parole''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the language in actual performance." (Chomsky 1965: 3)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time, several linguistic studies began to acknowledge not only the presence, but importance of variability found in speaker data. Instead of dismissing this variability on the grounds that the variants either belonged to different coexisting linguistic systems or demonstrated unpredictable [[free variation]] as had been done before, they recognized that it might be influenced by the speaker's circumstances. Sociologist John L. Fischer conducted one of the first systematic studies of language variation in 1958 to address variation in the speech of New England schoolchildren. Finding free variation to be an unsatisfactory explanation, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...Another sort of explanation is possible in terms of current factors which lead a given child in given circumstances to produce one of the variants rather than another." (Fischer 1958: 47-8)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fischer eventually discovered a correlation between the linguistic variants and independent social [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] such as [[social class|class]] and [[sex]]. By gathering variable data and analyzing it, he proved that the inconsistencies were indeed manageable, resisting the Axiom of categoricity's premise that the data be abstracted from social contexts in order to make it coherent and manageable. By invalidating this premise, it proved that acceptance of the Axiom of categoricity is not a requirement but rather an idealistic option that may or may not be useful to a study. Fischer's work created the basis for sociolinguistic analysis in the coming years, notably [[William Labov]]'s studies in [[Martha's Vineyard]] and New York City during the 1960s.

==Acceptance in modern theory==
Despite its rejection by sociolinguists, the Axiom of categoricity is still an influential postulate in some schools of linguistics. Chambers claims that all the linguistic progress that was made when the axiom was the law remains successful and indisputable. (Chambers 1995: 12-29)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15408">Traditionally Russia used the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language and [[Slavonic Bible]], and in the modern era [[Bible translations into Russian]]. The minority languages of Russia usually have a much more recent history, many of them having been commissioned or updated by the [[Institute for Bible Translation]]. 

Bible translations into the [[languages of Russia]] include:

==Avar==
The Bible is being translated into [[Avar language]] ([[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]]) of the Caucasus by the [[Institute for Bible Translation]]. The first portion in Avar, John, was published in 1979, Mark followed in 1996, Luke and Acts in 2000, Proverbs in 2005, the complete New Testament in September 2008, and Genesis in 2011.&lt;ref name=IBT2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBT2011/&gt; Work on the Old Testament continues.

==Azerbaijani==

== Komi ==
The first full Bible in the [[Komi language]] was issued in 1823 in Saint-Petersburg by the [[Russian Bible Society]]. There were also the 1885 edition of the Bible and a translation of the New Testament made in 1970-80s. Though these three editions gave rise to complaints and in 2008 the Institute for Bible Translation issued a modern translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Шведские ученые перевели Евангелие на язык коми|url=http://www.pravoslavie-nord.ru/print.html?pid=919|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=ИА «Православие на Северной земле»|date=2008-09-24|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kryashen ==
[[Nikolay Ilminsky]], a Russian Orthodox priest and missionary, was the first who greatly promoted translations of the Bible into the minority languages of the Russian Empire including the Tatar dialect of the Christianized Tatars, called the [[Kryashen]]s. He and his colleagues translated and issued the Gospels (1891), the Psalter (1892), and the Epistles (1907), though the full translation was not completed. Unlike the dialect of the Muslim Tatars, who used the Arabic scripts then, the Kryashen dialect (language) has used and still uses its own version of the Cyrillic alphabet, which slightly differs from the modern Standard (Kazan) Tatar alphabet, and also has minor peculiarities in vocabulary and grammar. In 2005 the Russian Bible Society published a modern translation of the New Testament in Kryashen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Перевод Нового Завета на кряшенский язык|url=http://www.biblia.ru/translation/show/?10&amp;start=0|publisher=Российское Библейское Общество|accessdate=1 October 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:В Казани состоялась презентация Нового Завета на кряшенском языке (фоторепортаж) |url=http://kazan.eparhia.ru/news/2005/?id=902 |publisher=Официальный сайт Казанской епархии «Православие в Татарстане» |accessdate=1 October 2012 |language=Russian |date=2005-12-23 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalan Sign Language''' ({{lang-ca|Llengua de signes catalana, LSC}}; {{IPA-ca|ˈʎeŋɡwə ðə ˈsiŋnəs kətəˈlanə|IPA}}) is a [[sign language]] used by around 18,000 people in different regions of Spain including Barcelona and Catalonia. As of 2012, the Catalan Federation for the Deaf estimates 25,000 LSC signers and roughly 12,000 deaf people around the Catalan region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barbera |first1=Gemma |title=The meaning of space in Catalan Sign Language (LSC) |url=http://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/81074/tgba.pdf;jsessionid=ACC248C54DA51ECF654BB04B03B394FA.tdx1?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 50% intelligibility with [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE). On the basis of mutual intelligibility, lexicon, and social attitudes, linguists have argued that LSC and LSE are distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quer |first1=Josep |title=Legal Pathways to the Recognition of Sign Languages: A Comparison of the Catalan and Spanish Sign Language Acts |issue=4 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480479/pdf |journal=Sign Language Studies |volume=12 |pages=565–582 |doi=10.1353/sls.2012.0012|date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1994, LSC has had official status, due to a law to promote the language promulgated by [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]. [[Catalonia]] was the first Spanish [[Autonomous Community]] to approve a law for a sign language.

FESOCA (''Catalan Federation of Deaf People'') is an [[NGO]] founded in 1979 to represent and to defend the rights of deaf associations and individuals to achieve a full social participation and integration. FESOCA organises several courses, activities and meetings. In 2007, a bill was passed in Spain referred to as the "Bill of Deaf People" which was designed to cover sign language issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quer |first1=Josep |title=Legal Pathways to the Recognition of Sign Languages: A Comparison of the Catalan and Spanish Sign Language Acts |issue=4 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480479/pdf |journal=Sign Language Studies |volume=12 |pages=565–582 |doi=10.1353/sls.2012.0012|date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are research groups for LSC, such as ILLESCAT (LSC Study Centre). This centre studies the evolution of the language, makes linguistic studies and creates new [[neologism]]s. The ''Platform for Linguistic and Cultural Rights for LSC Users'' a.k.a. ''LSC, Ara!'' carried out a law to promote this language in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Statute of Autonomy]].

==Classification==
Wittmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; suspects that LSC may be part of the [[French Sign Language family]], but transmission to Catalonia would have happened early, and is not easy to demonstrate. Likewise, a Linguistic Professor from the University of Coruna who specializes in LSC, found that the difference between a language like this and other more common forms of sign language is the use of "neutral space" in front of the signer when speaking on real life situations as well as the use of visual character.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/222652450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic properties==
LSC primarily uses two of the three planes: horizontal and vertical planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbera |first1=Gemma |title=Use and Functions of Spatial Planes in Catalan Sign Language (LSC) Discourse |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/538079 |journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=147–174 |doi=10.1353/sls.2014.0000 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study using LSC demonstrated a universal pattern in the manner in the way signed and spoken language are used to communicate ideas. The experiment took into consideration movement, handshape and location as the three modes of comparison and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baus |first1=Cristina |last2=Gutiérrez-Sigut |first2=Eva |last3=Quer |first3=Josep |last4=Carreiras |first4=Manuel |title=Lexical Access in Catalan Signed Language (LSC) |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027708001339 |journal=Cognition |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.05.012 |pmid=18656181 |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=856–865|year=2008 |hdl=10230/33129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, the numeral signs of LSC were analyzed, noting the differing methods of signing numbers above five, which found some differences between LSC and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and emphasized how these changes can cause a language to change and evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuentes |first1=Mariana |last2=Tolchinsky Landsmann |first2=Liliana |title=The Subsystem of Numerals in Catalan Sign Language: Description and Examples from a Psycholinguistic Study |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/173774 |journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=5 |pages=94–117 |doi=10.1353/sls.2004.0022 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan Sign Language is more transparent (makes decimal values more explicit) than Spanish and Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuentes |first1=Mariana |last2=Tolchinsky Landsmann |first2=Liliana |title=The Subsystem of Numerals in Catalan Sign Language: Description and Examples from a Psycholinguistic Study |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/173774 |journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=5 |pages=94–117 |doi=10.1353/sls.2004.0022 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impersonal sentences in LSC are determinant upon syntactic differences in pronominal forms, role shift, and spatial locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meurant |first1=Laurence |last2=Lie Sinte |first2=Aur |last3=Van Herreweghe |first3=Mieke |title=Sign Language Research, Uses and Practices |date=2013 |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |location=Boston |isbn=978-1614511991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in ASL, verbs are divided into simple, deictic, and spatial-locative verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morales-López |first1=Esperanza |last2=Boldú-Menasanch |first2=Rosa Maria |last3=Alonso-Rodríguez |first3=Jesús Amador |last4=Gras-Ferrer |first4=Victòria |last5=Rodríguez-González |first5=María Ángeles |title=The Verbal System of Catalan Sign Language (LSC) |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185614 |journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=441–496 |doi=10.1353/sls.2005.0018 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of signing metaphors in LSC was studied in an experiment involving double-mapping, and the [[iconicity]] in sign languages like LSC and ASL plays a fundamental role for cognitive theories noting the symbiotic relationship between grammar and bodily cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarque |first1=Maria-Josep |title=Double Mapping in Metaphorical Expressions of Thought and Communication in Catalan Sign Language (LSC) |issue=3 |pages=292 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-825644551/double-mapping-in-metaphorical-expressions-of-thought |journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=5 |date=April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf people in Catalonia are taught to read and write oral languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wV86AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=catalan+sign+language#v=onepage&amp;q=catalan%20sign%20language&amp;f=false|isbn=9789027290427|author1=Plaza-Pust|first1=Carolina|last2=Morales-López|first2=Esperanza|date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

== LSC Award ==
In May 2015 the Departament de Cultura (Department for Culture) created the LSC Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/AppJava/cultura/notapremsavw/283119/ca/crea-premi-lsc-foment-llengua-signes-catalana.do |title=Es crea el Premi LSC de Foment de la Llengua de Signes Catalana |date=9 May 2015 |accessdate= |website= |publisher=Departament de cultura (Generalitat de Catalunya) |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to acknowledge individuals, institutions and initiatives for their contribution to the promotion and spreading of LSC.

This biennial award has the same consideration as other awards regarding spoken languages like the [[Pompeu Fabra]] Award for Catalan and the [[Robèrt Lafont]] Award for [[Occitan language|Occitan]].

==Overview==
[[Kenneth J. Gergen]] describes civil discourse as "the language of dispassionate objectivity", and suggests that it requires respect of the other participants, such as the reader. It neither diminishes the other's moral worth, nor questions their good judgment; it avoids hostility, direct antagonism, or excessive persuasion; it requires modesty and an appreciation for the other participant's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth J. Gergen |authorlink=Kenneth J. Gergen |title=Social construction in context |year=2001 |isbn=0-7619-6545-9 |pages=71–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book III of ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), [[John Locke]] contrasts between civil and philosophical discourse (or [[Rhetoric|rhetorical discourse]]) with the former being for the benefit of the reader, and the [[public good]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |author=John Locke |authorlink=John Locke |year=1690 |url=http://www.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/LockeBook3_9.htm |isbn=0-14-043482-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prince Maurice's Rational Parrot: Civil Discourse in Locke's Essay |author=Peter Walmsley |journal=[[Eighteenth-Century Studies]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=413–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On modern origins: essays in early modern philosophy |author1=Richard Kennington |author2=Pamela Kraus |author3=Frank Hunt |page=254 |isbn=0-7391-0814-X |year=2004 |publisher=[[Lexington Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, By the {{sm|philosophical}} use of words, I mean such a use of them as may serve to convey the precise notions of things, and to express in general propositions certain and undoubted truths, which the mind may rest upon and be satisfied with in its search after true knowledge. These two uses are very distinct; and a great deal less exactness will serve in the one than in the other, as we shall see in what follows.}}

The '''clathrate gun hypothesis''' is the popular name given to the idea that increases in sea temperatures or drops in sea levels can trigger a strong [[positive feedback]] effect on climate: first, warming causes a sudden release of [[methane]] from [[methane clathrate]] compounds buried in [[seabed]]s and seabed [[permafrost]]; second, because methane itself is a powerful [[greenhouse gas]], temperatures rise further, and the cycle repeats.  This runaway process, once started, could be as irreversible as the firing of a gun.&lt;ref name="Kennett 2003"&gt;{{cite book |first1=James P. |last1=Kennett |first2=Kevin G. |last2=Cannariato |first3=Ingrid L. |last3=Hendy |first4=Richard J. |last4=Behl |year=2003 |title=Methane Hydrates in Quaternary Climate Change: The Clathrate Gun Hypothesis |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |location=Washington DC |isbn=978-0-87590-296-8 |doi=10.1029/054SP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form, the hypothesis proposed that the "[[Clathrate compound|clathrate]] gun" could cause abrupt runaway warming on a time scale less than a human lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kennett 2003" /&gt; A 2018 published review concluded that the clathrate gun hypothesis remains controversial, but that better understanding is vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methane and Global Environmental Change|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-030154|year=2018|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=43|pages=165–192|last1 = Reay|first1 = Dave S.|last2=Smith|first2=Pete|last3=Christensen|first3=Torben R.|last4=James|first4=Rachael H.|last5=Clark|first5=Harry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Studies published in 2000 attributed the hypothesis to be responsible for warming events in and at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennett |first1=James P. |last2=Cannariato |first2=Kevin G. |last3=Hendy |first3=Ingrid L. |last4=Behl |first4=Richard J. |date=7 April 2000 |title=Carbon Isotopic Evidence for Methane Hydrate Instability During Quaternary Interstadials |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.288.5463.128 |bibcode=2000Sci...288..128K |volume=288 |issue=5463 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is now thought to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sowers |first=Todd |date=10 February 2006 |title=Late Quaternary Atmospheric {{chem|CH|4}} Isotope Record Suggests Marine Clathrates Are Stable |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1121235 |pmid=16469923 |bibcode=2006Sci...311..838S |volume=311 |issue=5762 |pages=838–840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Severinghaus |first1=Jeffrey P. |last2=Whiticar |first2=MJ |last3=Brook |first3=EJ |last4=Petrenko |first4=VV |last5=Ferretti |first5=DF |last6=Severinghaus |first6=JP |date=25 August 2006 |title=Ice Record of {{chem|13|C}} for Atmospheric {{chem|CH|4}} Across the Younger Dryas-Preboreal Transition |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1126562 |pmid=16931759 |bibcode=2006Sci...313.1109S |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1109–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At one point there seemed to be stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment (such as [[ocean acidification]] and [[Stratification (water)|ocean stratification]]) and of the atmosphere over timescales of tens of thousands of years during the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] 56 million years ago, and most notably the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], when up to 96% of all marine species became extinct, 252 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |others=Narrated by Jack Fortune |date=5 December 2002 |title=The Day The Earth Nearly Died |series=Horizon |serieslink=Horizon (BBC TV series) |network=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/dayearthdied.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erwin1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Erwin DH|year=1993|title=The great Paleozoic crisis; Life and death in the Permian|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pattern of isotope shifts expected to result from a massive release of methane does not match the patterns seen there. First, the isotope shift is too large for this hypothesis, as it would require five times as much methane as is postulated for the PETM,&lt;ref name=Payne2004&gt;Payne, J.L., Lehrmann, D.J., Wei, J., Orchard, M.J., Schrag, D.P. and Knoll, A.H., 2004.

However, past hydrate dissociation at [[Svalbard]] eight thousand years ago has been attributed to [[isostatic rebound]] (continental uplift following [[deglaciation]]).&lt;ref name="Wallmann2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Nature Communications|year=2018|authors=Wallmann et al.|title=Gas hydrate dissociation off Svalbard induced by isostatic rebound rather than global warming|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02550-9|doi=10.1038/s41467-017-02550-9|pmid=29311564|pmc=5758787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible release events===
Two events possibly linked to methane excursions are the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM). Equatorial permafrost methane clathrate may have had a role in the sudden warm-up of "[[Snowball Earth]]", 630 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Martin |last2=Mrofka |first2=David |last3=Von Der Borch |first3=Chris |year=2008 |title=Snowball Earth termination by destabilization of equatorial permafrost methane clathrate |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature06961 |pmid=18509441 |bibcode=2008Natur.453..642K |volume=453 |issue=7195 |pages=642–645 |url=http://faculty.ucr.edu/~martink/pdfs/Kennedy_2008_Nature.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, warming at the end of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] is not thought to be due to methane release.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A similar event is the methane hydrate releases, following ice-sheet retreat during the [[last glacial period]], around 12,000 years ago, in response to the [[Bølling-Allerød warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/01/like-champagne-bottles-being-opened-scientists-document-an-ancient-arctic-methane-explosion|title=Like 'champagne bottles being opened': Scientists document an ancient Arctic methane explosion|publisher=The Washington Post|date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PNAS|volume=114|issue=24|pages=6215–6220|year=2017|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/24/6215|title=Postglacial response of Arctic Ocean gas hydrates to climatic amelioration|authors=Serov et al.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1619288114|pmid=28584081|pmc=5474808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methane clathrate, also known commonly as methane [[hydrate]], is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Potentially large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the Earth, although the estimates of total resource size given by various experts differ by many orders of magnitude, leaving doubt as to the size of methane clathrate deposits (particularly in the viability of extracting them as a fuel resource). Indeed, cores of greater than 10&amp;nbsp;centimeters' contiguous depth had only been found in three sites as of 2000, and some resource reserve size estimates for specific deposits/locations have been based primarily on seismology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collet |first1=Timothy S. |last2=Kuuskraa |first2=Vello A. |year=1998 |title=Hydrates contain vast store of world gas resources |journal=[[Oil and Gas Journal]] |volume=96 |issue=19 |pages=90–95 |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-19/in-this-issue/exploration/hydrates-contain-vast-store-of-world-gas-resources.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jean |last=Laherrere |date=May 3, 2000 |title=Oceanic Hydrates: More Questions Than Answers |journal=Energy Exploration &amp; Exploitation |volume=18 |pages=349–383 |issn=0144-5987 |doi=10.1260/0144598001492175 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits in [[runaway climate change]] could be a cause of past, future, and present climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; some have suggested that this was a main factor in the planet warming 6&amp;nbsp;°C, which happened during the end-Permian extinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Michael J. |last2=Twitchet |first2=Richard J. |date=July 2003 |title = How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event |journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=358–365 |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/2003TREEPTr.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Despite its atmospheric lifetime of around 12 years, it has a [[global warming potential]] of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years, and 33 when accounted for [[aerosol]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shindell |first1=Drew T. |last2=Faluvegi |first2=Greg |last3=Koch |first3=Dorothy M. |last4=Schmidt |first4=Gavin A. |last5=Unger |first5=Nadine |last6=Bauer |first6=Susanne E. |year=2009 |title=Improved attribution of climate forcing to emissions |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1174760 |pmid=19900930 |bibcode=2009Sci...326..716S |volume=326 |issue=5953 |pages=716–718}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen and [[hydroxyl radical]] content of the atmosphere.

=== Subsea permafrost ===
{{Main|Permafrost}}
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the [[continental shelves]] of the polar regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IPCC AR4 |date=2007 |title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-7-2-4.html |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks.

From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from subsea permafrost into the ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630&amp;nbsp;mg methane per square meter is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, when wind accelerates air-sea gas exchange, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically. Observations suggest that methane release from seabed permafrost will progress slowly, rather than abruptly. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by [[global warming]], and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more rapid methane release from this source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shakhova |first1=Natalia |last2=Semiletov |first2=Igor |last3=Leifer |first3=Ira |last4=Sergienko |first4=Valentin |last5=Salyuk |first5=Anatoly |last6=Kosmach |first6=Denis |last7=Chernykh |first7=Denis |last8=Stubbs |first8=Chris |last9=Nicolsky |first9=Dmitry |last10=Tumskoy |first10=Vladimir |last11=Gustafsson |first11=Örjan |date=November 24, 2013 |title=Ebullition and storm-induced methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/ngeo2007 |bibcode=2014NatGe...7...64S |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=64–70 |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n1/full/ngeo2007.html |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metastable methane clathrates===
Another kind of exception is in clathrates associated with the [[Arctic ocean]], where clathrates can exist in shallower water stabilized by lower temperatures rather than higher pressures; these may potentially be marginally stable much closer to the surface of the sea-bed, stabilized by a frozen 'lid' of [[permafrost]] preventing methane escape.

The so-called [[Self-preservation|self-preservation phenomenon]] has been studied by Russian geologists starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Istomin |first1=V. A. |last2=Yakushev |first2=V. S. |last3=Makhonina |first3=N. A. |last4=Kwon |first4=V. G. |last5=Chuvilin |first5=E.

=== Ocean anoxia ===
{{Main|Anoxic event}}
Euxinic (i.e. sulfidic) and anoxic events happened in the past on different time scales ranging from decades to centuries (from [[impact event]]s) or through climate change within tens of thousands of years or a few million years. According to Gregory Ryskin, such a scenario could lead to the release of methane and other gases (e.g., {{CO2}}, {{chem|H|2|S}}) into the atmosphere, from the ocean. Following [[atmospheric methane]] excursions he postulates explosions and burning of methane would produce lots of smoke and dust, which would first lead to [[global cooling]].&lt;ref name="Ryskin 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryskin |first=Gregory |date=September 2003 |title=Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions |journal=Geology |doi=10.1130/G19518.1 |bibcode=2003Geo....31..741R |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=741–744 |url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/31/9/741}}&lt;/ref&gt; And likely after a relatively short geological period following stratospheric cooling, [[global warming]] would take over.

== Current outlook ==
{{Main|Climate change in the Arctic}}
Most deposits of methane clathrate are in sediments too deep to respond rapidly, and modelling by [[David Archer (scientist)|Archer]] (2007) suggests the methane forcing should remain a minor component of the overall [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name="Archer2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Archer |first=D. |year=2007 |title=Methane hydrate stability and anthropogenic climate change |journal=Biogeosciences |doi=10.5194/bg-4-521-2007 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=521–544 |url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2007.hydrate_rev.pdf |format=PDF}} See also [http://www.realclimate.org/wp-trackback.php/227 blog summary].&lt;/ref&gt;  Clathrate deposits destabilize from the deepest part of their [[Gas hydrate stability zone|stability zone]], which is typically hundreds of metres below the seabed.  A sustained increase in sea temperature will warm its way through the sediment eventually, and cause the shallowest, most marginal clathrate to start to break down; but it will typically take on the order of a thousand years or more for the temperature signal to get through.&lt;ref name="Archer2007" /&gt;

Hong et al. 2017 studied methane seepage in the shallow arctic seas at the Barents Sea close to Svalbard. Temperature at the seabed has fluctuated seasonally over the last century, between -1.8 and 4.8&amp;nbsp;°C, it has only affected release of methane to a depth of about 1.6 meters at the sediment-water interface. Hydrates can be stable through the top 60 meters of the sediments and the current observed releases originate from deeper below the sea floor. They conclude that the increased methane flux started hundreds to thousands of years ago, noted about it, "..episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Wei-Li, et al.

==== Continental slopes ====
[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|Profile illustrating the continental shelf, slope and rise]]
A trapped gas deposit on the continental slope off Canada in the [[Beaufort Sea]], located in an area of small conical hills on the ocean floor is just 290 meters below sea level and considered the shallowest known deposit of methane hydrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corbyn |first=Zoë |date=December 7, 2012 |title=Locked greenhouse gas in Arctic sea may be 'climate canary' |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2012.11988 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/locked-greenhouse-gas-in-arctic-sea-may-be-climate-canary-1.11988 |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ESAS region averages 45 meters in depth, and it is assumed that below the seafloor, sealed by sub-sea permafrost layers, hydrates deposits are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/arctic-methane-outgassing-e-siberian-shelf-part1.html|title=Arctic methane outgassing on the E Siberian Shelf part 1 - the background|year=2012|work=SkepticalScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seismology|Seismic]] observation in 2012 of destabilizing methane hydrate along the continental slope of the eastern United States, following the intrusion of warmer ocean currents, suggests that underwater landslides could release methane. The estimated amount of methane hydrate in this slope is 2.5 gigatonnes (about 0.2% of the amount required to cause the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum|PETM]]), and it is unclear if the methane could reach the atmosphere. However, the authors of the study caution: "It is unlikely that the western North Atlantic margin is the only area experiencing changing ocean currents; our estimate of 2.5 gigatonnes of destabilizing methane hydrate may therefore represent only a fraction of the methane hydrate currently destabilizing globally." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phrampus |first1=B.

[[Bill McGuire (volcanologist)|Bill McGuire]] notes, "There may be a threat of submarine landslides around the margins of [[Greenland]], which are less well explored. Greenland is already uplifting, reducing the pressure on the crust beneath and also on submarine methane hydrates in the sediment around its margins, and increased seismic activity may be apparent within decades as active faults beneath the ice sheet are unloaded. This could provide the potential for the earthquake or methane hydrate destabilisation of submarine sediment, leading to the formation of submarine slides and, perhaps, tsunamis in the North Atlantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatestate.com/2014/10/16/methane-hydrate-destabilisation-is-clearly-a-real-worry-particularly-in-the-context-of-warming-ocean-waters-in-the-east-siberian-continental-shelf|title=Bill McGuire: Modelling suggests with ice cap melt, an increase in volcanic activity|year=2014|work=ClimateState.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Klaus Wallmann et al. 2018 concluded that hydrate dissociation at Svalbard 8,000 years ago was due to the rebound of the seabed following ice-sheet retreat. As a result the water depth got shallower with less hydrostatic pressure, without further warming. The study, also found that today's deposits at the site become unstable at a depth of ~ 400 meters, due to seasonal bottom water warming, and it remains unclear if this is due to natural variability or anthropogenic warming.&lt;ref name="Wallmann2018"/&gt;

Further, carbon stored in the land biosphere would decrease by less than 25%, suggesting a critical situation for ecosystems and farming, especially in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Atsushi Obata |author2=Kiyotaka Shibata |date=June 20, 2012 |title=Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model |journal=J.

'''Comanche''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|æ|n|tʃ|i}} is a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]] spoken by the [[Comanche people]], who split off from the [[Shoshone]] soon after they acquired [[horse]]s around 1705. The Comanche language and the [[Shoshoni language]] are therefore quite similar, although certain consonant changes in Comanche have inhibited mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLaughlin |first=John |year=1992 |title=A Counter-Intuitive Solution in Central Numic Phonology |journal=International Journal of American Linguistics |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=158–181|jstor=3519754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Language Boundaries and Phonological Borrowing in the Central Numic Languages |title=Uto-Aztecan: Structural, Temporal, and Geographical Perspectives |last=McLaughlin |first=John E. |editor=Casad, Gene |editor2=Willett, Thomas |year=2000 |publisher=University of Utah Press |location=Salt Lake City |isbn=970-689-030-0 |pages=293–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Comanche" comes from the [[Ute language|Ute]] word ''{{lang|com-Latn|kɨmantsi}}'' meaning "enemy, stranger".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sapir.  1931.  ''Southern Paiute Dictionary''.  Reprinted in 1992 in:  ''The Collected Works of Edward Sapir, X, Southern Paiute and Ute Linguistics and Ethnography''.  Ed. William Bright.  Berlin:  Mouton deGruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their own name for the language is ''{{IPA|nʉmʉ tekwap&lt;u&gt;ʉ&lt;/u&gt;}}'' which means "language of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Lila Wistrand Robinson &amp; James Armagost.  1990.  ''Comanche Dictionary and Grammar''.  Summer Institute of Linguistics and The University of Texas at Arlington Publications in Linguistics Publication 92.  Dallas, Texas:  The Summer Institute of Linguistics and The University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use and revitalization efforts ==

Although efforts are now being made to ensure its survival, most speakers of the language are elderly. In the late 19th century, Comanche children were placed in boarding schools where they were discouraged from speaking their native language, and even severely punished for doing so.  The second generation then grew up speaking English, because of the belief that it was better for them not to know Comanche.

The Comanche language was briefly prominent during [[World War II]]. A group of seventeen young men referred to as the Comanche [[Code talker|Code Talkers]] were trained and used by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to send messages conveying sensitive information in the Comanche language so that it could not be deciphered by the enemy.

As of July 2013, there are roughly 25-30 native speakers of the language, according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name = "mcdaniels"/&gt; An online class is available from the Learn Comanche organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Comanche has a typical [[Numic]] [[vowel]] inventory of six vowels. In addition, there is the common [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/ai/}}.  Historically, there was a certain amount of free variation between {{IPA|[ai]}} and {{IPA|[e]}} (as shown by comparison with Shoshoni cognates), but the variation is no longer so common and most morphemes have become fixed on either {{IPA|/ai/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Grammar of Comanche |last=Charney |first=Jean O. |year=1993 |series=Studies in the Anthropology of North American Indians |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-1461-8 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following chart, the basic symbols given are in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], whereas the equivalent symbols in the conventional orthography are given to the right of them, in parentheses and boldface. Note that Comanche also has [[voiceless]] vowels, but they are non-phonemic and therefore not represented in this chart. In the conventional orthography, these vowels are marked with an underline: '''a̱, e̱, i̱, o̱, u̱, ʉ̱'''.

|}

===Vowel length and voicing===

Comanche distinguishes vowels by length. Vowels can be either long or short. Long vowels are never devoiced and in the orthography they are represented as (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, ɨɨ). An example of a long vowel is the (ee) in [wakaréʔee] meaning 'turtle'.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; Short vowels can be lengthened when they are stressed.  Short vowels can be either voiced or voiceless.  Unstressed short vowels are usually devoiced when /s/ or /h/ follows and optionally when word-final.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

=== Consonants ===

Comanche has a typical [[Numic]] [[consonant]] inventory.&lt;ref name="Charney1993" /&gt; As with the vowel charts, the basic symbols given in this chart are in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], whereas the equivalent symbols in the conventional orthography are given to the right of them in parentheses and boldface.

|}

=== Stress ===

Comanche stress most commonly falls on the first syllable. Exceptions to this rule, such as in the words ''Waʔsáasiʔ'', meaning '[[Osage Nation|Osage people]]', and ''aná'', meaning 'ouch!', are marked with an acute accent.

For the purpose of stress placement, the [[diphthong]]s /ai/, /oi/, and /ui/ act as one vowel with one [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]. Additionally, possessive pronouns, which serve as [[Clitic|proclitics]], do not affect the stress of a word (so that ''nʉ + námi'' 'my sister' retains its stress on the /a/ in ''námi'').

[[Secondary stress]] is placed on the second syllable of a two-syllable word, the third syllable of a word with three, four, or five syllables, and the fourth syllable of a word with six syllables.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"&gt;{{cite book |title=Comanche Dictionary and Grammar |last=Robinson|first=Lila Wistrand |authorlink= |author2=James Armagost|year=1992 |series= |publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics, Inc. |location=Arlington, Texas|isbn=0-88312-715-6 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Primary stress'''

Primary stress is "marked when it is non-initial stress".&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; In addition, "when a pronoun is suffixed by, for instance a postposition, the pronoun does take primary - and initial - stress."&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; An example is [nɨvía] nɨ-pia, which means my mother (my-mother).&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; In the following data where primary stress appears it will be shown as an "acute accent."&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; Primary stress is found in words or compounds of three, six and five syllables. However, when primary stress is marked in a third syllable it can also be consider as a secondary stress according to [[Elliott D. Canonge|Canonge]]'s but an "exception to this case is when both a proclitic and prefix are used."&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; An example of a third syllable stress is [há.bi+hu.píi.tu] which means 'stopped and lay down'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; Words with "five syllables have primary stress on the first syllable."  An example is [ká.wo+nò.ka.tu] which means 'stress'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; Also, words with six syllables have primary stress on the first syllable.  An example is [kú.ʔi.na.kù.ʔe.tu]  which means 'rosts for'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt;

*'''Non-initial stress'''

Non-initial stress can be found in any syllable of a word that is not in the initial position and it can also fall on long vowel. Also, the "initial syllable never weakens to the point of voicelessness"
&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; However, some exceptions to the non-initial stress are animal and plant names because some of them end with a stress long vowel plus which is represented by "ʔ".&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;"Loans are common sources of words with nonitinal stress" an example is [pirísii] pitísii, which means 'policeman'.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; A word with two stresses is [ánikúra] ánikúta, which means ant (analysis unknown).&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

*'''Alternating stress'''
Alternating stress occurs when there are words with three four, five and six syllables. In addition alternating stress is given "when nouns of compound are coequal, a root or stem has one-syllable suffix."&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; Also, prefixes or not stem-changes do not receive an indicial stress because the alternating stress "begins on the second syllable as in the following word of six syllables, following the pattern of   five-syllable words."&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; An example is [wu.hká.ʔa.mí.ʔanu] which means 'went to cut down'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; An examples of alternating stress in a four, five and six syllabuses are [á.ni.múi ]'housefly', [yú.pu.sí.a] meaning 'louse' and [wuh+tú.pu káʔ 'buckle] which meaning 'button'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; A examples of three syllables is [wáhkát ìmat òʔiàt I] waha=-?? twelve, which means 'two-??'.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt;

*'''Stress shift'''

Stress shift occurs when "verves often exhibit stylistic stress shift when occurring at the end of a breathing group."&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; In addition, stress moves "one syllable to the right if that syllable is voiced; otherwise it skips over the voiceless vowels to the next syllable". An example is [pohínu ]'jumped.&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt; According to Charney stress shift is caused by a suffixes-n which cause a 'right ward shift of stress in form with the shape CVHCV or CVhV."&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; Examples of CVHCV is [marohtíkwan] ma-toH-tíkwa-n which means 'he hit him' and an example of CVhv is [pahín] pahi-n which means 'he fell'.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;
By using the form CVHCV or CVhV we can see that -h "is presented as a second or a precipitated consonant".&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; However, "stress does not shift rightwards when the verb root does not contain [h].&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; An example is  [nómiʔan] no-miʔa-n meaning 'they moved camp.'&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

=== Phonological processes ===

* '''[[Free variation|Free Variation]]''': although not often reflected in the orthography, certain sounds occur in free variation. For instance, {{IPA|/j/}} can be pronounced as a {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (for example: ''ma yaa'' {{IPA|[ma dʒaː]}}), and a labialized {{IPA|/k/}} can be voiced (as in ''nʉ gwʉhʉ'': it is written '''gw''', even though it is more accurately {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}, just as the labialized {{IPA|/k/}} is written in Comanche as '''kw''' rather than {{IPA|/kʷ/}}). In contemporary times, preaspiration and preglottalization may occur in free variation with a long vowel: ''aakaaʔ'' / ''ahkaaʔ'' ('devil's horn').
* '''[[Lenition|Spirantization]]''': spirantization can occur in the phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} when they are preceded by vowels. {{IPA|/p/}} becomes the voiced bilabial fricative, {{IPA|[β]}}, usually written as a '''b''', and {{IPA|/t/}} becomes the voiced alveolar tap, {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, written as an '''r'''. An intervening {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/ʔ/}} does not block this spirantization process, as seen in ''tuaʔbaʔa'' 'on the son' (the sound {{IPA|[β]}} is written here as '''b''', and is [[Allophone|allophonic]] with the Comanche {{IPA|/p/}}). In the past, there was a process of nasalization in Comanche which has since been lost and which blocked spirantization; certain words that would otherwise exhibit spirantization in modern Comanche do not, therefore, as a result of the historical presence of what would have been a preceding nasal (''ʉ papi'' 'your head' would historically have been ''ʉn papi'').
* '''[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]]''': A fairly regular process of metathesis occurs, sporadically with voiceless consonants and regularly with voiced consonants. It is accompanied by the deletion of a vowel: ''otʉnhʉh'' &gt; ''orʉhʉ'' &gt; ''ohrʉ'' ('they', dual). In modern Comanche, voiceless, unaspirated stops followed by a long {{IPA|/ɨ/}} (written '''ʉ''') and an {{IPA|/h/}} may be realized as aspirated equivalents at the expense of the subsequent long vowel and {{IPA|[h]}}: ''pitsipʉ&amp;#x0331;ha'' &gt; ''pitsipʰa'' ('milk').
* '''[[Preaspiration]] and [[Glottalization#Glottal reinforcement|Preglottalization]]''': Certain consonants undergo preaspiration word medially, namely, {{IPA|/n/}} and the voiceless, unaspirated stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} (rendered in the IPA as {{IPA|[ʰn]}}, {{IPA|[ʰp]}}, {{IPA|[ʰt]}}, {{IPA|[ʰk]}}, respectively). It is usually written with an '''h''' before the consonant, as in ''aworahna'' 'cupboard' or ''ekasahpanaʔ'' 'soldier'. Similarly, many of the same consonants can also undergo preglottalization, which is written with '''ʔ''' before the consonant (resulting in the digraphs '''ʔn''', '''ʔb''', '''ʔw''', and '''ʔr'''), as in ''hunuʔbiʔ'' 'creek' or ''taʔwoʔiʔ'' 'gun'.
* '''Organic and Inorganic [[voiceless|Devoicing]]''': each Comanche vowel has an allophonic [[voiceless]] (or "whispered") equivalent. The devoicing process in Comanche follows a predictable pattern, and can be broken down into two categories - organic (compulsory) and inorganic (optional).
** A vowel which precedes an /s/ or an /h/ undergoes induced '''organic devoicing''', provided that the vowel is unstressed, [[Vowel length|short]], and not part of a cluster (contrast ''sit&lt;s&gt;&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/u&gt;suʔa'', 'this one also', which undergoes organic devoicing, with the similar word ''sit&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;suʔa'', 'these ones also', which does not because the vowel is not short). Two adjacent syllables cannot both have organic voiceless vowels. In such a situation, the second vowel does not devoice.
** The second type of devoicing that can occur in Comanche is '''inorganic devoicing'''. Short vowels that are not part of a cluster may be optionally devoiced at the end of a breath group, and this may apply even if the preceding vowel has undergone organic devoicing. Additionally, an inorganic, voiceless vowel conditions optional lengthening of a voiced penultimate vowel if there is no intervening [[Preaspiration|preaspirated]] consonant (for example, ''kaasa̲'' 'wing' and ''oomo̲'' 'leg').&lt;ref name="Robinson 92"/&gt;

== Morphology ==

Like many languages of the Americas, Comanche can be classified as a [[polysynthetic language]].

=== Nouns ===

Comanche nouns are inflected for case and number, and the language possesses a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] number. Like many Uto-Aztecan languages, nouns may take an [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] suffix. Many cases are also marked using [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]].

Personal pronouns exist for three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual, and plural) and three [[Grammatical person|persons]]. They have different forms depending on whether or not they are the subject or object of a verb, possessive (including [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] possessive forms), or the object of a postposition. Like many [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|languages of the Americas]], Comanche first-person plural pronouns have both [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive forms]].

The Comanche paradigm for nominal number suffixes is illustrated below:

: '''Notes:'''

* The objective and possessive forms differ only in their final feature: [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] is applied at the end of the possessive suffixes.
* The two dual suffixes are not technically distinct and may be used interchangeably. However, the first of the two (Dual I) is preferred for humans.
* The absolutive suffix may be dropped before the addition of these suffixes.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

=== Verbs ===

Many of the verb stems regularly are [[Suppletion|suppletive]]: [[intransitive verb]]s are suppletive for [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular versus plural]] [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[transitive verbs]] are suppletive for singular versus plural [[Object (grammar)|object]].  Verbs can take various affixes, including [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporated]] nouns before the stem.  Most verb affixes are suffixes, except for voicing-changing prefixes and instrumental prefixes.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

[[File:Comanche_Affix_Order_Paradigm.png|right|thumb|'''Note''': ''-HU=(1)'' is a particular affix which adds the meaning 'to accomplish a goal']]
The verb stem can take a number of prefixes and suffixes. A sketch of all the elements that may be affixed to the verb is given on the right:

In addition to verbal affixes, Comanche verbs can also be augmented by other verbs. Although in principle Comanche verbs may be freely combined with other verbs, in actuality only a handful of verbs, termed [[auxiliary verb]]s, are frequently combined with others. These forms take the full range of aspectual suffixes. Common auxiliary verbs in Comanche include ''hani'' 'to do, make', ''naha'' 'to be, become', ''miʔa'' 'to go', and ''katʉ / yʉkwi'' 'to sit'. An example of how the verbs combine: ''katʉ'' 'to sit' + ''miʔa'' 'to go' = ''katʉmiʔa'' ''to ride (and go)''.

====Instrumental prefixes====

As mentioned above, Comanche has a rich repertoire of [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] prefixes, and certain verbs (termed instrumental verbs) cannot occur without an instrumental prefix. These prefixes can affect the transitivity of a verb. The Comanche instrumental prefixes are listed below:
* ''kʉh-'' = 'with the teeth, chin, mouth'
* ''kuh-'' = 'with heat, fire'
* ''ma-'' = 'with the hand' and as a generalized instrumental
* ''mu-'' / ''muh'' = 'with the nose, lips, front'
* ''nih-'' = 'verbally'
* ''pih-'' = 'with the buttocks, rear (e.g., of a car)'
* ''sʉ-'' = 'with cold'; [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] is applied at the end of the prefix
* ''sʉh-'' = 'with the foot, in a violent motion'
* ''su-'' = 'with the mind, mental activity'; fortis is applied at the end of the prefix
* ''tah-'' = 'with the foot'
* ''toh-'' = 'with the hand, violent or completed action'
* ''tsah-'' = 'with the hand (extended to hand tools)'
* ''tsih-'' = 'with a sharp point, with the finger'
* ''tsoh-'' = 'with the head'
* ''wʉh-'' = an all-purpose instrumental

== Syntax ==

Comanche parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, and [[interjection]]s (such as ''haa'' 'yes' and ''kee'' 'no'), as well as [[Grammatical particle|particles]].

The [[word order]] is [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]: Subject - Object - Verb. But while the standard word order in Comanche is SOV, it can shift in two specific circumstances. The [[topic–comment|topic]] of a sentence, though marked with one of two particles, is often placed at the beginning of the sentence, defying the standard word order. Furthermore, the subject of a sentence is often placed second in a sentence. When the subject is also the topic, as is often the case, it ends up in the first position, preserving SOV word order; otherwise, the subject will be placed second. For example, the English sentence 'I hit the man' could be rendered in Comanche with the components in either of the following two orders: 'I' (topic) 'man' (object) 'hit' (an aspect marker) - the standard SOV word order - or 'man' (object and topic) 'I' 'hit' (an aspect marker) - an [[Object–subject–verb|OSV]] word order, which accentuates the role of the man who was hit.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt;

=== Switch reference ===

Like other Numic languages, Comanche has [[switch-reference]] markers to handle subordination.&lt;ref name="Charney1993"/&gt; This refers to markers which indicate whether or not a subordinate verb has the same or different subject as the main verb, and in the case of Comanche, also the temporal relation between the two verbs.

When the verb of a [[Dependent clause|subordinate clause]] has a different subject from the verb of the [[Independent clause|main clause]], and the time of the verbs is simultaneous, the subordinate verb is marked with ''-ku'', and its subject is marked as if it were an object. When the time of the verbs is not simultaneous, the subordinate verb is marked with one of several affixes depending on the [[Length (phonetics)|duration]] of the subordinate verb and whether it refers to an action which occurred before that described by the main verb or one which occurred after.

== Writing system ==

The Comanche Alphabet was developed by Dr. [[Alice Anderton]], a linguistic anthropologist, and was adopted as the official Comanche Alphabet by the [[Comanche Nation]] in 1994. The alphabet is as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! Alphabet || Pronunciation || Alphabet || Pronunciation || Alphabet || Pronunciation || Alphabet || Pronunciation || Alphabet || Pronunciation || Alphabet || Pronunciation
|- 
| a || /a/ || b || {{IPA|[β]}} /p/ || e || /e/ || h || /h/ || i || /i/ || k || /k/ 
|- 
| m || /m/ || n || /n/ || o || /o/ || p || [p] /p/ || r || {{IPA|[ɾ]}} /t/ || s || /s/ 
|- 
| t || [t] /t/ || u || /u/ || ʉ || /ə/ || w || /w/ || y || /j/ || {{IPA|ʔ}} || {{IPA|/ʔ/}} 
|}

: '''Notes:'''

* Long vowels are indicated by doubling the vowel: '''aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, ʉʉ'''.
* Voiceless vowels are indicated by an underline: '''a̱, e̱, i̱, o̱, u̱, ʉ̱'''.
* When the stress does not fall on the first syllable of the word, it is marked with an acute accent '''´''': ''{{lang|com-Latn|kʉtséena}}'' 'coyote'.
* The glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is sometimes written as '''?'''.
* The phonemes {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}} are written as '''ts''' and '''kw''', respectively.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1956 film ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], there are several badly pronounced Comanche words interspersed, such as "nawyecka" (''nooyʉka'' 'move camp around') and "timoway" (''tʉmʉʉ'' 'buy, trade').

In the 1963 film ''[[McLintock!]]'', also starring [[John Wayne]], McLintock (Wayne) and Chief Puma (Michael Pate) speak Comanche several times throughout the film.

In a 2013 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article, linguist Todd McDaniels of [[Comanche Nation College]] commented on [[Johnny Depp]]'s attempts to speak the Comanche language in the film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'', saying "The words were there, the pronunciation was shaky but adequate."&lt;ref name="mcdaniels"&gt;{{Cite news

In the 2016 film ''[[The Magnificent Seven (2016 film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'' two of the titular characters, a Comanche warrior named Red Harvest and Sam Chisholm, an African-American warrant officer, speak Comanche to each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1135">In the [[common law]], '''emblements''' are annual crops produced by cultivation legally belonging to the [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] with the implied right for its harvest, and are treated as the tenant's property.&lt;ref&gt;''Dutton v.

In these situations, the doctrine of emblements operates to guarantee the farmer's right to reap and carry away the fruits of his labor even if he loses title to the land on which they are grown.&lt;ref&gt;''Pittman v.

'''Jacob of Edessa''' (or '''James of Edessa''') ({{lang-syr|ܝܥܩܘܒ ܐܘܪܗܝܐ|Ya'qub Urhoy}}) (c. 640 – 5 June 708) was one of the most distinguished of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] writers.

==Life==
Jacob of Edessa was born in Aindaba ([[Arabic]]: عيندابا) at 50 km west of [[Aleppo]], around 640. He studied at the famous monastery of [[Qinnasrin]] (on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]], and later at [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=soc&gt;[http://soc-wus.org/2010%20News/652010121519.php "St. Jacob (James) of Edessa (+ June 5th, 708)", Syrian Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from Alexandria he became a monk at Edessa, where he was known for his learning. Ordained a priest in 672, he was appointed [[List of bishops of Edessa|metropolitan of Edessa]] by his friend [[Athanasius II, Patriarch of Antioch|Athanasius II]], [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]]. He held this office for three or four years, but the clergy opposed his strict enforcement of the Church canons. He was not supported by Julian II, the successor of Athanasius. In response to Julian's suggestion that he temporize his criticisms, he publicly burned a copy of the neglected canons in front of Julian's residence and retired to the monastery of [[Kaisum]] near [[Samosata]]. From there to the monastery of [[Eusebona]] where, for eleven years, he taught the Psalms and the reading of the Scriptures in Greek. Towards the close of this period Jacob again encountered opposition, this time from monks who despised the Greeks.&lt;ref name=soc/&gt;

Jacob left Eusebona and proceeded to the great convent of Tel {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ade ([[Arabic]]: تل عدا), one of several Syriac Orthodox monasteries on the 'mountain of Edessa' (? modern [[Tellgdi]], northwest of [[Aleppo]]), where he spent nine years in revising and amending the [[Peshitta]] version of the [[Old Testament]] with the aid of the various Greek versions.&lt;ref name=soc/&gt; Jacob played a prominent part in the synod Julian convened in 706.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt;

He was finally recalled to the bishopric of Edessa in 708, but died four months later.&lt;ref name=Gigot&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08277b.htm Gigot, Francis. "James of Edessa." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 29 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrinal allegiance==

Jacob belonged to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and his writings have a definite [[Miaphysite]] character. In the literature of his country he holds much the same place as St. Jerome does among the Latins.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt; [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani|Assemani]] tried hard to prove him orthodox (''B.O.'' i. 470 sqq.) but changed his opinion on reading his biography by [[Barhebraeus]] (ib. ii. 3–7). See especially Lamy, ''Dissert. de Syrorum fide'', pp.&amp;nbsp;206 sqq. i Text at Leipzig 1889 (''Das Buch der Erkenntniss der Wahrheit oder der Ursache aller Ursachen''): translation (posthumously) at Strassburg 1893.

==Writings==

Most of his works are in prose.  Few have been published.  In 1911 most of the information available was to be found in [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]]'s ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'' and [[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]]'s ''Catalogue of Syriac MSS in the British Museum''.

===Biblical works and commentaries===

Jacob produced a revision of the bible, based on the [[Peshitta]].  [[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]] calls this a curious eclectic or patchwork text. Five volumes survive in Europe ([[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]], ''Catalogue'' 38). This was the last attempt at a revision of the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Jacob was also the chief founder of the Syriac [[Oral Torah|Massorah]] among the Syrians, which produced such manuscripts as the one (Vat. cliii.) described by Wiseman in ''Horae syriacae'', part iii.

He also wrote commentaries and [[scholia]] on the bible.  Specimens of these are given by Assemani and [[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]]. They are quoted a lot by later commentators, who often refer to Jacob as the "Interpreter of the Scriptures".

He also wrote a ''Hexahemeron'', or treatise on the six days of creation. Manuscripts of this exist at [[Leiden]] and at [[Lyon]]. It was his last work, and being left incomplete was finished by his friend George the bishop of the Arabs.

He translated the apocryphal ''History of the Rechabites'' composed by [[Zosimus]] from Greek into Syriac ([[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]], ''Catalogue'' 1128, and [[François Nau|Nau]] in ''Revue semitique'' vi. 263, vii. 54, 136).

===Canons and Liturgy===

Jacob made a collection of ecclesiastical canons.  In his letter to the priest Addai we possess a collection of canons from his pen, given in the form of answers to Addai's questions. These were edited by [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]] in ''Reliquiae juris eccl. syriace'', pp.&amp;nbsp;117 sqq. and [[Thomas Joseph Lamy]] in ''Dissert''. pp.&amp;nbsp;98 sqq.

Additional canons were given in [[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]]'s ''Notulae syriacae''.

All of them have been translated and expounded by [[Carl Kayser]], ''[https://archive.org/details/diecanonesjacob00kaysgoog Die Canones Jacobs von Edessa]'' (Leipzig, 1886).

He also made many contributions to Syriac [[liturgy]], both original and as translations from Greek. As a liturgical author, Jacob drew up an anaphora, or liturgy, revised the Liturgy of St. James, wrote the celebrated "Book of Treasures", composed orders of baptism, of the blessing of water on the eve of the Epiphany, and of the celebration of matrimony, to which may be added his translation of Severus's order of Baptism.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Jacob's chief original contribution was his ''Enchiridion'' or ''Manual'', a tract on philosophical terms ([[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]], ''Catalogue'' 984).

Translations of works of Aristotle have been attributed to him.  However these are probably by other hands ([[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]], ''Short History'' p.&amp;nbsp;149; Duval, ''Littérature syriaque'', pp.&amp;nbsp;255, 258).

The treatise ''De cause omnium causarum'', which was the work of a bishop of Edessa, was formerly attributed to Jacob; but the publication of the whole by Kayser has made it clear that the treatise is of much later date.

===History===

Jacob also wrote a ''Chronicle'', as a continuation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]].  This is described and quoted from by [[Michael the Syrian]] in book 7 of his own ''Chronicle''.

The original text of Jacob's continuation has unfortunately perished apart from 23 leaves in a manuscript in the British Library. Of these a full account is given in [[William Wright (orientalist)|Wright]], ''Catalogue'' 1062, and an edition of these has been published in CSCO by E.W.Brooks.

===Grammar===

Jacob is most famous because of his contributions to the Syriac language and the West Syriac script (Serto).

In early Syriac vowels are either not shown, or else shown by a system of dots, used erratically.  Jacob borrowed five vowel signs from Greek, which he wrote above the line as miniature symbols.  This caught on, and is a feature of West Syriac writing even today.  He also elaborated the system whereby some consonants could stand for vowels.

Jacob also tried to introduce the Greek practice of writing the vowels on the line, the same way as is done for the consonants.  This was resisted by his countrymen and did not come into effect.

In his letter to George, bishop of [[Serugh]], on Syriac orthography (published by Phillips in London 1869, and by Martin in Paris the same year) he sets forth the importance of fidelity by scribes in the copying of minutiae of spelling.

===Other===

As a translator Jacob's greatest achievement was his Syriac version of the ''Homiliae cathedrales'' of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the monophysite patriarch of Antioch. This important collection is now in part known to us by [[E. W. Brooks]]'s edition and translation of the 6th book of selected epistles of Severus, according to another Syriac version made by [[Athanasius of Nisibis]] in 669. ([[Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre]] says 677; but Athanasius was patriarch only 684–687.)

A large number of letters by Jacob to various correspondents have been found in various MSS. Besides those on the canon law to Addai, and on grammar to George of Serugh referred to above, there are others dealing with doctrine, liturgy, and so forth. A few are in verse.

'''Judit Kormos''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈjudit ˈkormoʃ}}) (born 1970) is a professor of [[applied linguistics]] at the [[Lancaster University]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/profiles/judit-kormos|title=Dr. Judit Kormos - Department of Linguistics and English Language|date=5 July 2014|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is renowned for her work on [[motivation in second language learning]], and [[self-regulated learning|self-regulation]] in [[second language writing]]. Her current interest is in [[dyslexia]] in second language learning.

Along with [[Rosa Manchón]] she has been noted for her work on the cognitive dimension of the acquisition and use of second languages, with  emphasis on the psycholinguistic dimension of textual production and along with [[Alister Cumming|Cumming]], [[Ken Hyland|Hyland]], Manchón, [[Paul Kei Matsuda|Matsuda]], [[Lourdes Ortega|Ortega]], [[Charlene Polio|Polio]], [[Neomy Storch|Storch]] and [[Marjolijn Verspoor|Verspoor]] she has been considered as one of the most influential researchers on second language writing.{{By whom|date=October 2018}}

== Career ==
Kormos graduated at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1994. Kormos gained her [[PhD]] at the Eötvös Loránd University in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doktori.hu/index.php?menuid=192&amp;sz_ID=2828&amp;popup=1|title=Személyi adatlap|date=5 July 2014|publisher=ELTE BTK Doktori Iskola}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her PhD was supervised by [[Zoltán Dörnyei]]. Kormos took up a lecturer position at the [[Lancaster University]] in 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/contacts/detail/ntfs/2013/Kormos_Judit_profile_ntfs_2013|title=DR Judit Kormos|date=5 July 2014|publisher=The Higher Education Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to a Readership in 2012. She chose to be called ''Reader in Second Language Acquisition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/stories/1647/|title=Judit Kormos promoted to a Readership|date=1 October 2012|publisher=[[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2015, Kormos was awarded a personal chair. Her title became "Professor of Second Language Acquisition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/stories/2482|title=Judit Kormos awarded a personal chair|date=8 January 2015|publisher=[[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the coordinator of the Dyslexia For Teachers Of English Foreign Language Project, funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dystefl.eu/index.php?id=3&amp;L=4%27|title=DysTEFL|date=5 July 2014|publisher=DYSTEFL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, she has been a member of the editorial board of the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-second-language-writing/editorial-board&lt;/ref&gt; She has been an Editor of Special Thematic Issues and Associate Journal Editor of the [[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679922|title=Language Learning|date=2018|publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Kormos was interviewed by the Hungarian television channel [[ATV (Hungary)|ATV]] on recent changes in foreign language teaching policies in Hungary. She emphasised the important role of teaching students to learn foreign languages independently and autonomously with the help of modern technological tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/clippings/interview-on-hungarian-television-about-language-learning-policy%2862ad082f-fcca-47df-b4fe-14a3909294bd%29.html|title=Interview on Hungarian television about language learning policy|date=28 December 2012|publisher=DYSTEFL}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2014, [[Pearson Education]] released a new video lecture series on dyslexia and foreign language learning on [[YouTube]]. Kormos features in the first video of the series and discusses the psychological effects of dyslexia on the processes of foreign language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/stories/2299/|title=Judit Kormos features in lecture series on the effects of dyslexia on foreign language learning|date=21 May 2014|publisher=[[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-nrMvocyk8&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Dyslexic Learners in the EFL Classroom: Part 1 |date=2 April 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Kormos together with a European team from five partner countries won the ELTons award of the [[British Council]] in the Excellence in Course Innovation category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/stories/2300/|title=Judit Kormos and the Dystefl team win British Council ELTon award|date=23 May 2014|publisher=[[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishagenda.britishcouncil.org/eltons|title=The ELTons Awards 2014|date=23 May 2014|publisher=[[British Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 2014, she was cited in the Education webpage of the [[Guardian.co.uk|''Guardian'']] in a recent article on teaching languages to students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/20/learning-languages-special-education-needs|title=Inspiring students with learning disabilities to take up a language|date=20 June 2014|publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Khoemana''''', also known as '''Korana''' or '''Griqua''', is a [[Moribund language|moribund]] [[Khoe languages|Khoe language]] of South Africa.

==Names==
"Khoemana" (from ''khoe'' 'person' + ''mana'' 'language') is more commonly known as either '''Korana''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n|ə}} or '''Griqua''' (also Gri {{IPA|[xri]}}, Xri, Xiri, Xirikwa),.&lt;ref&gt;The ''-kwa'' is also a grammatical suffix. The letter "g" for the sound {{IPAblink|x}} reflects [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] orthography&lt;/ref&gt; These names reflect the endonym '''ǃOra''' {{IPA-all|ǃoɾa}} or '''!Gora''' {{IPA-all|gǃoɾa}}.&lt;ref&gt;The ''-na'' is a grammatical suffix&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes !Ora is also known as '''Cape Khoe''' or Cape Hottentot, though the latter is derogatory. The various names are often treated as different languages (called '''South Khoekhoe''' when taken together), but they do not correspond to any actual dialect distinctions, and speakers may use "Korana" and "Griqua" interchangeably. Both names are also used more broadly, for example for the mixed-race [[Griqua people]]. There exist (or existed) several dialects of Khoemana, but the details are unknown.&lt;ref name=killian&gt;Killian, D. [https://helda.helsinki.fi//bitstream/handle/10138/229407/Khoemana_and_the_Griqua.pdf ''Khoemana and the Griqua'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Khoemana is closely related to [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]], and the sound systems are broadly similar. The strongly aspirated Khoekhoe affricates are simply aspirated plosives {{IPA|[tʰ, kʰ]}} in Khoemana. However, Khoemana has an ejective velar affricate, {{IPA|/kxʼʔ/}},&lt;ref&gt;An ejective velar "scrape" followed by a glottal stop, a bit different from a typical velar ejective affricate&lt;/ref&gt; which is not found in Khoekhoe, and a [[Glottalized click#Ejective clicks|corresponding series of clicks]], {{IPA|/ǀ͡xʼ ǁ͡xʼ ǃ͡xʼ ǂ͡xʼ/}}. Beach (1938)&lt;ref&gt;D. Beach, 1938. ''The Phonetics of the Hottentot Language''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had a [[velar lateral ejective affricate]], {{IPA|[k͡ʟ̝̊ʼ]}}, a common realisation or allophone of {{IPA|/kxʼ/}} in languages with clicks, and it might be expected that this is true for Khoemana as well. In addition, about half of all [[lexical word]]s in Khoemana began with a click, compared to a quarter in Khoekhoe.

* The phoneme [k] can be realized as /c/ before [e] or [i].
* An intervocalic [p] and [b] are sometimes realized as /β/.
* [s] is stated to be alveolar-postalveolar when not followed by a close front vowel [i], [ĩ], or [e].
* The aspirated phoneme [tʰ] is realized as an affricate sound /ts/ when followed by a close front vowel [i], [ĩ], or [e].
* The aspirated sound [kʰ] can sometimes be realized as [kx]. Some Griqua speakers may pronounce [kʰ] as [kʼ].
* The [tsʼ] sound only seldom occurs.
* [m] and [n] can occur syllabically as [m̩] and [n̩].
* The trilled [r] can also be realized as a flapped [ɾ] in some speech.
* Voicing can be very weak in Khoemana in casual speech, so voiced plosives can be hard to distinguish from voiceless plosives.&lt;ref name="killian" /&gt;

==Population==
Reports as to the number of Khoemana speakers are contradictory, but it is clear that it is nearly extinct. It was thought to be extinct until the discovery of four elderly speakers around Bloemfontein and Kimberley.&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis, Menan (2011) "Collection of sound files for inclusion in a dictionary of Korana and eventual integration with a corpus of heritage texts"&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report by Don Killian of the [[University of Helsinki]] estimated that there were less than 30 speakers at the time.&lt;ref name=killian/&gt; Matthias Brenzinger reported in 2012 that one possible speaker remained, but that she refused to speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/kqz Korana] at Endangered Languages.com&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancies could be because the language has multiple dialects and goes by several names, with scholars not always referring to the same population.&lt;ref name=killian/&gt; Khoemana is listed as "critically endangered" in [[UNESCO]]'s ''Language Atlas''.&lt;ref name=unesco &gt;UNESCO [http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1442.html Xiri] at ''UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger''&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of this [[endangered language]] would have a significant impact on the heritage and culture of Khoemana speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Endangerment in Southern and Eastern Africa|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9783110170498|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=179–204|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestation==
Robust Khoemana (before more recent [[language attrition]]) is principally recorded in an 1879 notebook by [[Lucy Lloyd]], which contains five short stories; some additional work was done in Ponelis (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Ponelis, F.

==History==
{{see also|!Kora Wars}}
The people and their language first began to attract scholarly attention in the 1660s, coinciding with Dutch colonial efforts in the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and the resulting armed conflicts.&lt;ref name=killian/&gt; At the time, Khoemana was widely spoken throughout the coastal regions of South Africa. After years of attrition during the colonial era to the 1930s, and under [[apartheid]] from 1948 to 1994, the language has all but vanished.&lt;ref name=killian/&gt; Currently, speakers of Khoemana are not only scarce but scattered, due to forced migrations during the apartheid era. This has rendered the language particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=erasmus&gt;Erasmus, P.

'''Leonardo de la Caridad Padura Fuentes''' (born on October 10th, 1955) is a [[Cuba|Cuban]] novelist and journalist.  {{As of|2007}}, he is one of Cuba's best known writers internationally.  In his native Spanish, as well as in English and some other languages, he is often referred to by the shorter form of his name, '''Leonardo Padura'''. He has written screenplays, two books of short stories and a series of detective novels translated into 10 languages. In 2012, Padura was awarded the [[National Prize for Literature (Cuba)|National Prize for Literature]], Cuba's national literary award and the most important award of its kind. In 2015, he was awarded with the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Premio Principe de Asturias de las Letras]] of Spain, one of the most important literary prizes in the Spanish speaking world and usually considered as the Iberoamerican Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name=ht2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=83760 |title=Cuba’s National Literature Prize Awarded to Leonardo Padura  |work=[[Havana Times]] |author=[[Staff writer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Padura, who was born in [[Havana]], took a degree in [[Latin American literature]] at the [[universidad de La Habana|University of Havana]]. In 1980 he first came to prominence as an investigative journalist in a literary magazine called ''[[Caimán Barbudo]]'', a well-established publication that is still in print today. He subsequently became known as an [[essay]]ist and a writer of [[screenplay]]s and in particular, [[detective novel]]s. 
  
He wrote his first short novel between 1983 and 1984. Titled ''[[Fiebre de caballos]]'' (Horse Fever), it was basically a love story. He then spent the next six years continuing to work as a journalist, reporting on a wide range of cultural and historical topics. However, around this time he began to write his first novel featuring police officer Mario Conde, and while he was writing it, Padura realised how fundamental his years as a journalist were to his development as a writer. Firstly it gave him a whole new experience of the country, and secondly, it consequently changed his style with respect to his first book.

In 2013, France named him a ''Chevalier'' of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language=fr | title=Leonardo PADURA, Officier des Arts et des Lettres|url=http://www.ambafrance-cu.org/Leonardo-Padura-Officier-des-Arts|website=French Embassy in Cuba|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padura still lives and writes in his native city of Havana. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.planetadelibros.com/autor/leonardo-padura/000029310&lt;/ref&gt;
"In one of his essays entitled 'I would like to be Paul Auster,' Padura complains that he would love not to be constantly asked about politics in his country and why he continues living there. But this is very much his niche: he is widely seen as the best writer in Cuba, a country whose best writers were all formed before Castro rule. He offers us an off-the-beaten-path visit of a relatively closed society, a prose that is free of propaganda (though not liberated from surveillance). By occupying a small but significant critical space in Cuba, Padura becomes more interesting for Cuba observers and more intriguing for students of cultural and literary trends in the island."&lt;ref&gt;See Yvon Grenier, ''Culture and the Cuban State'', chapter 5 "How To Write From Mantilla, Or The Small Heresies Of Leonardo Padura" (Lexington Books, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Mario Conde books===
Padura is best known in the English-speaking world for his quartet of detective novels featuring lieutenant Mario Conde. Collectively titled ''Las cuatro estaciones'' (''The four seasons''), sometimes called ''The Havana Quartet'' in their English translations. Conde is a cop who would rather be a writer, and admits to feelings of "solidarity with writers, crazy people, and drunkards". These books are set respectively in winter, spring, summer and autumn (''Vientos de cuaresma'' literally means "Lenten Winds" and ''Paisaje de otoño'', Autumn landscape):
*''Pasado perfecto'' (1991, translated as ''Havana Blue'', 2007)
*''Vientos de cuaresma'' (1994, translated as ''Havana Gold'', 2008)
*''Máscaras'' (1997, translated as ''Havana Red'', 2005)
*''Paisaje de otoño'' (1998, translated as ''Havana Black'', 2006)

The four books were made into four [[Spanish language]] television films, which have been released with English subtitles as the [[Netflix]] mini-series ''Four Seasons in Havana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Peter|title=July 26 Cuba program features Brookline's Lee Schlenker|url=http://brookline.wickedlocal.com/news/20170724/july-26-cuba-program-features-brooklines-lee-schlenker|website=Brookline TAB|accessdate=13 February 2018|language=en|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English-language remake named ''Havana Quartet'' was considered by [[Starz]] with [[Antonio Banderas]] tagged to act as Conde,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/antonio-banderas-havana-quartet-series-starz-1201488440/|title=Antonio Banderas To Star In ‘Havana Quartet’ Drama Series In Works At Starz|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=31 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/starz-american-gods-chair-making-a-murderer-1201678470/|title=Starz’s Chris Albrecht On ‘The Chair’, ‘Making A Murderer’, ‘American Gods’, Diversity &amp; Filming In Cuba – TCA|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=9 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not proceed beyond the development stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Starz Greenlights Drama Series ‘Vida’ In Push To Attract Latino Viewers|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/starz-orders-vida-drama-series-veronica-osorio-melissa-barrera-to-star-push-latino-viewers-1202169060/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paisaje de otoño'' won the 1998 [[Premio Hammett]] of the [[Asociación Internacional de Escritores Policiacos]] (International Association of Crime Writers); this prize should not be confused with the similarly named [[Hammett Prize]] given by the North American branch of the organization, which is restricted to United States and Canadian authors.

Padura has published two subsequent books featuring Conde, the [[novella]] ''Adiós Hemingway'' (Padura’s first book to be translated into English, in 2005), and a recent novel ''La neblina del ayer'' (''The Fog of Yesterday'', translated into English as ''Havana Fever'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khaneka|first1=Pushpinder|title=The best books on Cuba: start your reading here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/29/world-library-best-books-on-cuba-start-your-reading-here|accessdate=19 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=29 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.havana-cultura.com/en/cuban-author/leonardo-padura/cuban-writer.html Havana-Cultura website] comments on the similarities and differences between Padura and Hemingway and how they might explain his decision to feature the expatriate American in ''Adiós Hemingway''.

===Other works===
Padura's novel ''El hombre que amaba a los perros'' (The Man Who Loved Dogs) deals with the murder of [[Leon Trotsky]] and the man who assassinated him, [[Ramon Mercader]]. At almost 600 pages, it is his most accomplished work and the result of more than five years of meticulous historical research. The novel, published in September 2009, attracted a lot of publicity mainly because of its political theme. The novel centres "on Stalin’s murderous obsession with Leon Trotsky, an intellectual architect of the Russian Revolution and the founder of the [[Red Army]]", and considers  "how revolutionary utopias devolve into totalitarian dystopias."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=13 April 2014|title=Cuba’s Preeminent Writer Takes Some New Chances|author=Bardach, Amy Louise|work=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/review/cubas-preeminent-writer-takes-new-chances/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padura's books are also available in French (including all the books featuring Conde), Italian, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], German, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Danish (language)|Danish]].

A '''lolcat''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒ|l|k|æ|t}} {{respell|LOL|kat}}) is an [[image macro]] of one or more [[cat]]s. The image's text is often [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] and grammatically incorrect, and is known as ''lolspeak''.

== History ==
[[File:Harry Whittier Frees - What's Delaying My Dinner.jpg|thumb|left|1905 cat postcard by [[Harry Whittier Frees]]|upright]]
British portrait [[photographer]] Harry Pointer created a [[carte de visite]] series featuring cats posed in various situations in the early 1870s. To these he usually added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photohistory-sussex.co.uk/BTNPointerCats.htm |title=Harry Pointer's Brighton Cats |publisher=Photohistory-sussex.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early figures include [[Harry Whittier Frees]] and (using mounted animals) [[Walter Potter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Even in the 1870s, humans were obsessed with ridiculous photos of cats |url=http://io9.com/5900334/even-in-the-1870s-humans-were-obsessed-with-ridiculous-photos-of-cats |author=Cyriaque Lamar |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''lolcat'' gained national media attention in the United States when it was covered by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which wrote that non-commercialized [[phenomena]] of the sort are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have "a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, [[Usenet]] feel to [them]".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lev|last=Grossman| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1642897,00.html| title = Cashing in on Cute Cats| authorlink = Lev Grossman| date = 2007-07-12| accessdate =2007-07-12| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}} Partial scan of the print edition: [http://fcrunk.wellimean.com/memes/catstime.jpg fcrunk.wellimean.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put them on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Da cutest distractshun of da decaid?

== Format ==
[[File:Lolcat in folder.jpg|thumb|A lolcat image using the "I'm in ur..." format]]

Lolcat is a composite of two words, "lol" and "cat". "[[LOL|Lol]]" stands for "Laugh out Loud" or "Laughing out Loud"; hence, lolcats are intended to be funny and to include jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrothing.com/2010/08/1950s-protololcats.html|title=1950's Proto-LOLcats|author=retrothing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lolcats images comprise a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically set in a heavy [[sans serif]] font such as [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] or [[Arial Black]].&lt;ref name="cats has grammar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html|title=Anil Dash: Cats Can Has Grammar|author=[[Anil Dash]]|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is, on occasion, [[Image editing|digitally edited]] for effect.

The caption generally acts as a [[speech balloon]] encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is [[Sensational spelling|intentionally written with deviations]] from standard English spelling and grammar,&lt;ref name="cats has grammar" /&gt; featuring "{{Sic|hide=y|strangely|-}}conjugated verbs, but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar".&lt;ref name="cats has grammar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newitz 2007"&gt;{{cite web

The text parodies the grammar-poor [[patois]] stereotypically attributed to [[Internet slang]]. Frequently, lolcat captions take the form of [[phrasal template]]s.&lt;ref name="kitty pidgin" /&gt; Some phrases have a known source, usually a well-known [[Internet meme]], such as [[All your base are belong to us]] or [[Do not want]],&lt;ref name="virgin_myths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/movieextras/top10s/top-ten-star-wars-myths-and-legends.php?ssid=10|title=Top ten Star Wars myths and legends: Do not want|work=VirginMedia.com|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others don't. The language of lolcats has also been likened to [[baby talk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2008-04-24-lolcats-job-search_N.htm|title=Lolcat site needz ur skillz|agency=Associated Press|first=Peter|last=Svensson|date=2008-04-24|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it draws on a variety of linguistic resources, not just the imitation of baby talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2579344/I_can_haz_language_play_The_construction_of_language_and_identity_in_LOLspeak|title=I can haz language play: The construction of language and identity in LOLspeak|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|last2=Vaughan|first2=Jill M.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many lolcat images capture cats performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use modern technology, such as computers.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

There are several well-known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, including "Ceiling Cat" (see below). Others include [[Fail (Internet meme)|Fail]] (a cat with a slice of [[processed cheese]] on its face)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Bremner Toulouse Updated 6 minutes ago |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3304328.ece |title=Microtrends: Failure&amp;nbsp;– Times Online |publisher=Technology.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[I Can Has Cheezburger]]" (a portrait of a blue [[British Shorthair]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2007/sb20070713_202390.htm|title=Bloggers Bring in the Big Bucks|publisher=''[[Business Week]]''|author=Tozzi, John|date=July 13, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular format is "[Adjective] cat is [adjective/noun]."

== Recurring characters ==
"Ceiling Cat" is a character spawned by the meme. The original image was an [[image macro]] with a picture of a cat looking out of a hole in a ceiling, captioned "Ceiling Cat is watching you [[Masturbation|masturbate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/01/24/ceiling-cat-is-watching-you-masturbate/ |title=I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER? » Blog Archive » ceiling cat is watching you masturbate. |publisher=icanhazcheezburger.com |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204143319/http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/01/24/ceiling-cat-is-watching-you-masturbate/ |date=2007-01-24 |archive-date=2007-02-04 |access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed numerous examples with the format "Ceiling Cat is watching you [''verb'' ending in / rhyming with -ate]" with Ceiling Cat superimposed in the upper left hand corner of an image macro depicting the appropriate action. The underlying theme is that the cat is looking down on one, almost in a form of judgement. "Ceiling Cat" and the corresponding "Basement Cat" (a [[black cat]] who lives in the basement) represent good and evil in the lolcat universe, and in some cases God and Satan, as in the [[LOLCat Bible Translation Project]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Charlie |last=Amter |coauthors= |title=Lolcat Bible Translation Project presents the Gospel according to Fluffy |date=2007-12-16 |publisher= |url=http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16,1,6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |work=Los Angeles Times |pages= |accessdate=2007-12-23 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224021046/http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16%2C1%2C6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archivedate=2007-12-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/news/today/s_568828.html|title=How one hungry 'kitteh' can has the Internet lol|last=Horan|first=Brianna|accessdate=2008-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215050105/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/news/today/s_568828.html|archivedate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/124063.asp?from=blog_last3|title=Time killer: The "lolcat" Bible|last=Guzman|first=Monica|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offshoots and parodies ==
Variations on the lolcat concept include captioning photos of other animals in a similar style (e.g. ''loldogs'' for dogs, etc.).

The syntax of lolcat captions was used as the basis for [[LOLCODE]], an [[esoteric programming language]] with interpreters and compilers available in [[.NET Framework]], [[Perl]], etc.&lt;ref name="Silverman" /&gt;

In the game Minecraft, there is an option to change language settings to LOLCAT.

Another example is [[Polandball]], which uses broken English, reminiscent of the lolcat meme.

'''Maridi Arabic''' was a possible Arabic [[pidgin]] apparently spoken in the upper Nile valley around 1000 CE. If legitimate, it would be the oldest record of a pidgin. It is known from just fifty words in an 11th-century text.

In 1068, the [[Andalusia]]n geographer [[Al-Bakri|Abū ʿUbayd al-Bakrī]] published the words of a traveler from [[Aswan]], who had complained to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Caliph in Egypt]] that in the town of "[[Maridi]]", black Africans had "mutilated" the [[Arabic|Arabic language]]. 

It appears that the text may be a caricature of an actual pidgin, or at least of partially acquired Arabic. It shares several features with [[Juba Arabic]] and [[Nubi Creole Arabic|Nubi Creole]]: a complete lack of inflection, including articles, possessive markers, and agreement; a single negative marker; ''ʔmny'' for the third-person dual pronoun, and perhaps the use of ''jaʿal'' 'make' rather than colloquial ''qaʿad'' 'stay' for the progressive. 

It is not known where "Maridi" was. It has been concluded that it was in Mauritania, with the single non-Arabic word in the text (below), ''kyk'' (people?), hypothesized to be from [[Songhai language|Songhai]] ''-koi'' 'people who' plus the Arabic plural ''-k.'' However, there are also indications that it was located in Upper Egypt or northern Sudan, as several of its features are found today only in that region. Specifically, Classical ''q'' has become ''ʿ'' (''ʿayn''), ''fwq'' "on" has become ''fwʾ'', and ''j'' has become ''d''. The last is a sound correspondence found today only in Upper Egypt.

'''Old Norwegian''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''gammelnorsk'' and ''gam(m)alnorsk''), also called '''Norwegian Norse''', is an early form of the [[Norwegian language]] that was spoken between the 11th and 14th century; it is a transitional stage between [[Old West Norse]] and [[Middle Norwegian]], and also [[Norn language|Old Norn]] and [[Faroese language|Old Faroese]].
Its distinction from Old West Norse is a matter of convention.
Traditionally, Old Norwegian has been divided into the main dialect areas of North Western, Outer South Western, Inner South Western, [[Trøndersk]], North Eastern, and South Eastern.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Phonological and morphological features==
One of the most important early differences between Old Norwegian and [[Old Icelandic]] is that ''h'' in the [[consonant]] combinations ''hl-'', ''hn-'' and ''hr-'' was lost in Old Norwegian around the 11th century, while being preserved in Old Icelandic. Thus, one has e.g. Old Icelandic ''hlíð'' '[[slope]]', ''hníga'' '[[curtsey]]' and ''hringr'' 'ring' vs Old Norwegian ''líð'', ''níga'' and ''ringr'', respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Many Old Norwegian dialects feature a height based system of [[vowel harmony]]: Following stressed high vowels (/i/, /iː/, /y/, /yː/, /u/, /uː/) and diphthongs (/ei/, /ey/, /au/), the unstressed vowels /i/ and /u/ appear as ''i'', ''u'', while they are represented as ''e'', ''o'' following long non-high vowels (/eː/, /øː/, /oː/, /æː/, /aː/). The situation following stressed short non-high vowels (/e/, /æ/, /ø/, /a/, /o/, /ɔ/) is much debated and was apparently different in the individual dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://folk.uib.no/hnooh/vokalharmoni/ Homepage of a symposium on Old Norwegian vowel harmony, held in Bergen in March 2015] (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Norse#Umlaut|''u''-umlaut]] of short /a/ (written ''ǫ'' in normalized Old Norse) is not as consistently graphically distinguished from non-umlauted /a/ as in Old Icelandic, especially in writings from the Eastern dialect areas. It is still a matter of academic debate whether this is to be interpreted phonologically as a lack of umlaut or merely as a lack of its graphical representation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Old Norwegian had alternative dual and plural first person pronouns, ''mit,'' ''mér,'' to the Common Norse ''vit,'' ''vér.''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cleasby, Guðbrandur Vigfússon — ''[http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/texts/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html An Icelandic-English Dictionary]'' (1874).

==Middle Norwegian==
{{Main article|Middle Norwegian}}
The [[Black Death]] struck Norway in 1349, killing over 60% of the population.&lt;ref name = "forskning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/juli/1090833676.68 |title=Svartedauden enda verre enn antatt |publisher=Forskning.no |author=Harald Aastorp |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probably precipitated the current process of language development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The language in Norway after 1350 up to about 1550 is generally referred to as Middle Norwegian. The language went through several changes: morphological paradigms were simplified, including the loss of [[grammatical case]]s and the levelling of personal inflection on verbs. A [[vowel reduction]] also took place, in some dialects, including in parts of Norway, reducing many final unstressed vowels in a word to a common "e".

The [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory also underwent changes. The [[dental fricative]]s represented by the letters [[thorn (letter)|þ]] and [[eth|ð]] disappeared from the Norwegian language, either merging with their equivalent [[stop consonant]]s, represented by [[t]] and [[d]], respectively, or being lost altogether.

'''Ostanes''' (from [iran]] {{lang|grc|Ὀστάνης}}), also spelled '''Hostanes''' and '''Osthanes'''&lt;!--(for persian Ὀστάνης{{#tag:ref|"Ostanes ... et non avec un θ ou th" ({{harvnb|Bidez|Cumont|1938|pp=I.168}})|group="n"}})--&gt;, was the pen-name used by several [[pseudepigraphy|pseudo-anonymous authors]] of iran and Latin works from [[Hellenistic period]] onwards. Together with [[Pseudo-Zoroaster]] and [[Pseudo-Hystaspes]], Ostanes belongs to the group of pseudepigraphical "Hellenistic Magians",{{#tag:ref|''Les Mages hellénisés'' (''The Hellenistic Magians'') is the title of [[#CITEREFBidezCumont1938|Bidez and Cumont's]] monumental collection of Zoroastrian [[pseudepigrapha]].|group="n"}} that is, a long line of Greek and other Hellenistic writers who wrote ''under the name of'' famous "Magians". While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the "inventor" of astrology, and Pseudo-Hystaspes was stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet, Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer.{{sfn|Beck|1991|pp=491ff}}

==Real Ostanes?==
Unlike "Zoroaster" and "Hystaspes", which have well attested Iranian language counterparts, for "Ostanes" there is "no evidence of a figure of a similar name in [[Iranian languages|Iranian tradition]]."&lt;ref name="Colpe_1983_828"&gt;{{harvnb|Colpe|1983|p=828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cf_Smith"&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Smith|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- And another one for good measure: Bidez &amp; Cument "inconnu dans les source Iraniens" --&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia Iranica'' entry for Ostanes, [[Morton Smith]] cites Justi's ''Namensbuch'' for instances of the name which refer to real persons. Smith: "Which [of these references to] Ostanes (...), if any, gave rise to the legend of the magus is uncertain."{{sfn|Smith|2003}}

Smith goes on to reconstruct the Old Iranian name as [[Linguistic reconstruction|*]](H)uštāna.{{sfn|Smith|2003}} The Justi entries{{sfn|Justi|1884|loc='Austanes', p. 52b}} that Smith alludes to are: [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 17.5.5 and [[Plutarch]] ''Artax.'' 1.1.5 (cit. [[Ctesias|Ktesias]]) for Ὀστάνης as the name of one of the sons of [[Darius II|Darius Nothos]], and a mention in [[Arrian]] (''An.'' 4.22) of a certain Αὐστάνης of Paraetakene, north-east of Bactria, who was captured by Alexander's general [[Craterus|Krateros]] and then taken to India. Arrian's Αὐστάνης is Haustanes in [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]] 8.5. Ktesias&lt;!-- presumably via Photius, but Justi only says "Ktesias ''Pers''. 49" --&gt; names 'Άρτόστης' as the son of Darius Nothus, and Justi suggests that Plutarch confused Artostes as Ostanes.{{sfn|Justi|1884|loc='Άρτόστης', p. 40a}}

==Pseudo-Ostanes==
The origins of the figure of "Ostanes", or rather, who the Greeks imagined him to be, lies within the framework of "alien wisdom" that the Greeks (and later Romans) ascribed to famous foreigners, many of whom were famous to the Greeks even before being co-opted as authors of arcana. One of these names was that of [[Zoroaster#In classical antiquity|(pseudo-)Zoroaster]], whom the Greeks perceived to be the founder of the magi and of their ''magi''cal arts. Another name was that of (pseudo-)[[Vishtaspa|Hystaspes]], Zoroaster's patron. The third of ''les Mages hellénisés''{{ref_label|c|c|none}} was Ostanes,&lt;ref name="BidezCumont_1938_i168-212"&gt;{{harvnb|Bidez|Cumont|1938|pp=I.168–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; imaginatively described by the 4th century BCE [[Hermodorus]] (apud [[Diogenes Laertius]] ''Prooemium'' 2) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster.

Once the magi had been associated with "magic"&amp;mdash;Greek ''magikos''&amp;mdash;it was but a natural progression that the Greek's image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too.&lt;ref name="Beck_2003_para7"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para. 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st century CE [[Pliny the Elder]] names &lt;!--(pseudo-)--&gt;"Zoroaster" as the inventor of magic (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' &lt;small&gt;XXX&lt;/small&gt;.2.3), but a "principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed."&lt;ref name="Beck_2003_para7"/&gt; Thus, while "universal consensus"&amp;mdash;so the skeptical Pliny&amp;mdash;was that magic began with (pseudo-)Zoroaster (xxx.2.3), as far as Pliny says he could determine, "Ostanes" was the first extant writer of it (xxx.2.8).

This 'Ostanes', so Pliny states, was a [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] magus who had accompanied [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced ''magicis'',{{#tag:ref|To Pliny ''magicis'' was both magical and magian; for the Roman they were one and the same.{{sfn|Beck|1991|p=516, n.56}}|group="n"}} the "most fraudulent of the arts", to that country. But the figure of Ostanes was such that Pliny felt "it necessary to supplement his history with doppelgangers"; so, not only does Ostanes appear as a contemporary of the early 5th century BCE Xerxes, but he is also contemporary with&amp;mdash;and companion of&amp;mdash;the late 4th century BCE [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=516, n. 55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny goes on to note that Ostanes's introduction of the "monstrous craft" to the Greeks gave those people not only a "lust" (''aviditatem'') for magic, but a downright "madness" (''rabiem'') for it, and many of their philosophers, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Democritus]], and [[Plato]] traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it.(xxx.2.8-10).&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=516}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny also transmits Ostanes's definition of magic: "As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it; he professes to [[divination|divine]] (''divina promittit'') from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins and axes, and by many other methods, and besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld" (xxx.2.8-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|pp=516–517}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1st century CE, "Ostanes" is cited as an authority on [[alchemy]], [[necromancy]],  divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century "he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy" and "much medieval alchemical material circulated under his name."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "authority" continued in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] alchemical literature, such as an Arabic treatise titled ''Kitab al-Fusul al-ithnay ‘ashar fi 'ilm al-hajar al-mukarram'' (''The Book of the Twelve Chapters on the Honourable Stone'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ullmann|1972|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anawati|1996|p=862}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As per [[2011 Census of India]], it is defined as:

''"A viable unit such as a village or part of a village contiguous to a statutory town and possess the urban features in terms of infrastructure and amenities such as pucca roads, electricity, taps, drainage system, educational institutions, post offices, medical facilities, banks etc.'' ''Examples of OGs are Railway colonies, university colonies and port areas, that may come up near a city or statutory towns outside its statutory limits but within the revenue limit of a village or villages contiguous to the town or city."''&lt;ref name="Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Concepts and Definitions|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/kerala/13-concept-34.pdf|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=7 February 2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3254">A '''plankowner'''&lt;ref name=term&gt;"U.S. Navy Style Guide", Navy.mil website&lt;/ref&gt;  (also referred to a '''plank owner'''&lt;ref name=Cutler167&gt;Cutler and Cutler, p 167&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes a plank holder) is an individual who was a member of the [[crew]] of a [[United States Navy]] [[ship]] or [[United States Coast Guard]] [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] when that ship was placed in [[Ship commissioning|commission]]. Originally, this term applied only to crew members that were present at the ship's first commissioning. Today, however, plankowner is often applied to members of newly commissioned units, new [[military base]]s and recommissioning crews as well.&lt;ref name=plank&gt;"Plank Owners, Plank Owner Certificates, and Planking", Naval Historical Center&lt;/ref&gt;

==In U.S. military==
Plankowner is a term used by the United States Navy,&lt;ref name="term"/&gt; and has consequently been variously defined by different units. The origin of the term is the implication that a crew member was around when the ship was being built and commissioned, and therefore has bragging rights to the "ownership" of one of the [[Plank (wood)|plank]]s in the main [[Deck (ship)|deck]].&lt;ref name="Cutler167" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plank" /&gt;

Historically, a plankowner in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, or his widow, could petition the [[Naval Historical Center]]'s Curator Branch for a piece of the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] when the ship was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]]. This practice has been discontinued and stocks of planking that existed at the Curator branch have been donated to various veteran's organizations.&lt;ref name="plank" /&gt;

Sailors who are plankowners at their current command often have the word "PLANKOWNER" embroidered on the back of their uniform ball cap to denote this designation. A plaque is placed aboard the ship with the crew names. When in port, the departure of a plankowner for the final time is usually announced on the [[1MC]] public announcing system with a bell-ring, as &lt;ding, ding&gt; "Plankowner, departing".{{cn|date=March 2015}}

In the [[United States Navy SEALs]], the term refers to the original or "founding" members of a SEAL Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Training, Teamwork Key to 45 Years of Navy SEALs|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=27285|publisher=[[United States Navy|navy.mil]]|date=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23295">'''Quoting out of context''' (sometimes referred to as '''contextomy''' or '''quote mining''') is an [[informal fallacy]] and a type of [[false attribution]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} in which a passage is removed from its surrounding matter in such a way as to distort its intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Morris S., ''With Good Reason: An Introduction to Informal Fallacies'' (1994), pp. 106–07 {{ISBN|0-312-15758-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contextomies may be both intentional, as well as accidental if someone misunderstands the meaning and omits something essential to clarifying it, thinking it to be non-essential.

Arguments based on this fallacy typically take two forms:
#As a [[straw man]] argument, it involves quoting an opponent out of context in order to misrepresent their position (typically to make it seem more simplistic or extreme) in order to make it easier to refute. It is common in politics.
#As an [[appeal to authority]], it involves quoting an authority on the subject out of context, in order to misrepresent that authority as supporting some position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/quotcont.html Quoting Out of Context], Fallacy Files&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextomy==
Contextomy refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original linguistic context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning, a practice commonly referred to as "quoting out of context".  The problem here is not the removal of a quote from its original context ''per se'' (as all quotes are), but to the quoter's decision to exclude from the excerpt certain nearby phrases or sentences (which become "context" by virtue of the exclusion) that serve to clarify the intentions behind the selected words.  Comparing this practice to surgical excision, journalist [[Milton Mayer]] coined the term "contextomy" to describe its use by [[Julius Streicher]], editor of the infamous [[Nazi]] broadsheet ''[[Der Stürmer]]'' in [[Weimar]]-era Germany.  To arouse anti-semitic sentiments among the weekly's working class Christian readership, Streicher regularly published truncated quotations from Talmudic texts that, in their shortened form, appear to advocate greed, slavery, and ritualistic murder.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, M. (1966). [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html ''They thought they were free:  The Germans, 1933–45.'']  Chicago, Illinois: [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rarely employed to this malicious extreme, contextomy is a common method of misrepresentation in contemporary mass media, and studies have demonstrated that the effects of this misrepresentation can linger even after the audience is exposed to the original, in context, quote.&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, M.S. (2005a). [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/toc/jcom/55/2 Quoted out of context: Contextomy and its consequences.] ''Journal of Communication, 55,'' 330–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, M.S. (2005b). [http://mcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/511 Contextomy: The art of quoting out of context.] ''Media, Culture, &amp; Society, 27,'' 511–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In advertising===
One of the most familiar examples of contextomy is the ubiquitous "review [[blurb]]" in advertising. The lure of media exposure associated with being "blurbed" by a major studio may encourage some critics to write positive reviews of mediocre movies.  However, even when a review is negative overall, studios have few reservations about excerpting it in a way that misrepresents the critic's opinion.

For example, the ad copy for New Line Cinema's 1995 thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', used the comment "a small masterpiece." Gleiberman actually gave ''Se7en'' a B&amp;minus; overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: "The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia." Similarly, [[United Artists]] contextomized critic [[Kenneth Turan]]'s review of their flop ''[[Hoodlum (film)|Hoodlum]]'', including just one word from it—"irresistible"—in the film's ad copy: "Even [[Laurence Fishburne]]'s incendiary performance can't ignite ''Hoodlum'', a would-be gangster epic that generates less heat than a nickel cigar. Fishburne's 'Bumpy' is fierce, magnetic, irresistible even… But even this actor can only do so much." As a result of these abuses, some critics now deliberately avoid colorful language in their reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Reiner, L. (1996). "Why Movie Blurbs Avoid Newspapers." ''Editor &amp; Publisher: The Fourth Estate, 129,'' 123, citing:
*Gleiberman, Owen. (1995, September 22). "[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]" (film review). ''[[Entertainment Weekly]],'' p. 45.
*[[Kenneth Turan|Turan, Kenneth.]], (1997, August 27). ''Hoodlum'': A fight for control of Harlem. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. 8.
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the pop culture magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reported that it had been the victims of "reckless blurbing" after the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' had taken a review fragment of "the most confusing, asinine, ridiculous—yet somehow addictively awesome—television show of all time" and only quoted "the most addictively awesome television show of all time" in its promotional material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/03/good-blurbs-from-bad-reviews-repo-men-the-bounty-hunter-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid |author= Sancton, Julian |date= March 19, 2010 |title= Good Blurbs from Bad Reviews: ''Repo Men'', ''The Bounty Hunter'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' |publisher= ''Vanity Fair'' |accessdate= February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Bialik]] recorded an instance of an adverb being applied to a different verb in a 2007 advert for ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'', where a ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' quote of "hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining" was reduced to "hysterically... entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/the_best_worst_blurbs_of_2007.php |author= Bialik, Carl |authorlink= Carl Bialik |date= January 6, 2008|title= The Best Worst Blurbs of 2007: The 10 most egregious misquotes, blurb whores, and other movie-ad sins of 2007 |publisher= ''Gelf Magazine'' |accessdate= February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is no specific law against misleading movie blurbs, beyond existing regulation over [[false advertising]]. The [[MPAA]] reviews advertisements for tone and content rather than the accuracy of their citations. Some studios seek approval from the original critic before running a condensed quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/11/best_film_ever.html |author= Beam, Chris |authorlink= Chris Beam |date= Nov 25, 2009 |title= '(Best) Film Ever!!!' How Do Movie Blurbs Work? |publisher= ''Slate'' |accessdate= February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]]'s [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] prohibits contextomy, and targets companies who "falsely claim accreditation" for their products in ways that are "not being true to the terms of the [original] endorsement". It is enforced in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Office of Fair Trading]], and carries a maximum penalty there of a £5,000 fine or two years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/07/philippullman Age banding], Philip Pullman, [[The Guardian]], 7 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/excellent-theatres-forced-to-withdraw-misleading-reviews-835860.html Excellent! Theatres forced to withdraw misleading reviews], Amol Rajan, [[The Independent]], 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation–evolution controversy==
Scientists and their supporters used the term ''quote mining'' as early as the mid-1990s in newsgroup posts to describe quoting practices of certain [[creationism|creationists]].&lt;ref name="The Quote Mine Project"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html The Quote Mine Project], John Pieret (ed), [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/ce/3/part5.html The Revised Quote Book], E.T. Babinski (ed), ''TalkOrigins Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qmproject&gt;According to the [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html Quote Mine Project] at ''TalkOrigins Archive'', the first record of the term in [[talk.origins]] was a posting by Lenny Flank on March 30, 1997, with a February 2, 1996 reference in another [[Usenet]] group, rec.arts.comics.misc&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used by members of the [[scientific community]] to describe a method employed by creationists to support their arguments,&lt;ref name="forrest"&gt;{{cite book | last = Forrest | first = Barbara | authorlink = Barbara Forrest |author2=[[Paul R. Gross]]  | title = Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design | url = http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/ | accessdate = 2007-03-09 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford | page = 7| isbn = 0-19-515742-7 | quote =In the face of the extraordinary and often highly practical twentieth-century progress of the life sciences under the unifying concepts of evolution, [creationist] "science" consists of quote-mining—minute searching of the biological literature—including outdated literature—for minor slips and inconsistencies and for polemically promising examples of internal arguments.  These internal disagreements, fundamental to the working of all natural science, are then presented dramatically to lay audiences as evidence of the fraudulence and impending collapse of "Darwinism." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=counter&gt;"The Counter-creationism Handbook", Mark Isaak, {{ISBN|0-520-24926-7}} p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol22/2089_quotemining_comes_to_ohio_12_30_1899.asp Quote-Mining Comes to Ohio], [[Glenn Branch]]&lt;/ref&gt; though it can be and often is used outside of the [[creation–evolution controversy]]. Complaints about the practice predate known use of the term: [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] wrote in his famous 1973 essay "[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]": {{quotation|Their [Creationists'] favorite sport is stringing together quotations, carefully and sometimes expertly taken out of context, to show that nothing is really established or agreed upon among evolutionists. Some of my colleagues and myself have been amused and amazed to read ourselves quoted in a way showing that we are really antievolutionists under the skin.}}

This has been compared to the Christian theological method of [[prooftexting]]:
{{quote|Pseudoscientists often reveal themselves by their handling of the scientific literature. Their idea of doing scientific research is simply to read scientific periodicals and monographs. They focus on words, not on the underlying facts and reasoning. They take science to be ''all statements by scientists''. Science degenerates into a secular substitute for sacred literature. Any statement by any scientist can be cited against any other statement. Every statement counts and every statement is open to interpretation.|Radner and Radner|''Science and Unreason'', {{ISBN|0-534-01153-5}}}}

The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) described the use of "[a]n evolutionist's quote mistakenly used out of context" to "negate the entirety of [an] article and creationist claims regarding the lack of transitional forms" as "a smoke screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1202/ |title=Does Convincing Evidence For Evolution Exist?|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG) and [[Henry M. Morris]] (founder of ICR) have been accused of producing books of mined quotes. ''[[TalkOrigins Archive]]'' (TOA) states that "entire books of these quotes have been published" and lists prominent creationist [[Henry M. Morris]]' ''That Their Words May Be Used Against Them'' and ''The Revised Quote Book'' as examples, in addition to a number of online creationist lists of quote-mines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html The Quote Mine Project], John Pieret (ed), ''TalkOrigins Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; Both AiG and ICR use the following quote from [[Stephen Jay Gould]] on intermediate forms.&lt;ref name=gouldmine/&gt;

Context shows that Gould rejected the gradualists' explanation for the lack of support for gradual change in favor of his own interpretation.  He continues:
{{quote|... Gradualists usually extract themselves from this dilemma by invoking the extreme imperfection of the fossil record. Although I reject this argument (for reasons discussed in ["The Episodic Nature of Evolutionary Change"]), let us grant the traditional escape and ask a different question.&lt;ref name=quote42/&gt;}}

Knowing that creationists are quoting him as if he were saying there were no transitional forms, Gould responded:
{{quote|Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. The punctuations occur at the level of species; directional trends (on the staircase model) are rife at the higher level of transitions within major groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution as Fact and Theory Science and Creationism'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]], (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==="Absurd in the highest degree"===
Since the mid-1990s, scientists and their supporters have used the term ''quote mining'' to describe versions of this practice as used by certain [[creationists]] in the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref name="The Quote Mine Project"/&gt; An example found in debates over [[evolution]] is an out-of-context quotation of [[Charles Darwin]] in his ''[[Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.}}

This sentence, sometimes truncated to the phrase "absurd in the highest degree", is often presented as part of an assertion that Darwin himself believed that natural selection could not fully account for the complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltbs.org/magazine/vol001_p04-05.pdf LTBS Quarterly, April 2000], [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/cfol/ch2-selection.asp Answers in Genesis: Natural selection]{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, [http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/darwin_eye_quote_revisited.htm No Answers in Genesis: The incomprehensible creationist - the Darwin "eye" quote revisited], [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA113_1.html Talk.origins: Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA113.1]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Darwin went on to explain that the apparent absurdity of the evolution of an eye is no bar to its occurrence, and elaborates on its evolution.

The quote in context is

{{quote|To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.

Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.|[[Charles Darwin]]|[[Origin of Species]]}}

==Other out of context quotations==
Besides the creation-evolution controversy, the fallacy of quoting out of context is also used in other areas. In some instances, commentators have used the term ''quote mining'', comparing the practice of others with creationist quote mining.&lt;ref name="urlQuote Mining, Near and Far.

In [[library classification]] systems, '''realia''' are three-dimensional objects from real life such as coins, tools, and textiles, that do not easily fit into the orderly categories of printed material. They can be either man-made (artifacts, tools, utensils, etc.) or naturally occurring (specimens, samples, etc.), usually borrowed, purchased, or received as [[gifts|donation]] by a teacher, [[library]], or [[museum]] for use in classroom instruction or in exhibits. [[Archival]] and [[manuscript]] collections often receive items of memorabilia such as badges, emblems, insignias, jewelry, leather goods, needlework, etc., in connection with gifts of personal papers.  Most government or institutional [[archive]]s reject gifts of non-documentary objects unless they have a documentary value. When accepting large bequests of mixed objects they normally have the donors sign legal documents giving permission to the archive to destroy, exchange, sell or dispose in any way those objects which, according to the best judgement of the archivist, are not manuscripts (which can include typescripts or printouts) or are not immediately useful for understanding the manuscripts.

==Treatment in libraries==
Most libraries usually have a very well written, legally tight, acquisitions policy which rejects beforehand any object which is not some kind of document. There are some exceptions. Children's libraries sometimes have a toy collection, whose individual items are lent out after being cataloged as realia, or under a more specific material designation such as toy, or game. Some large libraries can have a special mandate of keeping objects related to a literary collection or very large libraries can have a public relations department which can find museum objects useful for enhancing or promoting the general collection. Such a library is more likely to prize realia for their associations with writers, subjects, or themes in the library's collection rather than for their own intrinsic worth, artistic merit, historical significance, or scientific value.  Examples might include a feather pen believed to have been owned by [[John Hancock]], lead type from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s printing press, or a collection of Vietnam era canteens, mess kits, uniforms, combat boots, etc. used in an "hands on" exhibit for children to illustrate the [[Vietnam War]].

Within the very restricted domain of cataloging rules in the field of [[Library and information science]] the term "realia" is used to describe those mass-produced objects which incorporate documents or significant amounts of text (such as world globes, decks of quiz cards, board games), but which have a format which makes it hard to incorporate them in the general collection or to describe them easily in the [[Library catalog|catalog]].  Special cataloguing rules are available to describe these objects.

Objects of realia, due to their diverse and compound nature, pose unique preservation challenges for libraries and archives.  Unlike books and other traditional library materials, the artifactual value of these materials is key.  In fact, when such items are unaccompanied by written documentation, as is often the case, the intellectual value sought by most library collections is often uncertain.

“We have a lot of hair,” Saundra Taylor of the [[Lilly Library]] told ‘’The New York Times’’, explaining that realia such as locks of hair, toys, and inkwells, are often the unsolicited accompaniment to prized acquisitions of personal papers or book collections.  Some libraries prize their realia, actively preserving and exhibiting it while others simply keep it out of light and hope for the best.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, realia are seen as a nuisance, difficult not only to catalog, but to care for.  Unlike [[book]]s, which are mostly [[cellulose]] (paper, boards, natural fibers) and occasionally [[parchment|leather]], realia are often the sum of many parts.  One exasperating group of items that might find their way into library collections are textiles and handcrafts:  hair, needlework, clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzenthaler, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textile fibers==

=== Hair, wool, and silk ===
Little research has been conducted regarding the preservation and conservation of human hair within the context of the archival world.  However, much is known of the chemical structure and behavior of human hair, thanks in large part to the cosmetology industry; there is certainly a great deal of scholarship surrounding the care of other protein-based fibers, [[silk]] and [[wool]].

Loose, braided, tied lovingly in silk ribbons, hair was memorialized especially by the Victorians.  Often, hair would be encased within a glass or woven with metallic threads, paired with a metal setting to be worn as [[mourning]] jewelry, a memento of a friend or loved one.  [[Hairwork]], an art still practiced today by the [http://www.hairworksociety.org/ Victorian Hairwork Society], was a popular [[needlework]] method, often resulting in 2-dimensional mourning wreaths and graveyard scenes, worked in hair on a fabric ground.  Wool, because of its ability to wick moisture and resist flame, was commonly used in Western textiles throughout history, and might present itself in the form of bedlinens, clothing, and needlework.

Hair (both human and animal) mainly consists of a protein, keratin, the fibers of which give the inner core of hair a great deal of strength.  Hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds link the chained amino acids that make up hair.  Hydrogen bonds break and re-form easily on exposure to water, but disulfide bonds (responsible for curl, among other properties), can be broken only via chemical means.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, ‘’The World of Hair,’’ http://www.pg.com/science/haircare.&lt;/ref&gt;   Under examination with a microspectrophotometer, scientists have discovered that high heat, UV exposure, and even artificial lighting can be quite damaging to human hair.&lt;ref&gt;“Human Hair Chemistry and Mechanics,” TRI Princeton,  http://www.triprinceton.org/research/hair.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Wool, too, suffers in the sun—the fleece of sheep allowed to spend too much time in the sun before shearing accepts little dye when sheared from their backs, compared to their underbellies, as a result of disulfide bonds broken by UV light.  Heat and a wide variety of insects, too, are deleterious to woolen textiles.  Wool has a high resistance, however, to fungi and bacteria, provided it is free from [[sizing]] and soaps;&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, 195 and 197-199&lt;/ref&gt;   further, wool can absorb three times its volume in water and requires a bit of humidity to remain viable.&lt;ref&gt;Finch &amp; Putnam, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Silk, another protein-rich fiber, is the most problematic of textiles.  Often “weighted”  with metallic salts to produce a nicer drape in clothing, silks (especially black silks and silks used in trimmings) rarely hold up to washing and repeated handling.  Unlike other proteins, silk is not flame retardant.  It quickly becomes brittle when kept in hot, dry conditions, and is highly susceptible to rot when in warm, humid climes.&lt;ref&gt;Finch &amp; Putnam, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compound textiles ===
Cellulose fibers, like [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]] behave differently from protein-based fibers.  Linen and cotton, for instance, comprised most [[paper]]s for many centuries.  Clothing and handcrafts were often made with linen or cotton.  Needlework was often done with silk, wool, or hair on a linen or cotton ground.  Hairwork, silk embroidery, and wool embroidery pose special problems, due to the makeup of their parts.  In diffused light, all fibers deteriorate rapidly, compared to those stored in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cotton and linen resist temperature well.  Cotton can be stored in temperatures well above 100 degrees and still remain chemically and physically stable.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, 197&lt;/ref&gt; With these varying degrees of chemical and physical degradation, textiles woven from a blend of fibers, or art pieces created using a variety of fibers, deteriorate unevenly.  Storage of wool and silk, for example in the ideal condition for one, might have a negative effect on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Finch &amp; Putnam, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preservation of textiles ===
{{see also|Textile preservation|Preservation (library and archival science)}}
All textiles react negatively to air pollution, light, extremes of temperature, and humidity.  Rapid changes in the environment can cause undue stress for these natural fibers, causing them to expand and contract as they take on moisture if kept in humid conditions,  to dry out in high heat.  Chemical bonds are broken by the machinations of UV light and chemicals in polluted air.  As with other, more traditional, library materials, temperature and humidity should be kept within a steady range if at all possible:  70 (+/- 5 degrees) degrees Fahrenheit and 50% (+/- 5%) relative humidity is suggested by most sources. Pre-conditioned [[silica gel]] used for the purpose of humidity control should never come into direct contact with textiles.

Textiles should be stored in darkness, and exhibited in dim light with UV filtration.  To avoid acid-migration, textiles should not come into contact with wood or cardboard.  [[Acid-free paper|Acid-free]] tissue or muslin are often used to shield textiles from harmful [[lignin]]s.

Storage options for textiles are manifold.  Small items, such as locks of hair, fragments of cloth, or lace can be stored flat, sandwiched between sheets of tissue or encapsulated in [[mylar]].  Larger items tend to deteriorate at points of stress, due to folding or gravity pulling the fibers from one another.  Finch and Putnam recommend rolling on plastic tubing or covered cardboard, or shaping over dummies.  Clothing is often stored or shaped around specially created forms that support the textile fully while it is displayed or even hanged.

'''Repetition compulsion''' is a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] or its circumstances over and over again. This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This "re-living" can also take the form of [[dream]]s in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even [[hallucination]].

The term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a "key component in Freud's understanding of mental life, 'repetition compulsion' ... describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life".&lt;ref&gt;Jan Clark and Jim Crawley, ''Transference and Projection: Mirrors to the self.'' (Buckingham 2002). p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

He explored the repetition compulsion further in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', describing four aspects of repetitive behavior, all of which seemed odd to him from the point of view of the mind's quest for pleasure/avoidance of unpleasure.

The first was the way 'dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident' rather than, for example, 'show[ing] the patient pictures from his healthy past'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987). pp. 282-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second came from children's [[Play (activity)|play]]. Freud reported observing a [[child]] throw his favorite toy from his crib, become upset at the loss, then reel the toy back in, only to repeat this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=|first= |title=Literary Encyclopedia: Repetition Compulsion |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=947 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud theorized that the child was attempting to master the sensation of loss 'in allowing his mother to go away without protesting', but asked in puzzlement 'How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third was the way (noted in 1914) that the patient, exploring in therapy a repressed past, 'is obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in ''every'' way'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. pp. 288, 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth was the so-called "destiny neurosis", manifested in 'the life-histories of men and women ... [as] an essential character-trait which remains always the same and which is compelled to find expression in a repetition of the same experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

All such activities appeared to Freud to contradict the organism's search for pleasure, and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides':&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; 'a daemonic current/trait',&lt;ref name="Penguin" &gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=daemonic |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-141-93166-1 |id={{ISBN|0-14193166-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/276/ ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''] (C.

Following this line of thought, he would come to stress that '''an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''&lt;nowiki/&gt;';&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the [[death drive]].

Along the way, however, Freud had in addition considered a variety of more purely psychological explanations for the phenomena of the repetition compulsion which he had observed. Traumatic repetitions could be seen as the result of an attempt to retrospectively "master" the original trauma, a child's play as an attempt to turn passivity into activity: 'At the outset he was in a ''passive'' situation ... but by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an ''active'' part'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the repetition of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]}} and simultaneously satisfaction for the other {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the id]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions 'are of course the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.&lt;ref name="Freud, Beyond p. 292"/&gt;

Five years later, in ''Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety'', he would quietly revise his earlier definition—'There is no need to be discouraged by these emendations ... so long as they enrich rather than invalidate our earlier views'—in his new formula on 'the power of the compulsion to repeat—the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987). p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later psychoanalytic developments==
It was in the latter, psychological form that the concept of the repetition compulsion passed into the psychoanalytic mainstream. [[Otto Fenichel]] in his "second generation" compendium ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' stressed two main kinds of neurotic repetition.

On the one hand, there were '''Repetitions of traumatic events for the purpose of achieving a belated mastery'' ... seen first and most clearly in children's games',&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946). p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; although the 'same pattern occurs in the repetitive dreams and symptoms of traumatic neurotics and in many similar little actions of normal persons who ... repeat upsetting experiences a number of times before these experiences are mastered.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Such traumatic repetitions could themselves appear in active or passive forms. In a passive form, one chooses his or her most familiar experiences consistently as a means to deal with problems of the past, believing that new experiences will be more painful than their present situation or too new and untested to imagine. In the active, participatory form, a person actively engages in behavior that mimics an earlier stressor, either deliberately or unconsciously, so that in particular events that are terrifying in childhood become sources of attraction in adulthood. For instance, a person who was spanked as a child may incorporate this into their adult sexual practices; or a victim of sexual abuse may attempt to seduce another person of authority in his or her life (such as their boss or therapist): an attempt at ''mastery'' of their feelings and experience, in the sense that they unconsciously want to go through the same situation but that it ''not'' result negatively as it did in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| title =Roberta Satow - Psychoanalyst| url =http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| publisher =| date =| accessdate =6 July 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100117153938/http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| archivedate =17 January 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there were '''Repetitions due to the tendency of the repressed to find an outlet''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the drive of the repressed impulse to find gratification brought with it a renewal of the original defence: 'the anxiety that first brought about the repression is mobilized again and creates, together with the repetition of the impulse, a repetition of the anti-instinctual measures'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt; Fenichel considered that 'Neurotic repetitions of this kind contain no metaphysical element', and 'even the repetition of the most painful failure of the Oedipus complex in the transference during a psychoanalytic cure is not "beyond the pleasure principle"'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt;

Later writers would take very similar views. [[Eric Berne]] saw as central to his work 'the repetition compulsion which drives men to their doom, the power of death, according to Freud ... [who] places it in some mysterious biological sphere, when after all it is only the voice of seduction'&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say after You Say Hello?'' (London 1975). p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;—the seduction of the repressed and unconscious id.

[[Erik Erikson]] saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Middlesex 1973). p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ego psychology]] would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive ... the same mistake over and over again'.&lt;ref&gt;"Aaron Green" in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]], stressing the way 'the transference is a live relationship ... in the here-and-now of the analysis, repeating the way that the patient has used his objects from early in life' considered that 'this newer conception reveals a purpose ... [in] the repetition compulsion':&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006). pp. 149, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; thus 'unconscious hope may be found in repetition compulsion, when unresolved conflicts continue to generate attempts at solutions which do not really work ... [until] a genuine solution is found'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997). p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern formulations==
By the close of the twentieth century, the psychoanalytic view of repetition compulsion had come into increasing dialogue with a variety of other discourses, ranging from [[attachment theory]] through brief psychodynamic therapy to [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].

Attachment theory saw early developmental experiences leading to 'schemas or mental representations of relationship ... [which] become organized, encoded experiential and cognitive data ... that lead to self-confirmation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Jan |last2=Crawley |first2=Jim |title=Transference and Projection |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2002 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-335-20314-7 |id={{ISBN|0-33523164-0}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22schemas+or+mental+representations+of+relationship%22%22become+organized,+encoded+experiential+and+cognitive+data%22%22that+lead+to+self-confirmation%22 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Core Conflictual Relationship Theme]]—'core wishes that the individual has in relation to others'—was seen in brief psychodynamic therapy as linked to the way in 'a repetition compulsion, the client will behave in ways that engender particular responses from others that conform with previous experiences in interpersonal relationships'.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22core+wishes+that+the+individual+has+in+relation+to+others%22%22a+repetition+compulsion,+the+client+will+behave+in+ways+that+engender+particular+responses+from+others+that+conform+with+previous+experiences+in+interpersonal+relationships%22 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'psychological schemas' described in social psychology or cognitive-behavioural psychology ... 'an enduring symbolic framework that organizes constellations of thought, feeling, memory, and expectation about self and others" (Knapp 1991: 94)',&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22an+enduring+symbolic+framework+that+organizes+constellations+of+thought,+feeling,+memory,+and+expectation+about+self+and+others'+(Knapp+1991:+94)%22 5].&lt;/ref&gt; further parallels may be seen to the role of early unconscious fixations in fueling the repetition compulsion.

'''Shumashti''' – also known as '''Shumasht''' – is a [[Dardic language]] spoken in parts of western [[Pakistan]] and eastern [[Afghanistan]].
It was spoken by an estimated 1,000 people in 1994 on the western side [[Kunar River]] 60 miles up from [[Gawar-Bati]]. Literacy rates are low: below 1% (less than 10) for people who have it as a [[first language]], and between 15% to 25% (between 150 and 250) for people who have it as a [[second language]].
It has a lexical similarity of 63% with [[Nangalami language|Nangalami]] and 47% with [[Gawar-Bati language|Gawar-Bati]]. It has been heavily influenced by [[Pashayi language|Pashayi]].

'''Sidney Herbert Ray''' (28 May 1858 – 1 January 1939) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] and [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]] linguist who specialised in [[Melanesian languages]]. 

In 1892, he read an important paper, ''The languages of British New Guinea'', to the Ninth [[International Congress of Orientalists]]. In that paper, he established the distinction between the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Papuan languages]] of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="langBNG"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ray, S. H.|title=The languages of British New Guinea|journal=Transactions of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists|year=1892|volume=II (1892)|pages=754&amp;ndash;770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never held an academic position, and was employed throughout his working life as a school teacher,&lt;ref name="haddon"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Alfred Cort Haddon|Haddon, A.

Ray was an energetic fieldworker, and participated in a number of expeditions. 

His first fieldwork was carried out as part of [[Alfred Cort Haddon|A. C. Haddon's]] 1898 Torres Straits Expedition along with [[W. H. R. Rivers]], [[Charles Gabriel Seligman|C. G.

At the time Ray was a primary school teacher, who had already made a study of two Torres Straits languages on the basis of missionary publications and data supplied by Haddon.&lt;ref name="langham"&gt;{{cite book | author =Ian Langham | title =The building of British social anthropology: W.

This effort is often referred to as software archaeology."&lt;/ref&gt; Software archaeology, named by analogy with [[archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;Bryon Moyer, "[http://adm.omg.org/docs/Software_Archeology_4-Mar-2009.pdf Software Archeology: Modernizing Old Systems]," Embedded Technology Journal, March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[reverse engineering]] of software modules, and the application of a variety of tools and processes for extracting and understanding program structure and recovering design information.&lt;ref name="RGBH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hopkins and Kevin Jenkins, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GYvP0u2k2uMC&amp;pg=PA93 Eating the IT Elephant: Moving from greenfield development to brownfield]'', Addison-Wesley, 2008, {{ISBN|0-13-713012-0}}, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Software archaeology may reveal dysfunctional team processes which have produced poorly designed or even unused software modules.&lt;ref&gt;Diomidis Spinellis and Georgios Gousios, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=h34pwy005nYC&amp;pg=PA29 Beautiful Architecture]'', O'Reilly, 2009, {{ISBN|0-596-51798-X}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been in use for decades,&lt;ref&gt;An early discussion is Judith E. Grass, "[http://www.usenix.org/publications/compsystems/1992/win_grass.pdf Object-Oriented Design Archaeology with CIA++]," ''Computing Systems'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Winter 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects a fairly natural metaphor: a programmer reading [[legacy code]] may feel that he or she is in the same situation as an archaeologist exploring the rubble of an ancient civilization.&lt;ref name="AndyDave"/&gt;

==Techniques==
A workshop on Software Archaeology at the 2001 [[OOPSLA]] (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages &amp; Applications) conference identified the following software archaeology techniques, some of which are specific to [[object-oriented programming]]:&lt;ref name="AndyDave"&gt;[[Andy Hunt (author)|Andy Hunt]] and [[Dave Thomas (programmer)|Dave Thomas]], "[http://media.pragprog.com/articles/mar_02_archeology.pdf Software Archaeology]", ''IEEE Software'', vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 20-22, Mar./Apr. 2002, {{doi|10.1109/52.991327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Scripting language]]s to build static reports and for filtering diagnostic output
*Ongoing documentation in HTML pages or Wikis
*Synoptic signature analysis, statistical analysis, and [[software visualization]] tools
*Reverse-engineering tools
*Operating-system-level tracing via [[truss (Unix)|truss]] or [[strace]]
*Search engines and tools to search for keywords in source files
*[[Integrated development environment|IDE]] file browsing
*[[Unit testing]] frameworks such as [[JUnit]] and [[CppUnit]]
*API documentation generation using tools such as [[Javadoc]] and [[doxygen]]
*[[Debugger]]s

More generally, [[Andy Hunt (author)|Andy Hunt]] and [[Dave Thomas (programmer)|Dave Thomas]] note the importance of [[revision control|version control]], dependency management, text indexing tools such as [[GLIMPSE]] and [[SWISH-E]], and "[drawing] a map as you begin exploring."&lt;ref name="AndyDave"/&gt;

Like true archaeology, software archaeology involves investigative work to understand the thought processes of one's predecessors.&lt;ref name="AndyDave"/&gt; At the OOPSLA workshop, [[Ward Cunningham]] suggested a synoptic signature analysis technique which gave an overall "feel" for a program by showing only punctuation, such as semicolons and [[block (programming)|curly braces]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ward Cunningham]], "[http://c2.com/doc/SignatureSurvey/ Signature Survey: A Method for Browsing Unfamiliar Code]," Workshop Position Statement, Software Archeology: Understanding Large Systems, OOPSLA 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, Cunningham has suggested viewing programs in 2 point font in order to understand the overall structure.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/11/10/oftware-archeology/ Software Archeology]" on John D. Cook's blog ''The Endeavour'', November 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique identified at the workshop was the use of [[aspect-oriented programming]] tools such as [[AspectJ]] to systematically introduce [[tracing (software)|tracing]] code without directly editing the legacy program.&lt;ref name="AndyDave"/&gt;

Network and temporal analysis techniques can reveal the patterns of collaborative activity by the developers of legacy software, which in turn may shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the software artifacts produced.&lt;ref&gt;Cleidson de Souza, Jon Froehlich, and Paul Dourish, "[http://www.dourish.com/publications/2005/DeSouzaFroehlichDourish-SeekingSource-GROUP.pdf Seeking the Source: Software Source Code as a Social and Technical Artifact]," Proceedings of the 2005 International ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work, pp. 197-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rozlog of [[Embarcadero Technologies]] has described software archaeology as a six-step process which enables programmers to answer questions such as "What have I just inherited?" and "Where are the scary sections of the code?"&lt;ref name="Rozlog"&gt;Michael Rozlog, "[http://java.sys-con.com/node/487614 Software Archeology: What Is It and Why Should Java Developers Care?]," article on java.sys-con.com, January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These steps, similar to those identified by the OOPSLA workshop, include using visualization to obtain a visual representation of the program's design, using [[software metric]]s to look for design and style violations, using [[unit testing]] and [[profiling (computer programming)|profiling]] to look for bugs and performance bottlenecks, and assembling design information recovered by the process.&lt;ref name="Rozlog"/&gt; Software archaeology can also be a service provided to programmers by external consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sharwood, [http://www.zdnetasia.com/raiders-of-the-lost-code-39199788.htm Raiders of the Lost Code], [[ZDNet]], November 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|DataArchaeology}}
Mitch Rosenberg of InfoVentions.net, Inc. claims{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} that the first law of software archaeology (he calls it code or data archaeology) is:

''Everything that is there is there for a reason, and there are 3 possible reasons:''
# ''It used to need to be there but no longer does''
# ''It never needed to be there and the person that wrote the code had no clue''
# ''It STILL needs to be there and YOU have no clue''

''The corollary to this "law" is that, until you know which was the reason, you should NOT modify the code (or data).''

Software archaeology has continued to be a topic of discussion at more recent software engineering conferences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=1806799 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering] in Cape Town, South Africa in May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of ''programmer–archaeologist'' features prominently in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]].'' &lt;ref&gt;http://garethrees.org/2013/06/12/archaeology/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudovian''' (also known as '''Yotvingian''', '''Yatvingian''', or '''Jatvingian''') is an [[extinct language|extinct]] western [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] language of [[Northeastern Europe]]. Closely related to the [[Old Prussian language]], it was formerly spoken southwest of the Nemunas river in what is now [[Lithuania]], east of [[Galindia]] and north of [[Yotvingians|Yotvingia]], and by exiles in [[Prussia (Baltic)|East Prussia]].

==History==
[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|Distribution of the Baltic tribes, circa 1200 [[Common Era|CE]] (boundaries are approximate).]]

Sudovia and neighboring Galindia were two Baltic tribes or nations mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD as ''Galindai'' and ''Soudinoi'', ('''Γαλίνδαι''', '''Σουδινοί''').  Although Sudovian and Yotvingian were separate dialects of the same language, Sudovian and Yotvingian merged as a common dialect in the 10th century when the two nations created a Federation together with the [[Dainavians]] (''Dainowe'', ''Deynowe'', ''Denowe'', i.e. of [[Dainava (region)|Dainava]]). {{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[Peter of Dusburg]], in his 14th-century ''[[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]'', refers to Sudovia and to its inhabitants as ''Sudovites''.

After the district was conquered by the [[Teutonic Knights]], the language died out and its speakers were gradually absorbed by German, Lithuanian and Slavic populations.

The language has six grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative and locative, and a complex morphology with a variety of [[grammatical mood|moods]]. It was a frontier dialect of Old Baltic, which preserved many archaic features which had been lost in the Middle Baltic group.

Sudovian was very similar to and mutually intelligible with the archaic [[Old Prussian language]], as stated in the introduction to the 1st Old Prussian Catechism (printed in [[Königsberg]] – 1545  – the 1st Baltic language book):

''Die Sudawen aber wiewol ihre rede etwas nyderiger wissen sich doch inn diese preüßnische sprach : wie sie alhie im Catechismo gedruckt ist auch wol zuschicken und vernemen alle wort'' – "But the Sudovians, although their speech is somewhat lower, understand this Prussian language, as it is printed in the Catechism, and they express themselves well and understand every word".

There are also some Sudovian language phrases in "''Warhafftige Beschreibung der Sudawen auff Samland sambt ihren Bock heyligen und Ceremonien''" – True Description of the Sudovians in [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] together with their goat sanctifications and ceremonies – written in the mid-16th century by Hieronymus Meletius.

* Beigeite beygeyte peckolle.
* Kails naussen gnigethe.
* Kails poskails ains par antres. (a drinking toast)
* Kellewesze perioth, Kellewesze perioth.
* Ocho Moy myle schwante Panike.

[[John Poliander]] wrote in 1535 about the Sudovians living near Königsberg, Prussia, that 32 villages used ''Sudini speech'' in a 6-7 mile stretch of land of the Samland Corner that bears the name of Sudavia. They spoke a language similar to the Old Prussian language, but they used the term ''gentaras'' for amber, not the Samlandish (Old Prussian) term. From him we learn that the Sudovians lived secluded from the Samlandish, that they married within their own tribe, and did not allow intermarriage with the neighbouring Prussian population "even if begged". They stubbornly held to their own traditions, and wore finger and ear rings with bronze bells and silver belts. Nothing was imported from abroad, but everything was produced by local craftsmen. [[Christoph Hartknoch]] reported in 1684 that there were still Sudovians there.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The Constit. Synod. Evangel. of 1530 contains the following list of deities who were still worshipped by the Sudavians in Samland: "''Occopirmus, Sualxtix, Ausschauts, Autrympus, [[Patrimpas|Potrympus]], Bardoayts, Piluuytis, [[Perkūnas|Parcunas]], [[Peckols|Pecols]]'',..." (Hastings, p 488)

Toponyms from N.E. Poland, N.W. Belarus, and Lithuania also preserve words.
Sudovian was influenced by the [[Gothic language]], as was Old Prussian. As did other West Baltic dialects, it preserved the nominative singular neuter case ending - an absent from Latvian and Lithuanian. In the declension of nouns, five cases are the same as in Old Prussian: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative. The vocative example "''Kails naussen gnigethe.''" is listed above. The noun declension was very conservative and preserved many archaic features.

The Yotvingian territories of Sudovia and Galindia were later overrun and populated by [[Slavs]] around present-day [[Białystok]] and [[Suwałki]] in north-eastern [[Poland]] and nearby [[Hrodna]] (formerly Grodno) in [[Belarus]]. Some elements of Baltic speech are still retained in the Belarus and [[Ukraine]] territory, owing to the sparse indigenous populations and resettlements of refugees from Lithuania. The dialect of [[Zietela]] (Belarusian Дзятлава, Russian Дятлово, Yiddish Zietil, Polish Zdzięcioł) was of particular interest. Kazlauskas ''(1968, p.&amp;nbsp;285)'' suggested that the word ''mėnas'' ("month") (dative singular ''mënui'') encountered in dialects (Zietela, [[Lazdijai]]) and in the writings of [[Jonas Bretkūnas|Bretkūnas]]  is a remnant of nouns with the stem suffix -s.

===Polish-Yotvingian vocabulary===
Until the 1970s, Yotvingian was chiefly known from toponyms and medieval Russian sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kapović|2008|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1978, a monument with Yotvingian writing was discovered by accident. In [[Belarus]], a young man named Vyacheslav Zinov,&lt;ref&gt;http://ukrainianweek.com/History/65799&lt;/ref&gt; an amateur collector, bought a book of Catholic prayers from an old man from {{ill|Novy Dvor|ru|Новый Двор (Брестская область)}} village in the depths of [[Białowieża Forest]], which held a small manuscript titled ''Pogańskie gwary z Narewu'' ("Pagan Speeches of [[Narew]]"). It was written partly in [[Polish language|Polish]], and partly in an unknown, "pagan" language. Unfortunately, Zinov's parents threw away the book. However, before the manuscript was destroyed, Zinov had made notes of it which he sent to [[Vilnius University]] in 1983. Even though Zinov's notes were riddled with errors, it has been proven beyond doubt that the notes are indeed a copy of an authentic Yotvingian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kapović|2008|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zink&gt;Зинкявичюс З. "Польско-ятвяжский словарик?", Балто-славянские исследования, 1983. — Moscow, Наука, 1984, pp. 3—29. (Zinkevičius Z. Lenkų-jotvingių žodynėlis?, ''Baltistica'', XXI(1), 1985; with a photocopy of Zinov's manuscript. Continued in ''Baltistica'', XXI(2), 1985, pp. 184-193); English-language version, expanded: Zinkevičius, Zigmas, "A Polish-Yatvingian vocabulary?" In: Linguistic and Oriental studies from Poznań. 1992, pp. 99-133&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first person who analyzed the manuscript, [[Zigmas Zinkevičius]], this short Yotvingian–Polish dictionary (of just 215 words{{refn|group=Note|In fact there were 214 words, since one Polish word, "bośian" (Modern Polish, ''bocian'', "[[stork]]" was translated three times, with two translations, ''starkas'' and ''gerwe'' identified, while the third one, ''aucm'' was not, whereas to a Russian speaker it is immediately evident that it is a [[cursive]] writing for the Russian word "аист" for "stork"; probably a note by Zinov for himself.&lt;ref name=orel&gt;Орёл В.Э., Хелимский Е.А. Наблюдения над балтийским языком польско-«ятвяжского» словарика,  Балто-славянские исследования, 1985, Moscow,  Наука, 1987, vol. 6, pp. 121—134&lt;/ref&gt; }}), ''Pogańskie gwary z Narewu'', appears to have been written by a Catholic priest&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Possibly the priest was a native Belarusian, since some words in the "Polish" part were actually Belarusian&lt;/ref&gt; in order to preach to locals in their mother tongue. Concerning the language, Zinkevičius put forth three possible versions: (1) a Yotvingian dialect under a heavy influence of Lithuanian (2) Lithuanian words over a strong Yotvingian substratum (3) the compiler of the dictionary could not tell Lithuanian from Yotvingian clearly, and may have included words from both. The latter version is indirectly supported by the name of the document: "Speeches", rather than "Speech" &lt;ref name=zink/&gt; Some scholars did not rule out the possibility of forgery, but there are strong indications it was not.&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak, "“The Pagan dialects from Narew” in the light of Yatvingian onomastic remnants" in: ''Baltic from an Indo-European perspective''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sverdlovsk''' ({{lang-uk|Свердловськ}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Sverdlovs’k''; {{lang-ru|Свердловск}}) is a [[city]] in [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[Oblast|region]]) of south-eastern [[Ukraine]] on the border with the [[Russian Federation]]. Serving as the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Sverdlovsk Raion]] ([[raion|district]]), the city itself is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]], does not belong to the raion, and is located approximately 80&amp;nbsp;km from the oblast capital, [[Luhansk]]. On 12 May 2016 it was renamed  '''Dovzhansk''' ({{Lang-uk|Довжанськ}}, translit.  ''Dovzhansʹk'') by the Ukrainian government as part of [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/342825.html|title=Rada renames some population areas in occupied Donbas as part of decommunization campaign|last=|first=|date=12 May 2016|website=|publisher=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is controlled by the self-declared [[Luhansk People's Republic]] and the name change has not been enforced. Its population is estimated about {{Ua-pop-est2016|64225}}.

Most of the city residents work in the [[mining]] industry. The city municipality also includes the city of [[Chervonopartyzansk]], six towns and several smaller settlements.

The city serves as an international gateway between Ukraine and Russia and has border checkpoint in Chervonopartyzansk.

==History==
The city tracks its roots from a small village in the headstream of [[Dovzhyk River]] (Sharapka). At the end of the 18th century, it was granted by [[Catherine II of Russia]] to [[ataman]] [[Vasyl Orlov]] as a reward for his excellent military service. The farmland took on the name '''Dovzhykove-Orlovske (Sharapkyne)'''. Development of the area significantly expanded towards the end of the 19th century, after the discovery of [[coal]] in the [[Donbass|Donetsk region]].

In 1938 a number of local settlements as well as the Sverdlov mine (today is part of the Sverdlovantratsyt company) were merged into the [[city]] of Sverdlovsk in memory of the [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Yakov Sverdlov]].

[[File:Hensel_1741_4maps.jpg|thumb|The four ''mappae geographico-polyglottae'' give the beginning of the ''[[pater noster]]'' in various languages and scripts.]]
'''''Synopsis Universae Philologiae''''' is an early work on [[comparative linguistics]] by [[Gottfried Hensel]] (''Godofredus Henselius'', 1687-1767), a rector in [[Jelenia Góra|Hirschberg (Jelenia Góra)]], [[Lower Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegismund Justus Ehrhardt, ''Presbyterologie des Evangelischen Schlesiens'', 1783, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WeZBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA205  p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt;
Its full title reads:  ''Synopsis universae philologiae: in qua: miranda unitas et harmonia linguarum totius orbis terrarum occulta, e literarum, syllabarum, vocumque natura &amp; recessibus eruitur. Cum Grammatica, LL. Orient. Harmonica, Synoptice tractata; nec non descriptione Orbis Terr. quoad Linguarum situm &amp; propagationem, mappisque geographico-polyglottis''.
It was published in 1741 in [[Nuremberg]] by commission of the [[Homann heirs]] company. A second edition appeared in 1754.

The book proposes to present all the world's languages known at the time together with their various [[writing system]]s.
As was [[Adamic language|common at the time]] due to the enduring [[Tower of Babel]] myth, Hensel attempted to derive all languages from a common origin in [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], following
''A philosophicall essay for the reunion of the languages, or, the art of knowing all by the mastery of one'' (1675) by Pierre Besnier (1648&amp;ndash;1705).&lt;ref&gt;Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, ''Geschichte der neuern Sprachenkunde'' (vol. 5 of ''Geschichte der Litteratur von ihrem Anfang bis auf die neuesten Zeiten''), 1807, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dmUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11  p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vogtländisch''' ({{small|Standard German pronunciation:}} {{IPA-de|ˈfoːktlɛndɪʃ|}}; Vogtländisch: ''Vuuchtländisch'', {{small|Klingenthal pronunciation:}} {{IPA-dedia|ˈfuːxtlændɪʃ|}}) is an East-[[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialect, spoken in [[Vogtland]].

== Distribution and history ==
&lt;!-- missing image
[[Image:Vogtlaendisch_regional.png|thumb|350px|Räumliche Verteilung vogtländischer Mundarten]]
--&gt;
 
Vogtländisch is mainly spoken in rural and small town areas. The speakers are mainly to be found among the elderly, as school and preschool education tend to be negligent about fostering this linguistic tradition — nowadays, dialect use tends to be discouraged from an early age. Just like [[Lusatia]] and the [[Erzgebirge]], the Vogtland is one of few areas in Saxony still having regions of comparatively self-contained dialect. There is a relation between Vogtländisch and Erzgebirgisch, including sharing some linguistic features, which originates in similarities and interdependencies in their respective settlement history.

The dialects of the Vogtland are anything but uniform. The sub-dialects that can be spotted in the various sub-regions sometimes differ drastically. In Plauen, for instance, a Vogtländisch is to be heard differing completely from that spoken in Klingenthal (vogtl. Klengedohl {{IPA|/klenɡədoːl/}}) — a common remark between speakers from neighboring regions is "die singe doch ihre Wördder" (en.: they are singing [contrasted to articulately speaking] their words).

This is the main reason there is an extra differentiation to be made between the following sub-varieties:
*Core — or Middle Vogtländisch (in the area around [[Mühltroff]] – [[Treuen]] – [[Oelsnitz, Vogtland|Oelsnitz]]) 
*Northern — or Nether Vogtländisch (along the line [[Reichenbach im Vogtland|Reichenbach]] – [[Mylau]] – [[Netzschkau]] – [[Elsterberg]] – [[Pausa]])
*Eastern Vogtländisch (in the Göltzschtal area, from [[Falkenstein, Saxony|Falkenstein]] – [[Lengenfeld]]) 
*Upper Vogtländisch (south to the line [[Bobenneukirchen]] – [[Oelsnitz, Vogtland|Oelsnitz]] – [[Werda]] – [[Schöneck, Saxony|Schöneck]])

== Vogtländisch proverb ==
''Do, wu de Hasn Hoosn haaßen un de Hosen Huusn haaßen, do bi iech dr ham.''

Translated literally: "There, where hares are called a pair of pants and a pair of pants are called ''Husen'', that's the place I call home."
This proverb is also quite common in neighboring Erzgebirge due to the shift of vowels described in it, which is also a feature of Erzgebirgsich.

== Commonalities and differences ==
Vogtländisch appears as a more than less fluent transition between Meißenisch in the area [[Chemnitz]] – [[Zwickau]], [[Oberostfränkisch|Upper East Franconian]] in the area south to [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], and [[Süd-Ost-Thüringisch|South Eastern Thuringian]] in the area around [[Gera]].

Pre-Vogtländisch is the name for the transitional area to [[Thüringisch-Obersächsische Dialektgruppe|Sächsisch]], which surrounds [[Reichenbach im Vogtland|Reichenbach]]. Here the originary ''singing'' of words is only audible rudimentally, which also holds true for the over-emphasis of intonation within a sentence. Following the Göltzsch upstream, these phenomena will increase strongly.

=== Vogtländisch and Erzgebirgisch ===
:''See main article [[Erzgebirgisch]]''

As in the upper and less densely populated areas of the Vogtland everyday Vogtländisch is more in use than in the other distributional areas of the variety, Upper Vogtländisch is commonly perceived to be highly (ab)original and representative for all Vogtländisch varieties. Upper Vogtländisch shows but few differences compared to Western Erzgebirgisch, while diachronic change within the distribution area of Erzgebirgisch seems to be currently occurring. Making a difference between Upper Vogtländisch and Western Erzgebirgisch seems impossible when not having detailed experience or data of their distinctive features.

One shared feature seems to be double negation:

:''Aufm Bersch liecht kaa Schnee net.'' (Western Erzgebirgisch)

:{{IPA|/ʔaufm beʳʃ liːxt kɑː ʃneː nətʰ/}}

On the mountain lies no snow not.

===Vogtländisch and Oberostfränkisch (Upper East Franconian) ===
Also the delineation of Vogtländisch against Oberostfränkisch seems to be rather troublesome, if tried within small-scale regional comparisons. One tendency seems to be the absence of the "rolled R" in Vogtländisch, while distinctive exceptions may still occur.

The area surrounding Hof, also referred to as Bavarian Vogtland, is part of the transitional zone where many originally Vogtländisch features occur, while phonologically Oberostfränkisch seems to be closer.

===Vogtländisch and ''Sächsisch''===
In addition to Pre-Vogtländisch as a transitional form common features are recognizable on a geographically somewhat larger scale. In similarity to ''Sächsisch'', in Vogtländisch there are almost none but de-labialized vowel sounds and aspiration of consonants is almost completely absent. Especially recipients from southern and western Germany may perceive of the sound of Vogtländisch in a way encouraging the misconception, they would actually hear spoken ''Sächsisch''. Furthermore, ''ne'' instead of ''oder'' is used as a [[Question tag]] at the end of sentences, which is commonly perceived as a typicality of ''Sächsisch'' and Saxon use of [[High German]].

Yet, big differences occur in Vogtländisch morphosyntax, giving it features that encourage it be ranked among the East Franconian dialects. Accordingly, many monosyllabic words of Vogtländisch are not intellibible for speakers of ''Sächsisch'', for instance ''aa'' {{IPA|/ɑː/}} or ''ae'' {{IPA|/ɑːᵊ/}} (en: ''also'', High German ''auch'' {{IPA|/aux/}}, ''Sächsisch'' ''ooch'' {{IPA|/oːx/}}) or the affirmation ''hoa'' {{IPA|/haː/}} or ''hae'' {{IPA|/haᵊ/}}, which, while it can be used meaning "yes", does not have an equivalent in Standard English or High German, but corresponds with Sächsisch ''nu'' {{IPA|/nu/}} (in meaning roughly equivalent to ''aye'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]).

In certain sports, such as [[association football|football]], [[field hockey]], [[ice hockey]], [[team handball|handball]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]] and [[rugby league]], '''winger''' is a position. It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch, or playing field (the "wings"). In [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], the analogous position is the [[wide receiver]]. Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their teammates dominating the centre ground. They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline, or sidelines, and going out of play. In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal (by whatever name) in the centre of the field, a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central teammate.

==Association football==
{{Main|Midfielder#Winger}}
In [[association football|football]], a winger is an attacking [[midfielder]] in a wide position. Wingers are usually players of great pace or [[dribbling]] ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score.  Their main function is to support attack from the wings. Wingers do lots of high-speed running from defence to attack.

==Australian rules football==
{{Main|Centre line (football)#Wing}}
In [[Australian rules football]], the wingers or wingmen require considerable pace and stamina, as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Winger (ice hockey)}}
"Winger", in [[ice hockey]], is a [[forward (hockey)|forward]] position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area. They typically work by [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]ing the [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wing men in the game—out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners.  This position is typically just called "Wing", often preceded by the side on which the player normally skates (Left Wing or Right Wing).

==Handball==
In [[Team handball|Handball]] are two wing positions: left wing and right wing. In a typical team, these positions are occupied by fast and relatively small players. One of their main jobs in a game are fast attacks.

==Rugby league and rugby union==
Wingers or wings play on either the extreme left or the extreme right. They are usually the fastest players on the field and score the most [[try|tries]]. Wingers often fall back with the fullback to take kicks from the opposition.

There are two [[Wing (rugby league)|wings in a rugby league team]], numbered 2 and 5.. There are two [[Wing (rugby union)|wings in a rugby union team]], numbered 11 and 14.

==Prominent students==
Roth, who is in his 80′s, leads a venerated Bais Horaah in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], and is one of leading [[Poskim]] in the world today.{{cn|date= June 2017}}

After many years of living in [[Israel]], he emigrated to the US, where he eventually became recognized as one of the great Diaspora poskim.{{cn|date= June 2017}} Years later, he began dividing his time between New York and Israel, where he secludes himself for weeks on end in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] in the spiritual shadow at the most famous for the [[tomb]] of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]].{{cn|date= June 2017}}

In 1972, the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]] sought a [[Posek]] with uncompromising spiritual standards to serve on the Satmar beis din in Boro Park. The Rebbe’s spiritual requirements were daunting. Roth whose brilliance in Torah is surpassed only by his staunch principles that closely match those of Satmar, was immediately approved by Teitelbaum. He dispatched messengers to Roth's home in Israel requesting that Rav Roth relocate to Boro Park to disseminate Torah, and Roth assented. Since then, he has lived in New York, and although he is not officially affiliated with any group, he has close ties with the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] community.{{cn|date= June 2017}}

Roth soon acquired a reputation as one of the most Prominent [[Poskim]] of the generation. He accepts the most complex sh’eilos from all sections of the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], responding in lucid, understandable terms. His piskei halachah are studied and analyzed in batei medrash l’hora’ah throughout the world, and some of his response to personal status and family issues have ended months and even years of halachic debate where other dayanim were unwilling to take responsibility for such sensitive rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/406977/tehillim-hagaon-harav-yechezkel-roth-suffers-massive-heart-attack-placed-on-respirator.html|title=Hagaon Harav Yechezkel Roth Suffers Massive Heart Attack; Placed On Respirator|first=Dov|last=Gefen|work=[[Yeshiva World News]]|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
