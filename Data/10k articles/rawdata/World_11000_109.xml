'''ABS-3A''' is a [[communications satellite]] that is operated by [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]], providing coverage in the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as globally for TV distribution, cellular services, and maritime services.&lt;ref name=abs3a&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellite Fleet ABS-3A|url=http://www.absatellite.net/satellite-fleet/?sat=abs3a|website=Asia Broadcast Satellite|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite is the first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Stephen|title=Boeing’s first two all-electric satellites ready for launch|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/01/boeings-first-two-all-electric-satellites-ready-for-launch/|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; commercial communications satellite in orbit to use electric propulsion, providing a significant weight savings.

== Manufacture and specifications ==

The satellite was designed and manufactured by [[Boeing]], and is a [[Boeing 702SP]] model communication satellite.&lt;ref name=aw20140310/&gt; 
It will be located at 3 degrees West [[longitude]].&lt;ref name=abs3a/&gt; It was launched on board a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] rocket on 2 March 2015 (UTC time). 

The satellite is propelled solely by [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], with the on-board thrusters used for both [[geostationary orbit]] insertion and [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]].

The satellite is based on the [[Boeing 702]] [[satellite bus]], and was launched along with [[Eutelsat 115 West B]], which is based on the same bus. The satellite had a launch mass of {{convert|4307|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=Legless Falcon 9 conducts Static Fire test ahead of Sunday launch|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/02/legless-falcon-9-static-fire-ahead-launch/|website=NASASpaceFlight|accessdate=27 February 2015|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite utilizes three [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] beams and four [[Ku-band]] beams. The C-band beams will cover Americas, Middle East, and Africa. Additionally, the C-band can be used globally. The Ku-band beams will cover Europe, Middle East, North Africa, and South Africa, as well as providing further coverage of America.&lt;ref name=abs3a/&gt;

== Launch ==
[[File:Launch of Falcon 9 carrying ABS-EUTELSAT (16510241270).jpg|thumb|left|The launch of the Falcon 9 rocket carrying ABS-3A.]]
The launch occurred on March 2, 2015 at 03:50 UTC and the satellite has been deployed in the planned [[supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous]] transfer orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUTELSAT 115 West B launched successfully into space|url=http://news.eutelsat.com/pressreleases/eutelsat-115-west-b-launched-successfully-into-space-1123649|publisher=[[Eutelsat]]|date=2 March 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=William|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 launches debut dual satellite mission|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/03/spacex-falcon-9-debut-dual-satellite-mission/|website=NASASpaceFlight|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch is also notable for being the first flight of Boeing's stacked satellite configuration for the Boeing 702SP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Climer|first1=John|title=Boeing: Stacked Satellites Tested for the Rigors of Space|url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2015/01/bds_702sp_01_26_15.page|website=Boeing|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a configuration Boeing designed specifically to take advantage of the SpaceX [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] capabilities.&lt;ref name=aw20140310&gt;
{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=SpaceX Says Falcon 9 To Compete For EELV This Year |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_03_10_2014_p48-668592.xml |accessdate=2015-02-28 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=10 March 2014 |quote=''But the Falcon 9 is not just changing the way launch-vehicle providers do business; its reach has gone further, prompting satellite makers and commercial fleet operators to retool business plans in response to the low-cost rocket. In March 2012, Boeing announced the start of a new line of all-electric telecommunications spacecraft, the 702SP, which are designed to launch in pairs on a Falcon 9 v1.1. Anchor customers Asia Broadcast Satellite (ABS) of Hong Kong and Mexico's SatMex plan to loft the first two of four such spacecraft on a Falcon 9 in December in a launch window that opens this year, though SatMex owner Eutelsat said last month that the launch has moved to early 2015.  Using electric rather than chemical propulsion will mean the satellites take months, rather than weeks, to reach their final orbital destination. But because all-electric spacecraft are about 40% lighter than their conventional counterparts, the cost to launch them is considerably less than that for a chemically propelled satellite.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-orbit operations==
The satellite became fully operational as a [[geosynchronous]] [[commsat|communications satellite]] by 10 September 2015 after a handover from Boeing to ABS for on-orbit operations on 31 August 2015, approximately one month earlier than planned.&lt;ref name=boeing20150910&gt;

'''Agenția de Presă RADOR''' is the largest press monitoring center in [[Romania]], established in 1990. RADOR editors monitor news published in Romanian language and in other 15 foreign languages: from audiovisual media – 57 radio and TV stations, from the written media – 150 newspapers and news agencies on all continents.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

RADOR publishes news, interviews, analyses and comments grouped in specialised feeds on [[politics]], [[economy]], [[science]], as well as specialised bulletins: „România văzută din străinătate” ("Romania Seen From Abroad"), „Români de pretutindeni” ("Romanians From Everywhere"), „Revista presei internaționale” ("The International Press Summary"), „Economia mondială” ("Worldwide Economy"), „Economia românească” ("Romanian Economy"), „Cei 27 pentru Europa” ("27 for Europe"), „Balcanii și Marea Neagră” ("The [[Balkans]] and The [[Black Sea]]"), „Universul Științei” ("The Universe of Science"). RADOR also maintains a website.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== History ==

Agenția de presă RADOR was founded on June 16, 1921, replacing the first national news agency, disbanded in 1916 when Romania entered WWI.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

RADOR was the only Romanian large national agency in the interwar period. During that time, "RADOR" name was derived from "Radio Orient"; nowadays, "RADOR" means "Radio Observator".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Apart from its press monitoring service, RADOR also encompasses the "[[Dimitrie Gusti]]" Documentation Center (that creates daily, weekly and quarterly calendars of events) and the RADOR Library (an important documentation source for all [[Radio Romania]] departments. The library has about 55.000 volumes, including rare books and princeps editions).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''Parish Church of St Sebastian''' is a [[20th century]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[Parish church]] in [[Qormi]], [[Malta]].

==Old Chapel==
The original chapel dedicated to St Sebastian was mentioned in accounts by Bishop Pietro Dusina on his visit on February 2, 1575. Dusina describes the chapel lacking in necessarily means to celebrate the mass.

==Old Church==
Years later, in 1873, as the population of [[Qormi]] increased, a builder named Michelangelo Azzopardi proposed to the Bishop of Malta plans to build a bigger church instead of the old chapel. In 1880 work commenced on the building of the new church which was blessed by the Vicar General Guzeppi Mercieca on March 9, 1890.

On July 19, 1918, Archbishop [[Mauro Caruana]] made the church a subsidiary parish church, meaning that the church had the duty to minister to the surrounding people as a parish church under the authority the main parish [[Parish Church of St George, Qormi|church of St George]]. The church of St Sebastian eventually became an independent parish on 25 October 1935.

==New Church==
In 1937 new plans were made to build a larger church to serve as the parish church. Plans were made to acquire land nearby from the government which was granted a year later. In 1939, the designs for the new church were made by Arthur Zammit and presented by Annetto Mifsud Ellul. On February 4, 1940 the first work commenced on the building of the new church. The cornerstone was laid on 27 January 1946 by Archbishop [[Mikiel Gonzi]]. The crypt of the church was completed by 1952 and was blessed that same year were services commenced.

Most of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Counties of Norway|counties]] and [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipalities]] have their own flag. They are based on the respective [[coat of arms]] of the subdivision. However they are seldom used. Most public buildings and private homes use the National flag.

[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[SR-71 Blackbird]] is the current record-holder for a manned [[Airbreathing jet engine|airbreathing]] jet aircraft.]]
An '''air speed record''' is the highest [[airspeed]] attained by an [[aircraft]] of a particular class. The rules for all official aviation records are defined by [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI),&lt;ref name="FAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/|title=FAI portal|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also ratifies any claims. Speed records are divided into multiple classes with sub-divisions. There are three classes of aircraft: landplanes, [[seaplane]]s, and [[amphibious aircraft|amphibians]]; then within these classes, there are records for aircraft in a number of weight categories. There are still further sub-divisions for piston-engined, [[turbojet]], [[turboprop]], and rocket-engined aircraft. Within each of these groups, records are defined for speed over a straight course and for closed circuits of various sizes carrying various payloads.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SR-71 pilot [[Brian Shul]] reported in ''The Untouchables'' that he flew in excess of Mach 3.5 on 15 April 1986, over Libya, in order to avoid a missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shul|first=Brian|title=The Untouchables|year=1994|publisher=Mach One|isbn=0929823125|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the official record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the ''Rare Bear'', with a speed of 528.31&amp;nbsp;mph (850.24&amp;nbsp;km/h), the unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a British [[Hawker Sea Fury]] at 547&amp;nbsp;mph (880&amp;nbsp;km/h). Whereas these were both demilitarised, modified fighters, the fastest piston-engined aeroplane in stock (original, factory-built) condition was the German [[Dornier Do 335]] Pfeil, with a maximum speed of 474&amp;nbsp;mph (765&amp;nbsp;km/h) in level flight. The unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane (not in level flight) is held by a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk XIX, which was calculated to have achieved a speed of 690&amp;nbsp;mph (1,110&amp;nbsp;km/h, Mach 0.96) in a dive on 5 February 1952.

The last new speed record ratified before the outbreak of [[World War II]] was set on 26 April 1939 with a [[Messerschmitt Me 209|Me 209]] V1, at 755&amp;nbsp;km/h (469&amp;nbsp;mph).  The chaos, and secrecy, of World War II meant that new speed breakthroughs were not publicized nor ratified.  In October 1941, an unofficial speed record of 1004&amp;nbsp;km/h (624&amp;nbsp;mph) was secretly set by a [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Me 163 A|Messerschmitt Me 163]] AV4 rocket aircraft.  Continued research during the war extended the secret, unofficial speed record to 1130&amp;nbsp;km/h (702&amp;nbsp;mph) by July 1944, achieved by a  [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Messerschmitt Me 163]]B V18.  The first new official record in the post-war period was achieved by a [[Gloster Meteor]] in November 1945, at 976&amp;nbsp;km/h (606&amp;nbsp;mph).  The first aircraft to exceed the unofficial October 1941 record of the Me 163 AV4 was the [[Douglas Skystreak]], which achieved 1031&amp;nbsp;km/h (641&amp;nbsp;mph) in August 1947. The July 1944 unofficial record of the Me 163B V18 was officially surpassed in November 1947, when Chuck Yeager flew the [[Bell X-1]] to 891&amp;nbsp;mph (1434&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The official speed record for a [[seaplane]] moved by piston engine  - still valid today - is 709.209&amp;nbsp;km/h, from the seaplane ("idrocorsa") Macchi-Castoldi [[M.C.72]], attained on 23 October 1934, by [[Francesco Agello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was equipped with the [[Fiat AS.6]] engine (version 1934)  developing a power of 3100&amp;nbsp;hp at 3300 rpm, with coaxial counter-rotating propellers. The original Macchi-Castoldi MC72 MM.181 seaplane  that holds the record is kept in the Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle in Italy.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Frau und Hund''''' ("Woman and Dog") is a [[Germany|German]] [[magazine]] of art, poetry and related subjects, including politics, published thrice yearly by painter [[Markus Lüpertz]] and edited by writer G.H. Holländer. The subtitle "Zeitschrift für kursives Denken" ("Journal of Diagonal Thinking") plays on the German term for italics ("kursiv") and the German equivalent of (dis)course, Kurs as opposed to Diskurs.

The magazine was first published in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frau und Hund|url=http://memim.com/frau-und-hund.html|work=MEMIM Encyclopedia|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on occasion of the ART BASEL and distributed to visitors of the fair; a supplement entirely published in Italian was presented at the German Academy of Villa Massimo, Rome, on 1 April 2004, while a similar French version was presented at the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris, on November 29, 2006. Overall, ten regular issues have been published until the beginning of 2007.

There are hardly any reviews of periodicals in the German press. The magazine was, however, reviewed twice by the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', once in 2004 and once in 2006. ''[[Die Welt]]'' published an extract from issue 8, accompanied by a short characterization of the reviews aims, in November 2006.

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[the Gambia]] on 17 January 2002. They were boycotted by several opposition parties, including the [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1768466.stm Gambia poll landslide] BBC News, 18 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ruling [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]] of [[Heads of State of the Gambia|President]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] ran unopposed in 33 of the 48 elected seats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1765612.stm Poor turnout for Gambia polls] BBC News, 17 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and won 12 of the 15 seats in which they had opposition.

In seats where there was a vote, turnout was 56.4%.

The '''General Federation of Belgian Labour''' (ABVV/FGTB) is a socialist national [[trade union]] federation in [[Belgium]]. It was founded in 1945. It is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and has a membership of almost 1.2 million.

==Walloon movement==

Through the foundation of the ''Mouvement populaire wallon'' during the Great Strike that took place in the Winter 1960-1961, the Walloon working class now also demanded federalism as well as structural reforms. The leader of the Strike, [[André Renard]] was also a national leader of the General Federation of Belgian Labour.&lt;ref&gt;Chantal Kesteloot, ''Growth of the Walloon Movement'', in Nationalism in Belgium, MacMillan,  London, 1998, pp. 139-152, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This whole process will be named [[Renardism]].

'''Intelsat 24''', previously '''Amos-1''', is a commercial communication satellite which is operated by [[Intelsat]]. It was previously operated by [[Spacecom]] as Amos-1, and formed part of the [[Amos (satellite)|AMOS series of satellites]]. It was the first [[Israel]]i civilian communications satellite, and was initially positioned at [[4th meridian west|4° West]] longitude in [[geostationary orbit]]. It has since been moved to 47.3 degrees East.&lt;ref name="tachy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tachyon.com/docs/Interview-GlobalMilitary.pdf|title=Tackling the Challenges of Communication|last=Jameson|first=Helen|publisher=Global Military Communications|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917013846/http://www.tachyon.com/docs/Interview-GlobalMilitary.pdf|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its development was based on experience from [[Ofeq]] reconnaissance satellites in association with DASA and Alcatel Espace. It was launched on May 16, 1996 from [[Kourou]] in French Guiana, aboard an [[Ariane 4]] rocket flying in the 44L configuration, which launched together with [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] Palapa C-2 satellite using Ariane 4's SPELDA system that can launched two satellites stacked on top of another. It was used for home TV services (DTH/DBS by "Yes" company in Israel and by HBO and others in Europe). [[Spacecom]] succeeded quickly to fill all transmission abilities of Amos-1 and accumulated additional requests. Therefore, Spacecom decided to build [[AMOS 2]], which replaced AMOS-1 on orbit at 4 degrees West. AMOS-1 carries nine K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders.

Weighing 970&amp;nbsp;kg at launch, Amos-1 incorporated a 400 [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] liquid apogee motor and fourteen reaction control thrusters, each delivering ten Newtons of thrust for raising the satellite's orbit from geostationary transfer orbit to its final geostationary orbit as well as for its attitude control. It carried 450&amp;nbsp;kg of propellant ([[monomethyl hydrazine]] and [[Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen|MON-3]]).

Amos-1 measures 11.5 m in length in its final in-orbit configuration. It is 3-axis body stabilised using Sun and Earth sensors, momentum and reaction wheels. Its solar array generates 1380 W power, backed up by 24 [[ampere hour|A·h]] Ni-Cd batteries. After its launch, it was raised to its final geostationary orbit by firing the apogee boost motor in phases. After it reached the geostationary orbit, its antennae and solar panels were deployed and the satellite was placed in its allocated slot at 4° West longitude. Amos 1 and Amos 2 were placed near each other to enable [[satellite]] users to aim once and reach either satellite from the same [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].

In 2009, Amos-1 was sold to Intelsat, and became Intelsat 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/amos-1.htm|title=Amos-1 -&gt; Intelsat 24|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intelsat moved it over the Middle East, put it into an inclined orbit to conserve fuel, and rented its capacity to [[Tachyon Networks]] for US military communications.&lt;ref name="tachy" /&gt;

Intelsat 601 was launched at 23:08:08 UTC on 29 October 1991, atop an [[Ariane 4]] carrier rocket in the 44L configuration, flight number V47.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[ELA-2]] at [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed Intelsat 601 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]. The satellite raised itself into its final [[geostationary orbit]] using two liquid-fuelled [[R-4D-12]] engines,&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-6.htm|title=Intelsat-6 (601, 602, 603, 604, 605)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the satellite arriving in geostationary orbit on 2 November 1991.

Intelsat 601 operated in geostationary orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|35680|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|35897|km}}, and 0 degrees of [[inclination]].&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite carried 38 IEEE [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and ten IEEE {{Ku band}} [[transponder]]s, and had a design life of 13 years and a mass of {{convert|4330|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Upon entering service, Intelsat 601 was positioned at 27.5 degrees west. In October 1997, it was moved to 34.5 degrees west, reaching the new slot on 16 October. Between May and July 2002 it was moved to 32.9 degrees east, and between October and November it was again moved, to 64.25 degrees east, where it would remain until October 2006. Its final operations for Intelsat were conducted at 63.5 degrees east, where it arrived in November 2006. In October 2007 it was transferred to [[Europe*Star]], and relocated to 47.5 degrees East, arriving in November. The satellite was retired from service and placed into a [[graveyard orbit]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_601.html|title=Intelsat 601|publisher=tbs Internet|work=The Satellite Encyclopedia|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="628">The '''Magosian''' is the name given by [[archaeologist]]s to an [[archaeological industry|industry]] found in southern and eastern [[Africa]]. It dates to between 10,000 and 6,000 years BC and is distinguished from its predecessors by the use of [[microlith]]s and small [[blade]]s.  

In 1953, [[J. Desmond Clark]] found a notable site of Magosian artifacts at [[Kalambo Falls]], on what is now the border between  [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]].

The '''Movement for Democracy and Progress''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement pour la Démocratie et le Progrès}}, MDP), also known as the '''People's Democratic Movement''' (''Mouvement Démocratique Populaire'') was a political party in the [[Comoros]].

==History==
Based in [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford (2015) ''Political Handbook of the World 2015'', CQ Press&lt;/ref&gt; the party campaigned for the constitution approved in a [[Comorian constitutional referendum, 1992|1992 referendum]], and contested the [[Comorian legislative election, 1992|subsequent parliamentary elections]] later in the year. Although the party received the highest vote share at 10.4%, it won only three seats in the [[Assembly of the Union of the Comoros|Assembly of the Union]], whilst the [[Union of Democrats for Development]] won seven seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/km.html#1992_Federal_Assembly_Election Elections in the Comoros] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Comorian legislative election, 1993|early parliamentary elections]] the following year the party won only two seats. In 1994 the MDP joined with other opposition to form the Forum for National Recovery (FRN), an alliance opposed to President [[Said Mohamed Djohar]].

The MDP nominated [[Abbas Djoussouf]] as its candidate for the [[Comorian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]]. Djoussouf finished second in the first round of voting, progressing to the runoff, where he was defeated by UDD candidate [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]] by a margin of 64%–36%. The MDP subsequently boycotted the [[Comorian legislative election, 1996|parliamentary elections]] later in the year. However, Djoussouf was appointed Prime Minister in November 1998. Following a [[1999 Comorian coup d'état|coup]] in 1999, the MDP left the FRN, as some member parties had supported the coup.

Djoussouf was the MDP candidate again for the [[Comorian presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential elections]], but finished fourth out of the nine candidates in the first round. Prior to the [[Comorian legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]] the MDP joined the [[Camp of the Autonomous Islands]] alliance. The alliance won 12 of the 18 elected and all 15 of the indirectly-elected seats.

The '''Prague Garrison Command'''  ({{lang-cz|Pražské velitelství}}) is the primary military area command of the [[Army of the Czech Republic]] tasked for the defense and security of [[Prague]], the capital city of the [[Czech Republic]]. It is currently under the leadership of Colonel Milan Virt, with Captain Eva Cajthamlova acting as its spokeswoman. The Prague Garrison Command currently bears the honorary title of ''Unit of [[Prague Uprising]]''.

==History==
The [[Prague]] garrison's history is closely associated with the city's military history. The first fortified [[Prague]] military garrison was established in 1621, making it the oldest in the area that is now the [[Czech Republic]], and one of the oldest in [[Europe]]. The first commander of this garrison was Generalissimus [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], the [[Waldstein family|Prince of Waldstein]] and the Duke of Frydlant. In centuries that followed, the Prague garrison had become the most important military garrison in the country and since 1918 it was the central seat of the military leadership of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|ČSSR]]. After a military reorganisation of the armed forces took place on April 1, 2004, the Garrison Command of Prague was formed and was made the center of the armed forces garrison commands.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/en/ministry-of-defence/newsroom/video-gallery/honours-and-tones/garrison-command-of-prague-39027/|title=Garrison Command of Prague &amp;#124; Ministry of Defence &amp; Armed Forces of the Czech Republic|website=army.cz|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garrison activities==
The Prague Garrison Command is the governing body resbonisble for organizing garrison events in the public. The garrison mostly contributes to ceremonial protocol by providing soldiers from the Honor Guard of CAF and the [[Czech Army Central Band]] to serve during the ceremonial activities of the [[President of the Czech Republic]], the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]], the [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Minister of Defence]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (Czech Republic)|Chief of Staff]] and foreign leaders, namely [[state visits]] to the capital.

==Organization==
The Prague Garrison is made up of military units and installations that are permanently or temporarily on the territory of [[Prague]]. The commander of the garrison directly reports to the First Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Czech Republic)|Chief of the General Staff of CAF]]. The Command is composed of the following:&lt;ref name="army2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/structure/army/general-staff/garrison-6103|title=Garrison Command of Prague &amp;#124; Ministry of Defence &amp; Armed Forces of the Czech Republic|website=army.cz|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Project Aware began working with [[Reef Check]], sharing data about coral reef health.&lt;ref name=ReefCheck20008 /&gt; In 2011, the organization relaunched and announced a new focus on the removal of marine debris, encouraging volunteer divers from around the world to actively remove trash from waterways.

==BBB Rating==
In 2013, the Project Aware Foundation was given a rating of "standards not met," by the [[Better Business Bureau]]'s Wise Giving Alliance, due to variance in BBB requirements and written board policy and categorization of financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/environment/project-aware-foundation-in-rancho-santa-margarita-ca-36474 |title=Charity Report - Project AWARE Foundation - give.org |accessdate = 3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rashaida''', '''Rashaayda''' or ''Bani Rashid'' ({{lang-ar|بني رشيد, الرشايدة}}) is a tribe of ethnic [[Bedouin|Bedouin Arabs]] descending from [[Banu Abs]] native to the [[Hejaz|Hejaz region]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]. They currently inhabit [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]] and [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, William C., "The Rashaayda Bedouin - Arab Pastoralists of Sudan", 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html#er|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, many Rashaida migrated from the [[Hejaz|Hejaz region]] in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]] into what is now [[Sudan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], [[Umm Al-Quwain]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Western Malaysia]] after tribal warfare had broken out in their homeland. They are present in other Arab countries too, such as [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Palestine (region)| Palestine]]. Large numbers of Bani Rasheed are also found on the Arabian Peninsula.

The Bani Rasheed are descendants of the [[Banu Abs]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madote.com/2010/02/eritrea-rashaida-people.html Rashaida People History], Niaz Murtaza The pillage of sustainability in Eritrea 1998, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in most cases, in other languages ''Rom'' is now used for people of all genders.&lt;ref name="words"&gt;{{Citation |contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005191238/http://www.inotherwords-project.eu/content/project/media-analysis/terminology/terminology-concerning-roma |contribution = Roma, Sinti, Gypsies, Travellers...The Correct Terminology about Roma |title = In Other Words project |publisher = Web Observatory &amp; Review for Discrimination alerts &amp; Stereotypes deconstruction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Romani'' is the feminine adjective, while ''Romano'' is the masculine adjective. Some Romanies use ''Rom'' or ''Roma'' as an ethnic name, while others (such as the [[Sinti]], or the [[Romanichal]]) do not use this term as a self-ascription for the entire ethnic group.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=xix}}

Sometimes, ''rom'' and ''romani'' are spelled with a double ''r'', i.e., ''rrom'' and ''rromani''. In this case ''rr'' is used to represent the [[phoneme]] [[Uvular trill|{{IPA|/ʀ/}}]] (also written as ''ř'' and ''rh''), which in some Romani dialects has remained different from the one written with a single ''r''. The ''rr'' spelling is common in certain institutions (such as the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|INALCO Institute]] in Paris), or used in certain countries, e.g., [[Romania]], to distinguish from the [[endonym]]/[[homonym]] for [[Romanians]] (''sg. român, pl. români'').{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=xxi}}

=== English usage ===

In the English language (according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]), ''Rom'' is a noun (with the plural ''Roma'' or ''Roms'') and an adjective, while ''Romani'' (''Romany'') is also a noun (with the plural ''Romani'', ''the Romani'', ''Romanies'' or ''Romanis'') and an adjective.  Both ''Rom'' and ''Romani'' have been in use in English since the 19th century as an alternative for Gypsy{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. ''Romani'' was initially spelled ''Rommany'', then ''Romany'', while today the ''Romani'' spelling is the most popular spelling.  Occasionally, the double ''r'' spelling (e.g., ''Rroma'', ''Rromani'') mentioned above is also encountered in English texts.

The term ''Roma'' is increasingly encountered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |page = 52 |first1 = Elena |last1 = Marushiakova |first2 = Vesselin |last2 = Popov |contribution = Historical and ethnographic background; gypsies, Roma, Sinti |editor-first = Will |editor-last = Guy |title = Between Past and Future: The Roma of Central and Eastern Europe [with a Foreword by Dr. Ian Hancock] |year = 2001 |place = UK |publisher = University of Hertfordshire Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |page = 13 |first1 = Illona |last = Klimova-Alexander |title = The Romani Voice in World Politics: The United Nations and Non-State Actors |year = 2005 |place = Burlington, VT |publisher = Ashgate }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a generic term for the Romani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Xavier |last = Rothéa |title = Les Roms, une nation sans territoire? |url = http://www.theyliewedie.org/ressources/biblio/fr/Rothea_Xavier_-_Les_roms.html |website = Theyliewedie.org |accessdate = 31 July 2008 |language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |first = Bryan A |last = Garner |title = Dictionary of Legal Usage |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YwLiALrHLCEC&amp;pg=PA400 |year = 2011 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-0-19-538420-8 |pages = 400– }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = O'Nions |first = Helen |title = Minority rights protection in international law: the Roma of Europe |year = 2007 |publisher = Ashgate |isbn = 978-1-4094-9092-0 |page = 6 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=lN1Nj_IjUiUC&amp;pg=PA6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because all Romanies use the word ''Romani'' as an adjective, the term became a noun for the entire ethnic group.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=xx}} Today, the term ''Romani'' is used by some organizations{{snd}} including the [[United Nations]] and the US Library of Congress.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=xxi}} However, the [[Council of Europe]] and other organizations consider that ''Roma'' is the correct term referring to all related groups, regardless of their country of origin, and recommend that ''Romani'' be restricted to the language and culture: [[Romani language]], [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]].&lt;ref name="words" /&gt;

The standard assumption is that the [[demonym]]s of the Romani people, [[Lom people|Lom]] and [[Dom people|Dom]] share the same origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://imeu.net/news/article004439.shtml |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070523142528/http://imeu.net/news/article004439.shtml |archivedate = 23 May 2007 |title = Dom: The Gypsy community in Jerusalem |publisher = The Institute for Middle East Understanding |date = 13 February 2007 |accessdate = 17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Romany |title = Etymology of Romani |publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary |first = Douglas |last = Harper |date = 13 February 2007 |accessdate = 17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term ''Gypsy'' (or ''Gipsy'') originates from the [[Middle English]] ''gypcian'', short for ''Egipcien''. The Spanish term ''Gitano'' and French ''Gitan'' have similar etymologies. They are ultimately derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Αιγύπτιοι}} (''Aigyptioi''), meaning Egyptian, via [[Latin]]. This designation owes its existence to the belief, common in the Middle Ages, that the Romani, or some related group (such as the Middle Eastern [[Dom people]]), were itinerant Egyptians.&lt;ref name= Soulis&gt;{{Citation |last = Soulis |first = G |year = 1961 |title = The Gypsies in the Byzantine Empire and the Balkans in the Late Middle Ages |series = Dumbarton Oaks Papers |publisher = Trustees for Harvard University |pages = 15, 141–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/72karin.html |title = Metal-workers, agriculturists, acrobats, military-people and fortune-tellers: Roma (Gypsies) in and around the Byzantine empire |first = Karin |last = White |year = 1999 |journal = Golden Horn |volume = 7 |issue = 2 |accessdate = 26 August 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010320210002/http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/72karin.html |archivedate = 20 March 2001 |df = dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one narrative they were exiled from Egypt as punishment for allegedly harbouring the [[Child Jesus|infant Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Fraser1992"&gt;{{Harvnb |Fraser |1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in [[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', the medieval French referred to the Romanies as ''Egyptiens''.

== Population and subgroups ==

=== Romani population ===
{{Main|Romani populations}}
For a variety of reasons, many Romanis choose not to register their ethnic identity in official censuses. There are an estimated 3.8 million Romani people in Europe (as of 2002),&lt;ref name="PanPfeil2003" /&gt; although some high estimates by Romani organizations give numbers as high as 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/romatravellers/Documentation/strategies/statistiques_en.asp |title = Compilation of population estimates |publisher = Council of Europe |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622154153/http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/romatravellers/documentation/strategies/statistiques_en.asp |archivedate = 22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant Romani populations are found in the [[Balkans]], in some Central European states, in Spain, France, Russia and Ukraine. Several million more Romanies may live out of Europe, in particular in the Middle East and in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution-url = http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/my-big-fat-american-gypsy-wedding/about-the-show/gypsies-in-america/ |title = My big, fat American Gypsy wedding |contribution = There are Gypsies in America? Where? |publisher = TLC |date = 17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romani subgroups ===
Like the Roma in general, many different [[ethnonym]]s are given to subgroups of Roma. Sometimes a subgroup uses more than one [[endonym]], is commonly known by an [[exonym]] or erroneously by the endonym of another subgroup. The only name approaching an all-encompassing self-description is ''Rom''.{{sfn|Hübshmanová|2003}} Even when subgroups don't use the name, they all acknowledge a common origin and a dichotomy between themselves and ''[[Gadjo (non-Romani)|Gadjo]]'' (non-Roma).{{sfn |Hübshmanová|2003}} For instance, while the main group of Roma in [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]] refer to themselves as [[Sinti]], their name for their original language is ''Romanes''.

Subgroups have been described as, in part, a result of the [[Hindu caste system]], which the founding population of ''Rom'' almost certainly experienced in their South Asian ''[[urheimat]]''.{{sfn|Hübshmanová|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Horvátová |first = Jana |title = Kapitoly z dějin Romů |url = http://www.varianty.cz/cdrom/podkapitoly/d01kapitoly.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050312184629/http://www.varianty.cz/cdrom/podkapitoly/d01kapitoly.pdf |archivedate = 12 March 2005 |year = 2002 |publisher = Lidové noviny |place = Praha |language = Czech |page = 12 |format = PDF |quote = Mnohočetnost romských skupin je patrně pozůstatkem diferenciace Romů do původních indických kast a podkast.

Many groups use names apparently derived from the Romani word ''kalo'' or ''calo'', meaning "black" or "absorbing all light".&lt;ref&gt;[https://glosbe.com/rom/en/kalo ''Glosbe'' 2013, Dictionary/Romany-English Dictionary/kalo] (23 September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; This closely resembles words for "black" or "dark" in [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] languages  (e.g., [[Sanskrit]] काल [[Kāla (time)#Etymology|''kāla'']]: "black", "of a dark colour").{{sfn |Hübshmanová|2003}} Likewise the name of the [[Domba|Dom]] or Domba people of North India – to whom the Roma have genetic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 N. Rai et al., 2012, "The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations"] (23 September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; cultural and linguistic links – has come to imply "dark-skinned", in some Indian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Fonseca, ''Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and their Journey'', Random House, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence names such as ''kale'' and ''calé'' may have originated as an [[exonym]] or a euphemism for Roma.

=== Diaspora ===
{{Main|Romani diaspora}}
The Roma people have a number of distinct populations, the largest being the Roma and the Iberian Calé or Caló, who reached [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]] about the early 12th century, from a migration out of northwestern [[India]] beginning about 600 years earlier.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212012602 |author1 = Isabel Mendizabal |author2 = 21 others |title = Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data |journal = Current Biology |date = 6 December 2012 |accessdate = 12 December 2012 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.039 |volume = 22 |issue = 24 |pages = 2342–2349 |pmid = 23219723 |bibcode = 1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"&gt;{{cite news |author = Sindya N.

From the Balkans, they migrated throughout Europe and, in the nineteenth and later centuries, to the Americas. The Romani population in the [[United States]] is estimated at more than one million.&lt;ref name="time note"&gt;"Today, estimates put the number of Roma in the U.S. at about one million."&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil has the second largest Romani population in the Americas, estimated at approximately 800,000 by the 2011 census. The Romani people are mainly called by non-Romani ethnic Brazilians as ''ciganos''. Most of them belong to the ethnic subgroup ''Calés'' (Kale), of the Iberian peninsula. [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], Brazilian president during 1956–1961 term, was 50% Czech Romani by his mother's bloodline; and [[Washington Luís]], last president of the [[First Brazilian Republic]] (1926–1930 term), had Portuguese Kale ancestry.

{{Main|Origin of the Romani people}}
Findings suggest an [[Indian people|Indian]] origin for Roma.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Current Biology }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Romani groups did not keep chronicles of their history or have oral accounts of it, most hypotheses about the Romani's migration early history are based on linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rombase.uni-graz.at//cgi-bin/artframe.pl?src=data/hist/origin/origin.en.xml |title = Origin of Roma |first = Milena |last = Hübschmannová |year = 2002 |website = RomBase |publisher = Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz |accessdate = 3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no known record of a migration from India to Europe from medieval times that can be connected indisputably to Roma.{{sfn |Matras|2002|p= 14}}

=== ''Shahnameh'' legend ===
According to a legend reported in the [[Persian language|Persian]] epic poem, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', from [[Iran]] and repeated by several modern authors, the [[Sasanian]] king [[Bahram V|Bahrām V Gōr]] learned towards the end of his reign (421–39) that the poor could not afford to enjoy music, and he asked the king of India to send him ten thousand ''luris'', lute-playing experts.  When the luris arrived, Bahrām gave each one an ox, a donkey, and a donkey-load of wheat so that they could live on agriculture and play music for free for the poor. But the luris ate the oxen and the wheat and came back a year later with their cheeks hollowed with hunger. The king, angered with their having wasted what he had given them, ordered them to pack up their bags and go wandering around the world on their donkeys.&lt;ref name="GYPSY i"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Digard |first = Jean-Pierre |title = GYPSY i. Gypies of Persia |encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Iranica |accessdate = 22 July 2013 |url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gypsy-i }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguistic evidence ===
The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that the roots of the Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a large part of the basic lexicon, for example, regarding body parts or daily routines.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation |last1 = Šebková |first1 = Hana |last2 = Žlnayová |first2 = Edita |year = 1998 |url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf |title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) |place = Ústí nad Labem |publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Milena |last = Hübschmannová |title = Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku |journal = Bulletin Muzea Romské Kultury |issue = 4/1995 |year = 1995 |place = Brno |quote = Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romani and [[Domari language|Domari]] share some similarities: [[agglutination]] of postpositions of the second Layer (or [[case marking]] clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative.{{sfn|Matras|2002|p=48}} This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be a "sister language" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent{{snd}} but later research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the [[Central zone]] ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom therefore likely descend from two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.&lt;ref name="Domari"&gt;{{cite web |title = What is Domari? |publisher = University of Manchester.

In [[phonology]], Romani language shares a number of isoglosses with the Central branch of Indo-Aryan languages especially in the realization of some sounds of the Old Indo-Aryan. However, it also preserves a number of dental clusters. In regards to verb morphology, Romani follows the exact same pattern of northwestern languages such as [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers, lending credence to the theory of their Central Indian origin and a subsequent migration to northwestern India. Though the retention of dental clusters suggests a break from central languages during the transition from Old to Middle Indo-Aryan, the overall morphology suggests that the language participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref name=Elsevier /&gt;

=== Genetic evidence ===
[[File:Francisco Iturrino Two Gypsies.jpg|thumb|right|Two Gypsies in Spain, by [[Francisco Iturrino]]]]

This is lent further credence by its sharing the exact same pattern of northwestern languages such as [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers. The overall morphology suggests that Romani participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan languages]], thus indicating that the proto-Romani did not leave the Indian subcontinent until late in the second half of the first millennium.&lt;ref name=Elsevier&gt;{{cite web |title = Romani |url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/downloads/2/Matras_Rmni_ELL.pdf |format = PDF |website = Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics |publisher = Oxford: Elsevier |access-date = 30 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Another Darkness Another Dawn |last = Taylor |first = Becky |publisher = Reaktion Books Ltd.: |year = 2014 |location = London UK |pages = 22 |isbn = 978-1-78023-257-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Romani people}}

=== Arrival in Europe ===
Though according to a 2012 genomic study, the Romani reached the Balkans as early as the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;Mendizabal et. al (2012) "Our results further indicate that after a rapid migration with moderate gene flow from the Near or Middle East, the European spread of the Romani people was via the Balkans starting ∼0.9 kya."&lt;/ref&gt; the first historical records of the Romani reaching south-eastern Europe are from the 14th century: in 1322 after leaving Ireland on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Irish [[Franciscan]] monk [[Symon Semeonis]] encountered a migrant group of Romani outside the town of Candia (modern [[Heraklion]]), in [[Crete]], calling them "the descendants of [[Cain]]"; his account is the earliest surviving description by a Western chronicler of the Romani in Europe. In 1350 [[Ludolph of Saxony]] mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called ''Mandapolos'', a word some think derives from the Greek word ''mantes'' (meaning prophet or fortune teller).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title = gypsies |first = Linda |last = Anfuso |date = 24 February 1994 |newsgroup = rec.org.sca |message-id = PaN9Hc2w165w@tinhat.stonemarche.org |url = http://www.florilegium.org/files/CULTURES/Gypsies-msg.html |accessdate = 5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1360, a [[fiefdom]], called the ''[[Feudum Acinganorum]]'' was established in [[Corfu]], which mainly used Romani serfs and to which the Romani on the island were subservient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Charles |last1 = Keil |first2 = Dick |last2 = Blau |first3 = Angeliki |last3 = Keil |first4 = Steven |last4 = Feld |title = Bright Balkan Morning: Romani Lives and the Power of Music in Greek Macedonia |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxA6JA49B4C&amp;pg=PA50 |date = 9 December 2002 |publisher = Wesleyan University Press |isbn = 978-0-8195-6488-7 |pages = 50–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1440s, they were recorded in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ee5eOkd62BEC&amp;pg=PA11 |title = Ethnicity and Education in England and Europe: Gangstas, Geeks and Gorjas |author1 = Dr Ian Law |author2 = Dr Sarah Swann |page = 11 |website = Books.google.com |date = 28 January 2013 |accessdate = 20 December 2016 |isbn = 978-1-4094-9484-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 16th century, Scotland and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qfQ4iFhXx4YC&amp;pg=PA42 |title = Language Contact: Theoretical and Empirical Studies |author = Ernst Hĺkon Jahr |page = 42 |website = Books.google.com |date =  |accessdate = 20 December 2016 |isbn = 978-3-11-012802-4 |year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Romani migrated from [[Persia]] through North Africa, reaching the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 15th century.

=== Early Modern history ===
[[File:Sclavi Tiganesti.jpg|thumb|right|An 1852 [[Wallachia]]n poster advertising an auction of Romani slaves in [[Bucharest]]]]

Their early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in [[Wallachia]], they were issued safe conduct by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund]] in 1417.&lt;ref name="kenrick"&gt;{{Citation |first = Donald |last = Kenrick |title = Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies) |edition = 2nd |publisher = Scarecrow |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}  Romanies were ordered expelled from the [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen region]] of Germany in 1416, [[Lucerne]] in 1471, [[Milan]] in 1493, France in 1504, [[Catalonia]] in 1512, [[Sweden]] in 1525, [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1530 (see [[Egyptians Act 1530]]), and [[Denmark]] in 1536.&lt;ref name="kenrick" /&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}  In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, and Denmark in 1589, whereas [[Portugal]] began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538.&lt;ref name="kenrick" /&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}

A 1596 English statute gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked. France passed a similar law in 1683. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great of Russia]] declared the Romanies "crown slaves" (a status superior to [[serfs]]), but also kept them out of certain parts of [[St. Petersburg, Russia|the capital]].&lt;ref name="Norman Davies 1996 387–388"&gt;{{cite book |first = Norman |last = Davies |title = Europe: A History |author-link = Norman Davies |isbn = 978-0-19-820171-7 |year = 1996 |pages = 387–88 |title-link = Europe: A History }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1595, [[Ștefan Răzvan]] overcame his birth into slavery, and became the [[Voivode]] ([[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]]) of [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="kenrick" /&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}

Since a royal edict by [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/roma/Source/FS2/3.3_roundup-spain_english.pdf |author = Antonio Gómez Alfaro |title = The Great "Gypsy" Round-up in Spain |page = 4 |format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region. In the [[Great Gypsy Round-up]], Romani were arrested and imprisoned by the [[Spanish Monarchy]] in 1749.

During the latter part of the 17th century around the time of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] both France and Holland needed thousands of men to fight. Some recruitment took the form of rounding up vagrants and the poor to work the galleys and provide labour force for the armies. With this background, Gypsies were targets by both the French and the Dutch.

After the wars, and into the first decade of the 18th century, Gypsies were slaughtered with impunity throughout Holland. Gypsies, called ‘heiden’ by the Dutch, wandered throughout the rural areas of Europe and became the societal pariahs of the age. Gypsy-hunt or ''heidenjachten'', translated as "heathen hunt" happened throughout Holland in an attempt to eradicate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Another Darkness Another Dawn |last = Taylor |first = Becky |publisher = Reaktion Books Ltd.: |year = 2014 |location = London UK |pages = 72 |isbn = 978-1-78023-257-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some Romani could be kept as slaves in Wallachia and Moldavia until [[abolitionism|abolition]] in 1856, the majority traveled as free nomads with their wagons, as alluded to in the spoked wheel symbol in the [[Flag of the Romani people|Romanies flag]].{{sfn|Hancock|2001|p=25}} Elsewhere in Europe, they were subject to [[ethnic cleansing]], abduction of their children, and [[forced labor]]. In England, Romani were sometimes expelled from small communities or hanged; in France, they were branded and their heads were shaved; in [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]], the women were marked by their ears being severed. As a result, large groups of the Romani moved to the East, toward [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], which was more tolerant, and [[Ruska Roma|Russia]], where the Romani were treated more fairly as long as they paid the annual taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8136812.stm |first = Delia |last = Radu |title = 'On the Road': Centuries of Roma History |publisher = BBC |newspaper = World Service |date = 8 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
Romani began emigrating to North America in colonial times, with small groups recorded in [[Virginia]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]]. Larger-scale [[Roma in the United States|Roma emigration to the United States]] began in the 1860s, with groups of Romanichal from Great Britain.  The largest number immigrated in the early 1900s, mainly from the Vlax group of [[Kalderash]]. Many Romani also settled in South America.

==== World War II ====
{{Main|Porajmos}}
During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazis]] embarked on a systematic [[genocide]] of the Romani, a process known in Romani as the ''[[Porajmos]]''.&lt;ref name="Milton estimates"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles=true |title = Romanies and the holocaust: a reevaluation and an overview |website = Radoc.net |first = Ian |last = Hancock }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in [[concentration camp]]s.

They were often killed on sight, especially by the [[Einsatzgruppen]] (paramilitary death squads) on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005130 |title = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate = 2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220,000 and 1,500,000; even the lower figure would make the Porajmos one of the largest mass killings in history.&lt;ref name="hancock2005"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter = True Romanies and the Holocaust: A Re-evaluation and an overview |chapter-url = http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles= |last = Hancock |first = Ian |title = The Historiography of the Holocaust |isbn = 978-1-4039-9927-6 |pages = 383–96 |year = 2005 |publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of Romani in Nazi partner states differed markedly. In the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the separatist [[Ustasa]] organization killed around 25,000 Roma, almost the entire Roma population. The concentration camp system of [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], run by the Ustasa militia and the Croat political police, were responsible for the deaths of between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005219 |title = GENOCIDE OF EUROPEAN ROMA (GYPSIES), 1939–1945 |publisher = Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate = 27 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-1945 ====
In [[Czechoslovakia]], they were labeled a "socially degraded stratum," and Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future welfare payments, with misinformation, or after administering drugs.{{Sfn |Silverman |1995}}{{Sfn |Helsinki Watch |1991}}

An official inquiry from the Czech Republic, resulting in a report (December 2005), concluded that the Communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards Romanis, which "included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community. The problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the Czech Republic, either with improper motivation or illegally, exists," said the Czech Public Defender of Rights, recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date = 12 March 2007 |first = Marina |last = Denysenko |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6409699.stm |title = Sterilised Roma accuse Czechs |publisher = BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cases were revealed up until 2004, in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

[[File:Auguste Raffet, Famille tsigane en voyage en Moldavie, 1837.jpg|thumb|upright =1.36|Nomadic Roma family traveling in [[Moldavia]], 1837]]

The traditional Romanies place a high value on the [[extended family]]. [[Virginity]] is essential in unmarried women. Both men and women often marry young; there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of [[child marriage]]. Romani law establishes that the man's family must pay a [[bride price]] to the bride's parents, but only traditional families still follow this rule.

Once married, the woman joins the husband's family, where her main job is to tend to her husband's and her children's needs, as well as to take care of her in-laws. The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather, and men in general have more authority than women. Women gain respect and authority as they get older. Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children.

Romani [[social behavior]] is strictly regulated by Hindu purity laws&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FQT2Gp16j68C&amp;pg=PA210 |title = Gypsy Law: Romani Legal Traditions and Culture |page = 210 |first = Walter Otto |last = Weyrauch |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-520-22186-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("marime" or "marhime"), still respected by most Roma (and by most older generations of [[Sinti]]). This regulation affects many aspects of life, and is applied to actions, people and things: parts of [[Human anatomy|the human body]] are considered impure: the [[Sex organ|genital organs]] (because they produce emissions), as well as the rest of the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of [[menstruation|menstruating]] women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are also washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered impure, and must occur outside the dwelling place. The mother is considered impure for forty days after giving birth.

Death is considered impure, and affects the whole family of the dead, who remain impure for a period of time. In contrast to the practice of [[cremation|cremating]] the dead, Romani dead must be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/death.htm |title = Romani Customs and Traditions: Death Rituals and Customs |publisher = Patrin Web Journal |accessdate = 26 August 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070821022337/http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/death.htm |archivedate = 21 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the [[Rigveda]], and both are widely practiced in [[Hinduism]] today (although the tendency is for Hindus to practice cremation, while some communities in South India tend to bury their dead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hindugateway.com/library/rituals/ |title = The Journey of a Lifebody |publisher = hindugateway.com |date = 1991 |accessdate = 26 May 2008 |first = David M. |last = Knipe |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080930232759/http://www.hindugateway.com/library/rituals/ |archivedate = 30 September 2008 |df = dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animals are also considered impure, for instance cats because they lick their hindquarters. Horses, in contrast, are not considered impure because they cannot do so.{{sfn|Hancock|2001|p=81}}

=== Belonging and exclusion ===
{{Main|Romanipen|Gadjo (non-Romani)}}
'''Romanipen''' (also ''romanypen'', ''romanipe'', ''romanype'', ''romanimos'', ''romaimos'', ''romaniya'') is a complicated term of Romani philosophy that means totality of the Romani spirit, [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]], [[Kris (Romani court)|Romani Law]],  being a Romani, a set of Romani strains.

An ethnic Romani is considered a [[Gadjo (non-Romani)|gadjo]] in the Romani society if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a non-Romani may be considered a Romani if he has Romanipen. Usually this is an adopted child. As a concept, Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a [[Cultural framework|framework of culture]] rather than simply an adherence to historically received rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Saul |first1 = Nicholas |first2 = Susan |last2 = Tebbut |title = The Role of the Romanies: Images and Counter-Images of 'Gypsies'/Romanies in European Cultures |editor1-first = Nicholas |editor1-last = Saul |editor2-first = Susan |editor2-last = Tebbutt |publisher = Liverpool University Press |year = 2005 |page = 218 |isbn = 978-0-85323-689-4 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=AQw6qOCNj-UC&amp;pg=PA218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Tziganes aux Saintes-Maries de la Mer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|Christian Romanies during the pilgrimage at [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] in France, 1980s]]
Most Romani people are Christian, others [[Muslim Roma|Muslim]], some retained their ancient faith of [[Hinduism]] from their original homeland of [[India]], others have their own religion and political organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = G.

==== Beliefs ====
The ancestors of modern-day Romani people were previously [[Hindu]], but adopted Christianity or Islam depending on their respective regions through which they had migrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Restless Beings Project: Roma Engage |url = http://www.restlessbeings.org/projects/roma-gypsies |publisher = Restless Beings |accessdate = 26 December 2012 |year = 2008–2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim Roma]] are found in [[Turkey]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Egypt]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and [[Bulgaria]], forming a very significant proportion of the Romani people. In neighboring countries such as [[Serbia]], [[Greece]] most of the Romani inhabitants follow the practice of [[Orthodoxy]]. It is likely that the adherence to differing religions prevented families from engaging in intermarriage.&lt;ref name=Boretzky&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Boretzky |first1 = Norbert |title = Romani in Contact: The History, Structure and Sociology of a Language |date = 1995 |publisher = John Benjamins |location = Amsterdam, [[Netherlands|NL]] |page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, most Gitanos are Roman Catholics.
Some brotherhoods have organized Gitanos in their [[Semana Santa|Holy Week]] devotions.
They are popularly known as ''[[:es:Categoría:Cofradías de los Gitanos en España|Cofradía de los Gitanos]]''.
However, the proportion of followers of [[Evangelical Christianity]] among Gitanos is higher than among the rest of Spaniards.
Their version of ''el culto'' integrates [[Flamenco music]].

==== Deities and saints ====
[[Ceferino Giménez Malla|Blessed Ceferino Giménez Malla]] is recently considered a patron saint of the Romani people in Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Blessed Ceferino Gimenez Malla 1861–1936 |url = http://www.savior.org/saints/malla.htm |website = Visit the Saviour |publisher = Voveo |accessdate = 26 December 2012 |date = December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Sarah]], or Sara e Kali, has also been venerated as a patron saint in her shrine at [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]], France. Since the turn of the 21st century, [[Sara e Kali]] is understood to have been [[Kali]], an Indian deity brought from India by the refugee ancestors of the Roma people; as the Roma became Christianized, she was absorbed in a syncretic way and worshipped as a saint.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

==== Ceremonies and practices ====
Romanies often adopt the dominant religion of their host country in the event that a ceremony associated with a formal religious institution is necessary, such as a baptism or funeral (their particular belief systems and indigenous religion and worship remain preserved regardless of such adoption processes). The Roma continue to practice "[[Shaktism]]", a practice with origins in India, whereby a female consort is required for the worship of a god. Adherence to this practice means that for the Roma who worship the Christian God, prayer is conducted through the [[Virgin Mary]], or her mother, [[Saint Anne]]{{snd}} Shaktism continues over one thousand years after the people's separation from India.&lt;ref name="Cac"&gt;{{cite web |title = Roma |url = http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Roma.html#b |website = Countries and their Cultures |publisher = Advameg |accessdate = 26 December 2012 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Roma elders (who serve as spiritual leaders), priests, churches, or bibles do not exist among the Romanies{{snd}} the only exception is the Pentecostal Roma.&lt;ref name="Cac" /&gt;

==== Balkans ====
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Studio Shot of European in Gypsy Costume One of 274 Vintage Photographs.jpg|thumb|Costume of a Romani woman]]
For the Roma communities that have resided in the Balkans for numerous centuries, often referred to as "Turkish Gypsies", the following histories apply for religious beliefs:

* Albania – The majority of Albania's Roma people are Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Joshua Project |url = http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14567/AL |title = Romani, Vlax, Southern in Albania Ethnic People Profile |accessdate = 10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro – Islam is the dominant religion among the Roma.&lt;ref name="Roma" /&gt;
* Bulgaria – In northwestern Bulgaria, in addition to Sofia and Kyustendil, Christianity is the dominant faith among Romani people (a major conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity among Romani people has occurred). In southeastern Bulgaria, Islam is the dominant religion among Romani people, with a smaller section of the Romani population, declaring themselves as "Turks", continuing to mix ethnicity with Islam.&lt;ref name="Roma"&gt;{{cite web |title = Roma Muslims in the Balkans |url = http://romafacts.uni-graz.at/index.php/culture/introduction/roma-muslims-in-the-balkans |website = Education of Roma Children in Europe |publisher = Council of Europe |accessdate = 26 December 2012 |first1 = Elena |last1 = Marushiakova |first2 = Veselin |last2 = Popov |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Croatia – Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], a large number of Muslim Roma relocated to Croatia (the majority moving from Kosovo).&lt;ref name="Roma" /&gt;
* Greece – The descendants of groups, such as Sepečides or Sevljara, Kalpazaja, Filipidži and others, living in Athens, Thessaloniki, central Greece and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]] are mostly Orthodox Christians, with Islamic beliefs held by a minority of the population. Following the Peace Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, many Muslim Roma moved to Turkey in the subsequent population exchange between Turkey and Greece.&lt;ref name="Roma" /&gt;

In [[Ukraine]] and Russia the Roma populations are also Muslim as the families of Balkan migrants continue to live in these locations. Their ancestors settled on the Crimean peninsula during the 17th and 18th centuries, but then migrated to Ukraine, southern Russia and the Povolzhie (along the Volga River). Formally, Islam is the religion that these communities align themselves with and the people are recognized for their staunch preservation of the Romani language and identity.&lt;ref name="Roma" /&gt;

Romani music plays an important role in Central and Eastern European countries such as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, the [[Republic of Macedonia]], Albania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania, and the style and performance practices of Romani musicians have influenced European [[List of classical music composers|classical composers]] such as [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Johannes Brahms]]. The ''[[lăutari]]'' who perform at traditional Romanian weddings are virtually all Romani.

Probably the most internationally prominent contemporary performers{{fact|date=September 2018}} in the ''lăutari'' tradition are [[Taraful Haiducilor]]. Bulgaria's popular "wedding music", too, is almost exclusively performed by Romani musicians such as [[Ivo Papasov]], a virtuoso clarinetist closely associated with this genre and Bulgarian pop-folk singer [[Azis]].

Many famous classical musicians, such as the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] pianist [[Georges Cziffra]], are Romani, as are many prominent performers of [[manele]]. [[Zdob și Zdub]], one of the most prominent rock bands in [[Moldova]], although not Romanies themselves, draw heavily on Romani music, as do [[Spitalul de Urgență]] in Romania, [[Shantel]] in Germany, [[Goran Bregović]] in Serbia, [[Darko Rundek]] in Croatia, [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]] and [[Gogol Bordello]] in the United States.

Another tradition of Romani music is the genre of the Romani [[brass band]], with such notable practitioners as [[Boban Marković]] of Serbia, and the brass ''lăutari'' groups [[Fanfare Ciocărlia]] and Fanfare din Cozmesti of Romania.

Many musical instruments like violins and guitars are said{{by whom |date=February 2015}} to have originated from the Romani. Many dances such as the flamenco of Spain and Oriental dances of Egypt are also said to have originated from them.&lt;ref name="Gypsy dance origin"&gt;{{Citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bzd1CTtnjS8C&amp;pg=PA21 |title = Flamenco: All You Wanted to Know |page = 21 |format = [[Google books]] |isbn = 978-1-60974-470-0 |author1 = Martinez |first1 = Emma |date = 24 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive sound of Romani music has also strongly influenced [[bolero]], [[jazz]], and [[flamenco]] (especially ''[[cante jondo]]'') in Spain. European-style [[gypsy jazz]] ("jazz Manouche" or "Sinti jazz") is still widely practiced among the original creators (the Romanie People); one who acknowledged this artistic debt was guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]]. Contemporary artists in this tradition known internationally include [[Stochelo Rosenberg]], [[Biréli Lagrène]], [[Jimmy Rosenberg]], [[Paulus Schäfer]] and [[Tchavolo Schmitt]].

The Romanies of Turkey have achieved musical acclaim from national and local audiences. Local performers usually perform for special holidays. Their music is usually performed on instruments such as the [[goblet drum|darbuka]], [[clarinet|gırnata]] and [[cümbüş]].&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.rootsworld.com/turkey/cumbus.html |publisher = Rootsworld |title = Cümbüş means fun, Birger Gesthuisen investigates the short history of a 20th-century folk instrument }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary art and culture ==
{{Main|Romani contemporary art}}
[[Romani contemporary art]] is art created by Romani people. It emerged at the climax of the process that began in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the late-1980s, when the interpretation of the cultural practice of minorities was enabled by a paradigm shift, commonly referred to in specialist literature as the [[Cultural turn]]. The idea of the "cultural turn" was introduced; and this was also the time when the notion of cultural democracy became crystallized in the debates carried on at various public forums. [[Civil society]] gained strength, and civil politics appeared, which is a prerequisite for cultural democracy. This shift of attitude in scholarly circles derived from concerns specific not only to ethnicity, but also to society, gender and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Meet Your Neighbors |url = https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/neighbours_20090615.pdf |work = opensourcefoundations.org |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
{{Main|Romani language}}

Most Romani speak one of several dialects of the [[Romani language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xdtBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235 |title = Comparative-Historical Linguistics |isbn = 9789027276988 |last1 = Brogyanyi |first1 = Bela |last2 = Lipp |first2 = Reiner |date = 6 May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language, with roots in Sanskrit. They also often speak the languages of the countries they live in. Typically, they also incorporate [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s into Romani from the languages of those countries and especially words for terms that the Romani language does not have. Most of the ''Ciganos'' of Portugal, the [[Gitanos]] of Spain, the [[Romanichal]] of the UK, and [[Norwegian and Swedish Travellers|Scandinavian Travellers]] have lost their [[knowledge]] of pure Romani, and respectively speak the [[mixed language]]s [[Caló (Spanish Romani)|Caló]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rmq |chapter = Caló: A language of Spain |publisher = SIL International |editor-first = Raymond G |editor-last = Gordon Jr. |year = 2005 |title = Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition = 15th |location = Dallas, [[Texas|TX]] |isbn = 978-1-55671-159-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angloromany]], and [[Scandoromani]]. Most of the speaker communities in these regions consist of later immigrants from eastern or central Europe.&lt;ref name="Manchester_Rom"&gt;{{cite web |last = Matras |first = Yaron |title = Romani Linguistics and Romani Language Projects |url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/status/numbers.shtml |website = Humanities |publisher = The University of Manchester |accessdate = 24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no concrete statistics for the number of [[Romani language|Romani]] speakers, both in Europe and globally. However, a conservative estimation has been made at 3.5 million speakers in Europe and a further 500,000 elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Matras |first = Yaron |title = Romani Linguistics and Romani Language Projects |url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/status/numbers.shtml |website = Humanities |publisher = The University of Manchester |accessdate = 24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the actual number may be considerably higher. This makes Romani the second largest [[minority language]] in Europe, behind [[Catalan language|Catalan]].&lt;ref name="Manchester_Rom" /&gt;

In relation to dialect diversity, Romani works in the same way as most other European languages.&lt;ref name="The status of Romani in Europe"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Matras |first = Yaron |format = PDF |title = The status of Romani in Europe |journal = Report Submitted to the Council of Europe's Language Policy Division |date = October 2005 |page = 4 |url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/downloads/1/statusofromani.pdf |accessdate = 4 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-dialect communication is dominated by the following features:
* All [[Romani language|Romani]] speakers are [[bilingual]], and are accustomed to borrowing words or phrases from a [[second language]]; this makes it difficult when trying to communicate with Romanis from different countries
* [[Romani language|Romani]] was traditionally a [[language]] shared between extended family and a close-knit community.  This has resulted in the inability to comprehend [[dialects]] from other countries. This is the reason Romani is sometimes associated as being number of different languages.
* There is no tradition or example of a literary standard for Romani speakers to use as a guideline for their language use.&lt;ref name="The status of Romani in Europe" /&gt;

== Persecutions ==
{{Main|Anti-Romanyism}}

=== Historical persecution ===
One of the most enduring persecutions against the Romani people was their enslavement. [[Slavery in medieval Europe|Slavery was widely practiced in medieval Europe]], including the territory of present-day Romania from before the founding of the principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] in the 13th–14th century.&lt;ref name=Achim&gt;{{Citation |first = Viorel |last = Achim |title = The Roma in Romanian History |publisher = Central European University Press |place = Budapest |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-963-9241-84-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}} Legislation decreed that all the Romani living in these states, as well as any others who immigrated there, were classified as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Istoria și tradițiile minorității rromani |page = 36 |year = 2005 |publisher = Sigma |location = Bucharest |author1-link = Delia Grigore |last1 = Grigore |first1 = Delia |first2 = Petre |last2 = Petcuț |first3 = Mariana |last3 = Sandu |language = Romanian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was gradually [[Abolitionism|abolished]] during the 1840s and 1850s.{{Sfn |Achim |2004}}{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}

The exact origins of [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]] are not known. There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or were brought as slaves. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, in which the [[Romanians]] took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to use their labor. Other historians believe that the Romani were enslaved, while captured during the battles, with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving war prisoners may also have been adopted from the Mongols.&lt;ref name=Achim /&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}

Some Romani may have been slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, but most of them migrated from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities. After the Roma migrated into the area, slavery became a widespread practice by the majority population. The [[Tatars|Tatar]] slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first = Ștefan |last = Ștefănescu |title = Istoria medie a României |volume = I |publisher = Editura Universității din București |place = Bucharest |year = 1991 |language = ro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some branches of the Romani people reached Western Europe in the 15th century, fleeing as refugees from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Gypsy/Roma European migrations from 15th century till nowadays |url = https://www.academia.edu/1132677/Gypsy_Roma_European_migrations_from_15th_century_till_nowadays |work = academia.edu |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Romani were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe, they were often suspected by certain populations in the West of being associated with the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]] because of their physical features seemed related to the Turks. (The [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)#The Reichstag in the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Diet]] at Landau and Freiburg in 1496–1498 declared that the Romani were spies of the Turks). In Western Europe, such suspicions and discrimination against a people who were a visible minority resulted in persecution, often violent, with efforts to achieve [[ethnic cleansing]] until the modern era. In times of social tension, the Romani suffered as scapegoats; for instance, they were accused of bringing the plague during times of [[epidemics]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/timeline.htm |publisher = Patrin Web Journal |title = Timeline of Romani History |accessdate = 26 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111142247/http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/timeline.htm |archivedate = 11 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 1749, Spain conducted [[The Great Roundup of Gypsies (1749)|''The Great Roundup'']] of [[Romani people in Spain|Romani]] (Gitanos) in its territory. The Spanish Crown ordered a nationwide raid that led to the break-up of families as all able-bodied men were interned into forced labor camps in an attempt at ethnic cleansing. The measure was eventually reversed and the Gypsies were freed as protests began to arise in different communities, sedentary gypsies being highly esteemed and protected in rural Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://web.jet.es/gea21/mteorico/apuntes/anexo3.htm |title = Cap. 2: 2.1 Apuntes sobre la situación de la comunidad gitana en la sociedad Española – Anexo III.

Later in the 19th century, Romani immigration was forbidden on a racial basis in areas outside Europe, mostly in the English-speaking world. (Argentina in 1880 prohibited immigration by Roma, as did the United States in 1885.)&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

=== Forced assimilation ===
In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] (1740–1780), a series of decrees tried to force the Romanies to [[sedentism|permanently settle]], removed rights to horse and wagon ownership (1754), renamed them as "New Citizens" and forced Romani boys into military service if they had no trade (1761), forced them to register with the local authorities (1767), and prohibited marriage between Romanies (1773). Her successor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Josef II]] prohibited the wearing of traditional Romani clothing and the use of the [[Romani language]], punishable by flogging.&lt;ref name="samer" /&gt;

In Spain, attempts to assimilate the Gitanos were under way as early as 1619, when Gitanos were forcibly settled, the use of the [[Romani language]] was prohibited, Gitano men and women were sent to separate workhouses and their children sent to orphanages. [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] took on a more progressive attitude to Gitano assimilation, proclaiming their equal rights as Spanish citizens and ending official denigration based on their race. While he prohibited the nomadic lifestyle, the use of the [[Caló (Spanish Romani)|Calo language]], Romani clothing, their trade in horses and other itinerant trades, he also forbade any form of discrimination against them or barring them from the guilds. The use of the word ''gitano'' was also forbidden to further assimilation, substituted for "New Castilian", which was also applied to former Jews and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |first=Angus |surname= Fraser |title = Los gitanos|publisher = Ariel|year = 2005|isbn = 978-84-344-6780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Texto de la pragmática en la [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnBFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=%22Declaro+que+los+que+llaman+y+se+dicen+gitanos+no+lo+son+por+origen+ni+por+naturaleza,+ni+provienen+de+raiz+infecta+alguna%22&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=6SjhTfOKGpK08QPQmvWXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Declaro%20que%20los%20que%20llaman%20y%20se%20dicen%20gitanos%20no%20lo%20son%20por%20origen%20ni%20por%20naturaleza%2C%20ni%20provienen%20de%20raiz%20infecta%20alguna%22&amp;f=false ''Novísima Recopilación''. Ley XI], pg. 367 y ss.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians agree that Charles III pragmática failed due to three main reasons, ultimately derived from its implementation outside major cities and in marginal areas: The difficulty the Gitano community faced in changing its nomadic lifestyle, the marginal lifestyle in which the community had been driven by society and the serious difficulties of applying the pragmática in the fields of education and work. One author ascribes its failure to the overall rejection by the wider population of the integration of the Gitanos.&lt;ref name="samer"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rombase.uni-graz.at//cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml |title = Maria Theresia and Joseph II: Policies of Assimilation in the Age of Enlightened Absolutism |publisher = Karl-Franzens-Universitaet Graz |website = Rombase |date = December 2001 |first = Helmut |last = Samer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.everyculture.com/Europe/Gitanos-History-and-Cultural-Relations.html |title = Gitanos.

Other examples of forced assimilation include [[Norway]], where a law was passed in 1896 permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kenrick |first = Donald |title = Roma in Norway |url = http://www.reocities.com/~patrin/norway.htm |publisher = Patrin Web Journal |accessdate = 13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in some 1,500 Romani children being taken from their parents in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/central-committee/2002/the-church-of-norway-and-the-roma-of-norway |title = The Church of Norway and the Roma of Norway |publisher = [[World Council of Churches]] |date = 3 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holocaust ===
{{Main|Porajmos}}
The persecution of the Romanies reached a peak during World War II in the ''Porajmos'', the genocide perpetrated by the [[Nazis]] during [[the Holocaust]]. In 1935, the [[Nuremberg laws]] stripped the Romani people living in [[Nazi Germany]] of their citizenship, after which they were subjected to violence, imprisonment in [[concentration camp]]s and later genocide in [[extermination camp]]s. The policy was extended in areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably the Independent State of Croatia, Romania and Hungary.

Because no accurate pre-war census figures exist for the Romanis, it is impossible to accurately assess the actual number of victims. Most estimates for numbers of Romani victims of the Holocaust fall between 200,000 and 500,000, although figures ranging between 90,000 and 4 million have been proposed. Lower estimates do not include those killed in all Axis-controlled countries. A detailed study by Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian at the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]] gave a figure of at least a minimum of 220,000, possibly closer to 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cv/1996/685455.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040409001621/http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cv/1996/685455.pdf |archivedate = 9 April 2004 |title = Re. Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation (Swiss Banks) Special Master's Proposals |date = 11 September 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ian Hancock]], Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], argues in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |type = article |url = http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en |contribution = Romanies and the Holocaust: A Reevaluation and an Overview |editor-last = Stone |editor-first = D |year = 2004 |title = The Historiography of the Holocaust |publisher = Palgrave |place = Basingstoke and New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Europe, the extermination in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was so thorough that the [[Bohemian Romani]] language became extinct.

In 2008, following the brutal rape and subsequent murder of an Italian woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/02/italy.international |title = Italian woman's murder prompts expulsion threat to Romanians |work = The Guardian |date = 2 November 2007 |location = London |first = John |last = Hooper |accessdate = 14 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian government declared that Italy's Romani population represented a national security risk and that swift action was required to address the ''emergenza nomadi'' (''nomad emergency'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/30/roma-italy |title = Italy's new ghetto? |work = The Guardian |date = 30 March 2009 |location = London |first = Tana |last = de Zulueta |accessdate = 14 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas.

The 2008 [[Death of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic|deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic]], two Roma children who drowned while Italian beach-goers remained unperturbed, brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and the Roma people. Reviewing the state of play in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:{{quote|On International Roma Day, which falls on 8 April, the significant proportion of Europe's 12 million Roma who live in deplorable conditions will not have much to celebrate. And poverty is not the only worry for the community. Ethnic tensions are on the rise. In 2008, Roma camps came under attack in Italy, intimidation by racist parliamentarians is the norm in Hungary. Speaking in 1993, [[Václav Havel]] prophetically remarked that "the treatment of the Roma is a litmus test for democracy": and democracy has been found wanting. The consequences of the transition to capitalism have been disastrous for the Roma. Under communism they had jobs, free housing and schooling. Now many are unemployed, many are losing their homes and racism is increasingly rewarded with impunity.&lt;ref name="MO 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1757331-bleak-horizon |title = Bleak horizon |first = Hellen |last = Kooijman |place = EU |date = 6 April 2012 |publisher = Presseurop |accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 2016 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research poll]] found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma. In Greece 67%, in Hungary 64%, in France 61%, in Spain 49%, in Poland 47%, in the UK 45%, in Sweden 42%, in Germany 40%, and in the Netherlands 37% have an unfavourable view of Roma.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/europeans-fear-wave-of-refugees-will-mean-more-terrorism-fewer-jobs/lede-chart-2/ Negative opinions about Roma, Muslims in several European nations]".

=== Forced repatriation ===
{{Main|Expulsion of Romani people from France}}
In the summer of 2010 French authorities demolished at least 51 illegal Roma camps and began the [[French Romani repatriation|process of repatriating]] their residents to their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11020429 |title = France sends Roma Gypsies back to Romania |date = 20 August 2010 |agency = BBC News |accessdate = 28 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed tensions between the French state and Roma communities, which had been heightened after French police opened fire and killed a traveller who drove through a police checkpoint, hitting an officer, and attempted to hit two more officers at another checkpoint. In retaliation a group of Roma, armed with hatchets and iron bars, attacked the police station of Saint-Aignan, toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10681796 |title = Troops patrol French village of Saint-Aignan after riot |date = 10 July 2010 |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288 |title = Q&amp;A: France Roma expulsions |date = 15 September 2010 |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 16 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government has been accused of perpetrating these actions to pursue its political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = France Begins Controversial Roma Deportations |date = 19 August 2010 |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/sarkozy-finds-a-scapegoat-france-begins-controversial-roma-deportations-a-712701.html |work = Der Spiegel |accessdate = 20 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EU Justice Commissioner [[Viviane Reding]] stated that the [[European Commission]] should take legal action against France over the issue, calling the deportations "a disgrace". Purportedly, a leaked file dated 5 August, sent from the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Ministry]] to regional police chiefs included the instruction: "Three hundred camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months, Roma camps are a priority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11301307 |title = EU may take legal action against France over Roma |date = 14 September 2010 |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 15 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many depictions of Romani people in literature and art present romanticized narratives of mystical powers of [[fortune telling]] or irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. Romani were a popular subject in [[Venice|Venetian]] painting from the time of [[Giorgione]] at the start of the 16th century; the inclusion of such a figure adds an exotic oriental flavour to scenes. A [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting by [[Paris Bordone]] (ca. 1530, [[Strasbourg]]) of the [[Holy Family]] in Egypt makes [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], a gypsy [[Fortune-telling|fortune-teller]]; the scene is otherwise located in a distinctly European landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Jacquot |first = Dominique |title = Le musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg&amp;nbsp;— Cinq siècles de peinture |date = 2006 |publisher = Éditions des Musées de Strasbourg |location = Strasbourg |isbn = 978-2-901833-78-9 |page = 76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly notable are classics like the story ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'' by [[Prosper Mérimée]] and the [[Carmen|opera based on it]] by [[Georges Bizet]], [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', [[Herge]]'s ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]'' and [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''La Gitanilla''. The Romani were also depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', all by [[William Shakespeare]].

The Romani were also heavily romanticized in the [[Soviet Union]], a classic example being the 1975 ''[[Gypsies Are Found Near Heaven|Tabor ukhodit v Nebo]]''.
A more realistic depiction of contemporary [[Romani in the Balkans]], featuring Romani lay actors speaking in their native dialects, although still playing with established clichés of a Romani penchant for both magic and crime, was presented by [[Emir Kusturica]] in his ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1988) and ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]'' (1998). The films of [[Tony Gatlif]], a French director of Romani ethnicity, like ''Les Princes'' (1983), ''[[Latcho Drom]]'' (1993) and ''Gadjo Dilo'' (1997) also portray gypsy life.

The '''Museum of Romanian Literature "Mihail Kogălniceanu"''' ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Literaturii Române „Mihail Kogălniceanu”}}) is a museum in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].

== Overview ==

The museum was established on April 1, 1965, according to a governmental decision of the [[Moldovan SSR]] from February 10, 1965. Since the beginning, it was affiliated with the [[Moldovan Writers' Union]]. The first director was [[Gheorghe Cincilei]] (1936-1999). In 1983, the museum took the name of [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], and in 1991 became Centrul Naţional de Studii Literare şi Muzeografie „M.Kogălniceanu”. Since 1997, the museum has operated under the name Museum of Romanian Literature "Mihail Kogălniceanu".

The museum has over 90 thousand objects: secular and religious books (16th-21st century), [[manuscripts]], art objects, and documents. Most of the exhibited books are the editions of the Romanian classics.

Hours of service: summer: 10.00 - 18.00, winter: 9.00 – 17.00. Friday – closed.

[[File:Brugneto di San Marino.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A Bottle of wine from San Marino]]

'''Sammarinese wine''' is [[wine]] from [[San Marino]], which is home to a small but profitable wine industry. Being a small enclave within [[Italy]], its wine industry is often overshadowed by its larger neighbor. The region produces a number of wines such as Brugneto and Tessano (cask-aged red wines) and Biancale and Roncale (still white wines).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=731 Gastronomy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218130701/http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=731 |date=2007-12-18 }}, Visit San Marino&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transparency International e.V.''' ('''TI''') is an [[international non-governmental organization]] which is based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], and was founded in 1993. Its [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] purpose is to take action to combat global&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/impact|title=Our impact - Transparency International|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|website=www.transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[corruption]] with civil societal [[anti-corruption]] measures and to [[Crime prevention|prevent criminal activities]] arising from corruption. It publishes for example the [[Global Corruption Barometer]] and the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]. Transparency International has the legal status of a German registered voluntary association ''([[Eingetragener Verein]])'' and serves as an [[umbrella organization]]. Its members have grown from a few individuals to more than 100 national chapters which engage in fighting corruption in their home countries.&lt;ref name="Transparency International e.V"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation|title=Our Organisation – overview|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; TI confirmed the dis-accreditation of the national chapter of [[United States of America]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_confirms_the_disaccreditation_of_its_chapter_in|title=Transparency International confirms the disaccreditation of its chapter in the US|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program|2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report]], Transparency International was number 9 of 100 in the ''Top Think Tanks Worldwide (non-U.S.)'' category and number 27 of 150 in the ''Top Think Tanks Worldwide (U.S. and non-U.S.)'' category.&lt;ref name="Global Go To"&gt;{{cite web| author=James G.

==Role==

=== General ===
Transparency International states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Transparency International is the global civil society organization leading the fight against corruption. It brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. TI's mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption.{{quote without source|date=April 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organization defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain which eventually hurts everyone who depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo|title=Transparency International – What we do|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It develops tools for fighting corruption and works with other civil society organizations, companies and governments to implement them. Since 1995, Transparency International has issued an annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI); it also publishes a [[Global Corruption Report]], a [[Global Corruption Barometer]], and a [[Bribe Payers Index]].

In 2013, Transparency International published the Government Defence Anti-corruption Index with which corruption in the defence sector of 82 countries was measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government Defence Anti-corruption Index |publisher=Transparency International |year=2013 |url=http://government.defenceindex.org/report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508093004/http://government.defenceindex.org/report |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have expressed criticism towards the methodology of the report. Mark Pyman, the founder of TI's Defence &amp; Security&amp;nbsp;program, defended the report in an interview and stressed the importance of transparency in the military sector. The plan is to publish the index every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transparency is feasible |author=Mark Pyman |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption Perceptions Index ===
{{Main article|Corruption Perceptions Index}}
The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index – a combination of polls – drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI reflects the views of observers from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/in_detail/|title=2012 Corruption Perceptions Index – In detail|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corruption Perceptions Index has received criticism over the years. The main one stems from the difficulty in measuring corruption, which by definition happens behind the scenes. The Corruption Perceptions Index therefore needs to rely on third-party survey which have been criticized as potentially unreliable. Data can vary widely depending on the public perception of a country, the completeness of the surveys and the methodology used. The second issue is that data cannot be compared from year to year because Transparency International uses different methodologies and samples every year. This makes it difficult to evaluate the result of new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |publisher=Global Integrity &amp; UNDP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=2011-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corruption Perceptions Index authors replied to these criticisms by reminding that the Corruption Perceptions Index is meant to measure ''perception'' and not "reality". They argue that "perceptions matter in their own right, since... firms and individuals take actions based on perceptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uslaner|first=Eric M. |title=Corruption, inequality, and the rule of law: the bulging pocket makes the easy life|publisher=Cambridge University Press

== Organization ==
[[Image:Transparency International Berlin.jpg|thumb|Transparency International's headquarters in [[Berlin]]]]
Transparency International consists of chapters – locally established, independent organisations – that address corruption in their respective countries. From small bribes to large-scale looting, corruption differs from country to country. As chapters are staffed with local experts they are ideally placed to determine the priorities and approaches best suited to tackling corruption in their countries. This work ranges from visiting rural communities to provide free legal support to advising their government on policy reform. Corruption does not stop at national borders. The chapters play a crucial role in shaping its collective work and realising its regional and global goals, such as Strategy 2015. Transparency International's multi-country research and advocacy initiatives are driven by the chapters.

According to its 2012 Annual Report, it is funded by western governments (with almost €5 million from the UK government) and several multinational companies, including oil companies Exxon Mobil and Shell, hedge funds KKR and Wermuth Asset Management, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/annual_report_2012|title=TI Publication - Annual Report 2012|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not however seem to affect their practices, as Exxon Mobil itself was ranked in 2008 as the least transparent of 42 major oil and gas firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7370685.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - Exxon 'ranks low on transparency'|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Transparency International was founded in May 1993. According to political scientist Ellen Gutterman, "TI's presence in Germany, and indeed its organizational development and rise from a small operation to a prominent international [[TNGO]], benefited from the activities 
and personal, elite connections of at least three key German individuals: Peter Eigen, 
Hansjoerg Elshorst, and Michael Wiehen".&lt;ref name="gutterman"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2012/Gutterman2.pdf|title=The Legitimacy of Transnational NGOs: Lessons from the Experience  of Transparency International in Germany and France (PDF)|journal=Paper submitted to the 84th annual conference of the Canadian Political Science Association |author=Ellen Gutterman |date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Eigen]], a former regional director for the [[World Bank]], is recognized as a founder, along with others.&lt;ref name="gutterman"/&gt; Michael Wiehen was a World Bank official at [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="ptfund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ptfund.org/staff/michael-wiehen/|title=Michael Wiehen - Partnership for Transparency Fund|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansjörg Elshorst was managing director of the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ)]] (German Agency for Technical Cooperation). Other founding board members included [[John Githongo]] (former Permanent Secretary for Ethics and Governance in the office of the President, Kenya),&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation/advisory_council/0/|title=Advisory Council|website=Transparency.org|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Electric]] lawyer Fritz Heimann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.colgate.edu/cews/people/bios_old/heimann.htm|title=CEWS - Panelist Biographies - Butler|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117013913/http://groups.colgate.edu/cews/people/bios_old/heimann.htm|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael J.

In 1995, Transparency International developed the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI ranked nations on the prevalence of corruption within each country, based upon surveys of business people. The CPI was subsequently published annually. It was criticized for poor methodology and unfair treatment of developing nations, while also being praised for highlighting corruption and embarrassing governments.&lt;ref name=Chaikin&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Chaikin | title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=June 2009 | pages=12–13 | ISBN=0-230-61360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Transparency International began publishing the [[Bribe Payers Index]] (BPI) which  ranked nations according to the prevalence that a country's [[multinational corporations]] would offer bribes.&lt;ref name=Chaikin/&gt;

==Non-support of Edward Snowden==

At its annual meeting in November 2013 in Berlin, Transparency International's national chapters from Germany and Ireland proposed a [http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Snowden.pdf resolution] calling for the "end of the prosecution of Edward J. Snowden... He should be recognized as a whistleblower for his help to reveal the over-reaching and unlawful surveillance by secret services... He symbolizes the courage of numerous other whistleblowers around the world."

The final resolution that was passed by the plenary excluded any reference to Snowden, and excluded a call for "comprehensive protection on whistleblowers from all forms of retaliation". The original resolution presented by the German and Irish chapters was weakened following the intervention of Transparency International's American chapter, TI-USA. "The whistleblower resolution was watered down by the US delegation," a TI insider was quoted in an [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-mokhiber/transparency-internationa_b_4687986.html article] published by the Huffington Post. "TI USA is very corporate oriented, very inside the Beltway oriented."

Five months earlier, in June 2013, representatives from Transparency International declined Snowden's request to meet him at the Moscow airport. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch met Snowden to support his asylum request, but Transparency International refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-mokhiber/transparency-internationa_b_4687986.html|title=Transparency International Nixes Edward Snowden|first1=Russell Mokhiber|last1=Editor|first2=Corporate Crime|last2=Reporter|date=10 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding from Siemens==

In January 2015 it was reported that Transparency International (TI) accepted $3 million from the German engineering multinational [[Siemens]], which in 2008 paid one of the largest corporate corruption fines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/worldbusiness/16siemens.html|title=Settling Bribery Case to Cost Siemens $1.6 Billion|first1=Eric|last1=Lichtblau|first2=Carter|last2=Dougherty|date=15 December 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in history – $1.6 billion – for bribing government officials in numerous countries.

Transparency International applied for and received the money from Siemens, even though TI's due diligence procedures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/duediligence.pdf|title=Private-Sector Donors Approval and Due Diligence Processes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibit the organization from accepting money from corporations that want to "[[greenwashing|greenwash]]" their reputations by making donations to TI. "If any corporate donor is accused of having been involved in corruption, the donor can expect no protection from TI," the procedures state.

Transparency International received the money from the Siemens Integrity Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/about/sustainability/en/core-topics/collective-action/integrity-initiative/index.php|title=Integrity Initiative|website=www.siemens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a year after the Initiative hired former TI staffer Jana Mittermaier, raising questions of a "revolving door" that has benefited both the organization and the company.

Several of TI's national chapters also have accepted money from Siemens: $660,000 for TI USA, $600,000 for TI Italy, $450,000 for TI Bulgaria, and $230,000 for TI Mexico – each for a period of three years.

"This really shows that Transparency International is not as pure as people think," a TI insider told Corporate Crime Reporter.

Transparency International Managing Director Cobus de Swardt said, "We did not file an application to Siemens, we applied to the Siemens Integrity Initiative. There's a difference. We have not applied to Siemens." However, according to Siemens, the money for these grants is "provided by Siemens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/transparency-international-siemens-revolving-door-spins-money-pipeline-flows/|title=Transparency International Siemens Revolving Door Spins, Money Pipeline Flows - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=11 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/siemens-and-the-greenwashing-of-transparency-international/|title=Transparency International and the Greenwashing of Siemens - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=2 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/siemens-donates-3-million-transparency-international/|title=Siemens Donates $3 Million to Transparency International - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=21 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal scandals==

In January 2017, the TI Secretariat confirmed that its International Board of Directors decided on 10 January 2017 to strip its US affiliate – Transparency International USA – of its accreditation as the National Chapter in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_confirms_the_disaccreditation_of_its_chapter_in|title=Transparency International confirms the disaccreditation of its chapter in the US|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International USA joins Transparency Croatia in having its credentials stripped.
The stated basis for the dis-accreditation was the board's recognition of differences in philosophies, strategies, and priorities between the former chapter and the Transparency International Movement. Elsewhere, it was reported that TI-USA came to be seen in the United States as a corporate front group, funded by multinational corporations – the same multinationals that corrupt the U.S. political system. TI-USA's million-dollar budget was provided by Bechtel Corporation, Deloitte, Google, Pfizer  ($50,000 or more), Citigroup, ExxonMobil, Fluor, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Marsh &amp; McLennan, PepsiCo, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Raytheon, Realogy, Tyco ($25,000–$49,999), and Freeport-McMoRan and Johnson &amp; Johnson (up to $24,999).&lt;ref name="corporatecrimereporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/transparency-international-strips-us-affiliate-of-accreditation/|title=Transparency International Strips United States Affiliate of Accreditation - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=19 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TI-USA previously awarded an annual corporate leadership award to one of its big corporate funders. In 2016, this award went to Bechtel.

In April 2015 TI defended the decision by its American chapter, TI-USA, to give Hillary Clinton its Integrity Award in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_and_the_clinton_foundation_regarding_recent_statements|title=Press release - Transparency and The Clinton Foundation: Regarding recent statements|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TI's statement followed a report by [[National Public Radio]] that Bill and Chelsea Clinton were not factual regarding the transparency of the Clinton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2015/05/01/npr-exposes-holes-chelsea-and-bill-clintons-most-transparent-foundation|title=NPR Exposes Holes in Chelsea and Bill Clinton's 'Most Transparent Foundation' Boasts|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a "lack of confidence", TI's chapter in Croatia was disaccredited by the organization's board of directors in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_statement_on_its_former_chapter_in_croatia|title=Press release - Transparency International statement on its former chapter in Croatia|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, several leaders of the Croatia chapter challenged the legality of the chapter president's election. The president was accused of falsifying records, conflicts of interest, and arbitrarily expelling 10 chapter members who opposed the hiring of staff against the organization's rules. The Croatian government eventually revoked the president's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seldi.net/fileadmin/public/PDF/Publications/RAR/SELDI_Regional_Anticorruption_Report_Final_Revised.pdf | title=Anti-Corruption Reloaded Assessment of Southeast Europe | publisher=Southeast Europe Leadership for Development and Integrity | date=2014 | editor=Ognian Shentov|editor2=Ruslan Stefanov|editor3=Boyko Todorov | isbn=978-954-477-221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International has come under intense criticism for accepting millions of dollars from companies that have engaged in bribery.&lt;ref name="corporatecrimereporter.com"/&gt; In 2014, Siemens donated $3 million to Transparency International after pleading guilty in 2008 to bribery charges in which it paid more than $1.6 billion in penalties relating to widespread corrupt practices in Greece, Norway, Iraq, Vietnam, Italy, Israel, Argentina, Venezuela, China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-294.htm|title=Press Release: SEC Charges Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide Bribery; 2008-294; Dec. 15, 2008|website=www.SEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's policy forbids accepting money from corrupt companies.
In January 2016 a dispute arose regarding TI's chapter in New Zealand. The Governance Director in TI's Berlin headquarters sought to block an ethics complaint filed against the chapter's board chair by preventing the complaint from being heard by the Berlin office. The Governance Director also submitted an affidavit challenging a New Zealand court's jurisdiction to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwisfirst.com/stan-cutzachs-governance-of-transparency-international-hits-new-zealand/|title=Stan Cutzach's Governance of Transparency International Hits New Zealand - Kiwisfirst|date=12 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 former TI staffer Anna Buzzoni went public regarding retaliation she and her colleagues faced after reporting to managers questionable financial dealings at TI's Water Integrity Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterintegritynetwork.net/|title=Home page - WIN - Water Integrity Network|website=WIN - Water Integrity Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Buzzoni's project responsibilities were suspended and she was transferred against her will. She left TI shortly before internal whistleblower guidelines were adopted in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://correctiv.org/en/blog/2015/08/27/falling-deaf-ears/|title=Falling on Deaf Ears|date=27 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
