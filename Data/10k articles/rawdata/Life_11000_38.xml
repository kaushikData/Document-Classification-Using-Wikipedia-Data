{{nihongo|'''''8 Man'''''|8マン}} or {{nihongo|'''''Eightman'''''|エイトマン|Eitoman}} is a [[manga]] and [[anime]] [[superhero]] created in 1963 by science fiction writer [[Kazumasa Hirai (author)|Kazumasa Hirai]] and manga artist [[Jiro Kuwata]].  He is considered [[Japan]]'s earliest [[cyborg]] superhero, predating even ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' (the same year, [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] created ''[[Cyborg 009]]''), and was supposedly the inspiration for ''[[RoboCop]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce4uTsv-3e4C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=8+man+robocop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AFR7vAhMOw&amp;sig=j5QNmQRrqC0R5TcppKGE2A_QByc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje4MX3xJHVAhVqDcAKHcyYAWA4ChDoAQgrMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=8+man+robocop&amp;f=false|title=Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade|date=5 November 2010|publisher=A-Net Digital LLC|accessdate=18 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manga was published in Weekly Shōnen Magazine and ran from 1963 to 1966.  The anime series, produced by Eiken with the TCJ Animation Center, was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System, and ran from November 17, 1963, to December 31, 1964, with a total of 56 episodes (plus the "farewell" special episode, "Goodbye, Eightman").

==Plot==

Murdered by criminals, Detective Yokoda's body is retrieved by Professor Tani and taken to his laboratory.  There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the eighth subject to have his life force transferred into an [[Android (robot)|android]] body.  For the first time, the experiment succeeds.  Yokoda is reborn as the [[armor]]-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as [[shape-shift]] into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time [[infant baptism|christening]] himself as "Hachiro Azuma".  He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka.  Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro do not know he is an android.  As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his own murderers to justice). To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes "energy" cigarettes that he carries in a cigarette case on his belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E03KBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT872&amp;lpg=PT872&amp;dq=8+man+robocop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oCBM6hk7LN&amp;sig=Jp_seG0Qo3dafotZRf-LtSX4JQs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje4MX3xJHVAhVqDcAKHcyYAWA4ChDoAQg7MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=8+man+robocop&amp;f=false|title=The Anime Encyclopedia, 3rd Revised Edition: A Century of Japanese Animation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Clements|first2=Helen|last2=McCarthy|date=9 February 2015|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|accessdate=18 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the character's origin actually varies significantly between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie.  In the original Japanese manga and TV series, the character's name does not change when he is reborn as 8 Man.  The "Detective Yokoda" name was created for the live-action version.  In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car.  Also, in the Japanese story, the character is called "8 Man" because he is considered an extra member of the Japanese police force.  There are seven regular police precincts and 8 Man is treated as an unofficial eighth precinct all to himself.

The Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories.  Many of the stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series, but not all of them.  The novella stories were originally printed on a weekly basis in ''Shukuu Shōnen Magazine'' in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page.  Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of ''Shuukuu Shōnen Magazine''.  These stories were generally between 30-40 pages in length.

In the North American version of the series the resurrected detective/android is known as "Tobor" or the word "robot" spelled backwards. Tani is referred to as "Professor Genius" and the sobriquet of 8-Man is changed slightly to "8th-Man". The story content was clearly directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers.  Due to changes in cigarette advertising laws in the 1960s, television characters were not allowed to be seen smoking.  As this was a major plot device in the series, the show was forced to be removed from broadcast in the United States.

===The US version===
In 1965, '''''8 Man''''' was brought to the [[United States|U.S.]] as '''''8th Man''''' (sometimes called "Tobor the 8th Man," as in its English-language theme music), with [[Worldvision Enterprises|ABC Films]] as its syndicated distributor.  Only 52 of the original 56 episodes were "converted" into English.

The characters were renamed as follows:
* Yokota/Azuma/8 Man - Special Agent Brady/Tobor ("robot" spelled backwards)/8th Man
* Tani - Professor Genius
* Tanaka - Chief FumbleThumbs
* Sachiko - Jenny Hartsweet
* Ichiro - Skip

==Reception==
8 Man was ranked ninth in Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth, who commented that, "Before ''[[Cyborg 009]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', and ''[[Robocop]]'', there was 8 Man: The first cyborg manga and anime hero. Building on ''[[Astro Boy]]'', 8 Man helped to shape the trajectory of robot and cyborg heroes for the next decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
The 8 Man franchise was revived in the early 1990s by a live-action film, video game and new animated series.

In 1991, SNK released a [[video game]] edition of ''Eight Man'' for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] arcade and home video game system (both versions are identical) where the player took the role of 8 Man and his robo-comrade 9 Man in a fight against an invading evil robot army.  The game was released internationally.  While the game stayed true to the concept of a crime-fighting super-robot, it was widely panned for being tedious and relying too much on the gimmick of its speed-running effect.

===Live-action movie===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:8man-1992film.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Kai Shishido as 8 Man in the 1992 film]] --&gt;
In 1992, a live-action film version of 8 Man was produced in Japan.  Titled ''Eitoman - Subete no Sabishī Yoru no Tame ni'' ({{nihongo2|8マン・すべての寂しい夜のために}}, lit. ''8 Man - For All the Lonely Night''&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate_t?langpair=ja|en&amp;text=すべての寂しい夜のために Translation of 8 Man Japanese subtitle by Google Translate]&lt;/ref&gt;), it was directed by  Yasuhiro Horiuchi and starred Kai Shishido as the title character and [[Toshihide Wakamatsu]] as Detective Yokota.  Distributed in the United States by [[Fox Lorber]] video simply as ''8 Man'', the movie was widely panned for its choppy editing, mediocre direction and low-budget feel.  Many modern American viewers, unfamiliar with the older animated series, felt the movie was an inferior version of ''RoboCop'', despite the fact that the latter was a much more recent franchise.

===''8 Man After''===
In mid-1993, the mantle of 8 Man was taken up by Hazama Itsuru in the [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series ''8 Man After''. Existing in a world far more corrupt than that of his predecessor, the new 8 Man had no qualms about being extremely violent towards the cybernetic criminals who had murdered him previously. Licensed by [[Streamline Pictures]] where it went out of print until being released on DVD by [[Image Entertainment]] in 2001. It has since been released by [[Discotek Media]] in 2016 with Japanese audio and English subtitles for the first time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-05/exclusive-discotek-licenses-8-man-after-ova/.98368|title=Exclusive: Discotek Licenses 8 Man After OVA|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''8 Man Infinity''===
A manga series called {{nihongo|''8 Man Infinity''|8マンインフィニティ Eitoman Infiniti}}  is being authored by Kyoichi Nanatsuki under Kodansha, which is being serialized under Kodansha's ''Magazine Z''.

In 1233, a group of [[friar]]s of the [[Franciscan]] Order arrived in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] with the intention of creating a community to minister to the poor and the oppressed. This arrival was not welcomed by the established Reading Abbey, but the fact that the friars had [[patronage|royal patronage]] meant that Abbot Adam was obliged to assist.

'''Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP)''' is a program established by [[NASA]] to sponsor research projects that advance the technology and techniques used in [[planetary exploration]].  The objective is to enable the study of [[astrobiology]] and to aid the planning of extraterrestrial exploration missions while prioritizing science, technology, and field campaigns.

==Overview==
ASTEP is one of four elements of NASA's Astrobiology Program, which falls under the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate. According to the formal description from NASA, "The ASTEP program sponsors the development of technologies that enable remote searches for, and identification of, life in extreme environments, including planetary surfaces and subsurfaces."&lt;ref name="IceBite"&gt;(Marinova, 2010)  http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_expedition&amp;task=detail&amp;id=3388&amp;type=blog&amp;pid=19&lt;/ref&gt; ASTEP is concerned with discovering technologies which will enable scientists to study astrobiology both on the surface of the Earth and on extraterrestrial bodies. A central focus of ASTEP's research is terrestrial field campaigns, or long-duration expeditions where researchers live in the same region they are studying. These are conducted on Earth in remote or hostile locations, such as Antarctica or the bottom of the ocean. Through understanding complex and exotic life on Earth, such as [[extremophile]]s, scientists hope to better define the characteristics they should look for and the locations they should seek when attempting to discover extraterrestrial life.

==Methodology==
ASTEP funded projects typically perform research by searching for and studying [[extremophile]] biology in Earth's harshest environments through the use of field research campaigns. The environments where this research is conducted is meant to simulate the expected conditions on extraterrestrial worlds in the Solar System. Past field work has typically targeted two regions. Arctic and Antarctic climates simulate the low temperatures expected on many other planets such as [[Mars]], near rover landing sites.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt; Underwater regions are also an area of study because they simulate high pressure, low light and variable temperature conditions. This region simulates proposed missions to explore the vast liquid water ocean that is expected to reside under Jupiter's moon, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref name="MidCaymen"&gt;(German, 2009) http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3287/oases-for-life-on-the-mid-caymen-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

ASTEP promotes the development of new exploration technologies and techniques that can search, identify, and study life in extreme conditions in locations that are difficult to access. There is a broad range of things that can fall into this category. Previous examples include laboratories such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]], sampling techniques, the [[Mars rovers]], the Titan lander ([[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens]]), and submersibles.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;(Billings, Apout ASTEP, 2008) {{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/astep/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528091403/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/astep/about/ |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomous systems are preferred because data can be collected without the presence of humans near the test area. The field campaigns are used as a proof-of-concept for the proposed technologies as well as a demonstration. They are generally tested with mock-mission where conditions and challenges simulate those that might be experienced on an actual mission. This helps identify their strengths and weaknesses in the technology’s mission execution and structural endurance.

Beyond the practice of new technologies, ASTEP strives to learn more about astrobiology through observation and study on the field campaigns. Analyzing the collected samples helps researchers determine the thermal, photonic, pressure, and chemical boundary conditions for living organisms. Understanding how these organisms adapt and evolve in these extreme conditions may be similar to the methods used by extraterrestrial organisms, and thus offers clues about where life may be found. Another area of study is the environmental footprint that [[extremophile]] life leaves behind, [[biomolecule]]s or [[biosignature]]s such as chemical trails, geological formations, etc. Identifying these clues often inspires new biology searching techniques, and simplifies mission planning.

==Other projects==
[[Stromatolite]] building provides important geological information on the history of [[microorganism]]s dating back to over a billion years ago. In recent years, ASTEP has been researching how these layered fossils could have formed by studying modern day [[microbial mat]]s, which leave stromatolite similar to their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;(Schirber, [[Astrobiology Magazine]], 2010) http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3418/first-fossil-makers-in-hot-water&lt;/ref&gt;

ASTEP's instrument development program is currently working on a prototype to detect the presence of [[DNA]] on the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt; The prototype will replicate any DNA found in Martian ice or regolith using [[polymerase chain reaction]] amplification techniques.

The [[IceBite]] Project involves testing drills for future Martian missions where ice will need to be penetrated. The research is being conducted in high altitude Antarctic valleys which closely resemble the ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'' landing site in geologic composition.&lt;ref name="IceBite" /&gt; As of 2009, the scientists have successfully completed the first phase of the three-year mission, which was to probe the region, install scientific  instruments, and determine the future testing sites.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt;

A team of ASTEP scientists are exploring the [[Cayman Trough|Mid-Cayman Spreading Center]], a wide ridge at the westernmost region of the Cayman Trough. Oceanic life reaches the extremes at the depths, where the pressure is the greatest and underwater [[sea vent]]s pump hot and mineral-rich water into the ocean. Project researchers think [[extraterrestrial life]] could be similar to the exotic life forms found near these vents. The submersible [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]] was developed by ASTEP to autonomously survey the hydrothermal vent systems at the depths of the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center.&lt;ref name="MidCaymen"/&gt;

==Publicity==
In order to raise awareness about the research being conducted under the auspices of ASTEP, scientists have been increasingly using blogs as a way to convey information about their studies, typically when they are performing science at a remote location on a terrestrial field test. Scientists have also begun contacting museums via satellite uplink to discuss astrobiology with the public.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; The most prominent blog is produced by NASA's IceBite team, which performs annual expeditions to Antarctica.

'''Aurelia Isabel Henry Reinhardt''' (April 1, 1877&amp;nbsp;– January 28, 1948) was an American educator, activist, and prominent member and leader of numerous organizations. She completed her undergraduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], her doctoral dissertation at [[Yale University|Yale]], and studied as a [[Research fellow|fellow]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. After teaching at the [[University of Idaho]], the [[Lewis–Clark State College|Lewiston State Normal School]], and with the Extension Division of the [[University of California]], Reinhardt was elected president of [[Mills College]] in 1916, and held the position until 1943, making her the longest serving president in the history of the school.

Reinhardt was a [[peace activist]] during the [[First World War]], an active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and supported the ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] as well as the formation of the [[League of Nations]]. She wrote and spoke extensively throughout the US and Europe, to a range of social, political and business groups, on topics including the [[education of women]], [[women's suffrage]], [[world peace]], and [[international cooperation]]. Reinhardt was president of the [[American Association of University Women]], and a prominent member of the [[American Unitarian Association]], serving for two years as its first female moderator. As the only female member of the Unitarian Commission of Appraisal, she delivered the [[Ware Lecture]] in 1932, and was briefly a minister in [[Oakland, California]]. She was a director of the [[Starr King School for the Ministry]], and was a delegate at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|inaugural meeting]] of the [[United Nations]] in 1945.

Aurelia Henry Reinhardt was married to George F. Reinhardt in 1909. They had two sons, who she raised after his unexpected death in 1914. Following her retirement in 1943, she traveled internationally before returning to California, where she died on January 28, 1948, due to heart problems. A lifelong advocate for the marginalized and dispossessed, she was the recipient of [[honorary degrees]] from a number of educational institutions, and has been commemorated through the establishment of a society, fellowship, a university building, and a professorship bearing her name. She was named nationally as "one of the ten outstanding women of 1940," and honored as the California State Mother in 1946.

==Early life==
Aurelia Isabel Henry was born on April 1, 1877, in [[San Francisco, California]]. The second of six children, she was the daughter of Mary and William Warner Henry, a wholesale grocer, land owner, and businessman.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boaz |first1=Martha |author-link=Martha Boaz|title=New Books: Aurelia Henry Reinhardt: Portrait of a Whole Woman.

'''Bycatch''', in the [[fishing industry]], is a [[fish]] or other marine species that is caught unintentionally while catching certain target species and target sizes of fish, crabs etc. Bycatch is either of a different species, the wrong sex, or is undersized or  [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] individuals of the target species. The term "bycatch" is also sometimes used for untargeted catch in other forms of animal harvesting or collecting. It is interesting to note that the term "deliberate" by-catch is used to refer to the by-catch as a source of illegal wildlife trade (IWT) in several areas throughout world [see: Ermolin and Svolkinas 2018]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321289096_Assessment_of_the_sturgeon_catches_and_seal_bycatches_in_an_IUU_fishery_in_the_Caspian_Sea&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1997, the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) defined bycatch as "total fishing [[Mortality rate|mortality]], excluding that accounted directly by the retained catch of target species".&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1997) Towards sustainable fisheries: economic aspects of the management of living marine resources. OECD Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Bycatch contributes to fishery decline and is a mechanism of overfishing for unintentional catch.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overfishing ''Overfishing''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment]. eds. Sidney Draggan and C. Cleveland. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average annual bycatch rate in the U.S. from 1990 to 1999 was 6215 with standard error of 448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Read|first1=Andrew J.|last2=Drinker|first2=Phebe|last3=Northridge|first3=Simon|title=Bycatch of Marine Mammals in U.S. and Global Fisheries|journal=Conservation Biology|date=February 2006|volume=20|issue=1|pages=163-169|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00338.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fisherman bycatch issue originated due to the “mortality of dolphins in tuna nets in the 1960s” &lt;ref&gt;Hall, M. A., Alverson, D. L., &amp; Metuzals, K. I. (2000). By-catch: problems and solutions. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 41(1), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational fishing===
Given the popularity of recreational fishing throughout the world, a small local study in the US in 2013 suggested that discards may be an important unmonitored source of fish mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum ML, Worley GM, Safi B, Dickens K, Jones J et al (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.120v1  By-catch in a recreational fishery: an unmonitored source of mortality.] PeerJ Preprints 1:e120v1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shrimp trawling===
[[File:Trawer Hauling Nets.jpg|thumb|right|Double-rigged shrimp [[fishing trawler|trawler]] hauling in the [[Fishing net|nets]]|alt=Photo of boat moving forward at sea. On each side, the boat has one pole pointing away from boat with nets attached]] 
[[File:Shrimp bycatch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shrimp]] bycatch|alt=Photo of hundreds of dead fish lying on ship deck]]
The highest rates of [[incidental catch]] of non-target species are associated with tropical [[shrimp]] [[trawling]]. In 1997, the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) documented the estimated bycatch and [[Discards|discard]] levels from shrimp fisheries around the world. They found discard rates (bycatch to catch ratios) as high as 20:1 with a world average of 5.7:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|issue= 928 FIIU/C928
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrimp trawl fisheries catch 2% of the world total catch of all fish by weight, but produce more than one-third of the world total bycatch. [[United States|American]] shrimp trawlers produce bycatch ratios between 3:1 (3 bycatch:1 shrimp) and 15:1 (15 bycatch:1 shrimp).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Trawling|Trawl nets]] in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, have been identified as sources of mortality for [[cetacea]]n and [[finfish]] species.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"&gt;SAFMC (2004){{citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When bycatch is discarded (returned to the sea), it is often dead or dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Tropical shrimp trawlers often make trips of several months without coming to port. A typical haul may last 4 hours after which the net is pulled in. Just before it is pulled on board the net is washed by zigzagging at full speed. The contents are then dumped on deck and are sorted. An average of 5.7:1 means that for every [[kilogram]] of shrimp there are 5.7&amp;nbsp;kg of bycatch. In tropical inshore waters the bycatch usually consists of small fish. The shrimps are frozen and stored on-board; the bycatch is discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Clucas, I. |editor2=Teutscher, F. |title=FAO/DFID Expert Consultation on Bycatch Utilization in Tropical Fisheries.

Recent sampling in the South Atlantic rock shrimp fishery found 166 species of finfish, 37 [[crustacean]] species, and 29 other species of [[invertebrate]] among the bycatch in the [[trawl]]s.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt; Another sampling of the same fishery over a two-year period found that rock shrimp amounted to only 10% of total catch weight. Iridescent swimming crab, dusky flounder, inshore [[lizardfish]], spot, [[Crangon crangon|brown shrimp]], longspine swimming crabs, and other bycatch made up the rest.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt;

Despite the use of [[bycatch reduction device]]s, the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Mexico removes about 25–45 million [[Lutjanus|red snapper]] annually as bycatch, nearly one half the amount taken in directed recreational and commercial snapper fisheries.&lt;ref name="GMFMC (2006)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Entangled porpoise.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Dall's porpoise]] caught in a fishing net]]
One example of bycatch is [[dolphin]]s caught in [[tuna]] nets. As dolphins are [[mammal]]s and do not have [[gill]]s they may drown while stuck in nets underwater. This bycatch issue has been one of the reasons of the growing [[ecolabel]]ling industry, where fish producers mark their packagings with disclaimers such as "dolphin friendly" to reassure buyers. However, "dolphin friendly" does not mean that dolphins were not killed in the production of a particular tin of tuna, but that the fleet which caught the tuna did not ''specifically'' target a feeding [[Dolphin#Social behavior|pod]] of dolphins, but relied on other methods to spot tuna schools.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Sea turtles===

[[Sea turtle]]s, already critically endangered, have been killed in large numbers in shrimp trawl nets. Estimates indicate that thousands of [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle|Kemp's ridley]], [[loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead]], [[Green sea turtle|green]] and [[leatherback sea turtle]]s are caught in shrimp trawl fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the US [[Atlantic]] annually&lt;ref name="Epperly"&gt;{{

===Fish Gears===
Bycatch is inevitable where there is fishing activities, the incidental catch do not limit to only fish species –  dolphins, sea turtles, seabirds are also victims to bycatch. For example, Longlines, trawls and purse seine nets are driving factors of endangerment of 15 shark species. Bycatch could also affect reproduction of populations as juveniles are caught during fishing nets. Bycatch happens most commonly with the use of gillnets, longlines, or bottom trawls. Longlines have bait hooks attached to them and have the potential to extend over 50 miles, along with gill nets in water, they catch everything that swims by, while bottom trawls sweeps the seafloor, grabbing everything along their paths.&lt;ref name="seafoodwatch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seafoodwatch.org/ocean-issues/wild-seafood/bycatch|title=Effects of Bycatch from Fishing for Wild Seafood from the Seafood Watch Program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium|author=|date=|website=www.seafoodwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently in the world, there are thousands of miles of different types of nets and lines being put into world’s ocean daily, and these modern fish gear are robust and invisible to the eye, making them efficient at catching fish and bycatching everything else that comes in the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/bycatch|title=Bycatch - Threats - WWF|author=|date=|website=World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hook-and-line fishing could limit bycatch to a certain extent as the non-target animals can be released back to the ocean fairly quickly&lt;ref name="seafoodwatch.org"/&gt;

==Mitigation==
[[File:Turtle excluder device 2.png|thumb|right|A [[turtle excluder device]]|alt=]]
Concern about bycatch has led fishermen and scientists to seek ways of reducing unwanted catch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosafetuna.org/about/campaign-eco-safe-tuna.html Campaign for Eco-Safe Tuna] Retrieved 2.21.2012&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main approaches.

One approach is to ban fishing in areas where bycatch is unacceptably high. Such area closures can be permanent, seasonal, or for a specific period when a bycatch problem is registered. Temporary area closures are common in some bottom-trawl fisheries where undersized fish or non-target species are caught unpredictably. In some cases fishermen are required to relocate when a bycatch problem occurs.

The other approach is alternative [[fishing net|fishing gear]]. A technically simple solution is to use nets with a larger mesh size, allowing smaller species and smaller individuals to escape. However, this usually requires replacing the existing gear. In other cases, it is possible to modify gear. The "Bycatch Reduction Device" (BRD) and the Nordmore grate are net modifications that help fish escape from shrimp nets.

BRDs allow many commercial finfish species to escape. The US government has approved BRDs that reduce finfish bycatch by 30%. [[Spanish mackerel]] and [[weakfish]] bycatch in the South Atlantic was reduced by 40%.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt; However, recent surveys suggest BRDs may be less effective than previously thought.&lt;ref name="GMFMC (2006)"&gt;Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (GMFMC) (2006) [http://www.gulfcouncil.org/Beta/GMFMCWeb/downloads/Shrimp%20Amend%2015%20Scoping%20106.pdf#search='shrimp%20amendment%2015' ''Scoping Document for Amendment 15 to the Shrimp FMP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217160414/http://www.gulfcouncil.org/Beta/GMFMCWeb/downloads/Shrimp%20Amend%2015%20Scoping%20106.pdf#search='shrimp%20amendment%2015'#search='shrimp%20amendment%2015' |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rock shrimp fishery off Florida found the devices did not exclude 166 species of fish, 37 crustacean species, and 29 species of other invertebrates.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt;

In 1978, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) started to develop [[turtle excluder device]]s (TEDs). A TED uses a grid which deflects turtles and other big animals, so they exit from the trawl net through an opening above the grid. US shrimp trawlers and foreign fleets which market shrimp in the US are required to use TEDs. Not all nations enforce the use of TEDs.

For the most part, when they are used, TEDs have been successful reducing sea turtle bycatch.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMFMC (2005)"&gt;{{cite web
|year=2005
|url=http://www.gulfcouncil.org/Beta/GMFMCWeb/downloads/Shrimp%20Amend%2013%20Final%20805.pdf
|title=Final Amendment Number 13 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
|work= US Waters with Environmental Assessment Regulatory Impact Review, and Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowder, 2001{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not completely effective, and some turtles are still captured.&lt;ref name="SAFMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epperly"/&gt; NMFS certifies TED designs if they are 97% effective. In heavily trawled areas, the same sea turtle may pass repeatedly through TEDs.&lt;ref name="Epperly"/&gt; Recent studies indicate recapture rates of twenty percent or more, but it is not clear how many turtles survive the escape process.&lt;ref name="Epperly"/&gt;

The size selectivity of trawl nets is controlled by the size of the net openings, especially in the "cod end". The larger the openings, the more easily small fish can escape. The development and testing of modifications to fishing gear to improve selectivity and decrease impact is called "conservation engineering."

[[File:Seabirds longlinersm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seabird]]s with longline [[fishing vessel]]|alt=Photo of hundreds of seabirds on water surface around boat]]
[[Longline fishing]] is controversial in some areas because of by-catch. Mitigation methods have been successfully implemented in some fisheries. These include:
* weights to sink the lines quickly
* streamer lines to scare birds away from baited hooks while deploying the lines
* setting lines only at night with minimal ship lighting (to avoid attracting birds)
* limiting fishing seasons to the southern winter (when most seabirds are not feeding young)
* not discharging offal while setting lines.

However, gear modifications do not eliminate by-catch of many species. In March 2006, the [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] longline swordfish fishing season was closed due to excessive [[loggerhead sea turtle]] by-catch after being open only a few months, despite using modified [[circle hook]]s.

One solution that Norway came up with to reduce bycatch is to, "adopt a 'no discards' policy". This means that the fishermen must keep everything they catch. This policy has helped to, "encourage [bycatch] research", which, in turn has helped "encourage behavioral changes in fishers" and "reduce the waste of life" as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, M. A., Alverson, D. L., &amp; Metuzals, K. I. (2000). By-catch: problems and solutions. Marine 
Pollution Bulletin, 41(1), 207.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Seabirds get entangled in longlines by flocking around vessels, this eventually leads to drowning because they try to catch baits on the hooks. Fisheries had been using “Streamer lines” as a cost-effective solution to mitigate this type of bycatch, and it has dramatically reduced seabird mortality. These streamer lines have bright colors and are made of polyester rope, they are positioned alongside the longlines on both sides. Their bright colors and constantly flapping of water frightens the seabirds and they fly away before reaching the baited hooks. A successful example would be the use of streamer lines in Alaskan groundfish longline fisheries, as the deaths of seabirds declined by about 70% after the employment of these lines.&lt;ref name="seafoodwatch.org"/&gt;

==Alternative to release==
Some fisheries retain bycatch, rather than throwing the fish back into the ocean. Sometimes bycatch are sorted and sold as food,&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt, Elizabeth, [http://southernspaces.org/2011/oyster-any-other-name "An Oyster by Any Other Name"], ''Southern Spaces'', 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America where cost of labour is cheaper. Bycatch can also be sold in frozen bags as "assorted seafood" or "seafood medley" at cheaper prices. Bycatch can be converted into [[fish hydrolysate]] (ground up fish carcasses) for use as a soil amendment in [[organic agriculture]] or it can be used as an ingredient in [[fish meal]]. In [[Southeast Asia]] bycatch is sometimes used as a raw material for fish sauce production. Bycatch is also commonly de-boned, de-shelled, ground and blended into [[fish paste]] or moulded into fish cakes ([[surimi]]) and sold either fresh (for domestic use) or frozen (for export). This is commonly the case in Asia or by Asian fisheries. Sometimes bycatch are sold to [[fish farms]] to feed farmed fish, especially in Asia.

If bycatch is quickly released, predators and scavengers may consume it.

==Non-fisheries bycatch==
The term "bycatch" is used also in contexts other than fisheries. Examples are [[insect collecting]] with [[pitfall trap]]s or [[flight interception trap]]s for either financial, controlling or scientific purposes (where the bycatch may either be small vertebrates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = Bycatch, ethics and pitfall traps | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/j36742269g171282/ | journal = Journal of Insect Conservation | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1023/A:1017191920328}}&lt;/ref&gt; or untargeted insects) and control of introduced vertebrates which have become pest species like the [[muskrat]] in Europe (where the bycatch in [[trapping|traps]] may be e.g. [[European mink]]&lt;ref&gt;Kranz A, Polednik L and Gotea V (2001) [http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/v/x/vxg901/publ/ddiannals2001_124-129.pdf Conservation of the European Mink (''Mustella lutreila'') in the Danube Delta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929032133/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/v/x/vxg901/publ/ddiannals2001_124-129.pdf# |date=2011-09-29 }} Background information and project plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7509">'''Cervical dilation'''  (or cervical dilatation) is the opening of the [[cervix]], the entrance to the uterus, during [[childbirth]], [[miscarriage]], [[abortion|induced abortion]], or gynecological surgery.  Cervical dilation may occur naturally, or may be induced by surgical or medical means.

== Childbirth ==
In the later stages of pregnancy, the cervix may already have opened up to 1–3&amp;nbsp;cm (or more in rarer circumstances), but during [[childbirth|labor]], repeated [[uterine contraction]]s lead to further widening of the cervix to about 6 centimeters.  From that point, pressure from the presenting part (head in vertex births or bottom in breech births), along with uterine contractions, will dilate the cervix to 10 centimeters, which is "complete." Cervical dilation is accompanied by [[Cervical effacement|effacement]], the thinning of the cervix.

General guidelines for cervical dilation:
* Latent phase: 0–3 centimeters
* Active Labor: 4–7 centimeters
* Transition: 8–10 centimeters
* Complete: 10 centimeters. Delivery of the infant takes place shortly after this stage is reached (although the mother does not always push right away.)

=== Symptoms ===
During [[pregnancy]], the os (opening) of the cervix is blocked by a thick plug of [[mucus]] to prevent bacteria from entering the uterus. During dilation, this plug is loosened. It may come out as one piece, or as thick mucus discharge from the vagina. When this occurs, it is an indication that the cervix is beginning to dilate, although not all women will notice this mucus plug being released.

[[Bloody show]] is another indication that the cervix is dilating. Bloody show usually comes along with the mucus plug, and may continue throughout labor, making the mucus tinged pink, red or brown. Fresh, red blood is usually not associated with dilation, but rather serious complications such as [[placental abruption]], or [[placenta previa]].  Red blood in small quantities often also follows an exam.

The pain experienced during dilation is similar to that of [[menstruation]] (although markedly more intense), as period pains are thought to be due to the passing of [[endometrium]] through the cervix. Most of the pain during labor is caused by the uterus contracting to dilate the cervix.

=== Induced dilation in childbirth===
[[Prostaglandin]]s (P2 and [[Prostaglandin E2|PGE2]]) contribute to cervical ripening and dilation. The body produces these hormones naturally. Sometimes prostaglandins in synthesized forms are applied directly to the cervix to induce labor.&lt;!--

Other means of natural cervical ripening include [[nipple stimulation]], which produces [[oxytocin]], a hormone which is necessary for uterine contractions. Nipple stimulation can be performed manually, by use of a [[breast pump]], or by suckling. Henci Goer, in her comprehensive book, The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, details how this practice was researched in two separate studies of 100 and 200 women in the mid nineteen-eighties. Women were assigned randomly to two groups. In one group, nipples were stimulated for one-hour sessions, three times per day. In the other group, women were to avoid any form of nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse. The researchers concluded in both studies that nipple stimulation could indeed ripen the cervix and in some cases induce [[uterine contractions]]. Goer further notes that in the smaller study, an [[external fetal monitor]] was used, and no [[uterine hyperstimulation]] was noted.&lt;ref&gt;The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer,1999,{{ISBN|0-399-52517-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|failed=y|date=August 2012}}

Cervical dilation may be induced mechanically by placing devices inside the cervix that will expand while in place.  A [[balloon catheter]] may be used.  Other products include [[laminaria]] stick (made of dried seaweed) or synthetic [[hygroscopic]] materials, which expand when placed in a moist environment.&lt;ref name="eMed" /&gt;

== In hysteroscopy==
{{anchor|dilator}}
In [[hysteroscopy]], the diameter of the hysteroscope is generally too large to conveniently pass the [[cervix]] directly, thereby necessitating cervical dilation to be performed prior to insertion. Cervical dilation can be performed by temporarily stretching the cervix with a series of ''(cervical) dilators'' of increasing diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/laparoscopy.pdf Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy.] A Guide for Patients, Revised 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9128">'''Complementary holism''' is a [[social theory]] or conceptual framework proposed by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], that sees all societies as consisting of a Human Center and Institutional Boundaries, and that all social relations in the political, economic, community/cultural and kinship "spheres" as mutually interacting to defining our social experiences. Complementary holism does not rest on an ''a priori'' assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as [[historical materialism]] does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with [[Marxists]] that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with [[anarchists]] in regard to the [[State (polity)|State]] or with [[feminists]] in regard to [[gender inequality]], but they assert that Marxists see economics, or [[class conflict]], as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

In ''Liberating Theory'', Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel et al. write that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as Marx and Engels paid strict attention to "state of the art" science in their time, we should keep up with contemporary developments. Ironically, however, though most contemporary Marxists pride themselves on being "scientific," few bother to notice that "state of the art" science has changed dramatically in the last hundred years. While avoiding simplistic mimicry and misapplication of scientific principles, we should update our methods by seriously examining contemporary science for new ideas relevant to our theoretical efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Modern quantum physics, for example, teaches that reality is not a collection of separate entities but a vast and intricate "unbroken whole." Ilya Prigogine comments, "The new paradigms of science may be expected to develop into the new science of connectedness which means the recognition of unity in diversity." When thinking about phenomena, we inevitably conceptually abstract parts from the whole in which they reside, but they then exist as separate entities only in our perceptions. There are no isolated electrons, for example, only fields of force continually ebbing and flowing in a seamless web of activity which manifests events that we choose to call electrons because it suits our analytic purposes. For the physicist, each electron, quark, or whatever is a "process" and a "network." As a process it has a developmental trajectory--extending through all time. As a network, it is part of an interactive pattern--stretching throughout all space. Every part embodies and is subsumed in a larger whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Center and Institutional Boundary==
Each society has a human center where we find people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an institutional boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as our consciousnesses, needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect on what kind of people we become.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Society's center and boundary are ''complementary'' aspects of a single unbroken whole. Both center and boundary are complex dissipative systems. Whatever society's defining features may be, they will necessarily pervade both society's center and boundary. They will persist through evolutionary changes since such changes necessarily involve limited adaptations of both center and boundary. Revolution, however, will alter these defining features. Since we know that historically people universally engage in certain social activities, which in turn involve social relations contouring daily life and governing group interactions, as our next conceptual step it makes sense to subdivide society along lines highlighting these activities, social relations, and social groups. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spheres==
Complementary holism carves out the Human Center and Institutional Boundary into four separate but interconnecting social spheres: the Economic Sphere, the Kinship Sphere, the Community Sphere and the Political Sphere.

# The [[Economic]] Sphere is where the production, consumption, and allocation of material means of life occur. The key institutions for the economy are workplaces, allocation mechanisms, property relations, and remuneration schemes.
# The [[Kinship]] Sphere is where child rearing, nurturing future generations, socializing and care giving occur. Key institutions are the family, with parental and child rearing roles, where gender and sexuality, and other relations form for boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers, adults, children and the elderly.
# The [[Political]] Sphere is where adjudication, policy regulation and law making occur with courts, a legislature and police.
# The [[Community]] Sphere is where identity, religion, and spirituality occur with race, ethnicity, places of worship, beliefs about life and death, celebration of cultural traditions, etc.

Like the human center and institutional boundary, these four spheres interconnect with one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People aren't economically-affected in one part of their lives and gender-affected in another; state-influenced one day of the week and community-influenced some other day. Instead, they simultaneously experience economic, kinship, governance, and community involvements, and this guarantees that spheres interact. At a particular time class may have more influence on molding a person's consciousness and behavior than gender, or vice-versa. But these influences must co-exist. ''(Liberating Theory)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accommodation==
Accommodation describes a particular way in which the four spheres interact with each other. The assigned roles that are a feature of one sphere may be accommodated in another. How our roles are divided in the workplace may accommodate with sexist and racist divisions found as central features in our Kinship and Community Spheres so that economic activity subjugates women and non-whites to lower pay and positions of power than men and whites.

==Co-Definition==
Another way the four spheres can interact is by co-defining each other. For example, workplace roles are often determined by more than "class divisions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing inherent in capitalist economic relations that requires the activity of coffee-making to be assigned to the role of secretary. There is no purely economic reason why in the U.S., women are ghettoized into so-called "pink collar" jobs: clerical work, nursing, domestic work, restaurant and food service, retail sales, elementary school teaching, etc. There is nothing about economics that requires that in addition to different levels of compensation, women's and men's activities must or even should involve different degrees of oversight and mobility. Purely economic dynamics cannot explain such profound gender differentiations. In this sense, then, not only do economic relations accommodate kinship hierarchies, by placing women in the lowest "economicallydefined" positions, but patriarchy "co-defines" basic economic relations. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social Change==
Proponents of complementary holism feel the social theory is not only helpful in understanding society as it is but in understanding how society can be changed. By recognizing the interconnecting social forces - the human center, institutional boundary and four social spheres - and how they shape and are shaped by the intertwining relationship with each other, complementary holists feel we are better equipped to transform society and overcome social oppressions.

Complementary holism sees two ways in which societies can change:

# ''Reproduction'': This is where a change recreates a past social feature. An example could be where a revolution overthrows one hierarchical political system and replaces it with another.
# ''Transformation'': This is where social activities create an entirely new characteristics that differ from the past. For example, a social revolution may overthrow a [[market economy]] and replace it with a self-managed [[participatory economy]].

==Professional career==
Following the exposure gained at the Olympics, Sutherland was offered a number of contracts as a professional boxer. In October 2008 he signed terms with London-based promoter [[Frank Maloney]].&lt;ref name="Taking on world"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sutherland finally taking on the world|work=The Independent|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/boxing-sutherland-finally-taking-on-the-world-1574492.html|date=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2008, Sutherland made a winning start to his professional career with a first round knockout of Georgi Iliev in Dublin. After the bout, Sutherland's promoter Frank Maloney said "I think we've found a real superstar here tonight and this is just the start of a long journey". His next fight, against Siarhei Navarka on 6 March at Robin Park Arena in [[Wigan]], ended with Sutherland winning by a third round stoppage.&lt;ref name="dream debut"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dream debut for Daz|work=Sky Sports|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_4665550,00.html|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutherland won his third fight at the Fenton Manor Sports Complex in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] on 29 May against Vepkhia Tchilaia. Sutherland won his next fight against Gennadiy Rasalev in [[York Hall]], London.

==Death==
On 14 September 2009, Sutherland was found dead with his wrists bound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0313/sutherlandd.html|work=RTÉ News|title=Darren Sutherland 'in a panic' before death|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his apartment in [[Bromley]] by his promoter, [[Frank Maloney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/boxing/article6834645.ece|title=Frank Maloney ill after finding Olympic boxing hero Darren Sutherland hanged|work=The Times|date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8274073.stm|work=BBC News|title=Sutherland was in 'quite a happy mood'|date=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged he died by hanging himself. He suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]]. Olympic gold medalist, [[James DeGale]] commented on the death stating: "It is very, very sad news - I just can't believe it, It is a tragedy. First and foremost, my heart goes out to his family. I just could not believe it; my heart went to the floor when I heard. He was a big part of my Olympic medal journey and it is just terrible. I just do not know what to say except that he was a brilliant fighter, in fact an excellent fighter, and he was a gentleman outside the ring as well. He had an Olympic bronze medal and his whole life to look forward to. He had a great future, and my heart goes out to everyone who knew him."&lt;ref name="Darren Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/darren-sutherland-dead|title=Olympic bronze medallist Darren Sutherland found hanged|date=15 September 2009|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was dating Irish model [[Hazel O'Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="hazel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119965/Darren-Sutherlands-ex-girlfriend-Hazel-O-Sullivan-reveals-tried-make-scapegoat.html|title=Darren Sutherland's ex-girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan reveals how some tried to make her a scapegoat|work=Daily Mail|date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was exhumed in September 2010 for a further private postmortem at the request of his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0901/breaking44.html|work=The Irish Times|title=Body of Sutherland exhumed|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[open verdict]] was delivered at the inquest in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0315/314744-sutherlandd/|work=RTÉ News|title=Open verdict in Darren Sutherland inquest|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sutherland's death, James DeGale kept the initials 'DS' on his shorts in professional bouts. When he won the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[super middleweight]] world title against [[Andre Dirrell]] in 2015, he spoke post-fight of his relationship with Sutherland and dedicated the victory to him. "It's for Darren Sutherland as well, of course. My late rival" he said. "When he took his life back in 2009 it was horrendous. From when he passed, I've always had 'DS' on my shorts. And this world title is for him as well. A great guy. A great fighter. Unbelievable fighter. We've had some great, great scraps. It's for him."&lt;ref name="DeGale tribute to Sutherland"/&gt;

'''Doctor Octopus''' ('''Otto Octavius''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], Doctor Octopus is typically portrayed as a stocky, [[Near-sightedness|myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages, and is obsessed with proving his own genius and destroying the superhero [[Spider-Man]].

The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man cartoons and video games, and is portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. In 2009, Doctor Octopus was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 28th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/28.html Doctor Octopus is number 28 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516232902/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/28.html |date=May 16, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first brief appearance as the Superior Spider-Man was in ''Daredevil'' vol. 3 #21  (December 2012) and his first full appearance of the same character was in ''Avenging Spider-Man'' #15.1 (Dec. 2012). Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Created by [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web slinger's most persistent and dangerous foes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]]. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.44-45, Collins &amp; Brown, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] rated him as the greatest enemy of Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|website=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though historically portrayed as a supervillain, some depictions of him in the 2000s have indicated him to harbor more noble and honorable character traits, including those seen in the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', and in the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' comics series.

==Publication history==
The character of Doctor Octopus first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 (July 1963), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 19|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= One of Spider-Man's most recognizable foes burst onto the scene in this epic tale of the origin of Doctor Octopus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsarama 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/15454-the-10-greatest-spider-man-villains-of-all-time.html | title=The 10 Greatest SPIDER-MAN Villains of ALL TIME! | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | accessdate=2 January 2014 | author=Siegel, Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeFalco"&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: "Dr. Octopus shared many traits with Peter Parker.

==Fictional character biography==

Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father Torbert Octavius, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary Octavius. Young Otto's shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a "teacher's pet" and targeted as a subject for [[bullying]]. Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at Otto to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying Otto was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in manual labor, Otto was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Otto's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Otto's freshman year of college, his father's death due to an industrial accident pushed Otto towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science. After graduating from college, Otto found work in an engineering firm.

Otto became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]], and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[waldos|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brain–computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle arms were resistant to [[radiation]] and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from [[The Vitruvian Man]], the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man/Dr. Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him when Otto impressed her with a demonstration of his harness, and the two began a courtship. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, Otto's mother did not approve, believing that no woman was good enough for her son. To please her, he ended his engagement. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; His co-workers often called him "Dr. Octopus" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/&gt;

===Criminal career begins===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AmazingSpider-Man3octopus.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 (July 1963), first appearance of Doctor Octopus. Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]] --&gt;

During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Otto Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs&lt;ref name="untoldtales"&gt;{{Cite book|last = DeCandido|first = Keith R.A.|authorlink = Keith R.A. DeCandido|editor = Stan Lee and Kurt Busiek|title = Untold Tales of Spider-Man|year = 1997|publisher = Berkley Trade; Boulevard edition|chapter = Arms and the Man|isbn = 1-57297-294-7|postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself "Dr. Octopus" from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/&gt; Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[myopia|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

In their first encounter, Doctor Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career, but was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch]], and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/&gt;

Over the years, Dr. Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's rogues gallery]]. Doctor Octopus formed the original [[Sinister Six]] to fight Spider-Man after taking [[Betty Brant]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] hostage.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups, and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the '''Master Planner''', he organized a theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Doctor Octopus' gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon sheer force of will to summon the strength to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31-32&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department's Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #53&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s tenant,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #54&lt;/ref&gt; then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man's web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man's blood resulted in the Nullifier's interaction with Spider-Man's unique biology rendering him amnesiac,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #55&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man's own better nature resulted in him turning against his 'partner' despite his memory loss long enough for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #56&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #88&lt;/ref&gt; His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #112-115&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently unknowingly inherited.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Octopus escaped death when the island was destroyed, and began a life as a homeless person.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man''#152, 154, 156&lt;/ref&gt; He next battled the "ghost" of Hammerhead, and was able to return him to human form and defeat him after a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to poison New York City with printers' ink, and battled the [[Punisher]] and Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; He next battled the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and his gang.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #73, 75, 76&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #124&lt;/ref&gt; He later displayed symptoms which [[Mister Fantastic]] diagnosed as [[multiple personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Fantastic Four #267"&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #267&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Octopus was taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld, where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against [[Doctor Doom]] for leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the [[X-Men]] until [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] came to the mutants' aid.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arachnophobia===
His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (Spider-Man's then-partner) which led to Spider-Man beating Doctor Octopus to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Otto Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute [[arachnophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding [[nuclear reactor]]; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his 'great triumph'. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and resurrection===
During the [[Clone Saga]], Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #220&lt;/ref&gt; During the healing process he discovered Spider-Man's identity and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]]. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane clone [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #221&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until her teacher was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #427&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity, as the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer, and the memory of Spider-Man's identity had not been recorded at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #428&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent schemes===
In later years, Otto Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]". He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of arrogant young businessman and con artist [[Luke Carlyle|Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #43&lt;/ref&gt; Tiring of his life of crime and wishing to return to an engineering career, Octavius accepted the employment offer. This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Doctor Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #44&lt;/ref&gt; During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doctor Octopus ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing, although Doctor Octopus informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #45&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, Dr. Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador's freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Octopus was taken to Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the [[Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

While hiding in a plant that was owned by the villain [[Fusion (Marvel Comics)|Fusion]], Octavius was apparently forced to work for Fusion in helping him recover the 'John Hancock' satellite, once used to find nuclear weapons but now capable of finding potentially radioactive superhumans such as the Hulk or Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #39&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fusion had apparently forced Octavius into submission, Octavius eventually revealed that he had merely been faking his submission so that Fusion could do all the hard work of finding the satellite for Octavius to sell off,&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #40&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently beating Fusion half to death and attempting to sell the satellite himself before he was caught and defeated by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Doctor Octopus himself eluded authorities.{{issue|date=December 2010}} In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Dr. Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in one of their first encounters (at the time, Peter was severely weakened by a bad case of flu and Octavius assumed he was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Dr. Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius.{{issue|date=December 2010}} He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s supervillain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol IV #14). [[Spider-Man: One More Day|Later]], Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May's condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dying===
When Doctor Octopus learns that he is dying due to the years of punishment his body took in his villainous career, facing superhuman foes when he is fundamentally human once getting past the tentacles, he becomes increasily despondent and brazen in his final plans. Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city's resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets aggressively May Parker (guilty of being due to marry J. Jonah Jameson's father J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.), subtly disrupting the planned marriage. Spider-Man is eventually able to take control of Octavius's planned network, forcing Octavius to flee while vowing revenge.&lt;ref name="ASM600"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600&lt;/ref&gt;

In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Otto Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s unborn son, hoping to synthesize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642&lt;/ref&gt; only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646&lt;/ref&gt; reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging acknowledgment of his abilities.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648&lt;/ref&gt; Octavius and Spider-Man keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six,&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648"/&gt; Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson's shuttle,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #653&lt;/ref&gt; and Octavius contacting [[Iron Man]] to force him to find a cure for his degenerative condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #501&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Iron Man genuinely offers to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe find a viable cure,&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #502&lt;/ref&gt; Octavius smugly refuses, in favour of witnessing Stark admit that he can't do it and beg for mercy to disarm a device that Octavius had claimed was a bomb, basking in this "proof" of his, supposedly, superior intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #503&lt;/ref&gt;

His attempts to prolong his life, however, does not hinder a more vast sinister plan in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the [[Avengers Academy]] for a piece of [[Hank Pym]]'s technology,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Academy'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Future Foundation]] for a piece of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richard]]'s tech&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] for the ''Zero Cannon'', a powerful antigravity weapon,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676&lt;/ref&gt; later revealing to have gained something useful from his early foray in John Jameson's shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681&lt;/ref&gt; All this careful preparation came to fruition during the "[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/121/1214698p1.html|title=IGN.com: Dan Slott discusses the next big Amazing Spider-Man storyline|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the apparently mismatched pieces of technology stolen are used to build a satellite net, the ''Octavian Lens'', able to alter the world's climate by enhancing or smothering solar rays.

Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the [[greenhouse effect]] in exchange for gratitude and recognition,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682&lt;/ref&gt; but he's soon exposed by Spider-Man (having enhanced himself with new Horizon Labs-built tech&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Silver Sable]], who provoke him into revealing his real plan: immolate a great part of the entire population, to prevent anyone from surviving his impending death, having the survivors remember him in perpetual fear and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685&lt;/ref&gt; Playing over his ego, Spider-Man manages to stall him, by reminding him that, even if anyone managed to survive a drastic heating of the entire Earth, the survivors would likely be brain-damaged, and as such unable to remember his actions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687&lt;/ref&gt; Spider-Man then roughly defeats him, in retaliation for Silver Sable's death, openly mocking and berating his efforts by claiming that, because of the Octavian Lens' destruction and his declining health, he's now going to die alone, forgotten and without a legacy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avenging Spider-Man'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Death" and rebirth===
Even captivity and incarceration are unable to stop Otto Octavius. Since Spider-Man was forced to access the Octobots' hive mind several times in previous months,&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man #672''&lt;/ref&gt; he unwittingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. Octavius is now in Peter Parker's body and able to access his foe's memories but with none of his restraints content of living his civilian life and planning for his future while his foe is now trapped in Octavius' failing body.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Peter is able to recruit the Scorpion, Hydro-Man and Trapster with the task of keeping him alive and capturing "Spider-Man" in an attempt to reverse the mind swap. However, Trapster's portable life support can give Peter only 700 minutes to live.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Peter openly antagonizes "Spider-Man". While Peter's attempt to reclaim his body fails, he's able to imbue his nemesis with his very memories and values before apparently dying in Octavius' crippled body. Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter's dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Octavius claims that since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Spider-Man but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the "Amazing Spider-Man" becoming a "[[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]]".&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Superior Spider-Man===
Within Spider-Man's body, Otto Octavius starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a villain behind himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man'' 15.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon finds himself the target of several villains, such as an Octavius-tech enhanced [[Stilt-Man]],&lt;ref name="Daredevil 22"&gt;''Daredevil'' 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Overdrive (comics)|Overdrive]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], the new female [[Beetle (comics)#Janice|Beetle]], and the [[Living Brain]],&lt;ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #1"&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; all of them trying to take over the place left by the seemingly dead Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six. While they're still no match for the new, more ruthless Spider-Man, his violence and new mannerisms start to tip off several of his close friends and allies, such as the whole Horizon Labs, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]],&lt;ref name="Daredevil 22"/&gt; [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (explicitly forbidden to have Spider-Man's mind telepathically scanned under the threat of legal action in court),&lt;ref&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Jane Watson]],&lt;ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #1"/&gt; and [[Carlie Cooper]].&lt;ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #2"&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his accomplishments, Octavius is revealed to be still haunted by Peter Parker's lingering spirit, unable to reassert control over Spider-Man's shared body, but actively hampering his efforts to stray from Peter's values, and trying to reclaim his body.&lt;ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #2"/&gt; Despite Peter's lingering influence, Octavius's refusal of Peter's values and perceived screw-ups prompts him to "rectify" some mistakes: "Peter" enrolls back to college, pursuing actively the PhD Peter denied himself in the past,&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; and breaks the self-imposed "no-kill rule" by taking a proactive stance against evildoers and criminals, shooting the villain [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]] even after Massacre appeared to show signs of recovering from the brain damage that motivated his crimes,&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; and violently assaulting Jester and Screwball for a relatively minor insult.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; These actions prompted the Avengers to confront "Spider-Man" about his recent activities, recognizing that their friend would never act in such a manner.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; When their subsequent analysis confirms that he is still biologically Peter Parker, Octavius explains that he is merely dealing with stress over recent events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting a mind wipe of all of Peter's memories to destroy the living consciousness completely, Octavius manages to delete the Daily Bugle memory. Realizing Peter would not surrender, Octavius directly engages his foe in Spider-Man's mind. After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man's memories. Returning to the real world, Octavius rejoices from his belief that he is free and has achieved victory over Spider-Man.&lt;ref name="SSM9"&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; But this erasure has also deprived him of Spider-Man's memories, leaving it more difficult for him to pose as Spider-Man, with some of Peter's friends (such as Carlie, Mary Jane, and J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.) questioning Spider-Man's more brutal approach.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; While Octavius has developed more detailed resources than Peter possessed as Spider-Man, such as creating a small army of Spider-bots and Spiderling allies to assist him, as well as helping [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] trap the body-hopping mutant [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]] in a specially-designed containment unit,&lt;ref&gt;''A + X'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; he continues to resort to more questionable methods, such as killing [[Alistair Smythe]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; and blackmailing Jameson into giving him free rein in New York by threatening to expose the fact that Jameson asked him to do this. During a series of confrontations with his former allies in the Sinister Six, he also attempted to brainwash them into becoming his new 'team', resulting in him being forced to join forces with new hero [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]] when the Six snapped out of his control and tried to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man Team Up'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavius's focus on the larger scale also resulted in him missing the Green Goblin's efforts to establish a new criminal empire, with Green Goblin rescuing criminals who have escaped Spider-Man and recruiting them into his new gang as Octavius simply focused on the leaders where Peter would have tried to capture the whole gang. His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man's superior reached a particular climax when [[Spider-Man 2099]] came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly,&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #17&lt;/ref&gt; with Octavius becoming so fixated with solving the problem and keeping his identity secret that he actually attacked the future Spider-Man rather than ask for his help,&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #18&lt;/ref&gt; his actions resulting in the destruction of Horizon Labs because he couldn't solve the [[vibranium]]-related equations that Peter was able to resolve. Unknown to Octavius, Peter's memories managed to survive the deletion. When Octavius attempts to access Spider-Man's memories (because Octavius can only view memories that were looked at before the delete), Peter is shown lifting the 'rocks' off himself from the mental battle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

When Carlie had found evidence that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body, she mourns Peter in Doctor Octopus' grave. The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers that Doctor Octopus' body is not there. After Carlie has been captured by Menace, the Goblin King receives Carlie's journal from Menace where Goblin King discovers evidence in there that states that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

Following him being possessed by the Venom symbiote, Octavius receives unexpected help from Peter Parker's consciousness, though Octavius is still unaware that Peter survived their mental duel. Peter decides to maintain a low profile until Octavius does something that will cause him to spring into action.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; Peter finds that Octavius's delete has left him with very few memories of his own, but after realizing those he still has are the ones that define him, vows not to give up, and that he will regain control of his body.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #26&lt;/ref&gt; The Superior Spider-Man finds himself facing the full force of the Goblin Underground since the possession of the Venom symbiote 31 days ago. When the Superior Spider-Man finally confronts the Goblin King, he mentions that he knows about Doctor Octopus' mind-swap with Spider-Man. The Goblin King then makes his next move by having missiles targeted at Spider-Island II.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #27&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavius survived the bombardment and escaped with The Living Brain. He then tries to find the Goblin King, however before he can do that, Menace takes supporting character [[Anna Maria Marconi]] hostage.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Goblin destroys all the buildings that mean something to Octavius, to punish him for robbing the Goblin of his dream: Killing Spider-Man. Octavius is lured to Empire State University, where he finds Don Lamaze. During the ensuing fight, Lamaze takes a blade meant for Octavius and dies in Superior Spider-Man's arms. Heading to Alchemax, he is confronted by Spider-Man 2099, who takes control of the spider-slayers and demands answers. However, before he gets them, Goblin King reactivates the Slayers to kill the Spiders, stating Norman Osborn now rules New York.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29&lt;/ref&gt; Although he manages to escape, Octavius is forced to realize that he has failed in his goal to be a 'Superior' Spider-Man when the restored Peter Parker takes over to save a child from a runaway train where Octavius hesitated, reflecting that he is aware of his fundamental inferiority as he overcompensates while Peter holds himself back but acts when he has to. Octavius then willingly deletes his own consciousness so that Peter can regain control of his body. As Octavius's last memories fade, it is shown he had really fallen in love with Anna Maria, much to Peter's surprise. Octavius tells Peter he's willing to give up his love to keep her safe- something only Peter can do as the ''true'' Superior Spider-Man- and urges the hero to save New York in his place.&lt;ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #30"&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spider-Verse===
In the run-up to ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', Octavius was sent to the year 2099 by accident while dealing with the temporal anomalies caused by Horizon's time portal.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes – including one where Spider-Man joined the [[Fantastic Four]] and a variation of the [[House of M]] – where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, [[Spider-Man: India|Pavitr Prabhakar]], and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32&lt;/ref&gt; As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill,{{issue|date=December 2014}} but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 – who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter's leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer as they will just come back and they need a new plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #11&lt;/ref&gt; Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria's name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man' 2015"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #13 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

To stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the [[Karn (comics)|Master Weaver]] as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver's place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn's future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was 'destined' to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to 'save' himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the 'gift' of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #15 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, a copy of the consciousness of Doctor Octopus is shown to be in Living Brain where he is still in love with Anna Maria Maraconi.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1&lt;/ref&gt; Following the events of Spider-Verse, Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (Superior's web shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #32-33&lt;/ref&gt; The gauntlet housed a copy of Otto's consciousness up to the point of Spider-Verse (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in Goblin Nation, as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker's body again, planning to act at a time when Parker's spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #18&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time when Living Brain was at Parker Industries' London branch, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses anger over being forced to act like their lackey. After Sajani Jaffrey is fired by Peter Parker for conspiring against him, Doctor Octopus' consciousness smirks as Anna is made the head of Parker Industries' London branch.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy====
During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises' "New U" system which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within Living Brain, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #16&lt;/ref&gt; When Peter Parker scanned Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down Living Brain only for Doctor Octopus' consciousness to reactivate Living Brain and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker's body was 'infected' by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18"/&gt; Upon heading to Potter's Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus' body was grave robbed alongside Alistair Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker's consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. Jackal was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #20&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spider-Man later infiltrates New U Technologies after witnessing video footage of one of its subjects suffering from cellular degeneration, he evades the initial security force including Rhino and the female Electro. When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy #1''&lt;/ref&gt; With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/&gt;

After Silk escapes from New U Technologies, Doctor Octopus attacks Spectro who was unable to phase through the walls with the test subject. Doctor Octopus and Spectro fight until Electro arrives and knocks out Spectro. Doctor Octopus later experiments with Spectro and plans to put him into a cloned body.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' Vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying the clones of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] in order to perfect the Proto Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and Jackal offers her the "Proto Clone" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Octopus fights Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria Maraconi find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #24&lt;/ref&gt;

====Superior Octopus====
With his new body, Otto Octavius returns to one of his old bases only to find it is being occupied by Hydra. He defeats the Hydra soldiers, but is then recruited into Hydra by [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola grants him the leadership of some Hydra soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of [[Parker Industries]]. With Hydra's help, he creates a new uniform for himself, being the Superior Octopus, intending to wait for Peter's actions to trigger the collapse of Parker Industries so that he can retake his position and prove himself superior once again.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #25"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #25. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Superior Octopus appears as a leader of Hydra's Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of his work with Hydra's Avengers, Superior Octopus approached Spider-Man where he wants him to transfer ownership of Parker Industries back to him. When Peter Parker declined this offer, Superior Octopus had the Hydra Agents in Parker Industries' London branch blow up the building.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #29&lt;/ref&gt; As Peter flees to the Hong Kong branch of Parker Industries, Octavius attempts to implement various security protocols he had added to all Parker Industries tech that allows him to retake control of anything developed by the company,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #30. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; but Peter turns the tables on Octavius by ordering his employees to literally destroy the company in order to hurt Hydra, thwarting Octavius' attempt to shut down his new high-tech suit with an EMP by reverting to his traditional costume and turning the EMP trick against Octavius so that his own tentacles attack him. Octavius is forced to flee the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #31. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Go Down Swinging" arc where Red Goblin (Norman Osborn who has powered himself up with the Carnage symbiote) attacks Spider-Man and all his friends and family, Superior Octopus and [[J. Jonah Jameson]] help defend [[Aunt May]] as Superior Octopus still retains some of Peter's memories and sense of responsibility. This concludes with Peter forgiving Superior Octopus and giving him a "clean slate". In the [[Go Down Swinging (comics)|aftermath of Norman's defeat]], Superior Octopus reveals his new identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver, a person who has just started working at Horizon University. He was seen applying for a job under Max Modell as [[Anna Maria Marconi|Anna Maria]] starts acting suspicious towards Dr. Elliot Tolliver.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spider-Geddon====
During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Superior Octopus is seen fighting the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]]. Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange that the Night Shift becomes his agents where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. Superior Octopus leaves advising them never to cross him or they won't live long enough to regret it. After a day at Horizon University and saving some people on the Bay Bridge, Superior Octopus fights Arnim Zola, a bio-duplicate of [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], and some Hydra Agents who seek to repossess his services to rebuild Hydra. Superior Octopus states that he is done with his end of the bargain and attacks them. When the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] turns Superior Octopus to stone and shatters him, another Superior Octopus body emerges where it destroys the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] and defeats [[Arnim Zola]] while informing him to spread the word to Hydra to never come for him again. Superior Octopus' inner monologue states that he had perfected the [[Miles Warren (comics)|Miles Warren's]] cloning technology where each clone had to be made from the deceased in order to maintain their memories as a way to conquer death.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Octavius forces Nefaria into retreating from Los Angeles, he is confronted in his cloning workshop by the Spider-Army, which reveals that his cloning process has been 'hacked' by the Inheritors, who fed his computers hours-old data until they were ready to manifest, with these new Inheritors swiftly killing Noir and Spider-UK. Octavius then quotes "What have I done..."&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Geddon'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After initiating his base's self-destruct sequence to slow down the Inheritors, Superior Octopus states that they still should have killed the Inheritors while they had the chance. Upon heading to his lab at Horizon High to change into his Superior Spider-Man appearance, he goes to recruit Kaine and states that they should leave Ben Reilly out of the fight since Jennix is targeting the cloning technology from the defunct New U Technologies. As Superior Spider-Man and Kaine enter the portal, they are unaware that Ben Reilly has followed them.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Geddon'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior Spider-Man heads to Earth-1040 to recruit that world's Spider-Man where he helps to defeat Tarantula and learned about his counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Otto Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her [[Valeria Richards|second pregnancy]] as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Four #267"/&gt;

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[prehensility|prehensile]], titanium-steel artificial tentacle "arms" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like [[Spider-Man|Spider Man]], or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]] to take up a defensive position in a fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221140910/http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg |date=February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of "Octobots" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).&lt;ref name="ASM600"/&gt;

===Harnesses===
Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a carbonanium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' miniseries.

His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #165&lt;/ref&gt;

The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #22&lt;/ref&gt; The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.

===Powers as [[Spider-Man]]===
Having taken over Spider-Man's body,&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698"/&gt; Otto Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man's powers, abilities, memories, and equipment,&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"/&gt; although he loses access to Spider-Man's memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind.&lt;ref name="SSM9"/&gt; As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some [[carbonadium]] plating over his neck and skull,&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"/&gt; talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as [[tabi|jika-tabi]] shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.&lt;ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1"&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man 15.1''&lt;/ref&gt;

He also retains access to some of his former Doctor Octopus hideouts, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.&lt;ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1"/&gt;

===[[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]]===
The '''Octobots''' are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus. There are two different kinds of Octobots:

* The first model of the Octobot seen is a little metal ball with eight legs which are controlled mentally by Doctor Octopus via a remote control. These [[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]] can also be used to attack, to perform different tasks, and attach themselves to anyone so that Doctor Octopus can control them.
* The second model of the Octobot seen is a giant metallic robot which Doctor Octopus uses to attack huge constructions.

The [[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]] have at least two known variations:

* The '''[[Spider-Slayer]]s''' – These Spider-Slayers that appeared in ''[[Spider-Island]]'' are actually first generation Octobots that Spider-Man had laden with a special serum which was used to cure the Spider-Virus that slowly turned everyone into Man-Spiders.
* The '''Spider-Bots''' – The Spider-Bots are small red and blue spiders. While inside Spider-Man's body, he controlled them by remote and able to enact constant surveillance over the whole New York city, perform different tasks and control technology.

===Powers as Superior Octopus===
In his [[Superior Octopus]] body, Otto Octavius retains access to Peter Parker's powers while also having a new set of his original tentacles designed to work with this body.&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #25"/&gt;

===''Marvel Zombies''===
On Earth-2149 (a world in which almost all heroes and villains are zombies) an undead Doctor Octopus first appears in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' series alongside several other zombie supervillains attempting to kill and devour the invading [[Galactus]]; this incarnation of Doctor Octopus is apparently destroyed piecemeal by several cosmically powered hero zombies after he got in the way of an attack they were aiming at the invading [[Galactus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

Here, he is a doctor working in a facility on [[Ellis Island]]. His legs are crippled and withered, and he travels in a wheelchair with six long metal claw-like tentacles sticking out. He is officially conducting experiments on primates, to study their brains in connection with evolution, and in the end, it is shown he is secretly taking in kidnapped African-Americans for his own more secret experiments. He is later revealed to in fact be working with the Nazis and their American proxies, "[[Friends of New Germany]]", with the plot of making all minorities into mindless slaves. However, his experiments are uncovered by Spider-Man, and although he is allowed to leave the country due to his past service to America, he is subsequently rejected by the Nazis as they believe his crippled body reflects a crippled mind that could produce nothing of value for them.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Their objective was to steal the mayor's plan, but although they succeeded in the theft, they were forced to retreat after a battle with Lady Spider.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Verse'' #1 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In a later confrontation with Lady Spider and [[Spider-Man 2099]], Miguel manages to examine Octopus's equipment and notes that it is powered by a radioactive material with improper shielding, musing that he would be dead of cancer within a year if he kept using the tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man 2099'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

In a world where [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] was the Spider-Totem, Doctor Octopus attempted to blackmail the world with a stolen nuclear device.

However once he realizes that Luthor intends to destroy most of the planet Earth, Octopus betrays Luthor and attempts to stop him, but is defeated (Spider-Man subsequently defeats Luthor, and Superman prevents the East Coast of the United States from being destroyed by a Luthor-created tidal wave).&lt;ref&gt;''Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Doctor Octopus is younger, more muscular, and wears sunglasses to disguise scars from the accident that fused him to his metal arms. His arms are made of [[nanotechnology|nanobots]], and thus can transform into different tools. He initially claims to have a psychic link with his metal arms, demonstrated by controlling them remotely.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Six'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He later reveals he can manipulate all metal.&lt;ref name="UltimateSpiderMan"&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a scientist at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]], Norman Osborn's business rival. He is caught in a lab accident that also turns Norman into the [[Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]]. After this accident, his traditional metal arms are grafted onto his body and he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin perishes due to a heart attack caused by Octavius attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]], consisting of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]]. There are only five villains to begin with, but Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter by recounting the accident that created him, and he and Otto's involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter Parker into joining them, threatening Mary Jane Watson's life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by the [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''Ultimate Hobgoblin'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.

In the "[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]", Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage]] creature. His experimentation and research was done for the [[FBI]]/[[CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104, he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out.&lt;ref name="UltimateSpiderMan" /&gt;

Octavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]; he attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Octavius is beating Osborn senseless until his other former ally [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] intervenes and shocks Octavius with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out.

During the ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', Doctor Octopus appears as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s Brain Trust.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Mystery'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the rest of the Ultimate Six, Otto Octavius plays a role in the "Death of Spider-Man" storyline. Norman Osborn breaks him and the rest out of the Triskelion. After their escape, Osborn informs them that God wishes for them to kill Peter Parker.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156&lt;/ref&gt; Octavius wanted to leave the group, because he wanted to live a normal life as a scientist and also said that he took enough pride in helping create Spider-Man. Osborn was outraged by the fact that Octavius tried to share credit for Spider-Man's existence and attacked him. The two of them fought which ended with Osborn pummeling Octavius to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #157&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "Stark Expo", Otto Octavius shows off his tentacle harness at the Stark Expo which gets taken over by [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Following Ghost's defeat, [[Max Modell]] has Otto Octavius discontinue the experiment with the harness as he was pitching the cerebral cortex to serve as an alternative power source. Afterwards, he is approached by Norman Osborn who gives him his card and an offer to have his project funded by Oscorp whenever he's ready. Eventually, in "The Rise of Doc Ock" four-parter, Otto is revealed to have been developing a nuclear reactor of sorts under Horizon High, attracting the attention of the female [[Crimson Dynamo]]. While Spider-Man and Otto are able to drive the Dynamo off, she had caused the reactor to go into meltdown; while Spider-Man attempted to shut it down, Otto wouldn't have his work interfered with, and attempted to shut it down himself, resulting in his robotic arms being fused to his back. While initially downtrodden at his situation, Peter comforts him and Otto is convinced to team up with Spider-Man as "the Octopus". After several confrontations with the Lizard resulting in disasters, Otto is convinced to join Osborn Academy. Though he was annoyed that Norman Osborn started the Octobot projects without his approval, Otto later assisted in the fight against Rhino, who was used by Jackal to turn the students and one security guard into Rhinos. Upon Jackal's hideout being found by Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn, Norman arrived with the Oscorp Commandos consisting of Otto Octavius, Vulture, Rhino, Alistair Smythe, and Oliver Osnick.

===Film===
[[File:Doctor Octopus 2004 film.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Molina]] as Doctor Octopus in  ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004).]]

[[Alfred Molina]] portrayed Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus in the 2004 feature film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. This version is depicted as a sympathetic, misguided character and husband to Rosalie Octavius (portrayed by [[Donna Murphy]]). He first meets Peter Parker when Curt Connors recommends visiting him, lecturing Peter that all the talent in the world is useless without effort. A disastrous Oscorp-funded experiment with [[tritium]] that Octavius uses his four-armed harness to control results in Rosalie's death and the fusion of the harness to Octavius's body. The arms have artificial intelligence that first attack those who attempt to remove them, then later influence Octavius into becoming a criminal. He comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he resorts to bank robbery in order to continue financing his experiments. He eventually kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]] as a hostage in an abandoned pier warehouse where he makes another attempt to harness energy from tritium, not caring that it will destroy half of the city. When Spider-Man arrives, they battle again, resulting in Doctor Octopus's arms being damaged. After Peter willingly reveals his identity, he reminds Octavius of the latter's own words on how intelligence should be used for the good of mankind, causing Otto's original personality to overpower the A.I. of the arms. He ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy the tritium reactor by pulling it with him into the river as it explodes.

It is revealed that he and Norman were the founders of Oscorp, having met as lab partners in college, but Otto left with a settlement due to Norman's unethical genetic experiments that resulted in victims like [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Otto's research with prosthetics is also a personal necessity, as he suffers from a degenerative neurological disorder that will eventually rob him of his motor functions. Upon completion of the technology, Otto attaches four mechanical appendages to his back, using an intra-cranial neural network to connect them to his nervous system. However, technical flaws in the neural interface degrade Otto's limbic system, causing his hatred of Norman to overwhelm him. He goes on to form the Sinister Six from Spider-Man's enemies, cause a prison break, attack various Oscorp properties, and release Devil's Breath into New York, all in order to ruin Norman and expose his crimes to the world. His attempt to kill Norman is foiled by Spider-Man, causing them to fight. During the final battle, Doctor Octopus reveals he knew Peter was Spider-Man and unsuccessfully tries to convince him to continue their work before being thrown in prison, though Doctor Octopus will keep this information to himself.

'''Delayed implantation''' or '''embryonic diapause''' is a [[Reproduction|reproductive]] strategy used by approximately 100 different [[mammal]]s in seven or eight different [[order (biology)|orders]].  In embryonic diapause, the [[embryo]] ([[blastocyst]]) does not immediately implant in the [[uterus]] after [[sexual reproduction]] has created the [[zygote]], but is maintained in a state of [[dormancy]].  Little to no development takes place while the embryo remains unattached to the uterine wall.  As a result, the normal [[gestation]] period is extended for a species-specific time.&lt;ref name="lope"&gt;

While much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized, little is still known about entry into diapause, and the conditions which enable a blastocyst to remain dormant.

Some mammals that undergo embryonic diapause include [[rodent]]s, [[bear]]s, [[mustelid]]s (e.g. [[weasel]]s and [[badger]]s), and [[marsupial]]s, (e.g. [[kangaroo]]s).  Some groups only have one species that undergoes embryonic diapause, such as the [[roe deer]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Artiodactyla]].&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;

== Purpose ==

Mammals may undergo diapause to avoid the risk to their own lives during unfavourable and/or environmental conditions. 
Mammals use embryonic diapause to time the [[birth]] of their [[offspring]] for favorable [[metabolic]] and/or environmental conditions.  [[Reproduction]] has a large energy cost and it is beneficial to have ideal conditions (e.g. available food, mild weather, previous offspring [[weaned]]) to ensure the [[offspring]] survives before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;

== Types ==

Two types of mammalian embryonic diapause have been identified.

=== Facultative diapause ===

Facultative diapause is also known as lactational delayed implantation due to its regulation via [[lactation]].  If a female [[copulate]]s while still lactating for a previous litter, the suckling stimulus will cause the embryos to enter into diapause. This is known to occur in some [[rodent]]s, [[insectivore]]s and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;

  | jstor=1295231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obligate diapause ===

Obligate diapause is also known as seasonal delayed implantation and is a mechanism that allows mammals to time the birth of their offspring for favorable environmental conditions.  This mechanism occurs as a regular part of the reproductive cycle in mammals such as [[armadillo]]s, all species of [[pinniped]], many [[mustelid]]s, all [[Ursidae|ursids]], one species of [[fruit bat]], and the [[roe deer]].&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">'''''Erg''''' was a vessel built and owned by Halifax Steamship Ltd. in 1915. She was used to ferry workers across the harbour to vessels under repair during the [[Second World War]]. ''Erg'' was sunk in the [[Halifax Harbour]] three times and is currently located in the [[Bedford Basin]].&lt;ref name=nswrecks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nswrecks.net/ns-datapages/erg-dat.htm |title=Erg |publisher=Shipwrecks of Nova Scotia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231163326/http://nswrecks.net/ns-datapages/erg-dat.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early service==
''Erg'' was originally a [[steam tug]] called ''Sambro'' and was built by the [[Halifax Shipyard]] in 1915. She was one of the earliest steel vessels to be built in Halifax. ''Sambro'' was 55 feet long and almost 15 feet wide, with a depth of 7 feet and her maximum tonnage was 28. The tug was originally sunk during the [[Halifax Explosion]] of 1917. In 1927, ''Sambro'' was raised out of the harbour and was converted from steam to diesel, being given a 4 horsepower engine. With this change, the tug was given a new name and a new purpose. The vessel was renamed ''Erg'' and was used as a transport tug, ferrying workers and their equipment from the shipyard to vessels under repair.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/museum/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=1429 |title=Erg - 1943 |publisher=Maritime Museum of the Atlantic |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime harbour==
Halifax Harbour was an extremely busy port during the Second World War. Because of this, navigational dangers increased with the congestion in the harbour. The [[Naval Service of Canada]], which kept records of the activity in the harbour, advised that from 1940 to 1943, there were at least 12 vessels involved in accidents within Halifax Harbour. Vessels such as ''Camperdown'', ''Claire Lilley'' and ''Nueva Indalucia'' ran aground, whereas others such as ''Otter'', and ''Trongate'' caught fire and sank (or, in the case of ''Trongate'', was made to sink as the flames were completely out of control). In 1940, ''Herbidean'' was sunk by the British ship ''Esmond''; a forerunner to the fate of ''Erg''.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Gilbert Norman (1952). ''The Naval Service of Canada: Its Official History: Volume II: Activities on Shore During The Second World War''. Ottawa: King's Printer. {{pn|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wreck==
On June 6, 1943, ''Erg'' was carrying workers and equipment (air compressors and electric generators) through the fog and rain,&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; when she was run down by a Norwegian freighter – a steamship named ''Norelg'' (See [[Convoy SC 94]] for more information on this ship). The tug immediately began sinking and as a result, 19 men lost their lives. On July 19, the Royal Canadian Navy utilized the floating crane ''Lord Kitchener'' to raise the wreck of ''Erg'' so the bodies of the deceased could be recovered. Only 10 bodies were discovered and removed from the wreck. ''Erg''{{'}}s sinking was and still is considered one of the worst accidents to have taken place in the Halifax Harbour and is the greatest loss of life in regards to a shipwreck within these waters.&lt;ref name="novascotia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20031113004 |title=New Shipwreck Display Opens at the Maritime Museum |publisher=Province of Nova Scotia |date=November 13, 2003 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon inspection, it was decided that ''Erg'' was beyond repair and on August 24, 1943,&lt;ref name="novascotia1"/&gt; she was taken to her final resting place and sunk for the third and final time.

==Final resting place==
The ''Erg'' shipwreck site was rediscovered in 2001 in the northern part of the [[Bedford Basin]] (near Roach Cove) by the Nova Scotia Exploration Society.&lt;ref name=nswrecks/&gt; The site is a protected heritage site and is visited by many divers. Objects which were recovered from ''Erg'', such as the ships' whistle and portholes are currently on display at the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] on Lower Water Street.&lt;ref name="novascotia1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Evolutionary programming''' is one of the four major [[evolutionary algorithm]] paradigms.  It is similar to [[genetic programming]], but the structure of the program to be optimized is fixed, while its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.

It was first used by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US in 1960 in order to use simulated [[evolution]] as a learning process aiming to generate [[artificial intelligence]]. Fogel used [[finite-state machine]]s as predictors and evolved them.
Currently evolutionary programming is a wide [[evolutionary computing]] dialect with no fixed structure or ([[Genetic representation|representation]]), in contrast with some of the other dialects. It is becoming harder to distinguish from [[Evolution strategy|evolutionary strategies]].

Its main variation operator is [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]; members of the population are viewed as part of a specific species rather than members of the same species therefore each parent generates an offspring, using a (μ + μ){{Explain|date=April 2017}} [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|survivor selection]].

}}'''Ezequiel A Di Paolo''' (born in Buenos Aires, 1970) is a full-time Research Professor at [[Ikerbasque]], the Basque Foundation for Science. He also has affiliations with the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics at the [[University of Sussex]]. His field of research covers [[enactivism]] and embodiment in [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/people/peoplelists/person/23012|title=Ezequiel Di Paolo : People : ...  : Department of Informatics : University of Sussex|website=Sussex.ac.uk|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Di Paolo studied Physics at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and obtained a Master of Science degree in Nuclear Engineering from the [[Balseiro Institute]] in Argentina. He has a [[PhD]] degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from the [[University of Sussex]].

== Academic work ==
His work includes research in  [[embodied cognition]], dynamical systems, adaptive behaviour in natural and artificial systems, biological modelling, [[complex systems]], [[evolutionary robotics]], and [[philosophy of science]]. His research is in the tradition established by Varela, Thompson and Rosch,&lt;ref name="enaction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penny|first1=Simon|last2=Varela|first2=Francisco J.|last3=Thompson|first3=Evan|last4=Rosch|first4=Eleanor|title=Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience|journal=Leonardo|date=1995|volume=28|issue=4|pages=337|doi=10.2307/1576207}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an early example of the [[embodied cognition|embodied]], enactive approach to cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enaction: Toward a New Paradigm for Cognitive Science |pages=32–87 |doi=10.7551/mitpress/9780262014601.003.0003 |chapter=Horizons for the Enactive Mind: Values, Social Interaction, and Play |year=2010 |last1=Di Paolo |first1=Ezequiel A. |last2=Rohde |first2=Marieke |last3=De Jaegher |first3=Hanne |editor-first=John |editor-last=Stewart |editor-first2=Olivier |editor-last2=Gapenne |editor-first3=Ezequiel A. |editor-last3=Di Paolo |isbn=978-0-262-01460-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Paolo believes that [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] and [[Enactivism (psychology)|enactivism]] have the potential to increase our understanding in traditional problems of [[Cognitive Science|cognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Participatory sense-making|last = |first = |date = |journal = Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 485–507|doi = 10.1007/s11097-007-9076-9|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2007|last1 = De Jaegher|first1 = Hanne|last2 = Di Paolo|first2 = Ezequiel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocates that these alternative views should be explored and developed further, rather than being subsumed (or 'watered down'&lt;ref name="enaction" /&gt;) under more traditional frameworks, such as the [[René Descartes|cartesian]] dualistic model.

His promotion and exploration  of embodiment and enactivism is carried on through his work in the academic consortium [http://esmcs.eu/ eSMCs], an EU funded project to investigate the role of sensorimotor contingencies in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmcs.eu/consortium|title=Consortium - eSMCs|website=Esmcs.eu|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he is involved in [http://www.ias-research.net/people/IAS, Centre for LIfe, Mind and Society], a research group spanning complex systems in biology and self-organising systems.

Other areas of his work include social cognition and intersubjectivity. He is involved as principal investigator with the Marie-Curie Initial Training Network [http://tesis-itn.eu/ TESIS — Towards an Embodied Science of InterSubjectivity].

He is Editor-in-chief of the interdisciplinary journal ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

'''Francis Paul Heylighen''' (born 1960) is a prominent [[Belgian]] [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] investigating the emergence and evolution of intelligent organization.  He presently works as a research professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], the Dutch-speaking [[Free University of Brussels]], where he directs the transdisciplinary research group on "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition"&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.francis.heylighen Dr. Francis Heylighen] at LifeBoat Foundation Bios. Accessed 14 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecco.vub.ac.be/|title=ECCO Home - ecco.vub.ac.be|website=ecco.vub.ac.be|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Brain Institute. He is best known for his work on the [[Principia Cybernetica Project]], his model of the Internet as a [[global brain]], and his contributions to the theories of [[memetics]] and [[self-organization]]. He is also known, albeit to a lesser extent, for his work on [[intellectual giftedness|gifted people]] and their problems.

==Biography==
Francis Heylighen was born on September 27, 1960 in [[Vilvoorde]], [[Belgium]]. He received his high school education from the "Koninklijk Atheneum Pitzemburg" in [[Mechelen]], in the section Latin-Mathematics. He received his MSc in mathematical [[physics]] in 1982 from the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB), where he also received his PhD Summa cum Laude in Sciences in 1987&lt;ref name ="CV"&gt;* [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/CV-Heylighen.pdf Francis Heylighen's] Curriculum Vitae, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; for his thesis, published in 1990, as "Representation and Change. A Metarepresentational Framework for the Foundations of Physical and Cognitive Science."&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, Francis. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Rep&amp;Change.pdf Representation and change: a metarepresentational framework for the foundations of physical and cognitive science]. Communication and Cognition, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he started working as a researcher for the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research ([[NFWO]]). In 1994 he became a tenured researcher at the NFWO and in 2001 a research professor at the VUB. Since 1995 he has been affiliated with the VUB’s [[Center Leo Apostel]] for interdisciplinary studies.&lt;ref name ="BG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/heylighenProfile.htm|title=Dr|website=www.goertzel.org|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he created the ECCO research group&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecco.vub.ac.be Evolution, Complexity and Cognition group] (ECCO)&lt;/ref&gt; which he presently directs. Thanks to a grant from a private sponsor, in 2012 he additionally founded the [http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute] at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], becoming its first director.

In 1989 [[Valentin Turchin]] and [[Cliff Joslyn]] founded the [[Principia Cybernetica Project]], and Heylighen joined a year later. In 1993 he created the project's encyclopedic site, one of the first complex websites in the world. In 1996, Heylighen founded the "Global Brain Group", an international discussion forum that provides a working platform for most of the scientists who have worked on the concept of emergent Internet intelligence.&lt;ref name ="BG"/&gt; Heylighen was also one of the founders and former editor of the Journal of Memetics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|title=Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|last=Edmonds|first=Bruce|date=|website=cfpm.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ceased publication in 2008.

Heylighen is a Fellow of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldacademy.org/view/general_listing General Listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123014504/http://www.worldacademy.org/view/general_listing |date=2016-01-23 }} World Academy of Art &amp; Science. Retrieved Nov 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the Global Agenda Council on Complex Systems of the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/global-agenda-councils/francis-heylighen Francis Heylighen] The World Economic Forum. Retrieved Nov 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His biography has been listed since 2002 in [[Marquis Who's Who]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130505154259/http://bios.marquiswhoswho.com/francis_paul_heylighen/cybernetician_researcher/5556289 Francis Paul Heylighen] on  marquiswhoswho.com. Retrieved Nov 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he received an "Outstanding Technology Contribution Award" from the Web Intelligence Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi-consortium.org/wicweb/html/wicawards.html|title=WIC Annual|website=wi-consortium.org|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his research on the Global Brain.

==Work==
His research focuses on the [[emergence]] and [[evolution]] of [[Complexity|complex]], intelligent organization. Applications include the [[origin of life]], the development of multicellular organisms, knowledge, culture, and societies, and the impact of information and communication technologies on present and future social evolution.

Heylighen's scientific work covers an extremely wide range of subjects, exemplifying his intellectual curiosity and fundamentally transdisciplinary way of thinking. In addition to the topics mentioned above, his publications cover topics such as the foundations of [[quantum mechanics]], the structure of [[space-time]], [[hypermedia]] interfaces, the psychology of [[self-actualization]] and [[happiness]], the [[price mechanism|market mechanism]], formality and contextuality in language, [[causality]], the measurement of [[social progress]], the mechanism of [[stigmergy]] and its application to the web.

===Basic ideas===
This broad variety of work is held together by two basic principles. The relational principle notes that phenomena do not exist on their own, but only in relation (connection or distinction) to other phenomena. They thus only make sense as part of an encompassing network or system.&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, F. (2001). Bootstrapping knowledge representations: from entailment meshes via semantic nets to learning webs. Kybernetes, 30(5/6), 691–725. {{doi|10.1108/EUM0000000005695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary principle notes that [[:wikt:variation|variation]] through (re)combination of parts and [[natural selection]] of the fitter combinations results in ever more complex and [[adaptive system]]s. This principle is a direct application of [[Universal Darwinism]], the idea that Darwinian mechanisms can be extended to virtually all disciplines and problem domains.

The two principles come together in Heylighen's concept of a distinction dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, F. (1990). Representation and Change: A Metarepresentational Framework for the Foundations of Physical and Cognitive Science. Communication and Cognition.
&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, classical scientific methodology is based on given, unchanging distinctions between elements or states. Therefore, it is intrinsically unable to model creative change. But the evolutionary principle makes distinctions dynamic, explaining the creation and destruction of relations, distinctions and connections, and thus helping us to understand how and why complex organization emerges.

Moreover, any system must be adapted to its environment, which implies that it is able to react adequately to changes in that environment. This is the origin of mind or intelligence, as the system should be able to select the right actions for the given conditions. These "condition-action" relations are the basis of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, F. (2011). [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration]. Integral Review.&lt;/ref&gt; As systems evolve, their adaptiveness tends to increase, and therefore also their knowledge or intelligence. Thus, the general trend of evolution is [[self-organization]], or a spontaneous increase in intelligent organization.

===Principia Cybernetica===
Together with [[Cliff Joslyn]] and the late [[Valentin Turchin]], Heylighen is a founding editor of the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project, which is devoted to the collaborative development of an evolutionary-systemic [[philosophy]].  He created its website, the Principia Cybernetica Web,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/|title=Welcome to Principia Cybernetica Web|website=pespmc1.vub.ac.be|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993, as one of the [[List of websites founded before 1995|first complex webs]] in the world. It is still viewed as one of the most important sites on cybernetics, [[systems theory]] and related approaches.

===The Global Brain===
In 1996, Heylighen founded the "Global Brain Group",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalbraininstitute.org|title=The Global Brain Institute|website=globalbraininstitute.org|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international discussion forum that groups most of the scientists who have worked on the concept of emergent Internet intelligence.&lt;ref name ="BG"/&gt; Together with his PhD student [[Johan Bollen]], Heylighen was the first to propose algorithms that could turn the [[world-wide web]] into a [[self-organizing]], learning network that exhibits [[collective intelligence]], i.e. a [[Global brain]].

In the 2007 article "The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society" Heylighen gave a detailed exposition of the superorganism/global brain view of society, and an examination of the underlying evolutionary mechanisms, with applications to the ongoing and future developments in a globalizing world. Presently, he is developing a detailed mathematical and simulation model of the global brain, together with his collaborators in the Global Brain Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, F. (2012).

'''''From Dictatorship to Democracy, A Conceptual Framework for Liberation''''' is a book-length essay on the generic problem of how to destroy a dictatorship and to prevent the rise of a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''], 4th U.S. Ed., p viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written in 1993 by [[Gene Sharp]] (b. 1928), a professor of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth|University of Massachusetts]]. The book has been published in many countries worldwide and translated into more than 30 languages. Editions in many languages are also published by the [[Albert Einstein Institution]] of Boston, Massachusetts. {{as of|2012}} its current primary English-language edition is the Fourth United States Edition, published in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf ''''' From Dictatorship to Democracy'''''], 4th U.S. Ed., p iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been circulated worldwide and cited repeatedly as influencing movements such as the [[Arab Spring]] of 2010–2012.&lt;ref name=cnn2012_06_23/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailytimes2012_06_01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ft2012_06_25/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2012_06_11/&gt;

==Origin==
{{Gene Sharp}}
''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' (''FDTD'') was written in 1993 at the request of a prominent exiled [[Politics of Burma|Burmese]] democrat, Tin Maung Win, who was then editor of ''Khit Pyaing'' (The New Era Journal), in
[[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2&gt;The history of ''FDTD'' is discussed at length in Appendix 2 of the 4th US edition of ''FDTD'', "Acknowledgements and Notes on the History of From Dictatorship to Democracy" (pp. 87-90), available for download at the [[Albert Einstein Institution]] website [http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html HERE.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621020453/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html |date=2012-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87–8}} The book took several months to write as the author drew upon several decades of experience in scholarship on nonviolent action.&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=fdtdhist_sepdoc/&gt;
''FDTD'' was first published in 1993 as installments in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and English in ''Khit Pyaing''. In 1994, it was issued as a booklet in both English and Burmese.&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2/&gt;{{rp|88}} Since that time, there have been several additional English-language editions and translations into more than 30 additional languages.

==Topics covered==
''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' contains a preface and ten sections.  Its first appendix includes 198 ''Methods Of Nonviolent Action'' that were taken from Gene Sharp's ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' (1973), Part Two, ''The Methods of Nonviolent Action''. The main sections of the 4th US edition are entitled:
:1. Facing Dictatorships Realistically
:2. The Dangers of Negotiations
:3. Whence Comes the Power?
:4. Dictatorships Have Weaknesses
:5. Exercising Power
:6. The Need for Strategic Planning
:7. Planning Strategy
:8. Applying Political Defiance
:9. Disintegrating the Dictatorship
:10. Groundwork for Durable Democracy
Three appendices are included in the fourth US edition of ''FDTD'':
:Appendix 1. The Methods of Nonviolent Action
:Appendix 2. Acknowledgements and Notes on the History of ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''
:Appendix 3. A Note About Translations and Reprinting of this Publication
:For Further Reading
Appendix 3 gives a step-by-step procedure for effectively translating ''FDTD'' into other languages.

The ''[[Financial Times]]'', in discussing the prospects for dictators worldwide, described Sharp as "the [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] of the new [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi-ism]]" stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is new... is the wildfire spread of systematically non-violent insurgency.

{{Kabbalah}}
'''Gilgul'''/'''Gilgul neshamot'''/'''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] {{Hebrew|גלגול הנשמות}}, Plural: {{Hebrew|גלגולים}} ''Gilgulim'') describes a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] concept of [[reincarnation]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word ''gilgul'' means "cycle" or "wheel"  and ''neshamot'' is the plural for "souls." [[Soul]]s are seen to "cycle" through "[[Life|lives]]" or "incarnations", being attached to different human [[Human body|bodies]] over time. Which body they associate with depends on their particular task in the physical world, [[spirituality|spiritual]] levels of the bodies of predecessors and so on. The concept relates to the wider processes of history in Kabbalah, involving Cosmic [[Tohu and Tikkun|Tikkun]] (Messianic rectification), and the historical dynamic of ascending [[Ohr|Lights]] and descending [[Ohr|Vessels]] from generation to generation. The esoteric explanations of ''gilgul'' were articulated in Jewish mysticism by [[Isaac Luria]] in the 16th century, as part of the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] purpose of Creation.

==History in Jewish thought==
The belief in re-incarnation had first existed amongst Jewish mystics in the Ancient World, among differing explanation given of the after-life, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, re-incarnation is an esoteric belief within many streams of modern Judaism, but is not an essential tenet of traditional [[Judaism]]. It is not mentioned in traditional classical sources such as the [[Hebrew Bible]],, the classical rabbinic works ([[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]), or [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]]. [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism), however, teaches a belief in ''gilgul'', [[transmigration of souls]], and hence the belief is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative.

Among well-known rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi]] (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and [[Leon of Modena]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued with [[Saadia Gaon]] in favour of ''gilgulim''.

Rabbis who believed in the idea of reincarnation include, from Medieval times: the mystical leaders [[Nahmanides]] and [[Bahya ben Asher]]; from the 16th-century: [[Levi ibn Habib]], and from the mystical school of [[Safed]], [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]], [[Isaac Luria]], and his exponent [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]]; and from the 18th-century: the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], the [[Baal Shem Tov]], later Hasidic Masters, and the [[Lithuanian Jewish Orthodox]] leader and Kabbalist the [[Vilna Gaon]]; and - amongst others - from the 19th/20th-century: [[Yosef Hayyim]] author of ''Ben Ish Hai''.

With the 16th-century rational systemisation of [[Cordoveran Kabbalah]] by Alkabetz, and the subsequent new paradigm of [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] by Luria, Kabbalah replaced [[rationalism]] as the mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. Isaac Luria taught new explanations of the process of ''gilgul'' and identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures, which were compiled by Hayyim ben Joseph Vital in his ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]''.

The idea of ''gilgul'' became popular in Jewish folk belief, and is found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]].

The essential [[Kabbalistic]] text in regards to ''gilgul'' is called [[Shaar ha Gilgulim|Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Gate of Reincarnations'')[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135440/http://www.safed-kabbalah.com/ShaarGilgul/Introduction.htm], based on the work of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] (and compiled by his disciple, Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]]). It describes the deep, complex laws of reincarnation. One concept that arises from Sha'ar Ha'gilgulim is the idea that ''gilgul'' is paralleled physically by pregnancy. In Kabbalah, any higher spiritual truth is seen to be reflected in lower forms in this physical World. This is because the Divine lifeforce for this realm first descends through the chain of higher realms.

===Expression of Divine compassion===
[[File:Safed BW 1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Ark in the [[Ari Ashkenazi Synagogue|Ari (Isaac Luria) Ashkenazi Synagogue]] in [[Safed]]. Luria fully expounded the Kabbalistic doctrine of gilgul]]
In Kabbalistic understanding of ''gilgul'', [[reincarnation]] is not fatalistic or automatic, nor is it essentially a punishment of sin, or reward of virtue. In Judaism, the [[Jewish eschatology|Heavenly realms]] could fulfill [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith|Principle of faith]] in Reward and Punishment. Rather, it is concerned with the process of individual [[Tikkun olam|Tikkun]] (Rectification) of the soul. In Kabbalistic interpretation, each Jewish soul is reincarnated enough times only in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot]]. The souls of the righteous among the Nations may be assisted through ''gilgulim'' to fulfil each of their seven mitzvot, the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. As such ''gilgul'' is an expression of Divine compassion, and is seen as a Heavenly agreement with the individual soul to descend again. This stress on physical performance and perfection of each [[Mitzvah]], is tied to the [[Lurianic]] doctrine of Cosmic Tikkun of Creation. In these new teachings, a Cosmic catastrophe occurred at the beginning of Creation called the "Shattering of the Vessels" of the [[Sephirot]] in the "World of Tohu (Chaos)". The vessels of the Sephirot broke and fell down through the spiritual Worlds until they were embedded in our physical realm as "sparks of holiness" (Nitzutzot). The reason in Lurianic Kabbalah that almost all Mitzvot involve physical action, is that through their performance, they elevate each particular Spark of holiness associated with that commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. This [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theology gives cosmic significance to the life of each person, as each individual has particular tasks that only they can fulfil. Therefore, ''gilgulim'' assist the individual soul in this cosmic plan. This also explains the Kabbalistic reason why the future eschatological [[Utopia]] will be in this World, as only in the lowest, Physical realm is the purpose of Creation fulfilled.

===Spiritual dimension of all Creations===
[[Image:Glass of Water.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Water pouring into a glass|The [[sefirot]] consist of lights invested in vessels, similar to water poured into a glass. While taking on the shape of the glass, the water is essentially unchanged.]]
In [[Kabbalah]], from its initial Medieval form onwards, Creation is described as a descending [[Seder hishtalshelus|Chain of spiritual Worlds]] of cause and effect. The new 16th-century Kabbalistic paradigm of [[Isaac Luria]] extends the meaning of this with the concept of the holy sparks. Creation is a continuous process of Divine vitality. All physical and spiritual Creations only continue to exist due to the [[Divine immanence|immanent]] Divine [[Ohr]] ("Light"), from God's Will to create, that they constantly receive. This immanent flow forms the spark of holiness in any Created form. This teaches that the true essence of anything is only its Divine spark within, that gives it continual existence. If the light were to be withdrawn, the creation would cease to exist. This complete dependence on Divinity is hidden in this lowest physical realm, but the [[Merkabah|souls and angels]] of successively higher spiritual realms are nullified to the Divine Unity, in successively higher degrees. This explains the statement of Isaac Luria that even stones possess a subtle form of soul. With the focus in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] on Cosmic [[Tohu and Tikkun|Tikkun]] rectification, accordingly every leaf also possesses a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification".

===Above-conscious root of Gilgul===
16th-century Lurianic doctrine was the first time that Kabbalah focused on gilgul, because it forms the microcosmic parallel to the Cosmic Divine rectification taught by Luria. In Medieval Kabbalah of the [[Zohar]], which received its full rational synthesis in 16th-century [[Cordoveran Kabbalah]], immediately before the new teachings of Luria, Gilgul was not the focus as intellectual categorisation was sought. Lurianic Kabbalah, accordingly, while also fully systemised in rational articulation, nonetheless focuses on Divine soul levels above intellect. The central doctrine of Luria is the [[Tzimtzum]] (Divine "Withdrawal") that paradoxically transcends human logic. The [[Tohu and Tikkun|Tikkun]] rectification of the Tzimtzum, involving the "birur" (elevation) of the sparks of Creation, and their soul parallel of Gilgul, similarly are rooted in Divine levels above intellect. In the foundational Kabbalistic structure of the 10 [[Sephirot]] (emanations), [[Keter]] (Divine Will) transcends the intellectual Sephirot, and is the origin of All.

The Lurianic idea that all physical and spiritual Creations possess their particular bodily "soul", explains the notion that gilgul can involve a person's soul occasionally being exiled into lower creatures, plants or even stones.

===Five levels of the soul===
{{See also|Kabbalah#Human soul in Kabbalah}}
In Jewish mysticism the human soul has five levels that relate to different levels of the [[Sephirot]] (Divine emanations). Based on an ancient [[Midrash]]ic source,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bereshit Rabbah]] 14:9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kabbalah]] (followed also in [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic interpretation]] of Kabbalah) gives names for these five levels. Their corresponding [[Sephirot]] have both outer spiritual functions (vessels) and inner dimensions (lights), that relate to outer manifestations of the human soul, and their inner psychological "soul powers". The five levels of the human soul in ascending order:&lt;ref&gt;The five levels of the soul: [http://www.inner.org/glossary/gloss_s.htm#Soul Glossary of Kabbalah and Chassidut-entry on "soul"] at www.inner.org.

The most basic component of the [[soul]], the [[nefesh]], is always part of the ''gilgul'' process, as it must leave at the cessation of blood production (a stage of death). It moves to another body, where life has begun. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes.

==Other processes of transmigration==
''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]], the attachment of a second soul to an individual, and [[Dybuk]], the exile of a soul.

==In Hasidism==

===Internalisation of Kabbalistic structures in dveikut===
[[File:Besht Siddur.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Prayer book of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], founder of [[Hasidism]]. Hasidic interpretation of [[Kabbalah]] left aside previous focus on structures, such as gilgulim, seeking their internalisation in daily life. Hasidic prayer formed new practices of [[Jewish meditation]] in [[dveikut]]]]
[[Lurianic Kabbalah]] focuses on the process of ''gilgulim'', as it forms the microcosmic parallel to macrocosmic rectification of Creation. In the elite circles of Kabbalistic scholars, it becomes beneficial to helping achieve rectification for a person to identify their particular spiritual ''gilgulim''.

18th-century Hasidism sought to democratise and popularise the Jewish mystical tradition, so that the common folk could be invigorated by Judaism's inner dimensions. It sought the internalisation of abstract Kabbalistic metaphysics into personal perception and fervour ([[dveikus]]), by relating the structures of Kabbalah to their inner psychological relevance in man. Because ''gilgul'' forms part of the elaborate, abstract structure of the processes of redemption in Kabbalah, it was therefore sidelined in Hasidic Judaism. Hasidism believed in the Kabbalah and ''gilgul'' as authoritative, but left aside the focus in Jewish worship and [[Jewish meditation|meditation]] on the structures, meditations and metaphysical processes, to look to the inner Godliness within everything. Hasidic [[panentheism]] devotes itself to [[dveikus]] (attachment) to the Divine Omnipresence. In this [[Mysticism|inner path]], identification of one's past ''gilgulim'' becomes external, and a diversion from inner ''Bittul'' (self nullification). To identify one's particular spiritual tasks could introduce a refined level of egotism, while acting purely from [[dveikus]] to God would be a higher, essential soulful Jewish worship. The Hasidic figure of the [[Rebbe#Relationship of .E1.B8.A5asidim to their rebbe|tzadik]] ([[Rebbe#The .E1.B8.A4asidic Rebbe|Hasidic Rebbe]]), to which the followers would flock, was believed to know the particular past ''gilgulim'' of each person who came to them, through their [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities, and the future destiny of each person. However, in Hasidic thought, they would not directly reveal this information in private consultation, as for the follower to know the tasks would introduce self-centredness, and Divine "help from Above". Through its Divine Service, Hasidism sought to make Divinity revealed "from Below" to fulfil the Ultimate purpose of Creation. Nonetheless, the Tzadik would give assistance and special advice that would both help the follower to achieve their tasks, yet also preserve the full soulfulness "from Below" of the common person's Divine service.

===Ascending stages in the history of Jewish mysticism===
{{Main|Kabbalah|Hasidic philosophy}}
In the history of Jewish mysticism, this Hasidic approach to gilgul corresponds to the third of three successive stages of perception and relation to Divinity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages.htm Three stages in the development of Jewish mysticism] from inner.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the three ascending categories of existence taught by the [[Baal Shem Tov]]: [[Four Worlds|Worlds]] ("Olamot"-External spiritual vessel forms), Souls ("Neshamot"-Internal spiritual lights), Divinity ("Elokut"-Essential Godliness).

===Descent of the Generations in Halachic scholarship===
{{Main|Yeridat ha-dorot}}
Traditional Judaism views latter generations to be spiritually inferior and lower than former generations. This belief, called [[Yeridat ha-dorot]] ("Descent of the generations"), shapes the development of traditional Jewish thought. In [[Talmud]]ic commentary and [[Halachah]] it means that latter authorities in the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Eras of Rabbinic Judaism]] generally do not disagree with authorities from a previous era. The basis of this is two-fold. In the historical chain of transmission of Judaism from generation to generation, a latter generation is further removed from the original Revelation of the Torah on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Halachic authorities of a subsequent generation would avoid disagreeing with the preceding Halachic authorities, since to reach them, the chain of Torah transmission is longer and more vulnerable to mistaken recollection. This applies until the [[Oral Torah]] was written down in the Talmud, where the [[Amoraim]] Sages of the [[Gemara]] commentary do not disagree with the earlier [[Tannaim]] Sages of the [[Mishna]]. Accordingly, the Mishnaic [[Pirkei Avot]] begins with a historical account of the chain of Oral Torah transmission from Moses, until it became written down in the Mishna. Once the [[Oral Torah]] was written down in the Talmud and its commentaries, the principle still applies for a second reason. While Halachah adapts itself to new technological innovations, the principles behind it are held to be foundational. Latter authorities are less qualified to define the fundamental parameters of Halachah.

===Lower levels of souls in latter generations===
{{See also|Isaac Luria#His teachings}}
This belief in Descent of the Generations is believed in the [[world view]] of Orthodox Judaism, which traditionally based itself around Talmudic scholarship. However, the ascending levels from generation to generation in Jewish mysticism described above, an opposite pattern to the Descent of Generations, are not so well known in contemporary Orthodoxy. This is because Jewish mysticism is less understood by regular Orthodox Jews, especially outside of the mystical Hasidic Movement. Within Hasidism as well, scholarly understanding of the meaning of [[Hasidic philosophy]] in relationship to historical [[Kabbalah]], is more restricted to certain [[Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic groups]] over others. The three ascending stages in Kabbalistic paradigm, listed above, do not contradict the wider belief of Descent of the Generations. Kabbalah gives its own metaphysical reason for the generational descent. In Kabbalistic theology, latter generations possess lower souls than former generations. The level of a soul in Kabbalah only refers to its revealed form, while all the souls are rooted in the same sources. A lower soul means that it's spiritual power became greatly constricted as it descended the [[Seder hishtalshelus|Chain of Worlds]] to reach this World. Accordingly, the possessor of the soul has much more limited spiritual capabilities. In the last generations before the [[Mashiach|Messiah]], the souls come from the lowest levels, even though they are gilgulim of higher souls from earlier generations. This gives the Kabbalistic interpretation of the last generations when the "Heels (footsteps) of the Messiah" are perceptible. This Talmudic phrase becomes in Kabbalah, the generations of souls that correspond in the Man-metaphor of the [[Sephirot]] to the lowest level of the "heels" of the feet. This need however not be considered a disadvantage, as in Hasidic thought, which sought inner nullification to God in [[dveikus]], lower souls worship God with more self-sacrifice and innermost sincerity, because they act without great knowledge and fulfilment of ego. Their Divine service is able to bring the Messiah because of their devoted essential soulfulness.

===Ascending mystical revelations of select Tzadikim===
{{See also|Tzadik}}
In Jewish mystical thought, the descent of generations applies even more because of this metaphysical explanation. Within scholarship it applies to Halachah and Talmudic commentary because of the simple historical explanations. However, within Lurianic mysticism the opposite progressive ascendency still applies. The reason for this is because this 16th century Kabbalistic dimension of Jewish thought is innovated only by the greatest [[Tzadik]]im (saintly souls) in history, the rarest of whom are unaffected by descending generational soul levels. A ''Tzadik'' in early 19th century Chabad philosophy, as defined by the [[Tanya]] (c. 1814), is a truly elevated soul, unaffected by physical limitations. The rarest such Tzadikim in history, who teach new revelations in Kabbalistic thought, are considered apart from general (traditional) Tzadikim. To them is applied in Kabbalah the verse from Psalms, "The [traditional] Tzadik is the foundation of the World". 16th century Lurianic Kabbalah and 18th century Hasidic philosophy make radical statements about this believed supreme level of ''Tzadik''. In the Kabbalistic worldview, their new revelations in Jewish mystical thought advance the conceptual frontiers of Kabbalah from generation to generation. Therefore, while in Halachah (Jewish Law), scholarship ability decreases in each generation, in 16th century Lurianic, 18th century Hasidic, and 19th century Chabad philosophy, mystical thought is said to ascend through history. This ascent applies to Jewish mystical thought, the "Inner Torah" (''Nistar''-"Concealed") of [[Kabbalah]], rather than the "Revealed Torah" (''Nigleh''-"Revealed") of [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]], [[Midrash]], [[Talmud]], [[Halachah]] and Medieval [[Jewish philosophy]]. The reason for this is because in Nigleh, scholarship involves discovering new and deeper interpretations of previous revealed Biblical and Rabbinic texts. In Lurianic Kabbalah, advance is made by new doctrines and individual revelations that transcend previous descriptions. "Revealed" ''Nigleh'' corresponds to the collaborative scholarly ascent "from Below" of human intellect up to God. "Concealed" ''Nistar'' corresponds to privately drawing down new revelations of Divine intellect "from Above", down into the human intellect of one individual. This is also a philosophy, as the difference between [[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]] ("Prophecy") and Kabbalah ("Received"), is that Lurianic Kabbalah becomes articulated conceptually in intellectual structures, in which allegedly lays its supremacy over [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah is seen as the union of Chochmah (Wisdom) and Nevuah (Prophecy): [http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/five-stages-historical-development-kabbalah.php]. From www.inner.org. Retrieved Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascending lights, descending vessels in history===
{{Main|Ohr}}
This paradoxical [[dialectic]] is explained more generally in Hasidic thought as part of the divine cosmic plan of Kabbalistic [[Ohr|Lights]] and [[Ohr|Vessels]]. In each subsequent generation, the external levels of creation and this world ("vessels") descend to a lower level. This enables the difference between purity and impurity to become revealed, clarified and redeemed. At the same time, "In every generation a new, higher light descends from on High"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Habad]] Hasidic texts regarding the new, higher light that descends each year on [[Rosh Hashanah]], with the blowing of the [[Shofar]]&lt;/ref&gt; to transform this World. This inner revelation ascends progressively to prepare for, and give a foretaste of the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]]. In the future era, the constant, inner elevation of existence, the mystical purpose of creation, will be revealed, as the messianic revelations of divinity are created through the present service of God from below. In kabbalistic terminology this dialectic is also related to the "masculine waters" of "direct light" from above, and the "feminine waters" of "reflected light" from below. This explains the mystical concept in Hasidic interpretation of Kabbalah that in the messianic era, the feminine in creation will become the ascendant, and similarly the body will give life to the soul, the opposite of the present reality.

The ultimate purpose of any spiritual descent in Kabbalah is "only in order to reach a higher spiritual ascent", than the original level at the start. In the Hasidic explanation of individual [[Divine providence (Judaism)|Divine providence]], all that occurs for every individual is a concealed part of this ultimate ascent. In its inner interpretation, the descent, such as a spiritual fall, is itself the concealed beginning of the true divine ascent. According to this Hasidic explanation, sin is an opportunity for mystical [[dveikus]] (fervour) in [[Teshuvah]] (Return to God). This expression of divine compassion excludes any misinterpretation of Jewish reincarnation as a fatalistic process of reward and punishment.

==Identification of Gilgulim of historical figures==

===Outline of Jewish genealogy of nations===
Traditional [[Judaism]] describes [[Abraham]] as the first Jew. With his son [[Isaac]], and grandson [[Jacob]], they are described as the "Fathers" of the Jewish people, and their wives, [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]] are the "Mothers". These terms take on Kabbalistic meanings by being associated with some of the different [[Sephirot]] (Divine emanations). It was [[Moses]], in traditional Judaism, who later received the teachings of Judaism at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], embodied in the [[Torah]] and [[613 mitzvot]]. The other "Nations of the World", counted as 70 roots from [[Noah]], are given the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] for spiritual redemption, and do not need to convert to Judaism, in Jewish thought, to fulfil the [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]] purpose of Creation, or private salvation.

===Associations of particular figures with their reincarnations in Judaism===
{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=October 2009}} 
* [[Chaim ibn Attar]] in his classic [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commentary on the Torah]] identifies [[Moses]] as the ''gilgul'' of [[Abel]], and [[Rabbi Akiva]] as the ''gilgul'' of [[Cain]].

[[File:Kesavyismach1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Famous Jewish [[amulet]] attributed to [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moshe Teitelbaum of Ujhel]]. While Hasidism sidelined gilgulim and Kabbalistic [[Kavanot]], Hasidic Rebbes could follow these areas, without it externalising their inner [[dveikut]]]]
* The Hasidic [[Rebbe]], [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moshe Teitelbaum of Ujhel]] (1759–1841), who was one of the founders of Hasidism in Hungary, told his followers that he had been reincarnated three times, which he recalled. His first gilgul was as a sheep in the flock of the Biblical Patriarch [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah teaches that the sheep of Jacob, who founded the 12 tribes of the Jewish people, comprised the future souls of Israel&lt;/ref&gt; He sang to his followers the song, he said, that Jacob sang in the pastures. His second gilgul was in the time of [[Moses]], and his third gilgul, which he did not disclose out of humility, was in the time of the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] in Jerusalem. His followers asked another Hasidic Rebbe, who identified the third gilgul as the Biblical Prophet [[Jeremiah]]. In Hasidic history, his daily life especially reflected a yearning for the building of the [[Third Temple]] with the arrival of the [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. In his later days he wore his Shabbat clothing the entire week, anticipating the Messiah's arrival.
* The contemporary scholar of Kabbalah and Hasidut, [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], identifies [[Isaac Newton]] as the modern reincarnation of [[Noah]] on his website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/archive.htm From Noah's Rainbow to Isaac Newton's Prism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719094714/http://www.inner.org/archive.htm |date=2009-07-19 }} at www.inner.org. Retrieved October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He uses [[gematria]] in this identification, but also describes associations that run deeper. In the commentary of the [[Zohar]] on the story of Noah's flood, the Zohar gives a prediction that in the latter part of the 6th millennium in the [[Hebrew calendar]] dating system (the secular years 1740-1840), a great increase in "Wisdom (In the flood: water) from Above, and Wisdom (Bilically: water) from Below" will be revealed to prepare for the 7th [[Mashiach|Messianic]] millennium. If the generation of Noah had been worthy, their flood would have taken the form of wisdom rather than destructive water. This predicted expansion of Torah wisdom ("from Above") and Secular Wisdom and Science (from "Below") was instead delayed until the 6th millennium. This interpretation ties Newton, the founding forerunner of Modern Science, with Biblical Noah. Additionally, Newton rejected [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] ideas in favour of Old Testament Monotheism, a more complete expression of the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. He devoted his scholarly activity as much to esoteric calculations of [[Bible Code]]s and the [[Third Temple]], of which Noah's Ark is seen in Jewish commentary as the spiritual prototype, as much as to Mathematics and Physics. His [[Newtonian physics]] defined the mechanistic philosophy of Science until modern Physics broke it, analogous to "Wisdom from Above" superseding "Wisdom from Below". Additionally, the Seven Colours of Newton's prism split light are the Jewish symbol for the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. Yitzchak Ginsburgh uses this Kabbalistic identification to support his articulation of the inner Kabbalistic meaning of the Noahide Laws, which have both outer legislation in [[Halachah]], and inner meaning in [[Kabbalah]]. Their inner meaning helps fulfil the eschatological role of each [[Noahide Campaign|Righteous Noahide]] in the Jewish Messianic description of Universal Redemption for all Nations of the World.

'''Hadji Ali''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1887–92&amp;nbsp;– November&amp;nbsp;5, 1937){{Cref2|note 1}} was a [[vaudeville]] performance artist, thought to be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by [[kerosene]], and then acting by turns as a human [[flamethrower]] and [[fire extinguisher]] as he expelled the two liquids onto a [[Theatrical property|theatrical prop]]. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.

Although he never gained wide fame, Ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for heads of state including Tsar [[Nicholas&amp;nbsp;II of Russia]]. [[Judy Garland]] named him her favorite vaudevillian and [[David Blaine]] identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the [[short film]] ''Strange as It Seems'' (1930) and in ''Politiquerias'' (1931), the Spanish-language version of [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s ''[[Chickens Come Home]]''. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from ''Politiquerias'': 1977's ''Gizmo!'', and 1999's ''Vaudeville''. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to [[Johns Hopkins University]] for study, though the offer was declined.

==Background==
Hadji Ali was born into a working-class family&lt;ref name="Bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]]|location=Rockhampton, Qld|title=The Man Who Has Jonah Beaten|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55959729|date=November 16, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; in approximately 1887&lt;ref name="Daily Express"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/|format=fee required|title=The Man Who Could Swallow Anything Dies|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|location=London|date=November 18, 1937|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1892,&lt;ref name="Felton" /&gt; depending on the source consulted,{{Cref2|note 1}} probably in [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]].{{Cref2|note 2}} His fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a "[[regurgitation act]]", involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D.

He explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at [[Mount Saint Mary's Hospital|St. Mary's Hospital]] in [[Niagara Falls]], New York, in May&amp;nbsp;1926, that while swimming in the [[Nile]] as a ten-year-old boy, he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a [[Whale#Blowhole(s)|whale spouting]]. He continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurses and Doctors Witness a Stomach Freak at Hospital|newspaper=The Niagara Falls Gazette|location=Niagara Falls, NY|page=2|date=May 26, 1926|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%208/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette%201926%20Apr-Jun%20Grayscale/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette%201926%20Apr-Jun%20Grayscale%20-%200442.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=5b87fb52&amp;DocId=6659352&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=1e7+1e8+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more dramatic version of these events was provided by Ali's daughter, Almina Ali, in an interview in England after his death. She stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident: while bathing in the Nile, he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water. Instead of dying, as those present thought he might, Ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect.&lt;ref name="Gleaner"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=154073877|format=fee required|title=The Man Who Could Swallow Anything|newspaper=The Gleaner|location=Kingston, Jamaica|date=December 11, 1937|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cref2|note 3}}

Ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other&amp;nbsp;... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers.&lt;ref name="Bulletin" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for [[music hall]] performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar [[Nicholas&amp;nbsp;II of Russia]] to perform at the [[Winter Palace]] in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions."&lt;ref name="Bulletin" /&gt; Following [[World War I]], Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.&lt;ref name="Bulletin" /&gt;

==Performance==

The mainstay of Ali's act was "water spouting". After swallowing large amounts of water, 60 to 100 glasses at a time,&lt;ref name="Naugatuck"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=65590314|format=fee required|title=Amusements: At Palace|newspaper=Naugatuck Daily News|location=Naugatuck, CT|date=September 28, 1926|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time, sometimes approaching one minute.&lt;ref name="Sheboygan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=4465536|format=fee required|title=Hadji Ali, Egyptian Mystic, to Appear at Sheboygan Theatre|newspaper=The Sheboygan Press|location=Sheboygan, WI|date=December 21, 1928|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled [[hazelnut]]s (although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=65590314|format=fee required|title=Amusements: At Palace|newspaper=Naugatuck Daily News|location=Naugatuck, CT|date=September 28, 1926|page=5}}&lt;p&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=147046854|format=fee required|title=Hadji Ali Headliner at Electric First Half|newspaper=Joplin Globe|location=Joplin, MS|date=September 28, 1928|page=22}}&lt;p&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=12309435|format=fee required|title=World's Greatest Human Wonder, Hadji Ali|newspaper=The Bridgeport Telegram|location=Bridgeport, CT|date=September 17, 1926|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six [[handkerchief]]s of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.&lt;ref name="Naugatuck" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=12309435|format=fee required|title=World's Greatest Human Wonder, Hadji Ali|newspaper=The Bridgeport Telegram|location=Bridgeport, CT|date=September 17, 1926|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1929 article appearing in the ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|Lowell Sun]]'' newspaper, physician [[Morris Fishbein]] speculated that for Ali's nut feat, the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed, thus allowing him to produce it on cue. Dr. Fishbein also stated that unnamed "investigators" were convinced that for Ali's handkerchief stunt, to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience Ali flavored the cloth, and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up.&lt;ref name="Lowell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=61635285|format=fee required|title=Yes, Some human Beings Chew Their Cud, Just Like Cows|newspaper=The Lowell Sun|location=Lowell, Mass.|date=December 21, 1929|page=11|last=Fishbein|first=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali also swallowed live goldfish, watches, coins, [[costume jewelry]], paper money, peach pits, stones, live mice, buttons, [[Billiard ball|pool balls]] and other odd objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Were They Thinking?: Really Bad Ideas Throughout History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCONi-jjrnsC&amp;pg=PA92|last=Felton|first=Bruce|page=92|publisher=Lyons Press|year=2007|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=978-1-59921-132-9}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=8442425|format=fee required|title=Human Volcano is Appearing at the Strand|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|location=Oshkosh, WI|date=April 11, 1935|page=14}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=106942980|format=fee required|title=Palace Theater advertisement|newspaper=Evening Independent|location=Massilon, OH|date=August 18, 1928|page=11}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Book of Lists: The Original Compendium of Curious Information|last=Wallechinsky|first=David|author2=Amy Wallace|page=99|publisher=Canongate|year=2005|location=NY|isbn=978-1-84195-719-7}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite book|title=Oscar Asche, Orientalism, and British Musical Comedy|last=Singleton|first=Brian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rctWatwI84EC&amp;pg=PA75|page=75|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-97929-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another standard performance segment, he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling, he swallowed the smoke and, after a significant time had passed, issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=8442425|format=fee required|title=Human Volcano is Appearing at the Strand|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|location=Oshkosh, WI|date=April 11, 1935|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali's longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again, but this time followed by a pint of [[kerosene]].&lt;ref name="Naugatuck" /&gt; A [[Theatrical property|prop]] was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Book of Lists: The Original Compendium of Curious Information|last=Wallechinsky|first=David|author2=Amy Wallace|page=99|publisher=Canongate|year=2005|location=NY|isbn=978-1-84195-719-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; within which a small flame burned.&lt;ref name="Vaudeville" /&gt; Lighter than water and [[Miscibility|immiscible]] with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first.

Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away, extinguishing the fire.&lt;ref name="Naugatuck" /&gt;

{{quote box|quote=One can always hear a Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.

Not one of them can swallow three different handkerchiefs and then restore any one of the handkerchiefs called for. And it is questionable as to their ability to drink kerosene oil. Mr. Hadji Ali can do all of these things.|source=—''The Fredonia Censor'', May 2, 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%207/Fredonia%20%20NY%20Censor/Fredonia%20NY%20Censor%201927%20Dec-1928%20Nov%20Grayscale/Fredonia%20NY%20Censor%201927%20Dec-1928%20Nov%20Grayscale%20-%200257.pdf|title=Hadji Ali Does Amazing Feats|newspaper=The Fredonia Censor|location=Fredonia, NY|date=May 2, 1928|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=40%|fontsize=80%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quoted=2}}
At some performances, a panel or "jury" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no [[Magic (illusion)|trick]] mechanism was being employed—that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation.&lt;ref name="Sheboygan" /&gt; Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick. His stomach exposed by his standard costume, he invited audience members to pat his stomach, allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PuBAAAAMAAJ|title=Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater|last=Price|first=David|page=19|publisher=Cornwall Books|year=1985|location=NY|isbn=978-0-8453-4738-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One newspaper reported that Ali's feats, essentially controlled vomiting, were performed in "a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newpapers%20Disk2/Auburn%20NY%20Citizen/Auburn%20NY%20Citizen%201926%20pdf/Newspaper%20Auburn%20NY%20Citizen%201926%20-%200229.PDF|title=At the Jefferson|newspaper=The Auburn Citizen|location=Auburn, NY|date=April 21, 1926|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone felt the same: at least one of Ali's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act "was killing their supper shows".&lt;ref name="Felton" /&gt; Famed [[Escapology|escapologist]] and magician [[Harry Houdini]] remarked in his 1920 work ''Miracle Mongers and Their Methods'' that water spouting was a "performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miracle Mongers and Their Methods|last=Houdini|first=Harry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0u-YrUcJeMC&amp;pg=PA166|page=66|publisher=E.P.

The abilities of Ali fascinated the public and medical authorities.&lt;ref name="New Castle"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=57701794|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104084159/http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=57701794|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 4, 2013|format=fee required|title=Brings Dad's Body|newspaper=New Castle News|location=New Castle, PA|date=December 1, 1937|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in a 1928 ''[[The Sheboygan Press|Sheboygan Press]]'' article, at one of Ali's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance.

Ali's act was captured in two films: the 1930 [[Short film|short]] ''Strange as It Seems'', and ''Politiquerias'' (1931), the expanded Spanish-language version of [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s ''[[Chickens Come Home]]''.&lt;ref name="Felton" /&gt; Ali also had a [[bit part]] as the "Turkish landlord" in Warner Bros.' 1932 film ''[[Scarlet Dawn]]'' starring [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] and [[Nancy Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Movie Review: Scarlet Dawn (1932)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9A06E4DE1E31E333A25757C0A9679D946394D6CF|date=November 4, 1932|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|page=&lt;!-- not provided --&gt;|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from ''Politiquerias'': 1977's ''Gizmo!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Learned Pigs &amp; Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers|last=Jay|first=Ricky|page=299|location=NY|publisher=Villard Books|year=1986|isbn=978-0-374-52570-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1999's ''Vaudeville'', a documentary produced by [[KCTS-TV]] that exhibits 90 vaudeville acts over a two-hour running time.&lt;ref name="Vaudeville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=It's Back From the Wings: Vaudeville, Good and Bad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/tv/cover-story-it-s-back-from-the-wings-vaudeville-good-and-bad.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22hadji%20ali%22&amp;st=cse|date=November 23, 1997|last=Grimes|first=William|format=fee required|page=&lt;!-- not provided --&gt;|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary has since aired on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s ''American Masters'' series numerous times.&lt;ref name="Vaudeville" /&gt;

==Death==
Ali died on November&amp;nbsp;5, 1937, in [[Wolverhampton]], England, from [[heart failure]] during a bout of [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref name="Daily Express" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt; Even before his death, a rumor had circulated that the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] sought to procure Ali's stomach upon his death, and would pay as much as $50,000 for it. This claim appeared in a poster advertising Ali's impending appearance at a theater during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raffaelederitis.blogspot.com/2009/01/gifts-from-insects.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63quJYcLC?url=http://raffaelederitis.blogspot.com/2009/01/gifts-from-insects.html |title=Poster for a Hadji Ali performance at the Empire Stratford Theater |publisher=Raffaelederitis.blogspot.com |accessdate=December 11, 2011 |archivedate=December 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ali's death was reported, the rumor resurfaced as an active offer of $10,000.&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt; When a Rockefeller Institute manager was interviewed about the story, he said the offer had never been made but that nevertheless, "we should very much like to see the body."&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt; Almina and Julian transported Ali's body back to the United States on board the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]''.&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Castle" /&gt; According to a November&amp;nbsp;29, 1937 article in  the ''[[New York Post]]'', upon their arrival, Almina offered her father's body to [[Maryland]]'s [[Johns Hopkins University]] for investigation by surgeons, after which it would be transported to Egypt for interment in a mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Post|title=Harlem Eagle Guards Body of Prince With 2 Stomachs|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/New%20York%20Evening%20Post/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Post%201937%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Post%201937%20Grayscale%20-%206672.pdf|date=November 29, 1937|page=13|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Afro-American'' newspaper reported on December&amp;nbsp;11, 1937, that Johns Hopkins' officials had declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Afro-American (newspaper)|The Afro-American]]|title=Hospital Noes Julian's 2-Stomach Prince|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gRomAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mP0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5461,3817621&amp;dq=hadji-ali+johns-hopkins&amp;hl=en|date=December 11, 1937|page=4|location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}
{{Cnote2|note 1|A number of online and book sources give Ali's year of birth as 1892 or approximately 1892. However, Ali's daughter stated to reporters after her father's death in 1937 that "he was only forty-nine."&lt;ref name="Daily Express" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt; If Ali's daughter was correct about her father's age at the time of his death, he was born in 1887 or '88.}}

{{Cnote2|note 2|Ali's entry in ''Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'' speculates that "Hadji Ali" may have been an alias or a simplification of an unknown birth name, and that there was little proof he was actually from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Vaudeville" /&gt;}}

{{Cnote2|note 3|The ten years of age figure is attributed to an interview Ali gave to a [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'' while performing in Australia.&lt;ref name="Bulletin" /&gt; By contrast, after her father died, Almina Ali was quoted in ''[[Gleaner Company|The Gleaner]]'' as stating he had first learned of his abilities at ''seven'' years of age.&lt;ref name="Gleaner" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">'''John Chalkhill''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1600?) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]].

Two songs by him are included in [[Izaak Walton]]'s ''Compleat Angler'', and in 1683 appeared ''Thealma and Clearchus. A Pastoral History in smooth and easie Verse. Written long since by John Chalkhill, Esq., an Acquaintant and Friend of [[Edmund Spenser|Edmund Spencer]]'' (1683), with a preface written five years earlier by Walton.

Another poem, ''Aldilia, Philoparthens Loving Follie'' (1595, reprinted in vol. X of the ''Jahrbuch des deutschen Shakespeare-Vereins''), was at one time attributed to him. Nothing further is known of the poet, but a person with the same name is recorded as one of the coroners for [[Middlesex]] in the later years of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign.

[[George Saintsbury]], who included ''Thealma and Clearchus'' in vol. II of his ''Minor Poets of the Caroline Period'' (Oxford, 1906), points out a marked resemblance between Chalkhill's work and that of [[William Chamberlayne (poet)|William Chamberlayne]].

'''John Gray''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (died 17 July 1769) was a British mathematician.

As a young man he taught mathematics at [[Marischal College]], later Aberdeen University.&lt;ref name = LA/&gt;

He wrote ''"A Treatise on Gunnery"'', dedicated to the Duke of Argyll and published by William Innys (London) in 1731.&lt;ref name = LA&gt;https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/5846097_1418-gray-treatise-of-gunnery-1731-mathematics-first&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with [[Andrew Reid (writer)|Andrew Reid]] and others, he worked to produce a book of abridged ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' for 1720–1732; which was published by W. Innys and R. Manby in 1732.&lt;ref name=LBSO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146649623|title=John Gray Rector of Marischal College|publisher=Legacies of British Slave-ownership|accessdate= 15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1732 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, his application citation having described him as being of the Navy Office (or [[Navy Board]]), who were responsible for the construction and maintenance of  ships in the Royal Dockyards for the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=36&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27gray%27%29|title= Fellow details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1764 to his death he was [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|Rector of Marischal College]]. He died at his London home in 1769, having asked to be buried at Petersham next to his wife Elizabeth. He left estates in the West Indies to his nephews and 1000 acres to [[Gray's Inn]] of London.&lt;ref name=LBSO/&gt;

'''Kim Kyung-Jae''' (died 2002) is the first human being in history to die from literally playing a video game too much. According to publicly available English-speaking sources, he died of [[deep-vein thrombosis]] or [[deep-vein thrombosis|DVT]] after playing the [[Webzen]] video game [[Mu Online|Mu]] for 86 hours in [[Gwangju]], with pauses only to purchase cigarettes and to use the bathroom.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/asia-pacific/2499957.stm] Although no medical report is available in English, it is worth noting that prolonged immobility as well as vein condition are diatheses that increase the odds of contracting deep vein thrombosis.

[[File:Majestic Liberty Large.jpg|thumb|right|''Liberty Enlightening the World'', known as the [[Statue of Liberty]], was donated to the US by France and is an artistic personification of liberty.]]
Broadly speaking, '''liberty''' ([[Latin]]: ''Libertas'') is the ability to do as one pleases.&lt;ref&gt;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2005, Merriam-Webster, Inc, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-636-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In politics, liberty consists of the social, political, and economic freedoms to which all community members are entitled.&lt;ref&gt;"Each of those social and political freedoms which are considered to be the entitlement of all members of a community; a civil liberty." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy, liberty involves [[free will]] as contrasted with, [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fact of not being controlled by or subject to fate; freedom of will." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[theology]], liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties."&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom from the bondage or dominating influence of sin, spiritual servitude, worldly ties." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.&lt;ref name=mill1&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869)., "Chapter I: Introductory", ''On Liberty''. http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus liberty entails the [[duty|responsible]] use of freedom under the [[rule of law]] without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Freedom is more broad in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill one's desires. For example, a person can have the freedom to murder, but not have the liberty to murder, as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed.  Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.

The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as "[[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]"&lt;ref&gt;The Declaration of Independence, ''The World Almanac'', 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?article620&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Free will}}
Philosophers from earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (121–180 AD) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations", Book I, Wordsworth Classics of World Literature, {{ISBN|1853264865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679):&lt;blockquote&gt;"a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI).&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:

:"In the state of nature, liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society, liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus, freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: 'A liberty for everyone to do what he likes, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.' Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to (1) follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and (2) not be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and arbitrary wills of others."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Two Treatises on Government]]: A Translation into Modern English'', ISR, 2009, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|[[John Stuart Mill]].]]

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), in his work, ''[[On Liberty]]'', was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrooks, Logan Hart (2008) "Personal Freedom" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gxaa371USUC&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134] ''In'' Owens, William (compiler) (2008) ''Freedom: Keys to Freedom from Twenty-one National Leaders'' Main Street Publications, Memphis, Tennessee, p3–38, {{ISBN|978-0-9801152-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', [[Isaiah Berlin]] formally framed the differences between these two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: [[positive liberty]] and [[negative liberty]]. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from [[tyranny]] and the [[arbitrary]] exercise of [[authority]], while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Magna Carta]] (originally known as the Charter of Liberties) of 1215, written in iron gall ink on parchment in medieval Latin, using standard abbreviations of the period.

The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Junius P. (2007) ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A–K'' ; Vol. II, L–Z,&lt;/ref&gt; To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes).&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen, 2010, Democratic Freedom and the Concept of Freedom in Plato and Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt; That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it:

:"This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mikalson|first=Jon|title=Ancient Greek Religion|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405181778|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6xxlwbldcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=ancient+Greece+++rights+women&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Greece%20%20%20rights%20women|edition=2nd|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all [[religion]]s and [[ethnic group]]s were given the same rights and had the same [[freedom of religion]], women had the same rights as men, and [[slavery]] was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Henry Robertson, John Graham Merrills (1996).

In the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]], citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and [[equality before the law|equality]]. The need for tolerance on an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis can be found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]] of [[Ashoka the Great]], which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]] (1997). ''Human Rights and Asian Values''. {{ISBN|0-87641-151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]'':

[[Roman law]] also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]].  Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the [[nobility]], rarely by the common man.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

=== Social contract ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Eugène Delacroix]] – ''[[Liberty Leading the People|Liberty Leading the People (La liberté guidant le people)]]'' (1830)]]
[[File:French-Liberty-British-Slavery-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''French Liberty. British Slavery'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured French "liberty" as the opportunity to starve and British "slavery" as bloated complaints about taxation.]]
The [[social contract]] theory, most influentially formulated by [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]] (though first suggested by Plato in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''), was among the first to provide a political classification of [[rights]], in particular through the notion of [[sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]]. The thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[logic|reasoned]] that [[law]] governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the [[monarch|king]] his power, rather than the king's power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of [[Montesquieu]]. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on [[individualism|individual liberty]] as a fundamental reality, given by "[[Nature]] and [[God|Nature's God]]," which, in the [[utopia|ideal state]], would be as universal as possible.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'', [[John Stuart Mill]] sought to define the "...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual," and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes "how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control".&lt;ref name=mill1 /&gt;

==Origins of political freedom==

=== England and Great Britain ===
England and following the [[Act of Union 1707]] Great Britain, laid down the cornerstones to the concept of individual liberty.

In 1166 [[Henry II of England]] transformed English law by passing the [[Assize of Clarendon]] act. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Human Rights|url=https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/history-human-rights|publisher=Liberty|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215 the [[Magna Carta]] was drawn up, it became the cornerstone of liberty in first England, Great Britain and later, the world.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}}

In 1689 the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] grants 'freedom of speech in Parliament', which lays out some of the earliest [[civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher=British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled ''[[On Liberty]]'' argues for toleration and individuality. ''If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1859 |title= On Liberty |publisher=John W.Parker &amp; Son |place=London |edition= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AjpGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AHMraC_Owoi8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1864 |title= On Liberty |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman Roberts &amp; Green |place=London |edition= 3 |url= https://archive.org/details/onliberty00inmill |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', by [[Isaiah Berlin]], determines 'negative liberty' as an obstacle, as evident from 'positive liberty' which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Ian|title=''Positive and Negative Liberty''|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 British representatives attempt to and are prevented from adding a legal framework to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. (It was not until 1976 that the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Final authorized text''|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/universal-declaration-of-human-rights|date=September 1952|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

According to the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], all men have a natural right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the presence of slavery.  Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount, since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize.  The Supreme Court, in the [[Dred Scott]] decision, upheld this principle.  It was not until 1866, following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], that the US Constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that these rights were extended to women.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the United States of America, ''The World Almanac and book of facts'' (2012), pp. 485–86, Amendment XIV "Citizenship Rights not to be abridged.", Amendment XV "Race no bar to voting rights.", Amendment XIX, "Giving nationwide suffrage to women.". World Almanac Books, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-147-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices.  In the United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold v. Connecticut''. 381 U.S. 479 (1965) Decided June 7, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:
{{quote|I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but, as a practical matter, my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/a-culture-of-liberty_b_242402.html|title=A Culture of Liberty|date=21 July 2009|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty.  [[Liberalism|Liberals]] in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom.  [[Progressive Era|Progressives]] stress freedom from business monopoly as essential.  [[Libertarian]]s disagree, and see economic freedom as best.  The [[Tea Party movement]] sees big government as the enemy of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capitol Reader|title=Summary of Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto – Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuxEfI9GwcC&amp;pg=PP9|date=21 June 2013|publisher=Primento|isbn=978-2-511-00084-7|pages=9–10}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |last=Haidt |first=Jonathan |date=16 October 2010 |title=What the Tea Partiers Really Want |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703673604575550243700895762 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc |access-date=17 March 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald P.

=== France ===
France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, [[French Revolution|overthrew]] their own monarchy, with the cry of "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".  The bloodbath that followed, known as the [[reign of terror]], soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of [[conservatism]], wrote "The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. C. D., ''Edmund Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in France: a Critical Edition'', 2001, Stanford. pp. 66–67, {{ISBN|0-8047-3923-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

=== Liberalism ===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
According to the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', liberalism is "the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize [[freedom of choice]]".  But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals.  Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration.  Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return.  This idea of freedom is personal rather than political.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 1990, {{ISBN|1-56584-589-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', "Liberalism takes criticism from both the right and the left,...", p. 388, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19534334-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarianism ===
{{Main|Libertarianism|Minarchism|Libertarian Socialism|Anarcho-capitalism}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Libertarians]] hold liberty as their primary political value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libertarianism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339321/libertarianism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2014-05-20|quote=libertarianism, political philosophy that takes individual liberty to be the primary political value}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.&lt;ref&gt;David Kelley, "Life, liberty, and property." ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' (1984) 1#2 pp. 108–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Republican liberty ===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian [[Quentin Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume I: Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quentil Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume II:  The Values of Republicanism in Early Modern Europe'' Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the philosopher [[Philip Pettit]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pettit, ''Republicanism: a theory of freedom and government'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; one's liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one's actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], to be a ''liber homo'', a free man, means not being subject to another's arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite [[Machiavelli]] who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli, ''Discourses on Livy'', Harvey C. Mansfield &amp; Nathan Tarcov, translators, University of Chicago Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-226-50036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the [[English Civil War]] resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Socialism ===
{{Main|Socialism}}
{{Socialism sidebar}}
Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhargava|first= Rajeev |title= Political Theory: An Introduction |publisher= Pearson Education India|date=2008|isbn=|page = 255|quote=Genuine freedom as Marx described it, would become possible only when life activity was no longer constrained by the requirements of production or by the limitations of material scarcity…Thus, in the socialist view, freedom is not an abstract ideal but a concrete situation that ensues only when certain conditions of interaction between man and nature (material conditions), and man and other men (social relations) are fulfilled.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where "alienated labor" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodwin|first= Barbara |title= Using Political Ideas |publisher= Wiley|date=2007|isbn=978-0470025529|pages = 107–09|quote=Socialists consider the pleasures of creation equal, if not superior, to those of acquisition and consumption, hence the importance of work in socialist society.  Whereas the capitalist/Calvinist work ethic applauds the moral virtue of hard work, idealistic socialists emphasize the joy. This vision of 'creative man', Homo Faber, has consequences for their view of freedom...Socialist freedom is the freedom to unfold and develop one's potential, especially through unalienated work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marxism ====
{{Main|Marxism}}
For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a [[communist society]] characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx's emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the "realm of freedom", or discretionary free time, for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wood|first= John Cunningham |title= Karl Marx's Economics: Critical Assessments I |publisher= Routledge|date=1996|isbn=978-0415087148|pages = 248–49|quote=Affluence and increased provision of free goods would reduce alienation in the work process and, in combination with (1), the alienation of man's 'species-life'. Greater leisure would create opportunities for creative and artistic activity outside of work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Peffer|first= Rodney G. |title= Marxism, Morality, and Social Justice |publisher= Princeton University Press|date=2014|isbn= 9780691608884|page = 73|quote= Marx believed the reduction of necessary labor time to be, evaluatively speaking, an absolute necessity. He claims that real wealth is the developed productive force of all individuals. It is no longer the labor time but the disposable time that is the measure of wealth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural prerequisites==
Some authors have suggested that a virtuous culture must exist as a prerequisite for liberty. Benjamin Franklin stated that "only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of Benjamin Franklin 569 (Albert H. Smyth ed., 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Madison likewise declared: "To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of James Madison 223 (Gaillard Hunt ed., 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams acknowledged: "Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Howe, Jr., The Changing Political Thought of John Adams 165 (1966) (quoting from John Adams' "Reply to the Massachusetts Militia," Oct. 11, 1789).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Mills has said the idea was a deliberate ripoff of ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' after kids said they wanted to see that in a comic, and the concept of a computer brain as a partner was taken by [[John Wagner]] from [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Deathlok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thrill-Powered Overload! page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The name came from Doug Church while Mills, according to Church, came up with the acronym on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;Thrill-Powered Overload! page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==

Initially, M.A.C.H. 1 ("M.A.C.H." stands for "Man Activated by Compu-puncture Hyperpower") thematically resembled ''[[the Six Million Dollar Man]]'', but with more graphic violence. As the strip continued the tone became increasingly dark.  This contrasted directly with The Six Million Dollar Man, who began as a killer, but was progressively softened by the TV networks until it fitted into family entertainment.

===Plot===
John Probe is a [[British Secret Service]] agent at first engaging in missions against [[Second Red Scare|Communists]], [[terrorism|terrorists]] and [[organised crime]].  He has been given extreme physical enhancement by a method known as [[acupuncture|"compu-puncture"]] to give him "hyperpower" equivalent to the strength of fifty men, and computer circuitry imprinted onto his skull to control and advise on use of the hyperpower. The computer also grants him occasional mental skills, such as how to pilot aeroplanes, drive an armoured car, or specific scientific and military knowledge he would not normally possess. Probe eventually discovers that his superior, Denis Sharpe, had engineered the compu-puncture treatment which had given him his abilities so as to erase Probe's pre-augmented memory and to cause his death if he did not receive frequent treatments. As a result, Probe was forced to work for Sharpe.

Probe attempted to leave Sharpe and the service several times, but was forced to return for controlling hyperpower injections to prevent his energy flow from falling below survival level - although one story suggests that he has left Sharpe for an unspecified but considerable length of time.  Probe's computer would often attempt to overrule or counter his human emotions, but as the story wore on Probe became more and more resentful to both the computer and Sharpe's orders, often disobeying the computer's advice completely. Eventually, M.A.C.H. 1 killed Sharpe and then sacrificed himself to enable aliens, provoked into attacking Earth by Sharpe, to return home.  Probe's life before his compu-puncture treatment was never clarified or explained, and it was stated several times that the only person who knew anything about his prior life was Sharpe himself.

==Characters==
* '''John Probe''': A [[British Secret Service]] agent who volunteered for a special procedure whereby his physical strength, speed and agility would be enhanced using 'compu-puncture', a computerized form of [[acupuncture]] using multiple 'electro-needles'. His [[metabolism]] was controlled by a [[computer]] implanted in his [[Human skull|skull]], which also fed him tactical information such as the amount of strength or the exact throwing angle required for a given task.
* '''M.A.C.H. Zero''': M.A.C.H. 1 later met M.A.C.H. Zero, a prototype agent who had not been equipped with a computer implant and had consequently been driven insane by the uncontrolled hyperpower.  M.A.C.H. Zero later appeared in his own strip, involving a search for his son Tommy, based on a case of mistaken identity
* '''Tanya Maski''', an East European M.A.C.H. agent created after Sharpe sold the compu-puncture techniques to the Soviets. Maski had been created using inferior technology and although she possessed similar hyperpower to M.A.C.H. 1 would burn out much sooner.  Aware of this, she sacrificed herself to allow M.A.C.H. 1 to escape and confront Sharpe over his involvement.
* '''M.A.C.H. 2''' a robot successor to M.A.C.H. 1, created by Sharpe in order to remove the human element and perceived limitations from the M.A.C.H. project.  M.A.C.H. 1 fought M.A.C.H. 2, and was beaten, but managed to severely damage M.A.C.H. 2 during the fight.  Sharpe prevented M.A.C.H. 2 from killing M.A.C.H. 1, recognising that the human element - which was what enabled M.A.C.H. 1 to damage M.A.C.H. 2 - may still have use.

==Parodies==

===B.L.A.I.R. 1===

A spoof, entitled ''B.L.A.I.R. 1'', a satire on [[Tony Blair]], appeared in ''2000 AD'' in the late 1990s, and gained considerable media attention at the time. The story was not popular with readers, however, and was soon killed off.

*''B.L.A.I.R. 1'' (with art from [[Simon Davis (comics)|Simon Davis]]):
** "B.L.A.I.R. 1" (with [[David Bishop]]/[[Steve MacManus]], in ''2000 AD'' #1034, 1997)
** "Blair Force One" (with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], in ''2000 AD'' #1071-1074, 1997)
** "Criminal Record" (with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], in ''2000 AD'' #1084, 1998)
** "He Died with his Boots on" (with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], in ''2000 AD'' #1097-1098, 1998)

===Z.O.M.B.O.===

A second spoof ran in the 40th Anniversary Special: a fake 'original' version of the strip ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]'', dropped from the comic's original line-up. ''Z.O.M.B.O.'' parodied ''M.A.C.H. 1'', ''Invasion!'', and other 70s strip tropes with an over-the-top working class Zombo (playing the John Probe role) paired with an upper-class Etonian.

'''Takeda Oncology''', (originally '''Millennium Pharmaceuticals'''), is a biopharmaceutical company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. It is a fully owned subsidiary of [[Takeda Pharmaceutical]].

Takeda Oncology's [[research]], development and commercialization activities focused in two [[therapeutic]] areas: [[oncology]] and [[inflammation]] to develop a line of new product candidates. It was one of the first companies to systematically search for genes linked to disease,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; although none of the drugs which it is marketing or has in clinical trial, with one partial exception, have been the results of that research.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Shift Seen Atop Takeda Oncology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/business/29drug.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2005-06-29 |accessdate=2008-02-23 | first=Andrew | last=Pollack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly known for bringing [[bortezomib]] (marketed as [[Velcade]]) through clinical trials to approval for treatment of patients with [[multiple myeloma]] by the U.S. FDA, but has a growing clinical development [[sales pipeline|pipeline]] of other product candidates.

On May 14, 2008, Japanese company Takeda Pharmaceutical announced the completion of its acquisition of Millennium for US$25.00 per share in cash—a deal worth $8.8 billion. Takeda completed the acquisition through a tender offer and subsequent merger as a wholly owned subsidiary '''Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company''' - with the name being simplified to Takeda Oncology in 2013.

== History ==
Millennium was founded in 1993. In its early years, Millennium focused on building science and business teams. 
Beginning in 1994, Millennium created more than 20 strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These alliances provided Millennium with close to $2 billion of committed funding that was used to develop and enhance its pipeline.

A merger with Leukosite in 1999 brought the company its first drug close-to-market, [[Campath]]  (alemtuzumab) Injection, and additional investigational drugs in clinical trials.  In 2000, a merger with Cambridge Discovery [[Chemistry]] gave Millennium a strong presence in the United Kingdom and added to the organization more than 100 scientists with expertise in chemistry. In a strategic business decision, Campath was later sold to the Millennium partner for the drug, ILEX Oncology, which in turn was acquired by [[Genzyme]].

In February 2002, there was a further merger with COR Therapeutics—among the largest such mergers in the history of the biotech industry at that time. In addition to creating a strong pipeline of novel therapeutics, the merger added cardiovascular research and drug development to the company's other key therapeutic areas: oncology and inflammation. The merger also brought Integrilin ([[eptifibatide]]) Injection, an intravenous anti-[[platelet]] drug for patients with severe [[cardiovascular diseases]], into the Millennium fold. Millennium partnered with [[Schering-Plough]] on the development and marketing of Integrilin until 2005 when Millennium licensed the exclusive U.S. commercialization and development rights of Integrilin to Schering-Plough.

In May 2003 Velcade was launched for the treatment of relapsed and refractory [[multiple myeloma]] – a cancer of the blood.  At the time, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) granted approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma for patients who had not responded to at least two other therapies for the disease.  Velcade — the first FDA-approved [[proteasome]] inhibitor — reached the market in record time and represented the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved for patients with multiple myeloma.

In late December 2007, Millennium successfully submitted a supplemental new drug application ([[sNDA]]) to the FDA for Velcade for previously untreated multiple myeloma. The sNDA submitted to the FDA for this indication included data from the Phase III VISTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-05|url=http://investor.millennium.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=80159&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1052541&amp;highlight=|title=VELCADE as Initial Standard Therapy in multiple myeloma: Assessment with melphalan and prednisone |publisher=Millennium Corporate Communications }}&lt;/ref&gt; study, a large, well-controlled [[international]] clinical trial, comparing a Velcade-based regimen to a traditional standard of care. Priority review was granted by the FDA in January 2008.  On June 20, 2008, the FDA approved VELCADE in combination for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. This means that Millennium can market Velcade to patients who have not had any prior therapies for multiple myeloma (a first-line therapy).

In May 2008, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited purchased Millennium for $8.8 billion. Millennium was operating as an independent subsidiary, serving as the global center of excellence in oncology under its new name: "Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company". This global footprint includes oncology research and marketing strategy and oversight. In addition to Cambridge, MA, oncology resources include facilities in San Diego, San Francisco, Tsukuba and Osaka with Millennium as the global hub for this critical and rapidly expanding therapeutic area.

In summer 2013 the decision was made by Takeda to drop the "Millennium" brand effectively renaming the subsidiary into Takeda Oncology.
However, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc is still a legal holding of Takeda and its name is still used for on-going legal processes.

Velcade is the first oncology drug marketed and promoted by Millennium. Velcade was granted FDA approval little more than four and a half years after initiation of the first clinical trial. To discover and develop such treatments, the Company focuses on key molecular pathways that play crucial roles in underlying disease processes, and on identifying therapeutically significant differences that may exist among [[people]].  Takeda Oncology applies this approach broadly throughout its R&amp;D program to develop novel treatments not just for cancer but also for a number of other important diseases.

Velcade was co-developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development. Takeda is responsible for [[commercialization]] of Velcade in the U.S. and Janssen-Cilag is responsible for commercialization in Europe and the rest of the world. Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K. is responsible for commercialization in Japan. For a limited period of time, Takeda and Ortho Biotech. are co- promoting Velcade in the U.S. Approved in 85 countries, at least 85,000 patients have been treated with Velcade globally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6549">[[File:Neuromancer Brazilian cover.jpg|thumb|Molly Millions as depicted on the Brazilian cover of ''Neuromancer''.]]
'''Molly Millions''' (also known as '''Sally Shears''', '''Rose Kolodny''', and others) is a recurring character in stories and novels written by [[William Gibson]], particularly his [[Sprawl trilogy]]. She first appeared in ''[[Johnny Mnemonic]]'', to which she makes an oblique reference in ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (where she is mostly referred to as "Molly" with no last name given). Her most recent literary appearance was under the name "Sally Shears" in the book ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]''.

==Character history==
In all three stories, Molly is a physically tough (but not instantly imposing) bodyguard/mercenary [[cyborg]]. She is referred to as a "razorgirl" or "street samurai" throughout his stories and also as "Steppin' Razor" by the residents of Zion, a [[Rastafarian]] enclave aboard a space station.

A useful contact for dealing with gangs and black market elements, she tends to show little remorse for the opponents she ruthlessly dispatches in the course of her objectives. In fact she shows few deep emotions towards anyone outside of hatred, suspicion or amused contempt. Nevertheless, Molly is always regarded throughout the book as a loyal, morally strong character, opposed to the progressing decay of human relations in the world Gibson depicts.

An exception to her cold, somewhat cynical approach to life was her relationship with Johnny (of ''[[Johnny Mnemonic]]''), for whom she still mourned at the time of ''Neuromancer''. This is part of the personal history she relates to its protagonist, Case, in addition to the revelation that she worked as a "meat puppet" (a [[prostitution|prostitute]]) in a "puppet parlor" (a [[brothel]] where people loan out their bodies while maintained in a blanked-out state) to pay for her considerable cybernetic enhancements.

Another [[pseudonym]], used when she rents a hotel room in ''Neuromancer'', is "Rose Kolodny",  the name by which the [[Turing Police]] refer to her. The Turing Police may have simply gotten the name from the hotel's registry, but it is sometimes speculated to be her original name. The later trilogy books speculate that she is "SINless", having been an unrecorded birth and never having been issued a "Single Identity Number". This would give her the advantage of being more difficult to track in the cyberspace environment. Critic [[Larry McCaffery]] asserts that the name "Molly" is a reference to her status as a [[gun moll]].&lt;ref name="Storming"&gt;{{cite book | last = McCaffery | first = Larry | title = [[Storming the Reality Studio]] | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1168-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Gibson has stated that he derived inspiration for the character from the image of [[Chrissie Hynde]] on the [[Pretenders (album)|cover]] of the first [[The Pretenders|Pretenders]] album.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/statuses/13563814018 Twitter comment: "Key iconic for Molly was C. Hynde on first Pretenders album cover (...)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/statuses/13564306125 Twitter comment: "(...) Not so much CH per se, but this particular image."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Augmentations ==
Molly's metabolism, sensory input, and reflexes are artificially heightened by means of electronic implants and other advanced medical procedures. She has razor-sharp retractable blades underneath her fingernails, each double-edged and four centimeters in length. Appearing at first glance to be wearing mirrored sunglasses, Molly has in fact had her eye sockets sealed with vision-enhancing mirrored lenses, installed by the skilled black-market surgeons of [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba City]]. To accommodate the inset lenses her tear ducts have been re-routed to her mouth; on the very rare occasions she cries, she either spits out or swallows the tears. She never lets others touch the lenses as it would leave messy fingerprints requiring extra cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=William|authorlink=William Gibson|title=Burning Chrome (Johnny Mnemonic)|publisher=Arbor House|date=2003|location=New York City|id=Chrome|isbn=0-06-053982-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayal in other media ==
The 1995 film version of ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' replaced Molly with a character named Jane who did not have modifications to her eyes or to her fingers. Jane did share the modified nervous system but used a single razor attached to the tip of flexible spring rod as a weapon.

In the 2003 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''[[Neuromancer#Adaptations|Neuromancer]]'', Molly was played by the English [[actress]] [[Nicola Walker]]. [[Sasha Grey]] took on the role in ''Case'', a six-hour dramatic contemporary adaptation of the novel staged in [[New York City]] in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5403184/six-hours-of-william-gibsons-neuromancer-starring-sasha-grey-as-molly |title=Six Hours Of William Gibson's Neuromancer...

==History==
When the 92 giant sequoias in the valley were discovered and documented in 1852 by Augustus T.

At the time of the [[California Gold Rush]], people were searching California for undiscovered riches. As [[photography]] wasn’t developed enough yet to satisfy people’s curiosity, trees were felled and transported to big cities to prove their existence at great costs.{{sfn|Farmer|2013|page=12-}} In 1854 after unsuccessful exhibitions of the Discovery Tree, William Lapham, George L. Trask and George Gale set about to have the bark from the trunk of the Mother of the Forest removed, ready to be reassembled at exhibitions.

The removed sections of the bark were shipped by sea around [[Cape Horn]] to New York, where they were reassembled in 1855 in the shape of the tree for a "vegetable wonders of the gold regions" exhibition in the [[New York Crystal Palace]]. After New York, the bark was shipped in 1856 to London, where the sections accommodated by the building in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] attracted so much attention that all the sections were placed in their full length permanently in [[The Crystal Palace]] in London's Sydenham the next year.

The Mother of the Forest in Calaveras Grove did not survive for long once the bark had been removed. In 1856 the tree still had full foliage,&lt;ref name=excursion /&gt; but within five years no leaves remained. The plan for the remaining tree was to build a spiral staircase around the bare section and create a vista for visitors high up in the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New-York Daily Tribune |date=August 22, 1855 |page=6 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/1855-08-22/ed-1/seq-6/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchings’ 1886 book makes a mention of names and dates of visitors having been carved into the tree at different heights, especially at the top.{{sfn|Hutchings|1886|page=224}}

==Legacy==
Despite or due to the 1850s exhibitions, the destruction of the big trees was met with public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How a giant tree's death sparked the conservation movement 160 years ago |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jun/27/giant-tree-death-conservation-movement |last=Hickman |first=Leo |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2017 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, on introducing the bill that would become the [[Yosemite Grant]], senator [[John Conness]] opined that even after people had seen the physical evidence of the Discovery Tree and the Mother of the Forest, they still didn’t believe the trees were genuine, and that the areas they were from should be protected instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Congressional Globe |date=May 18, 1864|work=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774-1875 |url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=066/llcg066.db&amp;recNum=350 |page=2301 |quote=From the Calaveras grove some sections of a fallen tree were cut during and pending the great World’s Fair that was held in London some years since.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree and its environments were owned by several lumber companies around the turn of the century, with plans to cut the remaining trees down, as sequoia and giant sequoia with their thick trunks were seen as great sources of lumber at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|newspaper=The Strand Magazine |title=Timber Titans |last=Dollar |first=George |volume=14 |number=79 |date=July 1897 |url=https://archive.org/stream/TheStrandMagazineAnIllustratedMonthly/TheStrandMagazine1897bVol.XivJul-dec#page/n95/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again caused a chorus of public outcry by locals and [[conservation movement|conservationists]], and the area continued to be treated as a tourist attraction. The Yosemite protection was gradually extended to most sequoias,&lt;ref name="hartesveldt" /&gt; and Calaveras Grove was joined to [[California State Parks]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calaveras Big Trees |last=Kramer |first=Carol |date=2010 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MPdcyeVvr44C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Our National Park Policy: A Critical History |last=Isne |first=John |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Km2MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
To this day, what is left of Mother of the Forest stands as a large fire-blackened snag along the loop trail through the North Grove, at the far end of the loop.&lt;ref name=trailguide /&gt; Saw marks made when the bark was cut away are still visible on the trunk, which stands over 100 feet tall.

'''Naale Baa''' (English: "come tomorrow")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/ghosts-are-important/articleshow/50111340.cms|title= Ghosts are important|website=Indiatimes|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular folk legend which features prominently in areas across [[Karnataka]]. "Naale Baa" has been found written on walls of small towns and villages (Rural [[Bangalore]]) for years now. Villagers write this on walls to deter the entry of malevolent spirit into their homes. In some variations of the myth, the spirit is believed to be a bridal ghost who roams around the town in search of her husband. She is known to take away the man of the house who is often the sole earning member of the family, therefore, bringing bad luck to the entire household.

Naale Baa was an urban legend that went viral during the 1990s in [[Karnataka]]. The myth goes "a [[witch]] roams the streets in the night and knocks the door. The witch apparently speaks in voices of your kin so you would be deceived  to open the door. If you open it then you will die." So the residents came up with a smart idea of writing "Naale Baa" outside the doors and the walls of their house. So when the ghost reads it and it goes back to come again the next day and the cycle repeats.

==Origin==

The story of "Naale Baa"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/hey-lady-come-back-tomorrow_100461_blog|title=Hey Lady, Come Back Tomorrow!
|website=sulekha}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one that has been passed down from generations. This word of mouth cautionary tale, warns men of the villages not to roam alone in the night. This began after stories of men disappearing during a certain time of the year emerged in various parts of India. The villagers then stumbled upon the idea of inscribing variations of the term "naale baa bhoota",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/inothernews/bring-on-the-shivers/|title=15 Bizarre ‘True Stories’ From India That Will Keep You Up All Night
|website=Indiatimes|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which directly translates to "Ghost come tomorrow" or "O stree, repu raa" (hey lady, come back tomorrow) on the walls or doors after these mysterious disappearances.

There is no definite origin or proof of this tale, but superstition has lead villagers to still keep the tradition alive.

There was a renewed interest in her legend after reports of similar instances occurred in a village in [[Thailand]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5440191/Evil-widow-ghost-killing-young-men-Thai-village.html|title=Village forces its males to dress up as women after five healthy men die in their sleep, sparking fears the GHOST of an evil widow is taking her revenge|website=Dailymail|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein healthy young men began to disappear right under their beds in the night.

==Popular culture==
The 2018 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Stree (2018 film)|Stree]]'', starring [[Shraddha Kapoor]] and [[Rajkumar Rao]], is based on the 1990s Naale Baa tale from [[Karnataka]].

A '''nanobe''' is a tiny filamental [[structure]] first found in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sediment]]s.  Some scientists [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] that nanobes are the smallest form of [[life]], 1/10 the size of the [[Mycoplasma|smallest known]] [[Bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Nanjundiah2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nanjundiah | first =  V. | year = 2000 | title = The smallest form of life yet? | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–10 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF02985175 | pmid = 10824192 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uwins, Philippa, J. R.|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanobes.pdf|title=Novel nano-organisms from Australian sandstones|work= [[American Mineralogist]]| volume=83|pages=1541–1550|year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa Uwins ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes: About Philippa Uwins and the Discovery Team]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]]. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of [[oil exploration]] wells off Australia's west coast. Depths of retrieval were between {{convert|3400|m|mi|1}} and {{convert|5100|m|mi|1}} below the sea bed. While Uwins ''et al.'' present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are [[crystal]] growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to [[DNA]] might indicate that they are living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html "Nanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to the structures found in [[ALH84001]], a [[Mars meteorite]] found in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. 
Nanobes are similar in size to [[nanobacteria]], which are also structures that have been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused. Nanobacteria are thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or [[protocell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

{{unsourced section|date=July 2017}}

* It is a living organism (contains [[DNA]] or some analogue, and reproduces).
* Has a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] similar to [[Actinomycetes]] and [[fungi]].
* Nanobes are about 20 [[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter, which may be too small to contain the basic elements for an organism to exist (DNA, ribosomes, etc.), suggesting that if they grow and reproduce they would need to do so in an unconventional way.
* The [[Martian meteorite]] [[ALH84001]], discovered in 1984 in the [[Antarctic]], contained similar tubular structures which some [[astrobiology|astrobiologists]] suggested could be evidence of life at an earlier time on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McSween, H.

A review in ''Microbes and Environments''&lt;ref name=Velimirov2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velimirov, B. | year = 2001 | title = Nanobacteria, Ultramicrobacteria and Starvation Forms: A Search for the Smallest Metabolizing Bacterium | journal = Microbes and Environments | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–77 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-23 | doi = 10.1264/jsme2.2001.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the various ultra-small forms of proposed life states that the main criticism of nanobes is that they appear too small to contain the biochemical machinery needed to sustain life. The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper.&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998 /&gt; He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

'''Radial dysplasia''', also known as '''radial club hand''' or '''radial longitudinal deficiency''', is a congenital difference occurring in a longitudinal direction resulting in radial deviation of the wrist and shortening of the forearm. It can occur in different ways, from a minor anomaly to complete absence of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]], radial side of the carpal bones and thumb.&lt;ref name="Bednar"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bednar MS, James MA, Light TR |title= Congenital longitudinal deficiency. |journal= J Hand Surg |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages= 1739–47|year=2009 |pmid= 19896016 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypoplasia of the distal humerus may be present as well and can lead to stiffness of the elbow.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bates SJ, Hansen SL, Jones NF |title= Reconstruction of congenital differences of the hand. |journal= Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages= 128e-143e. |year=2009 |pmid= 19568146 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181a80777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radial deviation of the wrist is caused by lack of support to the carpus, radial deviation may be reinforced if forearm muscles are functioning poorly or have abnormal insertions.&lt;ref name="Netscher"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Netscher DT, Baumholtz MA |title= Treatment of congenital upper extremity problems. |journal= Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages= 101e-129e. |year=2007 |pmid= 17415231 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000258535.31613.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although radial longitudinal deficiency is often bilateral, the extent of involvement is most often asymmetric.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;

The incidence is between 1:30,000 and 1:100,000 and it is more often a [[sporadic mutation]] rather than an inherited condition.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; In case of an inherited condition, several syndromes are known for an association with radial dysplasia, such as the cardiovascular [[Holt-Oram syndrome]], the gastrointestinal [[VATER syndrome]] and the hematologic [[Fanconi anemia]] and [[TAR syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt; Other possible causes are an injury to the [[apical ectodermal ridge]] during upper limb development,&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; intrauterine compression, or maternal drug use ([[thalidomide]]).&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

==Classification==
Classification of radial dysplasia is practised through different models. Some only include the different deformities or absences of the radius, where others also include anomalies of the thumb and carpal bones. The Bayne and Klug classification discriminates four different types of radial dysplasia.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldfarb CA, Manske PR, Busa R, Mills J, Carter P, Ezaki M |title= Upper-extremity phocomelia reexamined: a longitudinal dysplasia. |journal= J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages= 2639–48|year=2005 |pmid= 16322613 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.02011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth type was added by Goldfarb et al. describing a radial dysplasia with  participation of the humerus.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt; In this classification only anomalies of the radius and the humerus are taken in consideration. James and colleagues expanded this classification by including deficiencies of the carpal bones with a normal distal radius length as type 0 and isolated thumb anomalies as type N.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;

Type N: Isolated thumb anomaly&lt;br /&gt;
Type 0: Deficiency of the carpal bones&lt;br /&gt;
Type I: Short distal radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type II: Hypoplastic radius in miniature&lt;br /&gt;
Type III: Absent distal radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type IV: Complete absent radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type V: Complete absent radius and manifestations in the proximal humerus

The term '''absent radius''' can refer to the last 3 types.

==Treatment==

===Splinting and stretching===
In cases of a minor deviation of the wrist, treatment by splinting and stretching alone may be a sufficient approach in treating the radial deviation in RD. Besides that, the parent can support this treatment by performing passive exercises of the hand. This will help to stretch the wrist and also possibly correct any extension contracture of the elbow. Furthermore, splinting is used as a postoperative measure trying to avoid a relapse of the radial deviation.&lt;ref name="Netscher" /&gt;

===Centralization===
More severe types (Bayne type III en IV) of radial dysplasia can be treated with surgical intervention. The main goal of centralization is to increase hand function by positioning the hand over the distal ulna, and stabilizing the wrist in straight position. Splinting or soft-tissue distraction may be used preceding the centralization.
In classic centralization central portions of the [[carpus]] are removed to create a notch for placement of the ulna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamb DW. |title= The treatment of longitdunal radial deficiency. |journal=Prosthet Orthot Int. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=100–3 |year=1991 |pmid=1923709  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach is to place the metacarpal of the middle finger in line with the ulna with a fixation pin.&lt;ref name="Bednar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

If radial tissues are still too short after soft-tissue stretching, soft tissue release and different approaches for manipulation of the forearm bones may be used to enable the placement of the hand onto the ulna. Possible approaches are shortening of the ulna by resection of a segment, or removing carpal bones.&lt;ref name="de Jong"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jong JP, Moran SL, Vilkki SK |title= Changing Paradigms in the Treatment of Radial Club Hand: Microvascular Joint Transfer for Correction of Radial Deviation and Preservation of Long-term Growth. |journal= Clin Orthop Surg. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=2012 |pmid=22379554 |doi=10.4055/cios.2012.4.1.36 |pmc=3288493}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ulna is significantly bent, osteotomy may be needed to straighten the ulna.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt; After placing the wrist in the correct position, radial wrist extensors are transferred to the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon, to help stabilize the wrist in straight position.&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; If the thumb or its carpometacarpal joint is absent, centralization can be followed by [[pollicization]]. Postoperatively, a long arm plaster splinter has to be worn for at least 6 to 8 weeks. A removable splint is often worn for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

Radial angulation of the hand enables patients with stiff elbows to reach their mouth for feeding; therefore treatment is contraindicated in cases of extension contracture of the elbow.&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; A risk of centralization is that the procedure may cause injury to the ulnar physis, leading to early epiphyseal arrest of the ulna, and thereby resulting in an even shorter forearm.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; Sestero et al. reported that ulnar growth after centralization reaches from 48% to 58% of normal ulnar length, while ulnar growth in untreated patients reaches 64% of normal ulnar length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sestero AM, Van Heest A, Agel J |title= Ulnar growth patterns in radial longitudinal deficiency. |journal= J Hand Surg Am. |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=960–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16843156 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews note that centralization can only partially correct radial deviation of the wrist and that studies with longterm follow-up show relapse of radial deviation.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manske PR, Goldfarb CA |title=Congenital failure of formation of the upper limb. |journal= Hand Clin. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=157–70 |year=2009 |pmid=19380058 |doi=10.1016/j.hcl.2008.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radialization===
[[Buck-Gramcko]] described another operation technique, for treatment of radial dysplasia, which is called radialization. During radialization the metacarpal of the index finger is pinned onto the ulna and radial wrist extensors are attached to the ulnar side of the wrist, causing overcorrection or ulnar deviation. This overcorrection is believed to make relapse of radial deviation less likely.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;

===Vascularized metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-joint transfer===
Villki reported a different approach in During this procedure a vascularised [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|MTP-joint]] of the second toe is transferred to the radial side of ulna, creating a platform that provides radial support for the wrist. The graft is vascularised and therefore maintains its ability to join the growth of the supporting ulna.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;

Prior to the actual transfer of the MTP-joint of the second toe soft-tissue distraction of the wrist is required to create enough space to place the MTP joint. When after several weeks enough space has been created through distraction, the actual transfer of the MTP joint can be initiated. During this surgical intervention the wrist and the second toe are prepared for transfer at the same time. The ipsilateral second toe MTP joint, together with its metatarsal arteries, its extensor and flexor tendons and its dorsal nerves to the skin, is harvested for transfer. The distal and middle phalanx of the toe are removed. The transferred toe, consisting of the metatarsal and proximal phalanx, is fixed between the physis of the ulna and the second metacarpal, or the scaphoid. 
The tendons of the toe are attached to those of the radial flexor and extensors muscles of the wrist to create more stability to the MTP joint. K-wires are placed to fixate the bones in the desired position. Once the bones are secured anastomosis are made between the vessels of the toe and the vessels of the forearm. After revascularization of the toe, the skin paddle is placed and the skin is closed.&lt;ref name="Vilkki"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vilkki SK. |title= Vascularized metatarsophalangeal joint transfer for radial hypoplasia. |journal= Semin Plast Surg |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=195–212 |year=2008 |pmid= 20567714 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1081403 |pmc=2884879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilkki et al. have conducted a study on 19 forearms treated with vascularized MTP-joint transfer with a mean follow-up of 11 years which reports an ulnar length of 67% compared to the contralateral side.&lt;ref name="Vilkki"/&gt; De Jong et al. described in a review that compared to study outcomes on centralization, Vilkki reported a smaller deviation postoperatively and a lower severity of the relapse.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;

A '''sandworm''' is a fictional creature that appears in the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' novels]] written by [[Frank Herbert]].

Sandworms are colossal worm-like creatures that live on the hot desert planet [[Arrakis]]. Arrakis is the only known source in the Universe of the spice [[Melange (fictional drug)|''melange'']], a drug highly prized for its medicinal and psychotropic properties. ''Melange'' deposits are found in the sand seas of Arrakis, where the sandworms live and hunt. Sandworms will attack anyone who attempts to extract ''melange'' from the sand, and some are large enough to swallow harvesting vehicles whole.  Most people accept sandworms as an inevitable hazard of ''melange'' harvesting, because they are nigh-indestructible and ''melange'' is in fact a byproduct of their life cycle.  The natives of Arrakis (the [[Fremen]]) regard them as sacred.

==Conception==
[[File:sandworm_analog_jan_1965.png|right|thumb|One of the earliest illustrations of a sandworm, by [[John Schoenherr]] ([[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']], Jan 1965)]]

The sandworms in ''Dune'' were inspired by the [[European dragon|dragons of European mythology]] that guard some sort of treasure. Favorites of Herbert included [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon in ''Beowulf'']] which guarded a hoard of gold, and the dragon of Colchis which guarded the [[Golden Fleece]] from [[Jason]].&lt;ref&gt;FH: And I made it, classically, the archetypal black beast, the one who lives underground in the cavern, with the gold.&lt;br/&gt;
WM: I see. OK., right. Well, this is the dragon of Beowulf, who lives in the cave.&lt;br/&gt;
FH: Yes.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;mdash;{{cite AV media |title=Unpublished interview with Frank Herbert and Professor Willis E. McNelly |date=1969 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7muoTaCpY |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DreamerOfDune&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Herbert|year=2003|title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429958448|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like these dragons, the sandworms of Arrakis "guard" the ''melange'' deposits and are a perpetual hazard for those who wish to harvest this treasure. In the novels, the sandworms are occasionally referred to as "dragons of the desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Herbert|year=1976|title=Children of Dune|quote=&lt;br/&gt;'My vision', he said. 'Unless we restore the dance of life here on Dune, the dragon on the floor of the desert will be no more.' Because he'd used the Old Fremen name for the great worm, she was a moment understanding him. Then: 'The worms?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plot of Herbert's 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', sandworms provide the danger and mystery of ''[[terra incognita]]'', and the transformational experience that the protagonist [[Paul Atreides]] must go through to triumph over his enemies. Herbert believed great power and knowledge must come at some sort of price, and so Paul must risk being devoured by a sandworm and then madness after consuming sandworm extract (the Water of Life).&lt;ref name=sandwormsofdune&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Sandworms of Dune (1977 essay) |first=Frank |last=Herbert |date=1987 |title=The Maker of Dune:Thoughts of a Science Fiction Master |editor-first1=Tim |editor-last1=O'Reilly |isbn=0425097854 |publisher=[[Berkley Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The elements of any mythology must grow from something profoundly moving, something which threatens to overwhelm any consciousness which tries to confront the primal mystery. Yet, after the primal confrontation, the roots of this threat must appear as familiar and necessary as your own flesh. For this, I give you the sandworms of Dune. [...] the extension of human lifespan cannot be an unmitigated blessing. Every such acquisition requires a new consciousness. And a new consciousness assumes that you will confront dangerous unknowns &amp;mdash; you will go into the deeps.|Frank Herbert&lt;ref name=sandwormsofdune/&gt;}}

To escape the notice of the sandworms, a traveller in the desert must learn to "walk without rhythm", because sandworms mistake rhythmic vibrations in the sand for prey (i.e. smaller sandworms).  This element comes from Frank Herbert's experiences as a hunter and fisherman. He knew how to mask his presence from prey by techniques such as approaching from downwind and treading lightly.&lt;ref name="DreamerOfDune"/&gt;

[[John Schoenherr]] provided the earliest artwork for the ''Dune'' series, including the illustrations in the initial pulp magazine serial and the cover of the first hardcover edition. Frank Herbert was very pleased with Schoenherr's art,&lt;ref&gt;"You can imagine my surprise to learn that John Schoenherr, one of the world's most foremost wildlife artists and illustrators, had been living in my head with the same images. People find it difficult to believe that John and I had no consultations prior to his painting of the Dune illustrations. I assure you that the paintings were a wonderful surprise to me."&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Excerpt from ''Dune Genesis'', an essay by Frank Herbert in ''Omni Magazine'' (July 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked that he was "the only man who has ever visited Dune".&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (Viking, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Schoenherr gave the sandworm three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth.  This design was referenced for the sandworm puppets that appeared in the [[Dune (film)|1984 movie adaptation of ''Dune'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/04/28/dune-sandworms-arrakis/|title=Sandworms of Arrakis|date=April 28, 2014|publisher=MonsterLegacy.net|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Sandworms are animals similar in appearance to colossal terrestrial [[annelids]] and in other ways to the [[lamprey]]. They are cylindrical worm-like creatures with a fearsome array of [[crystalline]] teeth that are used primarily for rasping rocks and sand. During his first close encounter with a sandworm in ''Dune'', Paul notes, "Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter ... crystal teeth with the curved shape of [[crysknife|crysknives]] glinting around the rim ... the bellows breath of [[cinnamon]], subtle [[aldehyde]]s ... [[acid]]s ..."&lt;ref name="Dune"&gt;[[Frank Herbert|Herbert, Frank]] (1965). ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. {{ISBN|0-441-17271-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandworms are described as "incredibly tough" by [[Liet-Kynes]], who further notes that "high-voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment" is the only known way to kill and preserve them; [[atomics (Dune)|atomics]] are the only explosive powerful enough to kill an entire worm, with conventional explosives being unfeasible as "each ring segment has a life of its own".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune''. "High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm," Kynes said. "They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They're incredibly tough."&lt;/ref&gt; Water is poisonous to the worms,&lt;ref name="Shai-Hulud"/&gt; but is in too short supply on Arrakis to be of use against any but the smallest of them.

The [[canon (fiction)|quasi-canonical]] ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia|Dune Encyclopedia]]'' invents a scientific name for the sandworm: ''Geonemotodium arraknis'' (also ''Shaihuludata gigantica'').

==Life cycle==
Herbert notes in ''Dune'' that microscopic creatures called '''sand plankton''' feed upon traces of [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] scattered by sandworms on the Arrakeen sands.&lt;ref name="Appendix I"&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', ''Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune''.&lt;/ref&gt; The sand plankton are food for the giant sandworms, but also grow and burrow to become what the Fremen call '''Little Makers''', "the half-plant-half-animal deep-sand vector of the Arrakis sandworm".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', ''Terminology of the Imperium'' (Little Maker).&lt;/ref&gt;

Their leathery remains previously having "been ascribed to a fictional {{'}}'''sandtrout'''{{'}} in Fremen folk stories", Imperial Planetologist [[Pardot Kynes]] had discovered the Little Makers during his ecological investigations of the planet, deducing their existence before he actually found one.&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt; Kynes determines that these "sandtrout" block off water "into fertile pockets within the porous lower strata below the 280° ([[thermodynamic temperature|absolute]]) line",&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt; and [[Alia Atreides]] notes in ''[[Children of Dune]]'' that the "sandtrout, when linked edge to edge against the planet's bedrock, formed living cisterns".&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;Herbert, Frank (1976). ''[[Children of Dune]]''. {{ISBN|0-399-11697-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fremen themselves protect their water supplies with "predator fish" that attack invading sandtrout.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Sandtrout can be lured by small traces of water, and Fremen children catch and play with them; smoothing one over the hand forms a "living glove" until the creature is repelled by something in the "blood's water" and falls off.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

{{quote|The sandtrout ... was introduced here from some other place. This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet ... and they did it to survive. In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase.|[[Leto II Atreides]], ''[[Children of Dune]]''&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;}}

The sandtrout are described as "flat and leathery" in ''Children of Dune'', with [[Leto II Atreides]] noting that they are "roughly diamond-shaped" with "no head, no extremities, no eyes" and "coarse interlacings of extruded [[Cilium|cilia]]".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; They can find water unerringly, and squeezing the sandtrout yields a "sweet green syrup".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; When water is flooded into the sandtrout's excretions, a [[pre-spice mass]] is formed; at this "stage of fungusoid wild growth", gases are produced which result in "a characteristic 'blow', exchanging the material from deep underground for the matter on the surface above it".&lt;ref name="Mass"&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', ''Terminology of the Imperium'' (Pre-spice mass).&lt;/ref&gt; After exposure to sun and air, this mass becomes melange.&lt;ref name="Mass"/&gt;

Kynes' "water stealers" die "by the millions in each [[spice blow]]" and may be killed by even a "five-degree change in temperature".&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt; He notes that "the few survivors entered a semidormant cyst-hibernation to emerge in six years as small (about three meters long) sandworms".&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt; A small number of these then emerge into maturity as giant sandworms, to whom water is poisonous.&lt;ref name="Shai-Hulud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt; A "stunted worm" is a "primitive form ... that reaches a length of only about nine meters". Their drowning by the Fremen makes them expel the awareness-spectrum narcotic known as the [[Water of Life (Dune)|Water of Life]].&lt;ref name="Appendix I"/&gt;

While sandworms are capable of eating humans, the latter do contain a level of water beyond the preferred tolerances of the worms. They routinely devour melange-harvesting equipment—mistaking the mechanical rhythm for prey—but they only seem to derive actual nutrition from sand plankton and smaller sandworms. Sandworms will not attack sandtrout.

===Leto II===

In ''Children of Dune'', [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]]'s [[prescience|prescient]] visions illuminate his [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]], his plan for the continued survival of mankind and the sandworms. After consuming massive amounts of spice, he allows many sandtrout to cover his body, the concentration of spice in his blood fooling the creatures:

{{quote|The sandtrout squirmed on his hand, elongating, stretching ... becoming thin, covering more and more of his hand. No sandtrout had ever before encountered a hand such as this one, every cell supersaturated with spice ... Delicately Leto adjusted his enzyme balance ... The knowledge from those uncounted lifetimes which blended themselves within him provided the certainty through which he chose the precise adjustments, staving off the death from an overdose which would engulf him if he relaxed his watchfulness for only a heartbeat. And at the same time he blended himself with the sandtrout, feeding on it, feeding it, learning it ... He located another, placed it over the first one ... Their cilia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow ... This was no longer sandtrout; it was tougher, stronger. And it would grow stronger and stronger ... With a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body, preventing rejection ... They were all over his body now. He could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane ... ''My skin is not my own.'' — ''Children of Dune''&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;}}

This layer gives Leto tremendous strength, speed, and protection from mature sandworms, which mistake his sandtrout-covered body for a lethal mass of water.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; He calls it a "living, self-repairing [[stillsuit]] of a sandtrout membrane", and soon notes that he is "no longer human".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

Gradually over the next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is transformed into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of human and giant sandworm.&lt;ref name="God Emperor"&gt;Herbert, Frank (1981). ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''. {{ISBN|0-575-02976-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the sandworm lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable than their predecessors, allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of his consciousness, trapped forever in an unending prescient dream.&lt;ref name="God Emperor"/&gt;

Over the next 1500 years, Arrakis (now called Rakis) is returned to a desert by the thriving sandworm cycle. Bene Gesserit Mother Superior [[Taraza (Dune)|Taraza]] becomes aware in ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' that humanity is being limited by the prescient dream of Leto, and controlled by him through his worm remnants. She engineers the destruction of Rakis by the [[Honored Matre]]s to free humanity, leaving one remaining worm to start the cycle anew. Taraza is killed; her successor [[Darwi Odrade]] takes the worm to Chapterhouse. She submerges it in a spice bath to generate sandtrout, with the goal of populating Chapterhouse, and later other planets, with new worms and infinite potential for gathering spice.

===Prequels and sequels=== &lt;!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Seaworm]] --&gt;
In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] (1999–2004), the Tleilaxu initiate [[Project Amal]], an early attempt to create synthetic melange  to eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. They are fundamentally unaware, however, that melange production is part of the sandworm lifecycle, and the project is an abysmal failure.

In ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'', Brian Herbert and Anderson's 2007 conclusion to the original series, the [[Spacing Guild]] is manipulated into replacing its [[Guild Navigator|Navigators]] with [[Ix (Dune)|Ixian]] navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators' supply of melange. Sure to die should they be without the spice, a group of Navigators commissions [[Tylwyth Waff|Waff]], an imperfectly awakened Tleilaxu [[ghola]], to create "advanced" sandworms able to produce the melange they so desperately require. He accomplishes this by altering the [[DNA]] of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of [[Buzzell (Dune)|Buzzell]]. Adapting to their new environment, these '''seaworms''' quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed "[[ultraspice]]". Meanwhile, sandworms are revealed to have survived the devastation of Rakis after all, by burrowing deep under the surface.

==Connection to the spice==

In ''Dune'', the desert of Arrakis is the only known source of the spice melange, the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe. Melange is a [[geriatric]] drug that gives the user a longer [[life expectancy|life span]], greater vitality, and heightened [[awareness]]; it can also unlock [[prescience]] in some subjects, depending upon the [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] and the consumer's [[physiology]]. This prescience-enhancing property makes interstellar travel ("folding space") possible. Melange comes with a steep price however: it is highly addictive,&lt;ref name="Addiction"&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', ''Terminology of the Imperium'' (Melange). "The spice ... is mildly addictive when taken in small quantities, severely addictive when imbibed in quantities above two grams daily per seventy kilos of body weight."&lt;/ref&gt; and withdrawal is a fatal process.

A [[by-product]] of the sandworm life cycle, sandtrout excretions exposed to water become a pre-spice mass, which is then brought to the surface by a buildup of gases and develops into melange through exposure to sun and air.&lt;ref name="Mass"/&gt; Liet-Kynes describes such a "spice blow" in ''Dune'':

{{quote|Then he heard the sand rumbling. Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of [[carbon dioxide]] was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous "blow" with a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.&lt;ref name="Dune"/&gt;}}

===Spice mining===

Collecting the melange is hazardous in the extreme, since rhythmic activity on the desert surface of Arrakis attracts the [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] worms, which are capable of swallowing even the largest mining equipment whole. Harvesting is carried out by a gigantic machine called a [[Harvester (Dune)|Harvester]], which is carried to and from a spice blow by a larger craft called a [[Carryall (Dune)|Carryall]]. The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for '''wormsign'''—the motions of sand indicating that a worm is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until a worm is close, at which time the Carryall lifts the Harvester to safety. The Fremen, who base their entire industry around the sale of spice and the manufacture of materials out of spice, have learned to co-exist with the sandworms in the desert and harvest the spice manually for their own use and for [[smuggling]] off-planet.

Later in the series, an artificial method of producing the spice is discovered by the [[Bene Tleilax]], who develop in secret the technology to produce melange in [[axlotl tank]]s. Still, the technology is not fully successful in pushing natural melange out of the marketplace.

===Spice cycle===

Due to the value of melange, attempts have been made to transplant production onto other planets. However, placing either adult sandworms (often smuggled with funds going to the Fremen) or sandtrout into existing deserts always met with failure. The large [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] of Arrakis indicate that it was not always a desert, but once had oceans. As spice production relies on the existence of a complete sandworm cycle, transplanting adult worms prevents the spice cycle from beginning anew with sandtrout, and transplanting sandtrout alone into existing desert denies them the necessary water to begin the cycle. Thus, placing sandtrout on a water-rich planet would allow them to start the complete spice cycle, at the cost of turning the planet into a desert, another Dune.

In ''Heretics of Dune'', the Honored Matres destroy Arrakis and the Tleilaxu, in part to eliminate spice production and thus irrevocably damage the [[Old Empire (Dune)|Old Empire]]. However, they are thwarted by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who escape with a single sandworm. Mimicking the devolvement of the God Emperor Leto II, they submerge the worm in spice-rich water, causing it to fission into its component sandtrout. The Bene Gesserit soon use the sandtrout to [[Terraforming|terraform]] their own planet [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]] into another Dune, and send countless others out into space to colonize other planets.

==Association with Fremen==
[[Image:DuneTV-ThumperCU.jpg|thumb|upright|The head of a [[Thumper (Dune)|thumper]], from the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries (2000)]]]]
Due to their size and territorial nature, sandworms can be extremely dangerous even to Fremen. The worms are attracted to—and maddened by—the presence of [[Holtzman shield|Holtzman force fields]] used as personal defense shields, and as a result these force fields are of little use on Arrakis.  In ''Children of Dune'' it is noted that a weapon has been developed on Arrakis called a "pseudo-shield".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; This device will attract and enrage any nearby sandworm, which will destroy anything in its vicinity.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

The Fremen manage to develop a unique relationship with the sandworms. They learn to avoid most worm attacks by [[mimic]]king the motions of desert animals and moving with the natural sounds of the desert, rather than the rhythmic vibration patterns that attract worms. However, they also develop a device known as a [[Thumper (Dune)|thumper]] with the express purpose of generating a rhythmic [[oscillation|vibration]] to attract a sandworm (see [[worm charming]]). This can be used either as a diversion, or to summon a worm for the Fremen to ride.

===Riding===
[[Image:DuneTV-Paul+Hooks.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Atreides]] ([[Alec Newman]]) wielding [[maker hooks]], from the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries (2000)]]]]

The Fremen have secretly mastered a way to ride sandworms across the desert.  First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device.  When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special "maker hook".  The hook is used to pry open the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand.  To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so that the exposed flesh faces upwards, carrying the rider with it.  Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as "[[Whip|beaters]]", hitting the worm's tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred miles and for about half of a day, at which point it will become exhausted and sit on the open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. The worm-riding ritual is used as a [[coming of age|coming-of-age ritual]] among the Fremen. Worm-riding is used by Paul-Muad'Dib during the Battle of [[Arrakis#Cities and features|Arrakeen]] for troop transport into the city after using [[Atomics (Dune)|atomic weapons]] to blow a hole in the Shield Wall.

After the reign of Leto II, sandworms become un-rideable, for reasons elaborated above. The one remarkable exception is a young girl named [[Sheeana]], an Atreides descendant who possesses a unique ability to control the worms and safely move around them.

===Crysknives===
Fremen use the sharp teeth of dead sandworms to produce the sacred knives they call [[crysknife|crysknives]]. Approximately 20 centimeters long, these hand-to-hand weapons are either "fixed" or "unfixed". An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's electrical field to prevent its eventual disintegration, while fixed knives are treated for storage.&lt;ref name="Crys"&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', ''Terminology of the Imperium'' (Crysknife).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fremen tradition dictates that once a crysknife is drawn, it must not be sheathed until it has drawn blood.&lt;ref name="Dune"/&gt;

==In derivative works==

Besides film and television adaptations, the ''Dune'' franchise has been adapted into a series of [[Dune computer and video games|computer and video games]] in which sandworms play a part.

===''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty''===

''(also relevant to "Battle of Arrakis" version of Dune II)''

Through each Great House's campaign, Sandworms will make their presence known from the third battle, generally two or three per scenario. Roaming under the surface of Dune, they are attracted to vibrations, and thus the movement of units, and will actually pursue and devour the victim immediately when they reach it. This can be fatal when the Sandworms consume all the player's Harvesters; as there is no "Sell buildings" option in ''Dune II'', having no credits whatsoever and being unable to replace devoured Harvesters is a straight defeat. However, Sandworms cannot (and will not) distinguish between friendly and enemy units, so they will also devour enemy infantry and vehicles, even Fremen. In ''Dune II'', their movement speed is medium, light vehicles and Combat Tanks can escape, but Harvesters, heavy vehicles and infantry are in constant danger. Sandworms, however, will remain idle and harmless until the player discovers them. If there are no units on sand, the Sandworm will come to a standstill and will wait until someone sets foot on sand.

Getting rid of Sandworms is possible, but tricky. First, they can only be fought from rocks. The Sandworm lures the attacking units into a great desert, and then turns against them, so chasing them down is futile. Apart from that, Sandworms are extremely resilient for most types of weapons, and immune to Deviator and spice mounds. It requires a combined fire of several heavy vehicles to make a Sandworm go away. Units and base defensive turrets will automatically fire at the Sandworm when it moves within range (except the Atreides in the early version of ''Dune II''). Eventually, after the Sandworm has eaten enough vehicles, or its energy is drained to yellow, it will disappear and never emerge again. The radar marks them as a pulsating white dot.

===''Dune 2000''===

Sand worms behave differently in Dune 2000 than in its predecessor. They can not be selected, nor their health is displayed. Their movement sight is more grainy rather than vibrating, and lightning bolts can be seen where the worm is. Their appearance is constant from the very first mission to the very end, and every multiplayer/practice map has 3 or more Sand worms (they can be turned off in multiplayer and practice).

Just like in Dune II, they have a voracious appetite, and will swallow vehicles, regardless of if it's the player's or the enemy's, and after swallowing 5 or so units, they will disappear for a short time. They are immune to spice mounds and Deviator gas as well. However, unlike in Dune II, they will re-emerge sooner or later, and will continue to roam the sands of Dune (yet, they will be a lot less aggressive). Dune 2000 Sand worms will not consume infantry, has significantly slower movement speed, and don't need to be alerted by the player. The radar shows the worm as a single white dot.

Taking a Sand worm out in Dune 2000 is simpler. In multiplayer mode, a certain type of infantry (Thumper infantry) can distract the worms' attention by deploying his thumper on the sand, attracting the worms, who will start circling around him. These worms are deadly to approach. Killing the Sand worm is time-consuming, it requires armor-piercing weapons. Troopers, Missile tanks and Devastators can nullify a Sand worm, as well as Rocket turrets.

===''Emperor: Battle for Dune''===
Towards the end of the [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]'', it is revealed that both the Tleilaxu and the Spacing Guild have been secretly experimenting with the sandworms of Arrakis in a remote research facility in the desert as the three great Houses of the Landsraad, the Atreides, Ordos and Harkonnen, are busy waging the War of Assassins amongst each other. It appears that the Tleilaxu have discovered the link between the Spice Melange and the sandworms as mentioned above. They plot to seize the Golden Lion Throne by breeding a man-worm, known as the Emperor Worm, and then fusing it with the Water of Life, mercilessly taken from the Lady Elara — who was held prisoner by the Reverend Mother (in truth a Tleilaxu [[Face Dancers|Face Dancer]]) since the beginning of the game — giving the Worm almost god-like powers.

All three Houses fight against the Guild in a race against time to destroy the Emperor Worm before it awakens, with a different ending for each House depicting their units destroying the Worm. One such ending reveals that, from the wreckage of the Emperor Worm's scaffold, red eyes are glowing in the dark, which perhaps suggests that the Worm survives. Should the player fail to defeat the Emperor Worm, then it becomes crowned as the new leader of the Empire of Man.

==Family and background==
Shakereh was born in [[Madras]] (27 August 1947 - missing April 1991 - declared deceased May 1994 ) into an aristocratic [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]] family from Shiraz in [[Persia]] who were residing in [[Singapore]].  She was the daughter of Gulam Hussain Namazie by his wife Gauhar Taj Begum, the youngest daughter of [[Sir Mirza Ismail]], the longest serving [[Diwan of Mysore]], [[Jaipur state|Jaipur]] and later [[Hyderabad]].  She is also the grand-daughter of [[Mohammad Namazi]] successful businessman who built his empire in [[Iran]], [[Singapore]] and [[America]] he is greatly respected for his philanthropic work and many charitable organisations in India, Singapore and Iran namely the [[Namazi Hospital]]. 

Shakereh's did her schooling in Singapore as her parents resided there and had family interests in business, horses and charitable endeavours.  In 1965, at age 18, Shakereh fell in love and married her first cousin [[Akbar Mirza Khaleeli]] from Madras their mothers were sisters [[Shah Taj Begum]] and [[Gauhar Taj Begum]] both daughters of Sir Mirza Ismail.  They have four daughters, Zeebundeh Khaleeli in 1966 Madras, Sabah Bakache 1967 Delhi, [[Rehane Yavar Dhala]] 1969 Paris, France and [[Esmath Khaleeli]] 1972 Amman, Jordan. 

Akbar Mirza Khaleeli, was an outstanding sportsman and student through school [[Bishop Cotton Boys' School]] and later [[Doveton Corrie Protestant Schools Association]], studied law at [[Loyola College, Chennai]].  He was considered the best Tennis Player in South India bar [[Ramesh Krishnan]] with great potential to be an all India Champion but decided to follow in his grandfathers footsteps and serve India instead.  He sat for the entrance exams and was accepted into both the IFS and IAS but decided to join the [[Indian Foreign Service]] in 1954.  He went on to serve in various posts in Delhi, Bagdad, Sri Lanka, Paris and Jordan.  He was finally promoted to serve as Indian Ambassador to [[Iran]] 1980-1985  [[Italy]] and High Commissioner to [[Australia]]. His expertise lies in Middle Eastern affairs and is often consulted where big decisions are to be made by both Corporates and Government to date.  Shakereh was with him through most of his postings save Iran because of the Iranian revolution she did not feel it was the right environment for her young daughters to be exposed to so early in their lives. 

While her husband was in Iran representing the country she had to find something substantial to stay occupied with along with the children who were now all between the ages of 8-16.  It was at this point she decided to move to Bangalore and pursue her love for construction which she shared with her great grandfather Aga Ali Asker who is still known for some of the most fabulous buildings across Bangalore.   At the age of 37 with 4 young daughters in tow she began her first venture which was to build the family home on Sankey Road, Abshot Layout and thereafter built her mothers house on Ali Asker Road single handedly with little  help at a time where sand and bricks were impossible to procure.  After this was done she turned her attention to the other family properties for development and evicting tenants who had outstayed their welcome.  

She was greatly admired by the muslim community and those who interacted with her.  She was an example to young muslim women in the community and was considered a progressive muslim woman. 


==Murder==
In 1991, Sabah, Shakereh's second daughter, found that she was unable to locate her mother. Despite repeated requests about Shakereh's whereabouts to her mother's second husband Murali Manohar Mishra, also known as Swami Shradhananda, he consistently avoided giving a proper answer. In 1992, Sabah's anxiety grew and she filed for a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' at the Ashok Nagar Police Station in [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]. For three years, the Swami evaded questions from the family, friends and legal authorities of the state. He lived in Bangalore like a king, pretending his wife was on a perpetual holiday.

In May 1994, the police of Karnataka finally found Shakereh's body (rather skeletal remains) buried deep in the [[courtyard]] of her own house.  Shakereh's murder was one of the most heinous crimes of Indian criminal history. When the murder was disclosed, it shook the nation.

Shakereh had been placed in the [[coffin]]-like box on 28 April 1991. She had been drugged asleep, placed on a [[mattress]] within the coffin-like box and covered with another mattress, [[suffocating]] her to death. She died unconscious, confined to a constricted space and buried by the man whom she trusted implicitly. When Shakereh's skeletal remains were recovered and the mattress was removed, one of her hands was found clutching the mattress which lay below her. The side of the box was scratched with her nails, perhaps in an attempt to get out, probably suffocating in the last pangs of breath.

==Legal case==
The Swami was taken into [[judicial custody]] after accepting the crime. The case also became an important milestone in the Indian judicial system as it was the first case where the [[exhumation]] process was recorded on video. The case was also the first time that [[DNA tests]] and videotapes of the exhumation were taken as evidence in India.

===Trial court===
On 21 May 2005 the Civil and Sessions Judge B.S. Totad sentenced Swami with a [[verdict]] of [[capital punishment]]. "He shall be hanged to death", the judge ordered. Shraddhananda betrayed no emotions as he stood in the dock, his head drooping as always. "From the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clear that the said murder has created such a fear in the minds of the family and in the community to live peacefully in society. There are no mitigating circumstances or factors to award a lesser punishment. After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and having regard to the nature of the methodology in committing the murder for gain, it is a fit case for capital punishment", the order read. "I am of the opinion that it falls under the bracket of the rarest of the rare cases and hence he be sentenced to death," the judge observed in the 300-page judgment. The judge directed the jail authorities not to execute the death sentence until they received confirmation from the high court.

===High Court===
In the high court, on 12 September 2005, a two bench judge composed of Justices S.R. Bannurmath and A.C. Kabbin awarded the death penalty to Shradananda. Terming it the "rarest of rare cases" in their order, the division bench composed of Justices S R Bannurmath and A C Kabbin, said: "The accused had murdered his wife in a diabolical and a well-planned scheme. As such, the death penalty imposed on him is liable to be confirmed. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any serious crime is thought to be a measure of tolerance that is unwarranted and unwise. The sessions court is justified in awarding death penalty to the accused." Shraddhananda is a "menace to the society and beyond reform". In addition, Justices S.R. Bannurmath and A.C. Kabbin stated, "in our view, the death was not a violent act by a weapon or attack, but the act was more violent since the mind of such a scheming person can be dangerous." "A person who plans in a cool and cunning manner ought to be hanged as there is no chance of his reformation. Shakereh was a helpless woman, and her trust was broken," the bench said. "Such scheming persons cannot be reformed. His conduct before and after the crimes shows that it (murder) had been planned methodically and carried out coolly and mercilessly. He has killed a person who had implicit faith in him and buried her unceremoniously" the verdict said.

===Supreme court===
On 18 February 2006, Shradananda issued notice to the [[Karnataka Government]] on special leave petition (SLP) questioning the high court judgment in September 2005. The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] Bench of Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Tarun Chatterjee, stayed the high court judgment, confirming the death sentence. On 22 July 2008, a [[life sentence]] for Shraddhananda was ordered by the [[Indian Supreme Court]] in [[New Delhi]].

It has been suggested they were used to mark the tomb on the surface.&lt;ref name=UCL /&gt; Another suggestion was that the house was meant to be a place for the dead person’s [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#kꜣ "double"|kꜣ]] to live although this theory has become less popular over time with the modern view being that the trays were primarily meant to provide food offerings or rather clay models of them.&lt;ref name=BMspout /&gt;

[[File:Tamagotchi 0124 ubt.jpeg|thumb|Tamagotchi Connection V1 by [[Bandai]]]]

The {{nihongo|'''Tamagotchi'''|たまごっち||拓麻歌子}} {{IPA-ja|tamaɡotꜜtɕi|}} is a handheld [[digital pet]], created in [[Japan]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|Akihiro Yokoi|ja|3=横井昭裕}} of WiZ and Aki Maita{{citation needed|reason=Who are these people?|date=October 2015}} of [[Bandai]]. It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and May 1997 in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s and early 2000s. Up until 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Figure seems to be a synthesis drawn from this report, but one tally was  specific 80 million worldwide --&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bandai.co.jp/press/images/3/60294.pdf |format= pdf |language= Japanese |title="Tamagotchi iD L" March 19th sale! |publisher= Bandai |date= 2010-01-31 |accessdate= 2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, over 82{{nbsp}}million units have been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tamagotchi 20th Anniversary Edition! |url=https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/cgi-bin/releases/index.cgi/file/view/5986?entry_id=5435 |publisher=[[Bandai]] |date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Tamagotchi are housed in a small egg-shaped computer with an interface usually consisting of three buttons, although the number of buttons may vary.

According to Bandai, the name is a [[portmanteau]] combining the two Japanese words {{Nihongo||[[wikt:たまご|たまご]]|tamago}}, which means "egg", and the end of "watch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandai.co.jp/kids/tm/ |script-title=ja:バンダイ タイムマシン |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723201551/http://www.bandai.co.jp/kids/tm/ |archive-date=2011-07-23 |website=Bandai}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071119125318/http://www.bandai.co.jp/kids/tm/tamago/tamago_01.html バンダイ マシン older archived version])&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the name is sometimes [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as "Tamagotch" without the "i" in Japan. Most Tamagotchi characters' names end in {{Nihongo||ち|chi}} in Japanese, with few exceptions.

==Background==
Tamagotchi was invented by Aki Maita for which she won the 1997 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tinyletter.com/whoinvented/letters/who-invented-tamagotchi |title=Who invented? Tamagotchi |date=January 29, 2016 |website=Who Invented}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1997 |title=The 1997 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |website=Improbable Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamagotchi is a keychain-sized [[virtual pet]] simulation game.  The characters are colorful and simplistically designed creatures based on animals, objects, or people. Beginning with the 2004 Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Character|url=http://www.jinco100.com/|website=JINCO100%|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature.&lt;ref name="rtfm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamatalk.com/IB/topic/116745-original-instruction-manuals/ |title=Original Instruction Manuals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention.  Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as [[List of Tamagotchi releases#TamagoChu|TamagoChu]], require little to no care from the player.

==Gameplay==
Upon activating the toy, an egg appears on the screen. After setting the Tamagotchi unit's clock, the egg will wiggle for several minutes, and then hatch into a small [[pet]]. In later versions, inputting the player's name and birthday is also required when setting the clock, and at birth, the player can name the pet and learn of its family group and/or gender. The player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions.  The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models a pause function was included.

Pets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet meter and Discipline meter to determine how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of [[bread]]) or a snack (usually a piece of [[candy]]). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the "scold" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave droppings around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.

If the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the "Medicine" option. Usually a pet will not play or be fed a meal when sick.
 
Pets would often fall asleep during the night time. Originally players had the option of manually turning off the light when the pet fell asleep (it would turn on the light by itself when it awoke). In order to raise a healthy pet, players were encouraged but not required to turn off the lights when the pet fell asleep. In recent versions, the pet turns off the light on its own when it went to sleep. Recent versions also allow waking the pet for a short time once it has fallen asleep. V5 had the three children look outside on the window when they wake up in the morning and before bed at night.

===Life cycle===
The pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of time, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes.  The pet can "die" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pets life cycle stages are '''Baby''', '''Child''', '''Teen''', and '''Adult'''. Later Tamagotchi models have added a '''Senior''' model.  Usually the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.

Poor care can cause a pet to die, but it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating [[UFO]] to indicate its return to its home planet. Often at times it will show the transition graphic, after which it will show the pet appearing to be sick, but with the skull flashing, beeping as it flashes. It then will show a happy version of the pet flashing with a longer beep, with an egg on the right side of the screen, after which it will show the pet as an angel (as indicated above). Pressing the middle button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, one can restart from the beginning by pressing A and C.

===New mechanics===
In recent models, the player earns currency called Gotchi Points while playing games, and can use the currency in an in-game shop to buy different foods, toys, accessories, or even room decorations for the pet.

====Connectivity====
Using infrared communication, two players can link their toys and the pets may form friendships, play games, exchange gifts, and even marry. Infrared connection was introduced with the Plus/Connection, but the Japanese Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi was the first model to interact with a computer. Since then, many subsequent models have also been able to interact with the E-Tamago or Tamatown websites by using alphanumeric codes generated by the toy to log into the website's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game.  After generating a code, the toy remains paused until the player either enters a logout code or cancels.  The player may play minigames in the town to earn Gotchi Points, or use Gotchi Points to buy items in the town shops.  To transfer points and items back to the toy, the player signs out of the Flash game and is given a code to input back into the toy. Newer models, such as the Tamagotchi 4U and the Tamagotchi 4U+ can connect to other Tamagotchi 4U units, as well as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], using [[near field communication]]. Unlike previous models, the Tamagotchi 4U does not have infrared, which consequently caused it to sell rather poorly.

====Marriage and family====
The Mesutchi and Osutchi Tamagotchis were the first to introduce marriages and offspring, and the feature returned in the Plus/Connection and subsequent models.  Two players with a male and female pet may link their toys and allow the pets to develop a friendship and fall in love.  Once the pets have raised their relationship meter sufficiently, the pets may marry. The player can also choose to have their pet marry a random pet brought in by the "Matchmaker."  Once married, the female will eventually produce two eggs, keeping one and leaving one with the male. Since the parent will automatically guide the baby's life, the only care it needs from the player is medicine in the case of sickness.  After a few days the parent will leave, and the player is left to care for a new generation.  This can continue for as long as the player manages to care for the pets.&lt;br /&gt;
The Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced the idea of character "families" or "groups."  These "families" are a kind of [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] for characters obtainable in the game, grouped mainly by appearance, though they are also associated with certain skills. A character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be of the female's group. ''Tamagotchi M!X'', the latest Japanese release, has a notable change to this feature; in this release, Tamagotchi offspring have merged traits from both of their parents.

====Other====
With the many different versions of the toy, there are other less common mechanics that influence the pet's growth, including but not limited to friendship with the player, varying types of skills, and career.
The Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced Skills, which can be built by playing certain games with the pet, or using certain toys or foods bought from the E-Tamago or in-game shops.  Having certain skills can help the pet obtain a career, and if built up high enough, can unlock special characters.

{{Main article|List of Tamagotchi releases}}
As of 2009, there have been over 44 Tamagotchi versions released since their creation in 1996, several of which were only released in Japan. Along with the original Tamagotchi, the first wave of Tamagotchi toys included Christmas, angel, and ocean themed versions. The newer versions began in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Plus, and the most recent version is the Japanese ''Tamagotchi M!X''.

Internationally, in 2013, ''Tamagotchi Friends'' is the latest model, featuring a grayscale screen and a new NFC feature that enables owner to "bump" their Tamagotchi to trade items. An upgrade, called ''Tamagotchi Friends: Dream Town Digital Friend'', was released in 2015. It has additional features, but can only be bought at online stores due to a lack of retailer interest in the product.

In early 2013, Bandai released an enhanced version of the original 1996 Tamagotchi as a free [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app named "Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.". A sequel to the game, "Tamagotchi L.i.f.e. Angel", was released on February 26, 2014.

===Video games===
Since its debut, Tamagotchi has made its way onto several gaming platforms.  Several early games feature gameplay similar to the original toys. A few [[Party video game|party-style games]] appeared on major consoles, along with the ''Corner Shop'' series of simulation games and a few role playing games for the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref name="TamVidGames"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ds-tamagotch.com/ |title= たまごっちのゲーム総合サイト |language= Japanese |trans-title= Comprehensive game site of Tamagotchi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Mametchi makes an appearance in [[Namco Bandai]]/[[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' as a playable character, along with his pet, Bagubagutchi, as an item. Mametchi and Yumemitchi also appeared in the [[Arcade game|arcade]] game ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' as unlockable costumes.

An arcade machine known as TamaStation is available in Japan from which players can win prizes for their Tamagotchi toy. This machine has several sequels, such as TamaStation 2.

==In other media==

===Film===
On June 5, 2007, it was announced by [[Reuters]] that an animated Tamagotchi film was to be released in December 2007. The film, ''[[Tamagotchi: The Movie]]'', focuses on Mametchi, along with his friends Memetchi and Kuchipatchi. Introduced are Tanpopo, a human girl who Mametchi accidentally transports to the Tamagotchi Planet; and Chamametchi, the younger sister of Mametchi who is born during the film's events. ''Tamagotchi: The Movie'' was released on December 15, 2007, and was distributed by [[Toho|Toho Co.]] The film opened at number 3 at the box office on opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-17/japanese-box-office-december-15-16-tamagotchi-at-no.3 |title=Japanese Box Office, December 15–16: Tamagotchi at #3 |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2008, [[North America]]n distributor [[Bandai Entertainment]] announced they had acquired the rights to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-30/bandai-entertaiment-gets-tamagotchi-feature-film |title=Bandai Entertainment Gets Tamagotchi Feature Film |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie's first English release was a direct-to-DVD version, released on June 3, 2009 in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The UK DVD was released on September 14, 2009 via Manga Entertainment.

On December 20, 2008, a second film, known as ''[[Tamagotchi: Happiest Story in the Universe!]]'' was released into theaters. This film, introducing a new Tamagotchi known as Hapihapitchi, was later released on DVD, on June 26, 2009. Unlike the first film, ''Happiest Story in the Universe'' has not been dubbed in English, but an extremely rare English dub existed in the Philippines. [[Madman Entertainment]] intended to dub ''Happiest Story in the Universe!'', but the dub was cancelled for unknown reasons.

On November 1, 2016, Bandai announced a new Tamagotchi short film called ''Tamagotchi: Secret Delivery Operation''. The film was theatrically released alongside the ''[[Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama]]'' film on April 28, 2017, and was included in the ''Cocotama'' movie's DVD released on December 6th, 2017. The short film once again follows Mametchi and his friends, assigned to make an essential delivery to the Gotchi King when a giant mechanical claw controlled by the Spacy Brothers intervenes with the delivery.

===Anime===
A Japanese-only [[anime]] series called ''Anime TV de Hakken!! Tamagotchi'' (アニメ TVで発見!! たまごっち, lit. "Found on Anime TV!! Tamagotchi") aired from July 7, 1997 to March 21, 1998 on Fuji TV.

In December 2007, Bandai Japan began airing ''Saa Ikō! Tamagotchi'' (さぁイコー！たまごっち) a week before the release of the first film. In December 2008, Bandai America dubbed the series, ''Let's Go! Tamagotchi'', and began streaming it on [[YouTube]] in both English and Japanese, with captions for up to seven other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-13/bandai-streams-tamagotchi-in-seven-languages-for-free |title=Bandai Streams Tamagotchi in Seven Languages for Free |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, another anime television series was announced, called [[Tamagotchi! (anime)|''Tamagotchi!'' (たまごっち!)]]. It began in October 2009 and ended in March 2015. A short-lived English dub of the Tamagotchi anime aired in Australia on channel [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]] from 2010-2014; only the first 26 episodes have been dubbed and have been repeated until 2014, when GO! took the anime out of their channel. The anime has been dubbed in Tagalog in the Philippines. There is also a dub in Taiwan airing on YoYo TV.

From November 23, 2013 to December 2014, Bandai America has been adapting the second Tamagotchi anime, ''[[Tamagotchi! (anime)|Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream]]'', into "webisodes" promoting the latest addition to the franchise outside Japan, ''[[List of Tamagotchi releases#Tamagotchi Friends|Tamagotchi Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://us.tamagotchifriends.com/2013/11/22/bandai-to-launch-tamagotchi-friends/ |title=Bandai To Launch Tamagotchi® Friends™ |publisher=Bandai |date=2013-11-22 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated video===
An animated video, Tamagotchi Video Adventures, was produced by 7th Level, Inc. in association with Bandai in 1997. Directed by Dan Kuenster, produced by Susan Deming and written by Kuenster, Deming and David Lewman. It runs approximately 42 and a half minutes long. Cosmotchi sends the Tamagotchi to Earth to collect an object that best exemplifies the planet for the Tamagotchi Museum. An original animated music video ("What's a Tamagotchi?") and a how-to-draw Tamagotchi featurette, starring director Kuenster follow the movie.

===Music===
* ''[[Momus (musician)|Momus]]'''s 1997 album ''Ping Pong'' features a song called "Tamagotchi Press Officer", which mocked Bandai's advertising strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://imomus.com/pingpongsong.html |title=Song By Song Guide To Ping Pong|publisher=imomus.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
During the 1990s, children frequently took Tamagotchi digital pets to [[school]] because in the first two releases (Generation 1 and Generation 2), a character could die in less than half a day if it did not receive adequate care. Concerns over class disruption as well as general distraction from schoolwork eventually prompted many schools to ban the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barayuga|first1=Debra|title=Electronic Pets Peep Their Last at Isle Schools |url=http://starbulletin.com/97/06/02/news/story2.html|accessdate=10 March 2015|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Local News|date=June 2, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990129010500/http://starbulletin.com/97/06/02/news/story2.html|archivedate=1999-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Harold 'Tiger' Black''' [[OBE]]  (1918-1983) was an Australian rugby league player from the 1930s and later a rugby league broadcaster and commentator.

==Playing career==
Born and raised at [[Arncliffe, New South Wales]], Ernie 'Tiger' Black began playing rugby league with his local [[Arncliffe Scots]] club in the early 1930s. He played Presidents Cup with [[St. George Dragons]] and was graded in 1937. He was a tenacious hooker, standing only 5&amp;nbsp;ft 1in (155&amp;nbsp;cm) and weighing only 60&amp;nbsp;kg. He raked against the biggest players of his day, always holding his own. Due to his small stature, and fearless disposition, he became forever known by the nickname 'Tiger'.

Black was a member of [[St. George Dragons|the Dragons']] 1938 premiership winning reserve grade side - the first [[St. George Dragons]] team to win a premiership. He played several first grade games in 1940 before painful kidney and back injuries curtailed his career at the age of 22. Upon retirement, 'Tiger' Black moved into club administration, and held many offices at [[St. George Dragons|St George]] over a number of years. In latter years he was a Director of the [[St. George Dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League players. 1995 ({{ISBN|1875169571}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media career==

In 1946, 'Tiger' Black became a rugby league broadcaster with Sydney Radio station [[2UW]]. Later, he moved to [[2UE]] and lastly to [[2KY]]. With [[2KY]], Black traveled the world many times, broadcasting Kangaroo Tours and World Cup matches. He is remembered alongside his great friend [[Frank Hyde]], as one of the greatest rugby league callers of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Heads: The March of the Dragons. 1989 ({{ISBN|0949853208}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

'Tiger' Black collapsed at his beloved St. George League Club on 30 August 1983, and died shortly afterwards. A hugely attended funeral at St. Davids Church [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]], preceded his burial at Woronora Cemetery, [[Sutherland, New South Wales]] on 2 September 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald:Death Notice 01/09/1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==

'Tiger' Black was awarded Life Membership of the [[St. George Dragons]] in 1965 and he was awarded an [[OBE]] - (British Empire Medal) in 1976 in recognition of service to sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://itsanhonour.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 'Tiger' Black was inducted in the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] Media Hall Of Honour for service to the media. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/history/scg-media-hall-of-honour/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomorrowland''' is one of the many themed lands featured at all of the Magic Kingdom styled [[Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products|Disney theme parks]] around the world owned or licensed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Each version of the land is different and features numerous attractions that depict views of the future. [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park in Paris]] includes a similar area called '''Discoveryland''', which shares some elements with other Tomorrowlands but emphasizes visions of the future inspired by [[Jules Verne]].

[[Walt Disney]] was known for his futurist views and, through his television programs, showed the American public how the world was moving into the future. Tomorrowland was the realized culmination of his views. In his own words: "Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today are opening the doors of the [[Space Age]] to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future."

It is this movement into the future that has, on occasion, left Tomorrowland mired in the past. Disneyland's Tomorrowland is now in its third generation, and the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland is in its second. The Walt Disney Company has mentioned that it wanted to keep Tomorrowland from becoming "Yesterdayland".  As a self-referential joke along this line, the 2007 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' (which is set mainly in the year 2037) features an amusement park called ''Todayland'', which has rides that look similar to [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]] and Disneyland's original [[Rocket Jets]].

===History===
[[File:Tomorrowland from Space Mountain Cueue - panoramio.jpg|thumb|400px|Tomorrowland taken from the [[Space Mountain (Disneyland)|Space Mountain]] queue]]

====Tomorrowland 1955–1966: The "original" Tomorrowland incarnation====
The first Tomorrowland opened at [[Disneyland]] on July 17, 1955, with only several of its planned attractions open, due to budget cuts. The construction of the park was rushed, so Tomorrowland was the last land to be finished. It became something of a corporate showcase, despite Walt Disney's reluctance. [[Monsanto Company]], [[American Motors]], [[ARCO|Richfield Oil]], and [[Dutch Boy Paint]] were some of the many companies to open showcases in Tomorrowland in the first few years. {{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Since the park was on a strict budget, one cost-cutting idea was to reuse the sets of the ''Nautilus ''from Disney's 1954 movie ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' as a walkthrough attraction.  This remained open until 1966. For the first four years, most of Tomorrowland was generally open space and considered to be very corporate-fueled. However, the area gained more attractions as time passed, many of which have since been removed.

When Disneyland opened, Tomorrowland represented the future in the year 1986.&lt;ref name=trahan&gt;{{cite book|last=Trahan|first=Kendra|title=Disneyland Detective: An Independent Guide to Discovering Disney's Legend, Lore, and Magic|year=2004|publisher=Permagrin Publishing|isbn=0971746400|author2=McKim, Brian |author3=Hawkins, Dave |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomorrowland's showpiece was the [[TWA Moonliner]], derived from Disney's "Man In Space" television episodes developed in the 1950s. The Moonliner was the tallest structure in the park at the time, even taller than the park icon Sleeping Beauty Castle. The Moonliner hosted Rocket To The Moon which was a ride to the moon. The entrance showpiece was the clock of the world showing the time anywhere on earth. The north show building hosted Circarama U.S.A. which showed movies on nine screens, and space station X-1 which showed a satellite view of America. The south show building showed the Monsanto Hall of Chemistry, which was a walk-through tour about chemistry.  [[Autopia]], an opening-day attraction, gave visitors a view of the National Interstate System that was to be built in the future. The attraction still remains open today, though it has been modified and rebuilt several times. This is the only attraction in Tomorrowland that has been open since opening day.

Several new attractions opened in 1955.  Among them were Tomorrowland Boats, The World Beneath Us, which showed the Earth's geology, and the Aluminum Hall of Fame, sponsored by [[Kaiser Aluminum]]. The final Tomorrowland attraction to open in 1955 was The Flight Circle which demonstrated methanol-powered model planes, boats and cars.

In 1956, Tomorrowland Boats were renamed Phantom Boats, and were closed later in the year. Dutch Boy Color Gallery opened in 1956, and sponsored Dutch Boy Paint. Two major attractions opened in 1956: the Astro Jets, where guests were able to fly their own rockets, and Skyway to Fantasyland, where guests rode "Buckets" over to Fantasyland.

In 1957, the [[Monsanto House of the Future]], a plastic house with four wings cantilevered from a central plinth, was built. This was similar to precursors at previous World's Fairs, though those were simply homes furnished with modern conveniences and aimed at housewives. Disneyland's attraction displayed conveniences such as picture phones and television remote controls, and it introduced many people to their first [[microwave oven]]. The Viewliner also opened where guests could ride in "the fastest miniature train in the world." It closed the next year making it the shortest lived Disney attraction ever.

In 1959, three major attractions, the park's first billed [[E ticket|E-ticket]] attractions, opened at Tomorrowland. These were the [[Disneyland Monorail]], [[Submarine Voyage]], and the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Matterhorn]] (which later became part of Fantasyland).  These additions were collectively so large in scope that they were televised as the second opening of Disneyland. New attractions came and some went as [[Walt Disney]] focused his efforts on the 1964–65 [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. After the Fair closed, he turned his attention to a new Tomorrowland and the [[Florida Project]], which would later become [[Walt Disney World]].

====Tomorrowland 1967–1997: "New Tomorrowland"====
[[File:Tomorrowland96 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|Disneyland's Tomorrowland entrance in 1996, before the 1998 makeover]]
By 1966, Tomorrowland was becoming quickly outdated. Most of its attractions were only there as advertisements for various sponsors, such as Monsanto, despite the 1959 Tomorrowland expansion. In 1967, the area was completely rebuilt with new attractions and scenery. The original layout was demolished, with a few exceptions, and a new set of buildings were erected. The addition of the [[Carousel of Progress]], [[Adventure Thru Inner Space]], an improved and larger Circle-Vision auditorium, Flight to the Moon, and the [[PeopleMover]] helped give Tomorrowland its "World on the Move" theme.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1973, "The World On The Move" began to change. General Electric decided to close Carousel of Progress, which later reopened at a new home in Walt Disney World in 1975 as part of its expansion. In 1974, with the American Bicentennial approaching, Disney designers seized the opportunity of the vacant carousel theater to present a large musical extravaganza called [[America Sings]], which featured 114 Audio Animatronics. The following year, Flight to the Moon was updated into [[Mission to Mars (attraction)|Mission to Mars]], as actual flights to the moon had become a reality since the former's construction.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1975, construction began on Walt Disney's proposed 1965 "Space Port". In May 1977, this project opened to the public as [[Space Mountain]]. The same year, the Super Speed Tunnel was added as part of the Peoplemover experience, as the Epcot model that was formerly in the building moved to Florida.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1984, Circle-Vision 360 received a brand new travelogue of the United States, to replace the aging "America The Beautiful" film – American Journeys.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1986, two new attractions found homes in Tomorrowland: [[Star Tours]] and [[Captain EO]]. Captain EO replaced the Space Stage in September 1986, and Star Tours replaced Adventure Thru Inner Space in January 1987. Aside from the Skyway closing in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-57515808/disney-grounds-skyway-ride.html|title=Disney Grounds Skyway Ride at Orlando, Fla., Park.|last=Verrier|first=Richard |date=November 10, 1999|publisher=Tribune Business News|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomorrowland remained largely unchanged for much of the following decade until it was redesigned in 1998.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1993, The Walt Disney Company planned a major refurbishment, "Tomorrowland 2055". This Tomorrowland was planned to have more of an extraterrestrial theme, and was going to replace [[Mission to Mars (attraction)|Mission to Mars]] with [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]. In 1994, however, this plan was scrapped due to the poor initial financial performance of [[Euro Disneyland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= February 27, 2018|title= The History of Tomorrowland 2055; a failed Land at Disneyland|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0X5vz1E_VU|access-date= August 15, 2018|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= [[YouTube]]|time= 3:24 to 6:23|location= |publisher= Fastpass Facts|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tomorrowland 1995–1998: "Tomorrowland in Decline"====
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickerson|first1=Marla|title=Admission Fee Raised Again|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-08/business/fi-33766_1_disneyland-admission-prices|accessdate=11 June 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years of 1995 - 1998 several Tomorrowland attractions were slated to be closed or remodeled. The Peoplemover, The Rocket Jets, Mission to Mars, Circle-Vision 360, Captain EO and the Starcade were all permanently closed or planned for renovation. At this time, most of these attractions were left vacant or walled off from the public.

In 1995, the  cost of an adult day pass at Disneyland was $34.00, and a Disneyland Annual Pass was $99.00. There was only one type of annual pass—as opposed to the current tiered system—and most Southern California locals had passes. Tomorrowland quickly became a local hang out for many local junior high and high school teenagers residing in Southern California. Teenagers congregated near the Tomorrowland Terrace, which featured a live band every night.

Tomorrowland became so synonymous with Southern California teenagers at that time, popular bands began to reference the local scene in their music. New Wave/Ska group No Doubt, named their 1995 break through album "Tragic Kingdom," in which the titled track opens with the "remain seated" warning from Matterhorn Mountain. Ska band Jeffries Fan Club (1997) wrote a song called "12," about a high school boy who meets a 12-year-old girl at Disneyland, and Pop-Punk band the Ataris (1998) "San Dimas High School Football Rules," was about the lead singer going to Disneyland with a girl he met and getting on all the rides.

This influx of teenagers did cause some negative consequences to the park. Disneyland had to employ more security because many of the teenagers were not respectful to the families visiting the park.  To combat the issue of mischievous locals, Disneyland made minor changes, including an increase to both one-day and annual passes. Tomorrowland officially began its renovation in 1995. The three-year makeover started only two years after the park’s last major project: the construction of Mickey’s Toontown. The land was not completely closed off the entire time, but major sections were blocked off to guests, and the entrance was finally walled up in 1997. As construction waged on, rumors about possible new attractions went rampant. Guests wondered if Tomorrowland would start to phase out transportation and space travel (its second main focus after home technologies in the 50s) in favor of a brand new theme. By the first months of 1998, New Tomorrowland was at the forefront of every Disneyland fan’s mind, and the springtime opening drew major crowds. When Tomorrowland re-opened Disneyland had raised prices and many of the locals either moved on or aged out of using Tomorrowland as a "hang out."

====Tomorrowland 1998–2004: The "New-New Tomorrowland" incarnation====
[[File:Tomorrowland.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Disneyland's Tomorrowland entrance 2006-2009]]

Tomorrowland reopened in 1998, loosely based on the retro-futurist concepts of Jules Verne that Disneyland Paris's Discoveryland featured.  The entire land was painted in bronzes, golds, and dark browns, with occasional green highlights.  New landscaping featured apparent vegetable plots and made reference to "neo-agrarian" concepts.  The flagship attraction of the makeover was the [[Rocket Rods]], which attempted to run a fast-paced ride on the former slow-paced PeopleMover track; the ride closed three years later due to intractable mechanical problems.

Many of the attractions remained fundamentally the same, but Circle-Vision, Captain EO, and Mission to Mars were all removed. The space formerly occupied by Circle-Vision was partly used for the queue of the Rocket Rods, while Captain EO was replaced by [[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]] and Mission To Mars was replaced by a restaurant called [[Redd Rockett's Pizza Port]].  The Rocket Jets attraction was redressed as a moving sculpture called the Observatron, while a similar attraction called the Astro Orbiter was placed at ground level in the entrance of Tomorrowland where the World Clock once stood.  The former America Sings theater became [[Innoventions (Epcot)|Innoventions]], a technology showcase based on the Walt Disney World: EPCOT original.  The famous Tomorrowland attraction [[Space Mountain]], which had been a gleaming white color for more than twenty years, was re-painted a copperish-brown color to go along with the redesign of Tomorrowland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Retro Space Mountain |url=https://yesterland.com/brownmountain.html |website=Yesterland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the opening of the New Tomorrowland for the summer of 1998, the Submarine Voyage was closed in September.

In late 2003, [[Matt Ouimet]] became president of the Disneyland Resort and sought to change some of the cost-cutting trends that had become the ''status quo'' there. Space Mountain was closed for two full years while the ride was refurbished and repainted white, the original color of the attraction, and the track was completely replaced by a new track with the same track plan. The former Rocket Rods queue building was converted into [[Buzz Lightyear (attractions)|Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters]] for a 2005 opening.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

====Tomorrowland 2005–2016: Disneyland's Happiest Homecoming and Diamond Anniversary====
{{main article|Happiest Homecoming on Earth|Disneyland Forever}}
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
In February 2005, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] approved a repaint of Tomorrowland for the "[[Happiest Homecoming on Earth]]" 50th anniversary celebration. This new paint scheme resembled the 1967 Tomorrowland with predominantly white, blue, and silver, although some of the former gold and bronze colors were kept.  The largest remainder from the 1998 color scheme was the Astro Orbitor until mid-2009, when it was repainted to match the rest of the land, and mechanisms that once caused its top to rotate properly were repaired.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[File:Dlp nemo lagoon.jpg|thumb|250px|The Submarine Lagoon at Tomorrowland. Monorail Orange is passing over a submarine.]]
In 2007, as part of the Year of a Million Dreams, the Submarine Voyage reopened as [[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]], with the submarines fully refurbished and repowered with batteries rather than diesel engines and a theme based around the 2003 film ''[[Finding Nemo]]''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Also in 2007, the Disneyland Monorail began phasing out its Mark V fleet of monorails in order to reverse engineer{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--why...were the original plans lost?--&gt; and upgrade the Mark V's to the new [[Mark VII monorail|Mark VII]] models. The new Mark VII's were phased in one at a time, beginning with Red and Blue in 2008 and Orange in 2009; Purple was confirmed not to undergo an upgrade and was scrapped. These new monorails were to pay homage to the original Mark I, II, and III monorails while retaining a modern, futuristic look. The previous [[Mark V monorail]] class of trains bore more of a resemblance to the [[Mark IV monorail|Mark IV]] and [[Mark VI monorail|Mark VI]] monorail classes of trains used on the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In January 2010, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'' closed to make way for a revived ''[[Captain EO]]'', which "re-opened" due the large public backing the 3D film had received upon [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] in June 2009. It was a limited engagement (albeit with no set closing date), and eventually closed in July 2014 to use the theatre to present a preview of [[Marvel Studios]]' ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. Later, starting on 26 September 2014, the Magic Eye theatre was used to present a preview of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', set to have ended on 21 November 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In July 2010, Disneyland's ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed motion simulator attraction ''[[Star Tours]]'' was closed to make room for its sequel, ''[[Star Tours—The Adventures Continue]]''. The new ride, which featured other ''Star Wars'' destinations in 3-D, opened on June 3, 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On March 21, 2015 Innoventions closed to become transformed into the Tomorrowland Expo Center. The building was closed and converted which reopened to guests on November 16, 2015. The first floor of the building hosts the "Star Wars Launch Bay", a new Star Wars exhibit with character meet and greets, displays featuring movie props and various sneak peeks behind the scenes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the two other future Star Wars films. The second floor formerly hosted the "Super Hero HQ", featuring meet and greets with Marvel characters Iron Man, Thor and Spider-Man with several displays from Innoventions remaining, but redressed to display Marvel's various television series and comic strips.

====Tomorrowland 2016–present: The "Season of the Force" Tomorrowland incarnation====
At the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], Disney announced that on November 16, 2015, Tomorrowland would launch a ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed "Season of the Force", in celebration of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. Among the changes launched as part of the event were the new attraction [[Star Wars Launch Bay|''Star Wars'' Launch Bay]]—an exhibition showcasing artwork and other materials related to the franchise, a ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''-themed update of Jedi Training Academy known as [[Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple]], the addition of ''The Force Awakens''-related content to [[Star Tours–The Adventures Continue]], and a ''The Force Awakens''-themed Space Mountain overlay known as Hyperspace Mountain.&lt;ref name="lat-seasonofforce"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomorrowland at Disneyland revamps with Season of the Force ahead of new 'Star Wars' movie release|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-disneyland-starwars-20151115-story.html|accessdate=22 February 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Details on Season of the Force, Coming November 16 to Disneyland Park in California|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/09/details-on-season-of-the-force-coming-november-16-to-disneyland-park-in-california/|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=September 24, 2015|date=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autopia also closed for a short period of time, but reopened in early 2016, with a new blue and silver color scheme to better fit current day Tomorrowland and a new sponsorship with [[Honda]].

{{See also|List of Magic Kingdom attractions#Tomorrowland}}

===History===

====Second Tomorrowland: 1971–1994====
The second Tomorrowland opened on October 1, 1971 at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], [[Florida]], and, like at Disneyland, was opened unfinished.  On opening day, only two attractions opened: the Grand Prix Raceway, and the Skyway to Fantasyland.

Tomorrowland was noted for being very barren and sterile at this time, due to the land being very flat and undetailed.  A large orange wall was located past the two large show buildings, and blocked guests from walking further than the Skyway building.  The wall had a small stage built into it, and a large outdoor food court sat adjacent to it to compensate for a lack of food venues at the time.  It was removed within two years and the Carousel of Progress took its place.

The largest counter service restaurant in the Magic Kingdom was the Tomorrowland Terrace.  America the Beautiful opened in November, and Flight to the Moon opened late on Christmas Eve, 1971, due to technical problems.  The south show building received an expansion in 1972, which housed If You Had Wings. The south building was further expanded in 1973, opening the Plaza Pavilion, which was an open-air restaurant, and served as a convenient way of getting from Main Street to Tomorrowland quickly.

In 1973, the plans for Tomorrowland were finalized; and for about two years, construction was a common sight.  In 1974, Star Jets, a spinner attraction sat on the WEDWay Peoplemover station. It resembled a Saturn V Rocket like its Disneyland cousin, the Rocket Jets. The ride vehicles between the two had some differences. The Disneyland Rockets were more narrow and resembled the central Saturn V rocket more, while the Magic Kingdom's vehicles look more like jets, hence the name "Star Jets".The Space Bar, another restaurant opened below the Peoplemover station.

The next year, Space Mountain and The Carousel of Progress opened on January 15. This was the first Space Mountain to open. It was the first totally indoor roller coaster in Florida and was the first roller coaster to have computer aided designs and use zoning to have 8 trains on the track at a time. Another Railroad station was planned to be built next to the entrance and exit to Space Mountain, but due to crowds in this area, it was never built. Carousel of Progress opened on the same day, and was similar to Disneyland's version except it rotated in the opposite direction. It also had a different song. Instead of "There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow", the song "The Best Time of Your Life." In June, the second version of the WEDWay Peoplemover opened.  This Peoplemover bore resemblance to Disneyland's, but was different, in that it used linear induction motors. This means that guests could not get stuck to the tracks as they could at Disneyland if they happened to fall out of the vehicle. The only moving parts of the vehicles were the wheels and the sliding doors. The track was similar but instead of it being open air and the vehicles having roofs, the opposite is true here. Unlike Disneyland's, the Peoplemover here never changed height. 
  
This Tomorrowland somewhat resembled Disneyland's Tomorrowland at the time, with large white buildings and clean geometric shapes. The triangular buildings at Disneyland were fully realized, and the opening of the Tomorrowland here had two enormous pylons which cascaded water down into the castle moat. Complimenting the Pylons were two large blue triangular walls which also released water into the moat. These waterfalls were often shut off as the slightest change of wind could spray water all over guests. In the early 80's the Waterfalls were turned off for good, and a large mosaic was painted on the blue walls, and some blue stripes were painted on the two pylons.

The colors of Tomorrowland were mainly whites complimented with ochre on the outside. The interior of the buildings were accented with reds, oranges, yellows, and browns. In Old Tomorrowland's later years, the outside colours were changed to pinks, and blues around the Peoplemover tracks.

====New Tomorrowland: 1994–present====
Tomorrowland went through a drastic change in 1994. It now resembles Tomorrowland from Disneyland in California slightly, but with more color. Many of the attractions changed. Some classic Tomorrowland attractions that have closed in Disneyland still live on at the Magic Kingdom Park, including the [[Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover]] and the [[Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress|Carousel of Progress]], which was moved from Disneyland to Walt Disney World in 1975.  A portion of Walt Disney's model display of the [[Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]], the first incarnation of what would become [[Epcot]], is also used as a display visible only from the [[Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover]].

For most of its history, Tomorrowland's color scheme was predominantly white with soft blues, creating a retro-modernist landscape. Huge monolithic towers, spires, and clean lines completed the futuristic look. In 1994, using inspiration from [[Discoveryland]] at Disneyland Paris, Tomorrowland was completely re-built and altered to resemble a galactic spaceport as it would have been envisioned by the science-fiction comic strips of the early 20th century, like [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Buck Rogers]]. Tomorrowland has since been given a much more metallic look, along with new darker blues and purples, especially along its main concourse leading from the central hub.

Interesting to note is that the spaceship atop the Cool Scanner misting station is actually a prop from the 1986 film ''[[Flight of the Navigator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=10 REAL Movie Props in Disney &amp; Universal Studios Theme Parks - Featuring Disney Dan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfY-cbdIX98|format=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Yesterworld Entertainment|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Tokyo Disneyland Tomorrowland View 201306.jpg|thumb|Tokyo Disneyland Tomorrowland]]
[[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s Tomorrowland was designed as a loose copy of Disney World's original Tomorrowland, particularly the main entryway which features nearly identical waterfalls and blue spires flanking the walkway. As is the case with other areas of Tokyo Disneyland, Tomorrowland has fewer attractions and more open spaces than its American counterparts, a move designed to facilitate a larger number of park guests. Notably missing is a [[PeopleMover]]-type attraction, whose tracks and ride vehicles have been conspicuous features of other Tomorrowland landscapes.

Although Walt Disney intended the original Tomorrowland in California and the original Tomorrowland in Florida to be a "living blueprint" of the future and Roy Oliver Disney intended the original Tomorrowland in Florida to be a "living blueprint" of the future, Tokyo Disneyland's Tomorrowland never directly showcased future technology, instead opting for more of a science fiction theme. Prominent attractions supporting this theme include [[Space Mountain]] and [[Astro Orbiter|Star Jets]], as well as the Pan Galactic Pizza Port, a restaurant that features a large [[audio-animatronic]] pizza-making machine operated by a whimsical alien creature named Tony Solaroni. In recent years, older attractions have been replaced with newer ones that feature movie tie-ins: [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters]] and [[Monsters, Inc. Ride &amp; Go Seek]] are two examples.

In October 2014, the Oriental Land Company announced a large expansion of New Fantasyland. The expansion includes closing the [[Autopia|Grand Circuit Raceway]], making Tomorrowland significantly smaller.

==Disneyland Park (Paris)==
[[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in [[Disneyland Paris|Paris]] has a Tomorrowland with an entirely different concept, '''Discoveryland'''. European culture was used distinctively in the park and Discoveryland uses the ideas of famed European thinkers and explorers such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] or [[H. G. Wells]], with [[Jules Verne]] featured most prominently.  This land was heavily inspired by the abandoned Disneyland concept ''Discovery Bay'', which would have sat at the north end of the park's [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of America]]. An example of an attraction is Space Mountain Mission 2, an enclosed outer space themed roller coaster with a tongue, which is a 2 inversion element, a corkscrew and objects made to look like planets and asteroids.

Architecturally designed using Jules Verne's vision of the future as inspiration, the land is laid out very differently from its predecessors. Many Tomorrowland classics are featured in Discoveryland, such as [[Autopia]] and [[Astro Orbiter|Orbitron]], some in an altered way, but [[Space Mountain: Mission 2|Space Mountain]] is changed the most. Its theme is [[Steampunk]]/[[Clockpunk]], with elements of [[Raygun Gothic]].

===History===
Originally conceived as '''[[Space Mountain (Paris)#Original concept|Discovery Mountain]]''', it was originally proposed to hold more than one attraction, including an improved version of [[Horizons (Epcot attraction)|Horizons]] from [[Epcot]], a larger Nautilus walk-through complete with a restaurant and a free-fall ride based on ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''. But due to budget cuts, it opened in 1995 as ''Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune'' (From the Earth to the Moon). Beside the Space Mountain show building is the Nautilus Lagoon, with a walk-through recreation of the Nautilus submarine from ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

The showcase attraction on opening day was a Circle-Vision 360 film, titled ''[[The Timekeeper|Le Visionarium]]''. The attraction featured an eccentric time-traveling robot and his robotic assistant, who take [[Jules Verne]] into the world of today, which is pictured as the future he dreamed of. The attraction was later exported to both the [[Magic Kingdom]] and to [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

Space Mountain was completely refurbished in 2005 for the Happiest Celebration on Earth, with a new soundtrack and special effects. [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast]]  opened April 8, 2006, in the former building of Le Visionarium, which closed in September 2004.

==Shanghai Disneyland Park==

===History===
[[Shanghai Disneyland]]'s Tomorrowland is the newest, opening with the resort on June 16, 2016. Unlike the other 5 Tomorrowlands around the world, this Tomorrowland does not feature Space Mountain, and instead features the [[TRON Lightcycle Power Run]]. Instead of a classic spinning rockets attraction, Shanghai's park includes a spinning Jet Packs ride. There is a new version of Disney's popular Buzz Lightyear dark ride called [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue]], utilizing new technology different from that of the versions of the ride located at other Disney parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unveilthemagic.shanghaidisneyresort.com.cn/?ref=officialwebsite#mrsj|title=上海迪士尼度假区|trans-title=Shanghai Disney Resort|publisher=|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRON Realm opened on September 20, 2016 to make it the first expansion for the park.

In [[funeral]] services, a '''viewing''' (sometimes referred to as calling hours, reviewal,  [[Funeral#Visitation|funeral visitation]] or a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and  [[Ireland]]) is the time that the family and friends come to see the deceased after they have been prepared by a funeral home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mywhatever.com/cifwriter/library/mortals/mor13206.html |title=Handbook for Mortals : What happens at funeral viewing hours? |publisher=Mywhatever.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended (however not necessary) that any body to be viewed be [[embalmed]] in order to create the best possible [[Lying in repose|presentation of the deceased]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/faq.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805092752/http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/faq.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-05 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Nea.gov.sg |date=2005-03-03 |accessdate=2012-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A viewing may take place at the funeral parlor, in a family home or at a [[Church (building)|church]] or [[chapel]] prior to the actual funeral service. Some cultures, such as the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], often take the body to the [[Marae]] or tribal community hall.

Viewing is sometimes combined with a service called a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] although in some places the term wake is interchangeable with viewing. Many authorities consider the viewing important to the [[grief|grieving]] process as it gives a chance to say goodbye on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/484135_2 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also make it easier to accept the reality of the death, which can often seem unreal especially in the industrial world where death is handled by professionals and the family may only know of a death through phone calls rather than experiencing it as it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funerals.org/faq/visit.htm |title=What is the Difference Between "Viewing" and "Visitation"? |publisher=Funerals.org |date=2007-11-26 |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141958/http://www.funerals.org/faq/visit.htm |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
