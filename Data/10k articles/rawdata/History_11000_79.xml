Since then, both Azerbaijan and Armenia have reported over 7,000 breaches of the ceasefire;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ru.apa.az/news/313223 |title=В марте армянские вооруженные подразделения нарушили режим прекращения огня 3746 раз|publisher=[[Azerbaijan Press Agency|APA]]|language=Russian| date=1 April 2016| accessdate =6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.newsru.com/world/04jun2011/karabah.html |title=Минобороны Азербайджана: новая война за Карабах неизбежна|publisher=NEWSru.com| date=4 June 2011| language=Russian|accessdate =6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 100 breaches of the ceasefire were reported and 12 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed in 2015 alone.&lt;ref name="thenationalinterest"/&gt; The April 2016 clashes have been the most serious breach of the 1994 ceasefire to date.&lt;ref name="ocha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/azerbaijan/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-situation-report-no-1-03-apr-2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160404094519/http://reliefweb.int/report/azerbaijan/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-situation-report-no-1-03-apr-2016|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 April 2016|title=Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict Situation Report No. 1 (as of 03 Apr 2016)|date=3 April 2016|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the possible reasons behind the conflict escalation is Azerbaijan's worsening economy. The [[Price of oil#2015-16 prices: The lows of January 2016|collapse of oil prices in 2015–16]] has been frequently cited, with clashes being used to distract the Azerbaijani population from rising prices and unemployment.&lt;ref name="thenationalinterest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theeconomist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21696563-after-facing-decades-armenia-and-azerbaijan-start-shooting-frozen-conflict-explodes|title=A frozen conflict explodes|date=9 April 2016|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, some Armenian sources blame Turkey for provoking violence.&lt;ref name="theeconomist"/&gt; Some Turkish commentators have suggested a Russian strategy to destabilize the region.&lt;ref name="thenationalinterest"/&gt;

On 8 April, Artak Beglaryan, a spokesperson for the NKR Prime Minister, posted a photo on his Twitter account showing the beheaded corpse of an Armenian soldier.

Relatives of three Armenian soldiers killed and beheaded during the escalation filed a complaint against Azerbaijan to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). The plaintiffs demand to recognize the case of inhuman treatment with regard to the bodies, lack of respect for their privacy, and discrimination based on nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/35390/|title=Complaint about beheading of Armenian soldiers filed to ECtHR, advocate reports|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 the European Ombudsman Institute (EOI) issued a statement that condemns any violation of human rights regarding civilians and attacks on civilian objects in Nagorno-Karabakh. According to EOI, "civilian citizens of Nagorno-Karabakh were inhumanly treated without any respect and by that offended in their dignity". "We are concerned by the information received, that peaceful civilians were killed in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlements through partly cruel and inhuman methods of execution. All these operations constitute gross violations of human rights; they are opposed to European human rights and human values; they significantly endanger the European system for the protection and promotion of human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoi.at|title=EUROPÄISCHES OMBUDSMANN INSTITUT -|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer of bodies===
On 10 April, the State Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and Missing Persons of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic said that of the 18 bodies of Armenian soldiers transferred that same day by Azerbaijan, all showed signs of [[torture]] or [[mutilation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Commission called these acts "a flagrant manifestation of inhumanity, run counter to the laws and customs of war and are in grave violation of the international humanitarian law", adding that the Karabakh side will ensure that "such behavior of the Azerbaijani side is condemned in strongest terms by the international community and the specialized agencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.aravot.am/2016/04/11/175574/|title=All bodies of the deceased transferred by the Azerbaijani side had signs of torture and mutilation|work=Առավոտ – Նորություններ Հայաստանից|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galatv.am/ru/news/145364/|title=Заявление Государственной комиссии НКР по вопросам военнопленных, заложников и без вести пропавших|work=ԳԱԼԱ|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defense denied the accusations and claimed that the transferred bodies of Azerbaijani servicemen had been mutilated by the Armenian side.&lt;ref name="kavkaz11apr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/280712/|title=Кавказский Узел - Азербайджан опроверг заявления о глумлении над телами убитых|work=Кавказский Узел|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKR State Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and Missing Persons called this claim by Azerbaijan a cynical attempt to mislead the international community, observing that before the start of the exchange procedure, all the bodies of the dead soldiers had been examined in the presence of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and no traces of abuse or ill-treatment had been discovered or registered on Azerbaijani soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Karabakh MFA: No traces of abuse or ill-treatment were discovered on bodies of Azerbaijani soldiers", A1+, 15 April 2016  [http://en.a1plus.am/1233704.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Casualty estimates===
According to the US State Department, Azerbaijan "took a huge number of casualties, including comparatively", although the number was not specified. Overall, a senior member of the US State Department estimated 350 casualties on both sides, including civilians.&lt;ref name="statedep"/&gt; According to the Russian analytical center Ostkraft the Azerbaijan army stopped its offensive against Karabakh because 800 Azerbaijani soldiers died during the clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regnum.ru/news/polit/2129092.html|title=OSTKRAFT: потери Азербайджана в Нагорном Карабахе в апреле — 800 человек - ИА REGNUM|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ostkraft.ru/ru/news/1753|title=Стали известны реальные потери Азербайджана в ходе боев в Карабахе - OSTKRAFT|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official estimates of the warring parties are far apart from each other. According to official statements of the involved sides, 90 Armenian&lt;ref name="at92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rus323302"/&gt; and 31 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed during the clashes,&lt;ref name="meydan" /&gt; and several pieces of military equipment from both sides were destroyed.

[[Chatham House]] fellow [[Zaur Shiriyev]], suggested that Azerbaijan prompted a "carefully controlled escalation [that] served to raise international awareness of the fragility of a status quo which Azerbaijan regards as unfavourable, in order to galvanize the international mediators and put pressure on Yerevan to be constructive at the negotiating table."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shiriyev|first1=Zaur|title=Violence in Nagorny Karabakh a Reflection of Azerbaijan’s Security Dilemma|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/violence-nagorny-karabakh-reflection-azerbaijan-s-security-dilemma|publisher=[[Chatham House]]|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Thomas de Waal]], senior associate at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and author of ''[[Black Garden|Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War]]'', does not believe that the Azerbaijani offensive was meant as a full-scale military operation but rather as a limited attempt to bring the conflict back on the international agenda and put Armenia under pressure. He believes that after the April violence, the conflict is unlikely to return to its semi-quiet state and that a new round of fighting would be harder to contain than previous conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Waal.

Christine Philippe-Blumauer noted, "Russian official reactions suggest that Russian troops would not actually decide to intervene in favor of the Armenian side, should the conflict scale-up to a fully-fledged war yet again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philippe-Blumauer|first1=Christine|title=Nagorno-Karabakh: A Conflict Entrenched in Nationalistic Propaganda|url=http://www.fpri.org/2016/05/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-entrenched-nationalistic-propaganda/|publisher=[[Foreign Policy Research Institute]]|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]] was the one who benefited most from the four-day-clashes. During the early days of the conflict, [[Moscow]] adopted a reserved attitude, and after within only few hours, most probably brokered the ceasefire. The [[OSCE Minsk Group]] organized a meeting only after several days the conflict sparked, and the parties declared the ceasefire even before the meeting took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2016-04-06/four-day-war-nagorno-karabakh|title=The four-day war in Nagorno-Karabakh|publisher=OSW|date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conflict, [[Russia]] started to increase political and ecnonomic ties with both [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]]. In [[Yerevan]], [[Gazprom]] agreed to increase gus supply to Armenia, and decreased the price of gas, which was already low. In [[Baku]], Russian foreign minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] had a discussion about a railway line from Russia to [[Iran]] through Azerbaijan. However, Russia alone is not entirely stabilising influence. [[Dmitry Rogozin]], a deputy prime minister said that Moscow is the biggest supplier of arms to both sides and will continue to be so in the future. People who worked on the settlement process said that none of the sides would have trust in a permanent peace established by Russia alone. As the former US ambassador to the Minsk Group, Mr Bryza puts it, "The key to resolving this is to get the two presidents to have sufficient trust in each other, and Russia is not going to be able to do that". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d485610-0572-11e6-9b51-0fb5e65703ce|title=Russia senses opportunity in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|publisher=Financial Times|date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April President [[Serzh Sargsyan]] acknowledged that Azerbaijani troops had taken very small pieces of land in the north and south of the contact line, which he said had no strategic importance for Armenian forces, who had not attempted to reclaim them to avoid additional loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halpin|first1=Anthony|last2=Khojoyan|first2=Sara|title=War May Resume at `Any Moment,' Armenian President Warns|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-24/caucasus-war-may-resume-at-any-moment-armenian-president-says|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May Sargsyan stated that the Armenian side had lost control of "800 [[hectare]]s of land having neither tactical not strategic importance",&lt;ref name="panarmenian 800"&gt;{{cite news|title=Karabakh lost 800 ha of land that played no strategic role: Armenia (video)|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/212454/|agency=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serzh Sargsyan: We have lost 800ha of land having neither tactical nor strategic importance|url=http://www.arminfo.am/index.cfm?objectid=69B287C0-1C2E-11E6-922F0EB7C0D21663|website=Arminfo|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Inch of Land: Armenian hardliners riled by Sargsyan’s admission of territorial losses in Karabakh|url=https://www.armenianow.com/en/karabakh/2016/05/18/armenia-karabakh-serzh-sargsyan-land-lost-sefilian/3431/|work=[[ArmeniaNow]]|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2016 Sargsyan fired 3 senior Armenian army officials, including the chiefs of the Logistics, the Intelligence and the Communications Departments, a move which was apparently influenced by the public criticism of the high death toll among the Armenian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dismissed: Sargsyan relieves three generals of senior army positions|url=https://www.armenianow.com/en/news/2016/04/26/armenia-generals-resignations-president-sargsyan/1904/|website=ArmeniaNow|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political harassment ===
[[Ali Karimli]], the leader of [[Azerbaijani Popular Front]] party, who criticized the Azerbaijani government over its actions during the clashes, became a subject of a series of protests (the latest one held on 12 April in front of Karimli’s house), organized by the authorities. The protesters also demanded to exile him from the country. According to the human rights lawyer [[Intigam Aliyev]], attacks against Karimli are simply diverting attention from truly important issues and testing technologies to distract people’s justified anger caused by the serious consequences of wrong decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meydan.tv/en/site/politics/13614/|title=Danger of attacks against Ali Karimli|first=|last=Meydan.TV|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contact.az/docs/2016/Social/041300152857ru.htm#.V0hQG9hkhdg|title=Активисты гражданского общества выразили поддержку Али Керимли|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004170252/http://www.contact.az/docs/2016/Social/041300152857ru.htm#.V0hQG9hkhdg|archive-date=4 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their list consisted of 94 names, while the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan confirmed only 31 deaths. According to the Meydan TV chief editor [[Emin Milli]], each person on their list really died in the clashes, and he stated that the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan could not deny this information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/here_and_now/azerbajdzhanskih_zhurnalistov_nazvali_natspredateljami-408142/ За что азербайджанских журналистов назвали нацпредателями] // tvrain.ru 25 апреля 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A vigil was also held to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to condemn the Azerbaijan for "outrageous militarization and vicious attacks", as stated by [[Paul Krekorian]], one of the organizers of the vigil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles City Hall lit up in Armenian tri-color|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/210206/|agency=PanArmenian|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vigil at LA City Hall following attack on Armenians in Azerbaijan|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/04/12/59531/vigil-at-la-city-hall-following-attack-on-armenian/|agency=KPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[US Congress]]woman [[Loretta Sanchez]], a senior member of the [[House Armed Services Committee]], called for a "[[Leahy Law]]" investigation into reports that the Azerbaijan armed forces, which annually receive millions of dollars in U.S. military aid, committed gross violations of human rights during Baku’s 2 April offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/149728/rep-loretta-sanchez-calls-for-leahy-law-investigation-of-azerbaijani-abuses/|title=Rep.

* US Senators [[Bill Barton (politician)|Bill Barton]] and [[Lois Tochtrop]] have condemned human rights violations by Azerbaijan as [[war crimes]]. According to them, "One heartbreaking account of Azerbaijan’s barbaric actions during the four-day war in April was the mutilated elders that journalists found in Talish after its recapture from Azerbaijani forces". Another violation was that "among the Azerbaijani officers Aliyev honored at a ceremony following the four-day war was the man who had posed with [Yezidi-Armenian soldier] Sloyan’s severed head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/05/20/state-lawmakers-support-for-azerbaijan-encouraged-last-months-anti-armenian-war-crimes/|title=State Lawmakers’ support for Azerbaijan Encouraged Last Month’s Anti-Armenian War Crimes|first1=About the Author Senator Bill Barton Senator Bill|last1=Barton|first2=whose maternal family survived the Armenian|last2=Genocide|first3=was a Republican member of the Utah State Senate for 12 years He is a member of Utah's chapter of the Armenian National Committee of America Senator Lois Tochtrop Senator Lois Tochtrop was a Democratic member of the Colorado General Assembly for 16 years She is a member of Colorado's chapter of the Armenian National Committee of|last3=America|date=20 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The societal reactions to the April clashes were different in [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. In Azerbaijan, the clashes surged patriotism in the public, and thousands of people volunteered to fight, yet the Ministry of Defence did not allow them to do so. Even people with the critical voice could not hide their surprise at the intense and quick social mobilization. For this reason, the decleration of the ceasefire on April 5 led to the sense of dissapointment in the public. In Armenia, following the ceasefire, demonstrations took place in [[Yerevan]], which were caused by the anti-Russian attitudes that objected to [[Moscow]]’s arms sales to [[Baku]]. Even though the Armenian officials firstly emphasized the effective performance of the Armenian army, there was a growing public dissapointment about the complacency and corruption in the army. Out-of-date equipment and poor communication lines were believed to be the cause for the death of many Armenian soldiers within the first few hours of the clashes. After the decleration of the ceasefire, four high-ranking army officials were dismissed from their position. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/nagorny-karabakh-conflict-defaulting-war|title=The Nagorny Karabakh Conflict: Defaulting to War|work=Russia and Eurasia Programme|accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic slave trade''' or '''transatlantic slave trade''' involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] people, mainly to the [[Americas]]. The slave trade regularly used the [[triangular trade]] route and its [[Middle Passage]], and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from [[Middle Africa|central]] and [[western Africa]], who had been sold by other West Africans to [[Western Europe]]an slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The capture and sale of slaves|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/africa/capture_sale.aspx|publisher=[[International Slavery Museum]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|location=[[Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops, making goods and clothing to sell in Europe. This was crucial to those western European countries which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires.&lt;ref name="Mannix 1962 Introduction-1–5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mannix|first=Daniel|title=Black Cargoes|year=1962|publisher=The Viking Press|pages=Introduction–1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese were the first to engage in the Atlantic slave trade in the 16th century. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to [[Brazil]], and other European countries soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shipwreck Shines Light on Historic Shift in Slave Trade|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150605-shipwreck-slave-trade-south-africa-18th-century-brazil|publisher = National Geographic Society|accessdate = June 8, 2015|first = Greta|last = Weber|date = June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible,&lt;ref name="Mannix 1962 Introduction-1–5"/&gt; there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar and cotton [[plantations]], gold and silver mines, rice fields, construction industry, cutting timber for ships, in skilled labour, and as domestic servants. The first Africans imported to the [[English colonies]] were classified as "[[indentured servants]]", like workers coming from England, and also as "apprentices for life". By the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, with the slaves and their offspring being legally the property of their owners, and children born to slave mothers were also slaves. As property, the people were considered merchandise or units of labour, and were sold at markets with other goods and services.

The major Atlantic slave trading nations, ordered by trade volume, were: the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], the [[British Empire|British]], the [[French colonial Empire|French]], the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and the [[Dutch Empire]]s. Several had established outposts on the African coast where they purchased slaves from local African leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Herbert S., and Jacob Klein. ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''. Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 103–139.&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were managed by a factor who was established on or near the coast to expedite the shipping of slaves to the New World. Slaves were kept in a factory while awaiting shipment. Current estimates are that about 12 million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Segal]], ''The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995), {{ISBN|0-374-11396-3}}, p. 4. "It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic." (Note in original: Paul E. Lovejoy, "The Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on Africa: A Review of the Literature", in ''Journal of African History'' 30 (1989), p. 368.)&lt;/ref&gt; although the number purchased by the traders was considerably higher, as the passage had a high death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Eltis, David and Richardson, David, "The Numbers Game". In: Northrup, David: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade'', 2nd edn, Houghton Mifflin Co., 2002, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil Davidson. ''The African Slave Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the beginning of the 19th century, various governments acted to ban the trade, although illegal smuggling still occurred. In the early 21st century, several governments issued apologies for the transatlantic slave trade.

==Background==
{{See also|History of slavery}}

===Atlantic travel===
The Atlantic slave trade developed after trade contacts were established between the "[[Old World]]" ([[Afro-Eurasia]]) and the "[[New World]]" (the [[Americas]]). For centuries, tidal currents had made ocean travel particularly difficult and risky for the ships that were then available, and as such there had been very little, if any, maritime contact between the peoples living in these continents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, however, new European developments in seafaring technologies resulted in ships being better equipped to deal with the tidal currents, and could begin traversing the Atlantic Ocean. Between 1600 and 1800, approximately 300,000 sailors engaged in the slave trade visited West Africa.{{sfn|Christopher|2006|p=127}} In doing so, they came into contact with societies living along the west African coast and in the Americas which they had never previously encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Pierre Chaunu]] termed the consequences of European navigation "disenclavement", with it marking an end of isolation for some societies and an increase in inter-societal contact for most others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha69|Chaunu 1969]], pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[John Thornton (historian)|John Thornton]] noted, "A number of technical and geographical factors combined to make Europeans the most likely people to explore the Atlantic and develop its commerce".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified these as being the drive to find new and profitable commercial opportunities outside Europe as well as the desire to create an alternative trade network to that controlled by the [[Islam|Muslim]] Empire of the [[Middle East]], which was viewed as a commercial, political and religious threat to European [[Christendom]]. In particular, European traders wanted to trade for [[gold]], which could be found in western Africa, and also to find a maritime route to "the Indies" (India), where they could trade for luxury goods such as [[spices]] without having to obtain these items from Middle Eastern Islamic traders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the initial Atlantic naval explorations were led by Iberians, members of many European nationalities were involved, including sailors from Portugal, Spain, the Italian kingdoms, England, France and the Netherlands. This diversity led Thornton to describe the initial "exploration of the Atlantic" as "a truly international exercise, even if many of the dramatic discoveries were made under the sponsorship of the Iberian monarchs". That leadership later gave rise to the myth that "the Iberians were the sole leaders of the exploration".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery]] was prevalent in many parts of [[Africa]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Historical survey, Slave societies |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archivedate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some parts of Africa were exported to states in Africa, Europe, and Asia prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="Ferro221"&gt;Ferro, Mark (1997). ''Colonization: A Global History''. Routledge, p. 221, {{ISBN|978-0-415-14007-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, although it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M'bokolo wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'':

{{quote|The [[Africa]]n continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the [[Sahara]], through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] (from the ninth to the nineteenth) ... Four million enslaved people exported via the [[Red Sea]], another four million&lt;ref name="afbis"/&gt; through the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] ports of the [[Indian Ocean]], perhaps as many as nine million along the [[Trans-Saharan trade|trans-Saharan]] caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Elikia M'bokolo, "The impact of the slave trade on Africa", ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', [http://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa 2 April 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to John K. Thornton, Europeans usually bought enslaved people who were captured in [[endemic warfare]] between African states.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Africans had made a business out of capturing Africans from neighboring ethnic groups or war captives and selling them.&lt;ref name="Thornton, page 310"&gt;Thornton, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; A reminder of this practice is documented in the Slave Trade Debates of England in the early 19th century: "All the old writers ... concur in stating not only that wars are entered into for the sole purpose of making slaves, but that they are fomented by Europeans, with a view to that object."&lt;ref&gt;''Slave Trade Debates 1806'', Colonial History Series, Dawsons of Pall Mall, London 1968, pp. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; People living around the [[Niger River]] were transported from these markets to the coast and sold at European trading ports in exchange for [[musket]]s and manufactured goods such as cloth or alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the European demand for slaves provided a large new market for the already existing trade.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; While those held in slavery in their own region of Africa might hope to escape, those shipped away had little chance of returning to Africa.

===European colonization and slavery in West Africa===
{{One source|section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Kongo audience.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] presenting themselves before the [[Manikongo]]. The Portuguese initially fostered a good relationship with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. Civil War within Kongo would lead to many of its subjects ending up as enslaved people in Portuguese and other European vessels.]]

Upon discovering new lands through their naval explorations, European colonisers soon began to migrate to and settle in lands outside their native continent. Off the coast of Africa, European migrants, under the directions of the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Conquest of the Canary Islands|invaded and colonised]] the [[Canary Islands]] during the 15th century, where they converted much of the land to the production of wine and sugar. Along with this, they also captured native Canary Islanders, the [[Guanches]], to use as slaves both on the Islands and across the Christian Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

As historian John Thornton remarked, "the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure or purchase of trade commodities".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Canary Islands as a naval base, Europeans, at the time primarily [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] traders, began to move their activities down the western coast of Africa, performing raids in which slaves would be captured to be later sold in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially successful in this venture, "it was not long before African naval forces were alerted to the new dangers, and the Portuguese [raiding] ships began to meet strong and effective resistance", with the crews of several of them being killed by African sailors, whose boats were better equipped at traversing the west African coasts and river systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1494, the Portuguese king had entered agreements with the rulers of several West African states that would allow trade between their respective peoples, enabling the Portuguese to "tap into" the "well-developed commercial economy in Africa ... without engaging in hostilities".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; "Peaceful trade became the rule all along the African coast", although there were some rare exceptions when acts of aggression led to violence. For instance, Portuguese traders attempted to conquer the [[Bissagos Islands]] in 1535.&lt;ref name="Thornton ,1998. p. 39"&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1571 Portugal, supported by the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], took control of the south-western region of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] in order to secure its threatened economic interest in the area. Although Kongo later joined a coalition in 1591 to force the Portuguese out, Portugal had secured a foothold on the continent that it continued to occupy until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these incidences of occasional violence between African and European forces, many African states ensured that any trade went on in their own terms, for instance, imposing custom duties on foreign ships. In 1525, the Kongolese king, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]], seized a French vessel and its crew for illegally trading on his coast.&lt;ref name="Thornton ,1998. p. 39" /&gt;

Historians have widely debated the nature of the relationship between these African kingdoms and the European traders. The Guyanese historian [[Walter Rodney]] (1972) has argued that it was an unequal relationship, with Africans being forced into a "colonial" trade with the more economically developed Europeans, exchanging raw materials and human resources (i.e. slaves) for manufactured goods. He argued that it was this economic trade agreement dating back to the 16th century that led to Africa being underdeveloped in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rod72|Rodney 1972]], pp. 95-113.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were supported by other historians, including Ralph Austen (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aus87|Austen 1987]], pp. 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of an unequal relationship was contested by John Thornton (1998), who argued that "the Atlantic slave trade was not nearly as critical to the African economy as these scholars believed" and that "African manufacturing [at this period] was more than capable of handling competition from preindustrial Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho98|Thornton 1998]], p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anne Bailey, commenting on Thornton's suggestion that Africans and Europeans were equal partners in the Atlantic slave trade, wrote:

{{quote|[T]o see Africans as partners implies equal terms and equal influence on the global and intercontinental processes of the trade. Africans had great influence on the continent itself, but they had no direct influence on the engines behind the trade in the capital firms, the shipping and insurance companies of Europe and America, or the plantation systems in Americas. They did not wield any influence on the building manufacturing centers of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Anne C. Bailey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YrIjNMu5_vsC&amp;q=Africans+were+equal+partners#v=snippet&amp;q=Africans%20were%20equal%20partners&amp;f=false ''African Voices of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Beyond the Silence and the Shame''], Beacon Press, 2005, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==16th, 17th and 18th centuries==

The Atlantic slave trade is customarily divided into two eras, known as the First and Second Atlantic Systems.

The First Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans to, primarily, South American colonies of the Portuguese and Spanish empires; it accounted for slightly more than 3% of all Atlantic slave trade. It started (on a significant scale) in about 1502&lt;ref&gt;Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760–1810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted until 1580 when [[Portugal]] was temporarily [[Iberian Union|united]] with [[Spain]]. While the Portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples, the Spanish empire relied on the [[asiento]] system, awarding merchants (mostly from other countries) the license to trade enslaved people to their colonies. During the first Atlantic system, most of these traders were Portuguese, giving them a near-monopoly during the era. Some Dutch, English, and French traders also participated in the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Emmer, ''The Dutch in the Atlantic Economy, 1580–1880. Trade, Slavery and Emancipation'' (1998), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; After the union, Portugal came under Spanish legislation that prohibited it from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier. It became a target for the traditional enemies of Spain, losing a large share of the trade to the Dutch, English, and French.

The Second Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans by mostly English, Portuguese, French and Dutch traders. The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Klein 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly more than 3% of the enslaved people exported from Africa were traded between 1450 and 1600, and 16% in the 17th century.

It is estimated that more than half of the entire slave trade took place during the 18th century, with the British, Portuguese and French being the main carriers of nine out of ten slaves abducted in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge World History of Slavery | publisher=Cambridge University Press |author1=Keith Bradley |author2=Paul Cartledge | year=2011 | pages=583 | isbn=0-521-84066-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1690s, the English were shipping the most slaves from West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hair|Law|1998|p=257}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained this position during the 18th century, becoming the biggest shippers of slaves across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christopher|2006|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, [[Angola]] had become one of the principal sources of the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3025792331/the-atlantic-slave-trade-from-angola-a-port-by-port|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade from Angola: A Port-by-Port Estimate of Slaves Embarked, 1701-1867|first=da Silva, Daniel B.|last=Domingues|date=1 January 2013|publisher=|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=46|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the British]] and [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|United States' ban]]s on the African slave trade in 1808, it declined, but the period after still accounted for 28.5% of the total volume of the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E., "The Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade. A Synthesis". In: Northrup, David (ed.): ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''. D.C. Heath and Company, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triangular trade===
{{Main|Triangular trade}}

The first side of the triangle was the export of goods from Europe to Africa. A number of African kings and merchants took part in the trading of enslaved people from 1440 to about 1833. For each captive, the African rulers would receive a variety of goods from Europe. These included guns, ammunition, and other factory-made goods. The second leg of the triangle exported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas and the Caribbean Islands. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas. The goods were the products of slave-labour plantations and included [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], [[molasses]] and [[rum]].&lt;ref name=Inikori&gt;{{cite book |title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe |first1=Joseph E. |last1=Inikori |first2=Stanley L. |last2=Engerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], considered the pioneer of the British slave trade, was the first to run the Triangular trade, making a profit at every stop.

===Labour and slavery===
[[File:BLAKE10.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Josiah Wedgwood#"Am I Not a Man and a Brother?"|"''Am I Not a Man and a Brother?''"]] 1787 medallion designed by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for the British anti-slavery campaign]]

The Atlantic Slave Trade was the result of, among other things, [[labour shortage]], itself in turn created by the desire of European colonists to exploit New World land and resources for capital profits. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] peoples were at first utilized as slave labour by Europeans until a large number died from overwork and [[Old World]] diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Through History |url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKpBPdn?url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative sources of labour, such as [[indentured servitude]], failed to provide a sufficient workforce.
Many crops could not be sold for profit, or even grown, in Europe. Exporting crops and goods from the New World to Europe often proved to be more profitable than producing them on the European mainland. A vast amount of labour was needed to create and sustain plantations that required intensive labour to grow, harvest, and process prized tropical crops. [[West Africa|Western Africa]] (part of which became known as "the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]"), Angola and nearby Kingdoms and later [[Central Africa]], became the source for enslaved people to meet the demand for labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/Kongo_History.htm|title=History Kingdom of Kongo|website=www.africafederation.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic reason for the constant shortage of labour was that, with large amounts of cheap land available and lots of landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves after a relatively short time, thus increasing the need for workers.&lt;ref&gt;Solow, Barbara (ed.). Slavery and the Rise of the Atlantic System, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Jefferson attributed the use of slave labour in part to the climate, and the consequent idle leisure afforded by slave labour: "For in a warm climate, no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefVirg.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=18&amp;division=div1|title=''Notes on the State of Virginia'' Query 18.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African participation in the slave trade===
[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gorée-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Slave traders in [[Gorée]], Senegal, 18th century]]
Africans played a direct role in the slave trade, selling their captives or prisoners of war to European buyers.&lt;ref name=afbis&gt;[http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm "Slave trade: a root of contemporary African Crisis"], Africa Economic Analysis 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners and captives who were sold were usually from neighbouring or enemy ethnic groups.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These captive slaves were considered "other", not part of the people of the ethnic group or "tribe"; African kings held no particular loyalty to them. Sometimes criminals would be sold so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans.&lt;ref name=afbis/&gt; But some African kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals. King [[Jaja of Opobo]], a former slave, refused to do business with the slavers completely. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Africans also participated in the slave trade through intermarriage, or ''[[cassare]]'', meaning "to set up house". It is derived from the Portuguese word "casar", meaning "to marry". Cassare created political and economic bonds between European and African slave traders. Cassare was a pre-European practice used to integrate the "other" from a differing African tribe. Powerful West African groups used these marriages as an alliance used to strengthen their trade networks with European men by marrying off African women from families with ties to the slave trade. Early on in the Atlantic Slave trade, these marriages were common. The marriages were even performed using African customs, which Europeans did not object to, seeing how important the connections were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ipsen|first1=Pernille|title=Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast|date=2015|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4673-5|pages=1, 21, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European participation in the slave trade===
Although Europeans were the market for slaves, Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of [[tropical diseases|disease]] and fierce African resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24159|title=Historical survey &gt; The international slave trade.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement, a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative. Since most of these nations did not have a prison system, convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local domestic slave market.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As of 1778, [[Thomas Kitchin]] estimated that Europeans were bringing an estimated 52,000 slaves to the Caribbean yearly, with the [[French people|French]] bringing the most Africans to the [[French West Indies]] (13,000 out of the yearly estimate).&lt;ref name=Kitchin1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R.

{{further|Slavery in Africa}}

Forms of slavery varied both in Africa and in the New World. In general, slavery in Africa was not heritable&amp;nbsp;– that is, the children of slaves were free&amp;nbsp;– while in the Americas, children of slave mothers were considered born into slavery. This was connected to another distinction: slavery in West Africa was not reserved for racial or religious minorities, as it was in European colonies, although the case was otherwise in places such as [[African slave trade#Slavery in Somalia|Somalia]], where [[Bantu people|Bantus]] were taken as slaves for the ethnic [[Somali people|Somalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Winant]] (2001), ''The World is a Ghetto: Race and Democracy Since World War II'', Basic Books, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'' (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of slaves in Africa was more variable than in the Americas. At one extreme, the kings of Dahomey routinely slaughtered slaves in hundreds or thousands in sacrificial rituals, and slaves as human sacrifices were also known in [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ed. (2005), ''Encyclopedia of African History,'' CRC Press, vol. 1, pp. 333–34; Nicolas Argenti (2007), ''The Intestines of the State: Youth, Violence and Belated Histories in the Cameroon Grassfields'', University of Chicago Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, slaves in other places were often treated as part of the family, "adopted children", with significant rights including the right to marry without their masters' permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgambia.com/information/slave-treatment-rights-privileges.html Rights &amp; Treatment of Slaves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223234940/http://accessgambia.com/information/slave-treatment-rights-privileges.html |date=2010-12-23 }}. Gambia Information Site.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] wrote:

{{quote|The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen. They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters ... The slaves which are thus brought from the interior may be divided into two distinct classes&amp;nbsp;– first, such as were slaves from their birth, having been born of enslaved mothers; secondly, such as were born free, but who afterwards, by whatever means, became slaves. Those of the first description are by far the most numerous ...&lt;ref&gt;Mungo Park, ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v. II, Chapter XXII - War and Slavery.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Americas, slaves were denied the right to marry freely and masters did not generally accept them as equal members of the family. New World slaves were considered the property of their owners, and slaves convicted of revolt or murder were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/negroplot/plotchronology.html The Negro Plot Trials: A Chronology.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722115800/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/negroplot/plotchronology.html |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slave market regions and participation===
[[File:Africa slave Regions.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th–19th centuries]]
There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the Western Hemisphere. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:&lt;ref name="Lovejoy"&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E. ''Transformations in Slavery''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] ([[Senegal]] and [[the Gambia]]): 4.8%
* [[Upper Guinea]] ([[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]): 4.1%
* [[Pepper Coast|Windward Coast]] ([[Liberia]] and [[Ivory Coast]]): 1.8%
* [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] ([[Ghana]] and east of [[Ivory Coast]]): 10.4%
* [[Bight of Benin]] ([[Togo]], [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]] west of the Niger Delta): 20.2%
* [[Bight of Biafra]] ([[Nigeria]] east of the [[Niger Delta]], [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]): 14.6%
* West Central Africa ([[Republic of Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Angola]]): 39.4%
* Southeastern Africa ([[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]]): 4.7%

Although the slave trade was largely global, there was considerable intracontinental slave trade in which 8 million people were enslaved within the African continent.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe|last=Inikori|first=Joseph|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who did move out of Africa, 8 million were forced out of Eastern Africa to be sent to Asia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===African kingdoms of the era===
[[File:Gezo (2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Ghezo]], King of [[Dahomey]], was under pressure from the British to end the slave trade]]
There were over 173 city-states and kingdoms in the African regions affected by the slave trade between 1502 and 1853 when [[Brazil]] became the last Atlantic import nation to outlaw the slave trade. Of those 173, no fewer than 68 could be deemed nation states with political and military infrastructures that enabled them to dominate their neighbours. Nearly every present-day nation had a pre-colonial predecessor, sometimes an [[African Empires|African Empire]] with which European traders had to barter.

====Ethnic groups====
The different ethnic groups brought to the Americas closely corresponds to the regions of heaviest activity in the slave trade. Over 45 distinct ethnic groups were taken to the Americas during the trade. Of the 45, the ten most prominent, according to slave documentation of the era are listed below.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Midlo Hall |first1= Gwendolyn |authorlink1= Gwendolyn Midlo Hall |title= Slavery and African Ethnicities in the Americas |url= http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=742 |accessdate= 2011-01-24 |edition= |series= |volume= |year= 2007 |origyear= |publisher= [[University of North Carolina Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8078-5862-2 |oclc= |doi= |page= {{page needed|date=January 2011}} |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human toll==
The transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet still unknown loss of life for African captives both in and outside America. Approximately 1.2&amp;nbsp;– 2.4 million Africans died during their transport to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6445941.stm Quick guide: The slave trade; Who were the slaves?] BBC News, 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; More died soon upon their arrival. The number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be enslaved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stannard, David. ''American Holocaust''. Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The savage nature of the trade led to the destruction of individuals and cultures. The following figures do not include deaths of enslaved Africans as a result of their labour, slave revolts, or diseases suffered while living among New World populations.

Historian [[Ana Lucia Araujo]] has noted that the process of enslavement did not end with arrival on the American shores; the different paths taken by the individuals and groups who were victims of the Atlantic slave trade were influenced by different factors—including the disembarking region, the kind of work performed, gender, age, religion, and language.&lt;ref&gt;''Paths of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Interactions, Identities, and Images''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates by Patrick Manning are that about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th century, but about 1.5 million died on board ship. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas. Besides the slaves who died on the Middle Passage, more Africans likely died during the slave raids in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young. Manning's estimate covers the 12 million who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million destined for Asian slave markets and the 8 million destined for African markets.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, "The Slave Trade: The Formal Dermographics of a Global System" in Joseph E. Inikori and Stanley L. Engerman (eds), ''The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe'' (Duke University Press, 1992), pp. 117-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=abvkqNGSTZ0C&amp;pg=PA119 online at pp. 119-20.]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the slaves shipped to [[Americas|The Americas]], the largest share went to Brazil and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus.

===African conflicts===
[[File:Slave ship diagram.png|right|thumb|Diagram of a slave ship from the Atlantic slave trade. From an Abstract of Evidence delivered before a select committee of the House of Commons in 1790 and 1791.]]
[[File:Thomas-Clarkson-De-kreet-der-Afrikanen MG 1315.tif|thumb|Diagram of a large slave ship. [[Thomas Clarkson]]: ''The cries of Africa to the inhabitants of Europe'', 1822?]]
According to Kimani Nehusi, the presence of European slavers affected the way in which the legal code in African societies responded to offenders. Crimes traditionally punishable by some other form of punishment became punishable by enslavement and sale to slave traders.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to [[David Stannard]]'s ''American Holocaust'', 50% of African deaths occurred in Africa as a result of wars between native kingdoms, which produced the majority of slaves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; This includes not only those who died in battles but also those who died as a result of forced marches from inland areas to slave ports on the various coasts.&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;Gomez, Michael A. ''Exchanging Our Country Marks''. Chapel Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of enslaving enemy combatants and their villages was widespread throughout Western and West Central Africa, although wars were rarely started to procure slaves. The slave trade was largely a by-product of tribal and state [[war]]fare as a way of removing potential dissidents after victory or financing future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John. ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400–1800'', Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some African groups proved particularly adept and brutal at the practice of enslaving, such as [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], [[Benin]], [[Igala people|Igala]], [[Kaabu]], [[Asanteman]], [[Dahomey]], the [[Aro Confederacy]] and the [[Imbangala]] war bands.&lt;ref&gt;Stride, G. T., and C. Ifeka. ''Peoples and Empires of West Africa: West Africa in History 1000–1800''. Nelson, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In letters written by the [[Manikongo]], [[Afonso I of Kongo|Nzinga Mbemba Afonso]], to the King [[João III of Portugal|João III]] of [[Portugal]], he writes that Portuguese merchandise flowing in is what is fueling the trade in Africans. He requests the King of Portugal to stop sending merchandise but should only send missionaries. In one of his letters he writes:

{{quote|Each day the traders are kidnapping our people—children of this country, sons of our nobles and vassals, even people of our own family. This corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated. We need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise, unless it is wine and flour for Mass. It is our wish that this Kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves ...

Many of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains. To satisfy this inordinate appetite, they seize many of our black free subjects ... They sell them. After having taken these prisoners [to the coast] secretly or at night ... As soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot iron.&lt;ref name="Adam Hochschild 1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa]]|first=Adam|last=Hochschild |authorlink=Adam Hochschild|isbn=0-618-00190-5|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], slavery had already existed in [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]. [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso]] believed that the slave trade should be subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote to King João III in 1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~winthrop/Thornton.html Winthrop, reading by John Thornton, "African Political Ethics and the Slave Trade"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316075617/http://www.millersville.edu/~winthrop/Thornton.html |date=March 16, 2010 }}, Millersville College.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Dahomey]] sold [[POW|war captives]] into transatlantic slavery; they would otherwise have been killed in a ceremony known as the [[The annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]]. As one of West Africa's principal slave states, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museeouidah.org/Theme-Dahomey.htm Museum Theme: The Kingdom of Dahomey], Musee Ouidah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-149772/Dahomey "Dahomey (historical kingdom, Africa)"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalcall.com/national/slave_trade10-08-2002.htm "Benin seeks forgiveness for role in slave trade"], ''Final Call'', 8 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Bambara Empire]] to the east, the [[Khasso]] kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the [[Europe]]an settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the [[France|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histoire-afrique.org/article76.html?artsuite=5 Le Mali précolonial.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201193105/http://www.histoire-afrique.org/article76.html?artsuite=5 |date=2011-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benin Empire|Benin]] grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the "Slave Coast".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter7.shtml ''The Story of Africa''], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Gezo of [[Dahomey]] said in the 1840s:

{{quote|The slave trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth ... the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Anglo-American Magazine|date=July–December 1854|volume=V|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qDQiAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%27%27The+slave+trade+is+the+ruling+principle+of+my+people.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the Bill that abolished the trading of slaves. The King of Bonny (now in [[Nigeria]]) was horrified at the conclusion of the practice:

{{quote|We think this trade must go on. That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml African Slave Owners], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Port factories===
After being marched to the coast for sale, enslaved people were held in large forts called factories. The amount of time in factories varied, but [[Milton Meltzer]] states in ''Slavery: A World History'' that around 4.5% of deaths attributed to the transatlantic slave trade occurred during this phase.&lt;ref name = dup2/&gt; In other words, over 820,000 people are believed to have died in African ports such as [[Benguela]], [[Elmina]], and [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]], reducing the number of those shipped to 17.5 million.&lt;ref name=dup2&gt;Meltzer, Milton. ''Slavery: A World History''. Da Capo Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic shipment===
[[File:A Liverpool Slave Ship by William Jackson.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''A Liverpool Slave Ship'' by William Jackson. [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]]]]
After being captured and held in the factories, slaves entered the infamous [[Middle Passage]]. Meltzer's research puts this phase of the slave trade's overall mortality at 12.5%.&lt;ref name="dup2" /&gt; Their deaths were the result of brutal treatment and poor care from the time of their capture and throughout their voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolfe|first1=Brendan|title=Slave Ships and the Middle Passage|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Slave_Ships_and_the_Middle_Passage|website=encyclopediavirginia.org|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2.2 million Africans died during these voyages where they were packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time. Measures were taken to stem the onboard mortality rate, such as enforced "dancing" (as exercise) above deck and the practice of force-feeding enslaved persons who tried to starve themselves.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; The conditions on board also resulted in the spread of fatal diseases. Other fatalities were suicides, slaves who escaped by jumping overboard.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; The slave traders would try to fit anywhere from 350 to 600 slaves on one ship. Before the African slave trade was completely banned by participating nations in 1853, 15.3 million enslaved people had arrived in the Americas.

Raymond L. Cohn, an economics professor whose research has focused on [[economic history]] and [[international migration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ilstu.edu/vitas/rlcohn.html|title=Raymond L. Cohn.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622201438/http://www.econ.ilstu.edu/vitas/rlcohn.html|archivedate=2007-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has researched the [[mortality rate]]s among Africans during the voyages of the Atlantic slave trade. He found that mortality rates decreased over the history of the slave trade, primarily because the length of time necessary for the voyage was declining. "In the eighteenth century many slave voyages took at least 2½ months. In the nineteenth century, 2 months appears to have been the maximum length of the voyage, and many voyages were far shorter. Fewer slaves died in the Middle Passage over time mainly because the passage was shorter."&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Raymond L. "Deaths of Slaves in the Middle Passage", ''Journal of Economic History'', September 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the vast profits of slavery, the ordinary sailors on [[slave ship]]s were badly paid and subject to harsh discipline. Mortality of around 20% was expected in a ship's crew during the course of a voyage; this was due to disease, flogging, overwork or slave uprisings.&lt;ref name="Edwards(Captain.)2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernard Edwards|author2=Bernard Edwards (Captain.)|title=Royal Navy Versus the Slave Traders: Enforcing Abolition at Sea 1808-1898|year=2007|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Books|isbn=978-1-84415-633-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disease (malaria or yellow fever) was the most common cause of death among sailors. A high crew mortality rate on the return voyage was in the captain's interests as it reduced the number of sailors who had to be paid on reaching the home port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bury the Chains: Prophets, Slaves, and Rebels in the First Human Rights Crusade |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |date=2005 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0618104690|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slave trade was hated by many sailors and those who joined the crews of slave ships often did so through coercion or because they could find no other employment.&lt;ref name="Rediker2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Rediker|title=The Slave Ship: A Human History|date=4 October 2007|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4406-2084-3|pages=138–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasoning camps===
Meltzer also states that 33% of Africans would have died in the first year at the [[Seasoning (slave)|seasoning camps]] found throughout the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="dup2" /&gt; [[Jamaica]] held one of the most notorious of these camps. [[Dysentery]] was the leading cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Diseases ==
Notable diseases not originally known as present in Americas before 1492 include those such as smallpox, malaria, bubonic plague, typhus, influenza, measles, diphtheria, yellow fever, and whooping cough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182560175|title=Epidemics and enslavement : biological catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715|last=Paul.|first=Kelton,|date=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803215573|location=Lincoln|oclc=182560175}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Atlantic slave trade]] following the discovery of the [[New World]], diseases such as these possessed the capability of obliterating populations such as the Natives by the masses as short amount of time as a few weeks or months.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25710386|title=Epidemics in the modern world|last=P.|first=Krieg, Joann|date=1992|publisher=Twayne Publishers|isbn=0805788522|location=New York|oclc=25710386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
[[Smallpox]] was one of the epidemics that surrounded the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Diseases like smallpox were known for causing a significant decrease in the indigenous population of the [[New World]]. An explanation to aid in understanding the logistics behind the extensive population decrease includes the topic of immunity. The native population was not immune to this disease in that they did not have the pathogen required to resist the disease. Those such as the European colonizers and the African slaves brought to the New World, however, did possess this pathogen due to having been previously exposed to smallpox. It was known to be a common illness many underwent as children, which in turn built up their immunity to withstand this disease. As a result of the Native Americans no longer being able to work the lands (as the labor required them to mine gold and silver), European colonizers, such as the Portuguese took advantage of their access to regions of the African continent such as Angola from which to extract another source of labor in which Africans had proven to be prime candidates in that they survived this case of the disease- also known as ''variola intermedius-'' while the Natives had continued to fall to the various illnesses.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47009810|title=Epidemics and history : disease, power, and imperialism|last=J.),|first=Watts, S. J. (Sheldon|date=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0585356203|location=New Haven|oclc=47009810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects of smallpox included fever, bodily eruptions, and was very noticeable in the disfigurement seen of the face, hands, and feet. This illness is a viral disease -contracted through contact with an exposed individual and through the air. Being that it is a virus, that there are no specific drug treatments to combat it such as those that later arose to combat bacterial infections such as [[Syphilis]]. In terms of image, many-such as those who believed the plague of syphilis in Europe to be the fault of the Amerindians- saw smallpox as the European revenge against the Natives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Immunity ===
For many diseases, the African and Eurasian population were able to have already acquired immunity- being able to resist an infection- due to prior exposure as children in which they were less likely to receive the same illness again. Upon arrival, these diseases were transmitted to the Native populations who did not have immunity due to no prior exposure having been from climates in which these germs, and pathogens surrounding these diseases were not common. Having been exposed to the illness as an adult, some effects would prove to be more enhanced than if they were to be at an adolescent age.

Evolutionary history also played a role in being immune to the diseases of the slave trade. Compared to African and Europeans, New World populations did not have a history of exposure to the disease, and therefore, no genetic resistance could be maintained as a result of adaptation through [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Disease Makes History: Epidemics and Great Historical Turning Points|last=Diamond|first=Jared|last2=Panosian|first2=Claire|publisher=Helsinki University Press|year=2006|isbn=9515706408|editor-last=Hämäläinen|editor-first=Pekka|location=Helsinki|pages=18-19, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels and extent of immunity varies from disease to disease. For smallpox and measles for example, those who survive are equipped with the cellular immunity to combat the disease for the rest of their life in that they cannot contract the disease again. There are also diseases in which immunity does not guarantee that an individual is not susceptible to becoming reinfected.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Inoculation ===
Due to a limited knowledge on the causation and range of effects of diseases surrounding the event of the slave trade, there were little to no methods for inoculation present during the time. In the late 16th century with the increased presence of smallpox, there existed some forms of inoculation or sometimes referred to as variolation in Africa and the Middle East. One practice features Arab traders in Africa "buying-off" the disease in which a cloth that had been previously exposed to the sickness was to be tied to another child's arm to increase immunity. Another practice involved taking pus from a smallpox scab and putting it in the cut of a healthy individual in an attempt to have a mild case of the disease in the future rather than the effects becoming fatal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As epidemiology advances, causes and effective treatments are being discovered to combat historically destructive diseases such as syphilis- which in today can be treated with simple antibiotics such as penicillin and other medications that can inhibit and rid the body of harmful bacteria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==European competition==
The trade of enslaved Africans in the Atlantic has its origins in the explorations of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century. Before that, contact with African slave markets was made to ransom Portuguese who had been captured by the intense North African [[Barbary pirate]] attacks on Portuguese ships and coastal villages, frequently leaving them depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Europeans to use enslaved Africans in the New World were the [[Spaniards]], who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]. The alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them (Laws of Burgos, 1512–13). The first enslaved Africans arrived in Hispaniola in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html Health In Slavery.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003165601/http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html |date=2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Portugal]] had succeeded in establishing sugar plantations (''engenhos'') in northern [[Brazil]] ca. 1545, Portuguese merchants on the West African coast began to supply enslaved Africans to the sugar planters. While at first these planters had relied almost exclusively on the native [[Tupi people|Tupani]] for slave labour, after 1570 they began importing Africans, as a series of [[epidemics]] had decimated the already destabilized Tupani communities. By 1630, Africans had replaced the Tupani as the largest contingent of labour on Brazilian sugar plantations. This ended the European medieval household tradition of [[medieval slavery|slavery]]&lt;!--Explain--&gt;, resulted in Brazil's receiving the most enslaved Africans, and revealed sugar cultivation and processing as the reason that roughly 84% of these Africans were shipped to the New World.

The first slaves to arrive as part of a labour force in the New World reached the island of [[Hispaniola]] (now [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]) in 1502. [[Cuba]] received its first four slaves in 1513. [[Jamaica]] received its first shipment of 4000 slaves in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynter | first1 = Sylvia | year = 1984a | title = New Seville and the Conversion Experience of Bartolomé de Las Casas: Part One | url = | journal = Jamaica Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 25–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slave exports to [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]] started in 1526.

The first enslaved Africans to reach what would become the United States arrived in July{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} 1526 as part of a Spanish attempt to colonize [[San Miguel de Gualdape]]. By November the 300 Spanish colonists were reduced to 100, and their slaves from 100 to 70{{why?|date = August 2014}}. The enslaved people revolted in 1526 and joined a nearby Native American tribe, while the Spanish abandoned the colony altogether (1527). The area of the future [[Colombia]] received its first enslaved people in 1533. [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Florida]] began their stints in the slave trade in 1541, 1563 and 1581, respectively.

The 17th century saw an increase in shipments. Africans arrived in the English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia in 1619. The first kidnapped Africans in English North America were classed as indentured servants and freed after seven years. Virginia law codified chattel slavery in 1656, and in 1662 the colony adopted the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which classified children of slave mothers as slaves, regardless of paternity. Irish immigrants took slaves to [[Montserrat]] in 1651, and in 1655 slaves were shipped{{by whom|date=October 2016}} to [[Belize]].

By 1802, Russian colonists noted that "Boston" (U.S.-based) skippers were trading African slaves for otter pelts with the [[Tlingit people]] in [[Southeast Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Dauenhauer&gt;{{Cite book

==Economics of slavery==
[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Slaves processing tobacco in 17th-century Virginia]]

In France in the 18th century, returns for investors in plantations averaged around 6%; as compared to 5% for most domestic alternatives, this represented a 20% profit advantage. Risks—maritime and commercial—were important for individual voyages. Investors mitigated it by buying small shares of many ships at the same time. In that way, they were able to diversify a large part of the risk away. Between voyages, ship shares could be freely sold and bought.&lt;ref&gt;Daudin 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most financially profitable West Indian colonies in 1800 belonged to the United Kingdom. After entering the sugar colony business late, British naval supremacy and control over key islands such as [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]], the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]] and the territory of [[British Guiana]] gave it an important edge over all competitors; while many British did not make gains, a handful of individuals made small fortunes. This advantage was reinforced when France lost its most important colony, [[St. Domingue]] (western Hispaniola, now Haiti), to a slave revolt in 1791&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h34-np2.html|title=Haiti, 1789 to 1806|website=www.fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported revolts against its rival Britain, after the 1793 French revolution in the name of liberty. Before 1791, British sugar had to be protected to compete against cheaper French sugar.

After 1791, the British islands produced the most sugar, and the British people quickly became the largest consumers. West Indian sugar became ubiquitous as an additive to Indian tea. It has been estimated that the profits of the slave trade and of [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations created up to one-in-twenty of every pound circulating in the [[Economic history of Britain|British economy]] at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the latter half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=104 Digital History.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226000000/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Rodney]] has argued that at the start of the slave trade in the 16th century, although there was a technological gap between Europe and Africa, it was not very substantial. Both continents were using Iron Age technology. The major advantage that Europe had was in ship building. During the period of slavery, the populations of Europe and the Americas grew exponentially, while the population of Africa remained stagnant. Rodney contended that the profits from slavery were used to fund economic growth and technological advancement in Europe and the Americas. Based on earlier theories by Eric Williams, he asserted that the industrial revolution was at least in part funded by agricultural profits from the Americas. He cited examples such as the [[Timeline of historic inventions|invention]] of the steam engine by [[James Watt]], which was funded by plantation owners from the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="WalterRodney"&gt;[[Walter Rodney]], ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]''. {{ISBN|0950154644}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians have attacked both Rodney's methodology and accuracy. [[Joseph C. Miller]] has argued that the social change and demographic stagnation (which he researched on the example of West Central Africa) was caused primarily by domestic factors. Joseph Inikori provided a new line of argument, estimating counterfactual demographic developments in case the Atlantic slave trade had not existed. Patrick Manning has shown that the slave trade did have a profound impact on African demographics and social institutions, but criticized Inikori's approach for not taking other factors (such as famine and drought) into account, and thus being highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick: "Contours of Slavery and Social change in Africa". In: Northrup, David (ed.): ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''. D.C. Heath &amp; Company, 1994, pp. 148–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the economy of West Africa===
{{POV section|date=December 2013}}
[[File:Different cowries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cowrie]] shells were used as money in the slave trade]]
No scholars dispute the harm done to the enslaved people but the effect of the trade on African societies is much debated, due to the apparent influx of goods to Africans. Proponents of the slave trade, such as [[Archibald Dalzel]], argued that African societies were robust and not much affected by the trade. In the 19th century, European [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], most prominently Dr. [[David Livingstone]], took the opposite view, arguing that the fragile local economy and societies were being severely harmed by the trade.

Because the negative effects of slavery on the economies of Africa have been well documented, namely the significant decline in population, some African rulers likely saw an economic benefit from trading their subjects with European slave traders. With the exception of Portuguese controlled Angola, coastal African leaders "generally controlled access to their coasts, and were able to prevent direct enslavement of their subjects and citizens".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thornton, John. ''A Cultural History of the Atlantic World 1250-1820.'' 2012, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as African scholar John Thornton argues, African leaders who allowed the continuation of the slave trade likely derived an economic benefit from selling their subjects to Europeans. The Kingdom of Benin, for instance, participated in the African slave trade, at will, from 1715 to 1735, surprising Dutch traders, who had not expected to buy slaves in Benin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The benefit derived from trading slaves for European goods was enough to make the Kingdom of Benin rejoin the trans-Atlantic slave trade after centuries of non-participation. Such benefits included military technology (specifically guns and gunpowder), gold, or simply maintaining amicable trade relationships with European nations. The slave trade was, therefore, a means for some African elites to gain economic advantages.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fage, J. D. "Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History", ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10. No 3, 1969, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Rodney]] estimates that by c.1770, the King of [[Dahomey]] was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling captive African soldiers and enslaved people to the European slave-traders. Many West African countries also already had a tradition of holding slaves, which was expanded into trade with Europeans.

The Atlantic trade brought new crops to Africa and also more efficient currencies which were adopted by the West African merchants. This can be interpreted as an institutional reform which reduced the cost of doing business. But the developmental benefits were limited as long as the business including slaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=321|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Thornton and Fage contend that while African political elite may have ultimately benefited from the slave trade, their decision to participate may have been influenced more by what they could lose by not participating. In Fage's article "Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History", he notes that for West Africans "... there were really few effective means of mobilizing labour for the economic and political needs of the state" without the slave trade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Effects on the British economy===
{{further|Historiography of the British Empire#Slavery}}
[[File:Joseph Cross, The Impolicy of Slavery, 1823 Cornell CUL PJM 1039 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|This map argues that import prohibitions and high duties on sugar were artificially inflating prices and inhibiting manufacturing in England. 1823]]
Historian [[Eric Williams]] in 1944 argued that the profits that Britain received from its sugar colonies, or from the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean, was a major factor in financing Britain's industrial revolution. However, he says that by the time of its abolition in 1833 it had lost its profitability and it was in Britain's economic interest to ban it.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Williams, ''Capitalism &amp; Slavery'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1944), pp. 98–107, 169–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers and historians have strongly contested what has come to be referred to as the "Williams thesis" in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;David Richardson, "The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660-1807," in P. J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 440-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Stanley Engerman]] finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] during any year of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name="The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanley L. Engerman|title=The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=3113341 | volume=46|pages=430–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income.&lt;ref name="The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century"/&gt; Historian [[Richard Pares]], in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before.&lt;ref name="The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Pares|title=The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire|jstor=2590147 | volume=7|pages=119–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Drescher and Robert Anstey argue the slave trade remained profitable until the end, and that moralistic reform, not economic incentive, was primarily responsible for abolition. They say slavery remained profitable in the 1830s because of innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Ward, "The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition," in P. J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 415-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] in his influential economic history of capitalism ''[[Das Kapital]]'' wrote that "... the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production". He argued that the slave trade was part of what he termed the "primitive accumulation" of capital, the 'non-capitalist' accumulation of wealth that preceded and created the financial conditions for Britain's industrialisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Chapter Thirty-One: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm|work=Karl Marx: Capital Volume One|accessdate=21 February 2014|quote=the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
[[File:Agostino Brunias - A Linen Market with a Linen-stall and Vegetable Seller in the West Indies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A Linen Market with enslaved Africans. West Indies, circa 1780]]
The demographic effects of the slave trade is a controversial and highly debated issue. Although scholars such as Paul Adams and Erick D. Langer have estimated that sub-Saharan Africa represented about 18 percent of the world's population in 1600 and only 6 percent in 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiencing World History|last=Adams|first=Paul|last2=Hwa|first2=Lily|publisher=New York University Press|year=2000|location=New York|pages=334|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reasons for this demographic shift have been the subject of much debate. In addition to the depopulation Africa experienced because of the slave trade, African nations were left with severely imbalanced gender ratios, with females comprising up to 65 percent of the population in hard-hit areas such as Angola.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, many scholars (such as Barbara N. Ramusack) have suggested a link between the prevalence of prostitution in Africa today with the temporary marriages that were enforced during the course of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Asia: Restoring Women to History|last=Ramusack|first=Barbara|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Rodney]] argued that the export of so many people had been a demographic disaster which left Africa permanently disadvantaged when compared to other parts of the world, and it largely explains the continent's continued poverty.&lt;ref name="WalterRodney"/&gt; He presented numbers showing that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while those of Europe and [[Asia]] grew dramatically. According to Rodney, all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving, and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.

Others have challenged this view. [[J. D. Fage]] compared the demographic effect on the continent as a whole. David Eltis has compared the numbers to the rate of [[emigration]] from [[Europe]] during this period. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas, a far higher rate than were ever taken from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis, ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars accused Walter Rodney of mischaracterizing the trade between Africans and Europeans. They argue that Africans, or more accurately African elites, deliberately let European traders join in an already large trade in enslaved people and that they were not patronized.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John. ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800''. Cambridge University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joseph E. Inikori argues, the history of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African economic model of the period was very different from the European model, and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Inikori, "Ideology versus the Tyranny of Paradigm: Historians and the Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on African Societies", ''African Economic History'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of racism===
[[File:Agostino Brunias - West Indian Creole woman, with her Black Servant - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Indian [[Creole peoples|Creole]] woman, with her black servant, circa 1780]]

[[Walter Rodney]] states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role of slavery in promoting racist prejudice and ideology has been carefully studied in certain situations, especially in the USA. The simple fact is that no people can enslave another for four centuries without coming out with a notion of superiority, and when the colour and other physical traits of those peoples were quite different it was inevitable that the prejudice should take a racist form.&lt;ref name="WalterRodney"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Eric Williams]] argued that "A racial twist [was] given to what is basically an economic phenomenon. Slavery was not born of racism: rather, racism was the consequence of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Eric |year=1994 |origyear=1944 |title=Capitalism and Slavery |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B6AWWVGBaswC&amp;pg=PA7 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, America, Portugal and in parts of Europe, opposition developed against the slave trade. Davis says that abolitionists assumed "that an end to slave imports would lead automatically to the amelioration and gradual abolition of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution: 1770–1823'' (1975), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as [[William Wilberforce]]. Many people joined the movement and they began to protest against the trade, but they were opposed by the owners of the colonial holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Society of Friends Subject Guide: Abolition of the Slave Trade.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Lord Mansfield]]'s decision in 1772, slaves became free upon entering the British isles.&lt;ref name="CUP"&gt;Paul E.

The [[Royal Navy]] moved to stop other nations from continuing the slave trade and declared that slaving was equal to [[piracy]] and was punishable by death. The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited the building or outfitting of ships in the U.S. for use in the slave trade. In 1807 Congress [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|outlawed the importation of slaves]] beginning on 1 January 1808, the earliest date permitted by the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|United States Constitution]] for such a ban.

[[William Wilberforce]] was a driving force in the British Parliament in the fight against the slave trade in the [[British Empire]]. On 22 February 1807, the House of Commons passed a motion 283 votes to 16 to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. The United States abolished the slave trade the same year, but not its [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]] which became the dominant character in American slavery until the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Marcyliena H.

The last recorded slave ship to land on U.S. soil was the [[Clotilde (slave ship)|''Clotilde'']], which in 1859 illegally smuggled a number of Africans into the town of [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/july05/|title=Question of the Month&amp;nbsp;– Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Africans on board were sold as slaves; however, slavery in the U.S. was [[abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] five years later following the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. The last survivor of the voyage was [[Cudjoe Lewis]], who died in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0195311043/ |title=Dreams of Africa in Alabama: The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Story of the Last Africans Brought to America |isbn=0-19-531104-3 |first=Sylvianne |last=Diouf|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last country to ban the Atlantic slave trade was [[Brazil]] in 1831. However, a vibrant illegal trade continued to ship large numbers of enslaved people to Brazil and also to Cuba until the 1860s, when British enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the Atlantic slave trade. In 1870 Portugal ended the last trade route with the Americas where the last country to import slaves was Brazil. In Brazil, however, slavery itself was not ended until 1888, making it the last country in the Americas to end involuntary servitude.

The historian Walter Rodney contends that it was a decline in the profitability of the triangular trades that made it possible for certain basic human sentiments to be asserted at the decision-making level in a number of European countries- Britain being the most crucial because it was the greatest carrier of African captives across the Atlantic. Rodney states that changes in productivity, technology, and patterns of exchange in Europe and the Americas informed the decision by the British to end their participation in the trade in 1807. In 1809 President [[James Madison]] outlawed the slave trade with the United States.

Nevertheless, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, M., and A. Negri(2000), ''Empire'', Cambridge, Mass, Harvard University Press, pp. 114-128.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it was neither a strictly economic nor moral matter. First, because slavery was (in practice) still beneficial to capitalism, providing not only an influx of capital but also disciplining hardship into workers (a form of "apprenticeship" to the capitalist industrial plant). The more "recent" argument of a "moral shift" (the basis of the previous lines of this article) is described by Hardt and Negri as an "ideological" apparatus in order to eliminate the sentiment of guilt in western society. Although moral arguments did play a secondary role, they usually had major resonance when used as a strategy to undercut competitors' profits. This argument holds that Eurocentric history has been blind to the most important element in this fight for emancipation, precisely, the constant revolt and the antagonism of slaves' revolts. The most important of those being the [[Haitian Revolution]]. The shock of this revolution in 1804, certainly introduces an essential political argument into the end of the slave trade, which happened only three years later.

==Legacy==

===African diaspora===
[[File:Debret casa ciganos.jpg|thumb|House slaves in [[Brazil]] c. 1820, by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]]]]
The [[African diaspora]] which was created via slavery has been a complex interwoven part of American history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/|title=Africans in America|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the success of [[Alex Haley]]'s book ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'', published in 1976, and the subsequent television miniseries based upon it ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] in January 1977, led to an increased interest and appreciation of African heritage amongst the [[African-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han06|Handley 2006]], pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these led many African Americans to begin researching their [[family history|family histories]] and making visits to West Africa. In turn, a tourist industry grew up to supply them. One notable example of this is through the [[Roots Homecoming Festival]] held annually in the [[Gambia]], in which rituals are held through which African Americans can symbolically "come home" to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han06|Handley 2006]], pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of dispute have however developed between African Americans and African authorities over how to display historic sites that were involved in the Atlantic slave trade, with prominent voices in the former criticising the latter for not displaying such sites sensitively, but instead treating them as a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ose06|Osei-Tutu 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Back to Africa"===
In 1816, a group of wealthy European-Americans, some of whom were abolitionists and others who were racial segregationists, founded the [[American Colonization Society]] with the express desire of returning African Americans who were in the United States to West Africa. In 1820, they sent their first ship to [[Liberia]], and within a decade around two thousand African Americans had been settled in the west African country. Such re-settlement continued throughout the 19th century, increasing following the deterioration of race relations in the southern states of the US following [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han06|Handley 2006]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rastafari movement===
The [[Rastafari movement]], which originated in [[Jamaica]], where 98% of the population are descended from victims of the Atlantic slave trade, has made great efforts to publicize the slavery and to ensure it is not forgotten, especially through [[reggae]] music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/reggae.shtml "Reggae and slavery"], BBC, 9 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologies===

====Worldwide====
In 1998, [[UNESCO]] designated 23 August as [[International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition]]. Since then there have been a number of events recognizing the effects of slavery.

At the 2001 [[World Conference Against Racism]] in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], African nations demanded a clear apology for slavery from the former slave-trading countries. Some nations were ready to express an apology, but the opposition, mainly from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United States]] blocked attempts to do so. A fear of monetary compensation might have been one of the reasons for the opposition. As of 2009, efforts are underway to create a [[UN Slavery Memorial]] as a permanent remembrance of the victims of the Atlantic slave trade.

====Benin====
In 1999, President [[Mathieu Kerekou]] of [[Benin]] (formerly the Kingdom of [[Dahomey]]) issued a national apology for the role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"], ''The New York Times'', 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luc Gnacadja]], minister of environment and housing for Benin, later said: "The slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it."&lt;ref name="dahomey"&gt;"[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-01/news/0005010158_1_slave-trade-benin-president-mathieu-kerekou Benin Officials Apologize For Role In U.S. Slave Trade"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 1 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate that 3 million slaves were exported out of the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] bordering the [[Bight of Benin]].&lt;ref name="dahomey"/&gt;

====France====
On 30 January 2006, [[Jacques Chirac]] (the then French President) said that 10 May would henceforth be a national day of remembrance for the victims of slavery in [[France]], marking the day in 2001 when France passed a law recognising slavery as a [[crime against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4662442.stm "Chirac names slavery memorial day"]. [[BBC News]], 30 January 2006. Accessed 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ghana====
President [[Jerry Rawlings]] of [[Ghana]] also apologized for his country's involvement in the slave trade.&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt;

====Netherlands====
At a UN conference on the Atlantic slave trade in 2001, the Dutch Minister for Urban Policy and Integration of Ethnic Minorities [[Roger van Boxtel]] said that the Netherlands "recognizes the grave injustices of the past." On 1 July 2013, at the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the Dutch West Indies, the Dutch government expressed "deep regret and remorse" for the involvement of the Netherlands in the Atlantic slave trade. The Dutch government has remained short of a formal apology for its involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, as an apology implies that it considers its own actions of the past as unlawful, and could lead to litigation for monetary compensation by descendants of the enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bnr.nl/incoming/10120016/bnr-juridische-zaken-geen-excuses-want-slavernij-mogelijk-niet-onrechtmatig |title=BNR Juridische Zaken {{!}} 'Geen excuses want slavernij mogelijk niet onrechtmatig' |last=van Heeteren |first=Renee |date=25 June 2013 |website= |publisher=BNR Nieuwsradio |access-date=8 March 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nigeria====
In 2009, the Civil Rights Congress of [[Nigeria]] has written an open letter to all [[Tribal chief|African chieftains]] who participated in trade calling for an apology for their role in the Atlantic slave trade: "We cannot continue to blame the white men, as Africans, particularly the traditional rulers, are not blameless. In view of the fact that the Americans and Europe have accepted the cruelty of their roles and have forcefully apologized, it would be logical, reasonable and humbling if African traditional rulers ... [can] accept blame and formally apologize to the descendants of the victims of their collaborative and exploitative slave trade."&lt;ref name=SmithGuardian /&gt;

====Uganda====
In 1998, President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of [[Uganda]] called tribal chieftains to apologize for their involvement in the slave trade: "African chiefs were the ones waging war on each other and capturing their own people and selling them. If anyone should apologise it should be the African chiefs. We still have those traitors here even today."&lt;ref name=SmithGuardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=David|title=African chiefs urged to apologise for slave trade|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/18/africans-apologise-slave-trade|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
On 9 December 1999, [[Liverpool City Council]] passed a formal motion apologizing for the City's part in the slave trade. It was unanimously agreed that [[Liverpool]] acknowledges its responsibility for its involvement in three centuries of the slave trade. The City Council has made an unreserved apology for Liverpool's involvement and the continual effect of slavery on Liverpool's black communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Museums Liverpool]], [http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/srd/liverpool.aspx "Liverpool and the transatlantic slave trade"]. Accessed 31 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2006, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] made a partial apology for Britain's role in the African slavery trade. However African rights activists denounced it as "empty rhetoric" that failed to address the issue properly. They feel his apology stopped shy to prevent any legal retort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6185176.stm "Blair 'sorrow' over slave trade"]. BBC News, 27 November 2006. Accessed 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair again apologized on March 14, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6451793.stm "Blair 'sorry' for UK slavery role"]. BBC News, 14 March 2007. Accessed 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2007, [[Ken Livingstone]] ([[Mayor of London]]) apologized publicly for London's role in the [[slave trade]]. "You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery", he said pointing towards the financial district, before breaking down in tears. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. [[Jesse Jackson]] praised Mayor Livingstone and added that reparations should be made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=477337&amp;in_page_id=1770 "Livingstone breaks down in tears at slave trade memorial"].

====United States====
On 24 February 2007, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed House Joint Resolution Number 728&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?071+ful+HJ728H2 House Joint Resolution Number 728]. [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]. Accessed 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging "with profound regret the involuntary servitude of Africans and the exploitation of Native Americans, and call for reconciliation among all Virginians". With the passing of that resolution, [[Virginia]] became the first of the 50 United States to acknowledge through the state's governing body their state's involvement in slavery. The passing of this resolution came on the heels of the 400th-anniversary celebration of the city of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], which was the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English colony]] to survive in what would become the [[United States]]. Jamestown is also recognized as one of the first slave ports of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]]. On 31 May 2007, the [[Governor of Alabama]], [[Bob Riley]], signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" for Alabama's role in slavery and apologizing for slavery's wrongs and lingering effects. Alabama is the fourth state to pass a slavery apology, following votes by the legislatures in [[Maryland]], Virginia, and [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]].

Accessed 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws. The language included a reference to the "fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow" segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, Darryl.

Accessed 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2009, the [[United States Senate]] issued an apologetic statement decrying the "fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery". The news was welcomed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]].

The '''Bolshoi Ballet''' is an internationally renowned [[classical ballet]] company, based at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]].  Founded in 1776, the Bolshoi is among the world's oldest ballet companies. It only achieved worldwide acclaim, however, in the early 20th century when Moscow became the capital of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Along with the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], the Bolshoi is recognised as one of the foremost ballet companies in the world.

==History==
The earliest origins of the Bolshoi Ballet can be found in the creation of a dance school for a Moscow orphanage in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/ent/A0808195.html|title=Bolshoi Ballet - Infoplease|author=|date=|website=InfoPlease|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118154231/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/ent/A0808195.html|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, dancers from the school were employed by [[Prince Pyotr Vasilyevich Ouroussoff]] and the English theatrical entrepreneur [[Michael Maddox]], to form part of their new theatre company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imgartists.com/?id=833&amp;page=artist|title=IMG Artists - Celebrate Performance|author=|date=|website=IMG Artists|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008030651/http://imgartists.com/?page=artist&amp;id=833|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally performing in privately owned venues, they later acquired the Petrovsky Theatre, which, as a result of fires and erratic redevelopment, would later be rebuilt as today's Bolshoi Theatre. While some guest dancers come and go from other very prestigious ballet companies—like the Mariinsky and American Ballet Theatre—many company dancers are graduates of the academy. In 1989, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-18/entertainment/ca-1313_1_bolshoi-ballet Michael Shannon] was the first American ballet dancer to graduate from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and join the Bolshoi Ballet company.&lt;ref&gt;"American Michael Shannon Joins the Bolshoi Ballet"- LATimes Article, November 18, 1989; {{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-18/entertainment/ca-1313_1_bolshoi-ballet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150423150738/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-18/entertainment/ca-1313_1_bolshoi-ballet |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite staging many famous ballets, it struggled to compete with the reputation of the Imperial Russian Ballet, today's [[Mariinsky Ballet]] of [[St. Petersburg]]. It was not until the appointment of [[Alexander Gorsky]] as Ballet Master in 1900 that the company began to develop its own unique identity, with acclaimed productions of new or restaged ballets including, ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' (1900), ''[[Coppélia]]''  (1901), ''[[Swan Lake]]''  (1901), ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''  (1903),  ''[[Giselle]]''  (1911), ''[[Le Corsaire]]''  (1912) and ''[[La Bayadère]]'' (1917).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theballetbag.com/2010/08/12/the-bolshoi-ballet/ Ballet Bag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816163134/http://www.theballetbag.com/2010/08/12/the-bolshoi-ballet/ |date=2010-08-16 }}, August 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet leadership's preference for uncomplicated moral themes in the arts was demonstrated in [[Yuri Grigorovich]]'s appointment as director in [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/23/bolshoi-ballet-black-swan 1964]. Grigorovich held his position until 1995, at which point a series of directors, including Boris Akimov, [[Alexei Ratmansky]], Yuri Burlaka and [[Sergei Filin]], brought more modern dance performance ideas to the company.&lt;ref name=Mackrell/&gt;

==Controversies==
[[Anastasia Volochkova]] has claimed that female dancers were forced to sleep with wealthy patrons. She said: “It mainly happened with the corps du [sic] ballet but also with the soloists. [...] I repeatedly received such propositions to share the beds of [[Business oligarch|oligarch]]s." &lt;ref name=BolshoiBrothel&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolshoi ballet was 'giant brothel' claims former dancer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21856516|work=bbc.co.uk/news|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320222734/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21856516|archivedate=20 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American dancer [[Joy Womack]] echoed this concern when she left the company after being told that, to secure solo roles she must either pay $10,000 or "start a relationship with a sponsor."&lt;ref name=Files&gt;{{cite news

The January 2013 sulfuric acid attack on art director [[Sergei Filin]] once again steeped the company in scandal. Bolshoi dancer [[Pavel Dmitrichenko]], was convicted of organizing the attack and sentenced to 6 years in prison. Reasons for the attack include corruption within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC News Europe|title=Bolshoi acid attack: Soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko jailed|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25197504|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325150550/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25197504|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Bolshoi Theatre cancelled the premiere of a ballet about openly gay Soviet dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]]. The Director General claimed it was due to the bad quality of the dancing, however, principle dancer [[Maria Alexandrova]] claimed it was the first sign of a 'new era' of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWR9VV3h0GY/?taken-by=aleksandrova_maria_bt |title=Maria Alexandrova Instagram Post |work=Instagram |date=8 July 2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504181751/https://www.instagram.com/p/BWR9VV3h0GY/?taken-by=aleksandrova_maria_bt |archivedate=4 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a show has been pulled in such a way since the collapse of the Soviet Union, sparking rumours about the motivation behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-40570212/bolshoi-theatre-postpones-rudolf-nureyev-ballet |title=Bolshoi Theatre postpones Rudolf Nureyev ballet |work=BBC News |date=11 July 2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711140528/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-40570212/bolshoi-theatre-postpones-rudolf-nureyev-ballet |archivedate=11 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company structure==
Today the Bolshoi Ballet remains one of the world's foremost ballet companies, in addition to being one of the largest, with approximately 220 dancers. The word "bolshoi" means "big" or "grand" in Russian. The company operates on a hierarchical system, similar to those used by other leading European ballet companies, with senior dancers ranked as principals, and descending in order of importance through lead soloist, first soloist, soloist and finally, corps de ballet. Due to its size, the company operates two troupes of corps de ballet.

In 2000, the Bolshoi Ballet opened its first Ballet Academy outside Russia, in [[Joinville]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/classical-bolshoi-finds-a-home-in-the-land-of-samba-30371155.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Classical: Bolshoi finds a home in the land of Samba}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/03/arts/discipline-bolshoi-land-samba-satellite-school-brazil-train-tomorrow-s-ballet.html | work=The New York Times | first=Larry | last=Rohter | title=The Discipline of the Bolshoi In the Land of the Samba; A Satellite School in Brazil to Train Tomorrow's Ballet Stars | date=3 July 2001 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314033754/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/03/arts/discipline-bolshoi-land-samba-satellite-school-brazil-train-tomorrow-s-ballet.html | archivedate=14 March 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centroysur.com/2012/02/13/the-bolshoi-ballet-the-discipline-of-russia-in-brazil/|title=The Bolshoi Ballet: The Discipline of Russia in Brazil - Centro Y Sur|author=|date=|website=centroysur.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140718020328/http://centroysur.com/2012/02/13/the-bolshoi-ballet-the-discipline-of-russia-in-brazil/|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escolabolshoi.com.br/bolshoi/Portugues/detIdioma.php?cod=1{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance style==
The performance style of the Bolshoi Ballet is typically identified as being colourful and bold, combining technique and athleticism with expressiveness and dramatic intensity. This style is commonly attributed to [[Alexander Alexeyevich Gorsky|Alexander Forsky]]. Historically there has been a fierce rivalry with the St. Petersburg Heritage Ballet Company, the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Mariinsky]]. Both have developed very different performing styles: the Bolshoi has a more colourful and bold approach, whereas the Mariinsky is associated with more pure and refined classicism.

[[File:Canada change 1880-09-01.png|thumb|right|The British Arctic Territories (darker region) upon incorporation into Canada]]

'''British Arctic territories''' were territories claimed by the United Kingdom in North America, consisting of the [[island]]s of what is now known as the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] (excepting islands in [[Hudson Bay]], which were part of [[Rupert's Land]]). The region was part of [[British North America]].

The [[British Empire|British]] claim to the area was based on the discoveries of [[Martin Frobisher]] (1535–1594) in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] passed control of the islands to [[Canada]] in 1880, by means of an Imperial [[Order in Council]], the [[s:Adjacent Territories Order|Adjacent Territories Order]], passed under the [[Royal Prerogative]].&lt;ref name="pubs"&gt;http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic14-1-53.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1880 transfer Canada gradually incorporated the islands with [[Rupert's Land]] into the [[Northwest Territories]]. The transfer was necessary over the fear of [[United States|American]] interest in the area as part of the [[Monroe Doctrine]].&lt;ref name="pubs" /&gt;

On April 1, 1999, the territory of [[Nunavut]] was created from the eastern portion of the Northwest Territories.  The majority of the islands became part of Nunavut. Islands split between Nunavut and Northwest Territories include [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]], [[Mackenzie King Island]] and [[Borden Island]].

These islands were never part of Rupert's Land, which covered those parts of North America draining into [[Hudson Bay]].  Canada had acquired those regions in 1870, creating the [[Province of Manitoba]] and the new [[Northwest Territories]], which originally included northern Ontario, the rest of Manitoba, all of Saskatchewan and part of Alberta, and what is now [[Nunavut]] territory, with the name Northwest Territories retained by the successor government in the region flanked by the Mackenzie River drainage to the north of Alberta.  The [[North-Western Territory]] was to its northwest, and included parts of British Columbia north of the [[Stikine Territory]] and including all of today's [[Yukon]] territory, and parts of Alberta not in the Hudson Bay drainage, as well as today's Northwest Territories.

== British Arctic Territory flag hoax ==

[[Flags of the World]] has a tradition of posting a new flag for the British Arctic Territory every April 1. It has led to some persistent misinformation on the web.&lt;ref name="BATFH"&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb!bat.html British Arctic Territory Flag Hoax]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8320">[[File:Latin inscription - geograph.org.uk - 376760.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Cantiorix inscription]]
The '''Cantiorix Inscription''' is a stone grave marker of the early [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman era]] found near [[Ffestiniog]] in north [[Wales]] and now at the church at [[Penmachno]]. It is notable both as the first known historical reference to the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]], and for its use of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] terms for 'citizen' and 'magistrate'.

It is considered by some to be evidence that a Roman-style administration existed beyond the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in some form in the early Kingdom of Gwynedd, while others either question or discount its significance in that regard.

==Inscription==
[[John Rhys]] had read the Latin text as "Cantiori Hic Jacit Venedotis Cive Fuit Consobrino Magli Magistrati" in his ''Lectures on Welsh Philology'' (1877), noting that "the person commemorated was a man of importance, and a Venedotian citizen, whatever that may exactly mean".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Rhys|1877|pp=168}} ''Lectures on Welsh Philology'', Lecture IV. The inscription is mentioned again in the Appendix on page 387 with the text as-written: ''Cantiori Hic Jacit Venedotis Cive Fuit [C]onsobrino Ma[g]li Magistrati''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] was more precise in ''After Rome'' (2003), noting technical details such as an all-capitals text and the use of late spoken Latin (e.g., CIVE instead of the formally correct CIVIS) to date the inscription to the fifth or sixth century, and neither before nor after that. He translated the inscription as "Cantiori lies here; he was a citizen of Gwynedd, a cousin of Maglus the magistrate", adding his broader thesis that "As well as the language, the political discourse of the Empire survived".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Charles-Edwards|2003|pp=9}} ''After Rome: c.400-c.800'', Introduction (Fifth Century Britain).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Cantiorix stone was found near Ffestiniog at the site traditionally known as the 'Graves of the Men of Ardudwy' ({{lang-cy|Beddau Gwŷr Ardudwy}}). The site has been destroyed over time, with little but the Roman road now visible. Antiquarian accounts include references to "likely long-cist graves marked by upright stones, suggesting a cemetery, as well as cairns, stones and other remains, which are thought to have included burial monuments of prehistoric date."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Edwards|2001|pp=25}} ''Early-Medieval Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture in Wales''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment by historians==
The importance of the reference to early medieval Gwynedd is uncontested, but the implications of the inscription's use of the terms 'civis' and 'magistrate' is varied. Rhys expressed doubt as to the inscription's meaning of 'civis', while Charles-Edwards suggested that it was evidence of a Roman-style "political discourse" in [[Wales in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval northern Wales]].

[[John Edward Lloyd|Lloyd]] in his ''History of Wales'' (1911) mentions the inscription stone at Penmachno as an early reference to Gwynedd (''Venedotis'' being a genetive form of something like ''Venedas'') in the sixth or seventh century and cites references, but does not comment upon it further. His discussion of "Wales Under Roman Rule" does not support any notion of a Roman heritage of administration or society, stating that Welsh society kept its native structure and connections to its pre-Roman past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Lloyd|1911|pp=40,89}} ''History of Wales''. Reference to the inscription stone is made on page 40. He states on page 89 that Welsh society kept its native structure and connections to its past.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy Davies]] in her ''Wales in the Early Middle Ages'' (1982) mentions the Cantiorix inscription parenthetically as part of a comment on people and communities. She says generally that there is very occasional mention of ''cives'' (citizens) as members of the community, and this single inscription is the only occurrence where it is mentioned in a context that specifies the size and nature of the community&amp;mdash;a citizen of Gwynedd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Davies|1982|pp=82}} ''Wales in the Early Middle Ages''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] in his ''History of Wales'' (1990) mentions several of the inscription stones at Penmachno, noting the reference to a "citizen of Gwynedd", and relates them to a desire to cling to the Roman world, particularly regarding trade goods, but does not otherwise relate them to a survival of a Roman-originated administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Davies|1990|pp=54–55}} ''History of Wales''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Snyder|Snyder]], speaking of the Cantiorix inscription in his  ''Age of Tyrants'' (1998), notes that the term ''magistratus'' is "otherwise unknown to British Christian epigraphy, though civic antecedents can be found on contemporary inscriptions from [[Gaul]] and the Mediterranean" and discusses several ancient usages of the term. He also notes authorities who had reached conclusions to the contrary, such as [[Leslie Alcock|Alcock]]'s belief that ''magistratus'' referred to one of the surviving ''civitates'' leaders to whom [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] had sent his rescript in 410, and [[Victor Erle Nash-Williams|Nash-Williams]]' belief that the inscription was evidence of an ordered system of government in north Wales in the post-Roman era, centered upon [[Segontium]]. Snyder also questions the meaning of a "citizen of Venidos", saying that Gwynedd at this time was a region that would later become a kingdom, and was not a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|1998|pp=118–119}} ''Age of Tyrants''&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards in her ''Early-Medieval Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture in Wales'' (2001) notes that the inscription recalls terms of the Roman past and suggests possible context (e.g., the Roman custom of burials along roads), also noting that the inscription stone from Castell Dwyran in [[Carmarthenshire]] contains the word ''Protictoris'', a title recalling a Roman past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Edwards|2001|pp=27–28}} ''Early-Medieval Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture in Wales''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christos Georgiou Doumas''' ({{lang-el|Χρήστος Γεωργίου Ντούμας}}; born 1933), is a [[Greeks|Greek]] archaeology professor at the [[University of Athens]]. From 1960 up until 1980, he had a career in the Greek Archaeological Service as curator of antiquities in [[Attica]] (on the Athenian [[Acropolis]]), in the [[Cyclades]], in the [[Dodecanese Islands]], and in the northern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands. He conducted excavations and organized many museum exhibitions in different regions of [[Greece]]. Doumas also served as curator of the prehistoric collections of the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]. Moreover, he became the director of antiquities and the director of conservation at the Hellenic Ministry of Culture. Since 1975, Doumas has been the director of excavations at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the Island of Thera (Santorini), as a successor to [[Spyridon Marinatos]]. He published several books and scholarly articles on Aegean archaeology and particularly about the cultures of the Aegean Islands.

'''Colin "Col" Hutchinson''' is a veteran [[statistician]], most notably in the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian/Australian Football League]] in the sport of [[Australian rules football]]. He was the AFL's official historian from the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/19/1077072783487.html?from=storyrhs Sporting Life – Sport – www.theage.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt; until around 2005.

A part of the [[AFL Players Association]], Hutchinson provides interesting statistics on football to newspapers and media outlets.

He is the author of several books including a history of the [[Geelong Football Club]] (''Cats' tales : the Geelong Football Club, 1897–1983'')&lt;ref&gt;''Cats' tales : the Geelong Football Club, 1897–1983''. Geelong Advertiser, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The AFL footy quiz book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Col Hutchinson| title = The AFL Footy Quiz Book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xl23AAAACAAJ| date = 2002| publisher = Penguin Group Australia| isbn = 978-0-14-300036-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last time Hutchinson missed seeing a live Geelong Football Club game was in 1963, over 1,100 games ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/1100-games-and-counting-20110826-1jel1.html 1100 games and counting]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of the Indies'''; officially, the '''Royal and Supreme Council of the Indies''' ({{lang-es|Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias}}, {{IPA-es|reˈal i suˈpɾemo konˈsexo ðe ˈindjas|pron}}), was the most important administrative organ of the [[Spanish Empire]] for the [[Americas]] and the [[Philippines]]. The crown held absolute power over the Indies and the Council of the Indies was the administrative and advisory body for those overseas realms. It was established in 1524 by [[Charles V of Spain]] to administer "the Indies," Spain's name for its territories. Such an administrative entity, on the conciliar model of the [[Council of Castile]], was created following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] in 1521, which demonstrated the importance of the Americas. Originally a section under the jurisdiction of the [[Council of Castile]], it was subsequently established as an autonomous body with legislative, executive and judicial functions. The Council of the Indies was abolished in 1812 by the [[Cádiz Cortes]], briefly restored in 1814 by [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and definitively abolished in 1834 by [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|the regency]], acting on behalf of the four-year-old [[Isabella II of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Cervantes, "Council of the Indies" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 36163. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qyjla7Hut0IC&amp;pg=PA102 El Consejo Real de Castilla y la Ley]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:PedroMoyaContreras.jpg|thumb|Pedro Moya de Contreras, former archbishop of Mexico, President of the Council of the Indies]]
[[Image:LuisdeVelascoII.jpg|thumb|Luis de Velasco II, Marqués de Salinas, Viceroy of New Spain and of Peru, later President of the Council of the Indies]]
[[File:Politica indianapor Iuan de Solorzano Pereira.jpg|thumb|[[Juan de Solórzano Pereira]], member of the Council of the Indies.]]
[[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] had granted extensive authority to [[Christopher Columbus]], but then withdrew that authority, and established direct royal control, putting matters of the Indies in the hands of her chaplain, [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]] in 1493.   The [[Catholic Monarchs]] (Isabella and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]]) designated Rodríguez de Fonseca to study the problems related to the colonization process arising from what was seen as tyrannical behavior of [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Governor Christopher Columbus]] and his misgovernment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Natives]] and Iberian settlers. Rodríguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy. He presided over a committee or council, which contained a number of members of the [[Council of Castile]] (''Consejo de Castilla''), and formed a ''Junta de Indias'' of about eight counselors.  Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was already using the term "Council of the Indies" in 1519. 

The Council of the Indies was formally created on August 1, 1524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson| first = Charles| authorlink = Charles Gibson (historian)| title = Spain in America| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| year = 1966| location = New York| pages = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king was informed weekly, and sometimes daily, of decisions reached by the Council, which came to exercise supreme authority over the Indies at the local level and over the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]'' ("House of Trade") founded in 1503 at Seville as a customs storehouse for the Indies. Civil suits of sufficient importance could be appealed from an ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' in the New World to the Council, functioning as a [[supreme court|court of last resort]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two secretaries of the Council, one in charge of Peru, Chile, Tierrafirme (northern South America), and the Kingdom of New Granada; the other was in charge of New Spain, encompassing Mexico, Guatemala, Nueva Galicia, Hispaniola, and the Philippines. The name of the Council did not change with the addition of the ''indias orientales'' of the Philippines and other Pacific territories claimed by Spain to the original ''indias occidentales''.&lt;ref&gt;Recopilación de las leyes de Indias, Libro II, Título VI.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Internecine fighting and political instability in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and the untiring efforts of [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] on behalf of the natives' rights resulted in Charles's overhaul of  the structure of the Council in 1542 with issuing of the "[[New Laws]]," which put limits on the rights of Spanish holders of [[encomiendas]], grants of indigenous labor. Under [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] the Council undertook the project to formally codify the large volume of Council and Crown's decisions and legislation for the Indies in the 1680 publication, the [[Laws of the Indies]] (''[[:es:Recopilación de las Leyes de Indias]]'') and re-codified in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 109-110, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of the Indies was usually headed by an ecclesiastic, but the councilors were generally non-clerics trained in law. In later years, nobles and royal favorites were in the ranks of councilors, as well as men who had experience in the high courts (''Audiencias'') of the Indies.  A key example of such an experienced councilor was [[Juan de Solórzano Pereira]], author of ''Política Indiana'', who served in Peru prior to being named to the Council of the Indies&lt;ref&gt;Cervantes, "Council of the Indies" p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; and led the project on the Laws of the Indies. Other noteworthy Presidents of the Council were [[:es:Francisco Tello de Sandoval]]; [[:es:Juan de Ovando y Godoy]]; [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]], former archbishop of Mexico; and [[Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas]], former viceroy of both Mexico and Peru. 

Although initially the Council had responsibility for all aspects of the Indies, under Philip II the financial aspects of the empire were shifted to the Council on Finance in 1556-57, a source of conflict between the two councils, especially since Spanish America came to be the source of the empire's wealth. When the Holy Office of the Inquisition was established as an institution in [[Mexican Inquisition|Mexico]] and [[Peruvian Inquisition|Lima]] in the 1570s, the Council of the Indies was removed from control.  The head of the Supreme Council of the Inquisition, [[:es:Juan de Ovando y Godoy]] became president of the Council of the Indies 1571-75. He was appalled by the ignorance of the Indies by those serving on the Council. He sought the creation of a general description of the territories, which was never completed, but the ''[[Relaciones geográficas]]'' were the result of that project.&lt;ref&gt;Cervantes, "Council of the Indies", p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of the Council's power was in the sixteenth century. Its power declined and the quality of the councillors decreased.  In the final years of the Hapsburg dynasty, some appointments were sold or were accorded to people obviously unqualified, such as a nine-year-old boy, whose father had rendered services to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, Mark A. "Council of the Indies", vol. 2, p. 293. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ascension of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] at the start of the eighteenth century, a series of administrative changes, known as the [[Bourbon reforms]], were introduced. In 1714 [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] created a Secretariat of the Navy and the Indies (''Secretaría de Marina e Indias'') with a single Minister of the Indies, which superseded the administrative functions of the Council, although the Council continued to function in a secondary role until the nineteenth century. Fifty years later [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] set up a separate Secretary of State for the Indies (''Secretarío del Estado del Despacho Universal de Indias'').&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late eighteenth century, the Council became powerful and prestigious again, with a great number of well qualified councillors with experience in the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, "Council of the Indies" p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808 Napoleon invaded Spain placed his brother, [[Joseph Napoleon]] on the throne. The [[Cádiz Cortes]], the body Spaniards considered the legitimate government in Spain and its overseas territories in the absence of their Bourbon monarch, abolished the Council in 1812. It was restored in 1814 upon [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII's]] restoration, and the autocratic monarch appointed a great number of Councillors with American experience.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, "Council of the Indies" p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council was finally abolished in 1834, a year after Ferdinand VII's death and after the loss of most of Spain's empire in the Americas.

The archives of the Council, the ''[[Archivo General de Indias]]'' one of the major centers of documentation for Spanish, Spanish American, and European history, are housed in [[Seville]].

Gordon’s 1991 book ''Resurrecting Marx: The Analytical Marxists on Freedom, Exploitation, and Justice'' was described by Mises Institute scholar [[Yuri Maltsev]] as "a refutation of [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] attempts to save the system from itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yuri N. Maltsev, ''Requiem for Marx'', Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gx0X4NvNE_gC&amp;pg=PA29 p 29], {{ISBN|978-1-61016-116-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which answers the arguments of [[Marxism|Marxist]] political philosophers, including [[Gerald Cohen]], [[Jon Elster]] and [[John Roemer]], dismisses every form of Marxism as theoretically unviable.&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''The Libertarian Reader,'' [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1998, [http://www.google.com/search?q=libertarian%20%20%22david%20gordon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=sp p 447].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' said Gordon's argument was "rather crude": [[capitalism]] could not be exploitative, and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism could serve a just world. Therefore, Gordon concludes, Marxism is "a complete failure."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Bruce E. (1992) "Review of David Gordon’s ''Resurrecting Marx,''" ''[[American Political Science Review]],'' Volume 86, Issue 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=InkRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=David+Gordon+Resurrecting+Marx&amp;dq=David+Gordon+Resurrecting+Marx&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vKHrTZ_1LcKCgAfjp_jhCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCw Page 510]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'' said Gordon failed to show that [[Analytical Marxism|analytical Marxists]] were "a formidable weapon in the hands of anti-Marxists" such as himself.&lt;ref name=DNSmith/&gt; Gordon was said to have shown little competency in anti-Marxist argument, falling into "easily avoided mistakes."&lt;ref name=DNSmith/&gt;

''The Review of Metaphysics'' assessed the book more positively, describing how Gordon successfully accomplished his explicit goal of demonstrating how Cohen, Elster and Roemer had failed to "rehabilitate Marx's economic theories".&lt;ref name=Gottfried&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gottfried |first=Paul |title=Book review: ''Resurrecting Marx'' |journal=The Review of Metaphysics |date=June 1991 |volume=44 |number=4 |pages=842–843 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/revmetaph/content/revmetaph_1991_0044_0004_0842_0842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review said that Gordon's book suggested an unstated second goal, that of Gordon justifying his own libertarian stance, and that this portion of the book was "by far the most stimulating".&lt;ref name=Gottfried/&gt; Oxford political scientist [[David Leopold]] noted Gordon's thumbnail test regarding whether a writer could be classified as an analytical Marxist as part of a common "misleading and unfortunate" understanding of the school, Gordon writing that a favorable stance on [[dialectic]]s meant that the writer must be "crossed off the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Leopold |editor=David Leopold, [[Marc Stears]] |chapter=Dialectical Approaches |title=Political Theory: methods and approaches |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aoas8YEAAqgC&amp;pg=PA121 |page=121 |isbn=978-0-19-923009-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon's book ''The Philosophical Origins of Austrian Economics'' (1992), which explores the philosophical origins of [[Carl Menger]]’s economic theories, was highly praised by Murray Rothbard.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, [http://www.rothbard.it/essays/present-state-of-austrian.pdf " The Present State of Austrian Economics"], paper delivered October 9, 1992; reprinted in ''The Logic of Action One: Method, Money, and the Austrian School,'' Glos, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd., 1997, pp. 111–172. Rothbard writes: "For a brilliant and incisive discussion and demolition of the logical empiricist contention on many levels, see David Gordon, The Philosophical Origins of Austrian Economics."&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Review of Austrian Economics]]'', [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] criticized the book for its over-simplistic division of philosophers into two camps—German (Hegelian, organicist and anti-science) and Austrian (Aristotelian, individualist and pro-science)—despite the philosophers having more complex interrelations. For instance [[Franz Brentano]] is exemplary of Austrian thought though he was born in Germany and was strongly influenced by German philosopher [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] [http://www.springerlink.com/content/hu61896300h72m76/ "The philosophy of Austrian economics"], Review of David Gordon’s ''The Philosophical Origins of Austrian Economics,'' ''The Review of Austrian Economics'', Volume 7, Number 2, 127–132, {{doi|10.1007/BF01101946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon later wrote an essay, "Second Thoughts on The Philosophical Origins of Austrian Economics," to provide some additions and corrections to his book.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon, [https://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE7_2_8.pdf "Second thoughts on The Philosophical Origins of Austrian Economics"], ''The Review of Austrian Economics'', Vol. 7, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon edited the collection, ''Secession, State &amp; Liberty'' (2002), eleven essays that suggest that [[secession]] should be given serious consideration. The essays examine United States history, look at theoretical issues, and apply theory to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Leef|George C. Leef]], [http://www.thefreemanonline.org/departments/book-review-secession-state-liberty-edited-by-david-gordon/ "A Feast of Challenges to the Conventional Wisdom"], a review of ''Secession, State &amp; Liberty,'' Freeman On Line, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Gordon conducted a study with Swedish consultant Per Nilsson on books published by Harvard University Press. They published the results of their analysis as "The Ideological Profile of Harvard University Press: Categorizing 494 Books Published 2000–2010" in ''[[Econ Journal Watch]].'' They presented a spread sheet analysis that classified the books by unknown criteria, concluding the issue was not that Harvard press "is ideological, but that its ideology is predominately leftist." The authors acknowledged they had not read all the books they classified. A reviewer noted that one author did not consider his book "leftist," and that the reason other books were so characterized was not clear.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Ayoub, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/pageview/harvard-press-leans-left-economists-say/28133 "Harvard Press Leans Left, Economists Say"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">'''Diocles of Peparethus''' ({{lang-el|Διοκλῆς}}; fl. late 4th – early 3rd century BC) was a historian from the Greek island of [[Peparethus]]. His works are lost, but they included histories of Persia and Rome: [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] and [[Plutarch]] acknowledge their debts to the latter as a source for their histories of early Rome, its native traditions and ancestral Greek connections.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives, Life of Romulus'', 3. Loeb edn. available at Thayer's site: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius' work survives only as a brief but historically significant catalogue summary. Plutarch seems to have relied on Fabius' history but acknowledges Diocles as its basis and authority. Diocles' own sources are unknown. He may have had access to Roman sources and traditions on which he foisted Greek interpretations and interpolations.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldo Momigliano, ''The classical foundations of modern historiography'', University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton, 1990, p101; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Djv5ttMz-HYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Diocles+of+peparethus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NreVzMV8R4&amp;sig=5CfZzc2PTD3cf5-fvnNAsABbnMA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q51pS_fEOaWy0gS8pNWpCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocles%20of%20peparethus&amp;f=false]: see also Dillery, in Andrew Feldherr (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Historians, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp78-81.

Little else is known of Diocles.

{{Green politics sidebar |Schools}}'''Eco-socialism''', '''green socialism''' or '''socialist ecology''' is an [[ideology]] merging aspects of [[socialism]] with that of [[green politics]], [[ecology]] and [[alter-globalization]] or [[anti-globalization]]. Eco-socialists generally believe that the expansion of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[poverty]], [[war]] and [[environmental degradation]] through [[globalization]] and [[imperialism]], under the supervision of repressive [[State (polity)|states]] and transnational structures.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kovel, J. |author2=Löwy, M. |title=An ecosocialist manifesto |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Eco-socialists advocate dismantling capitalism, focusing on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] by freely associated producers, and restoring the [[commons]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}  [[Caroline Lucas]], former leader of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], has described her party's brand of socialism as appealing to both middle-class environmentalists as well as working-class socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFG3INb7VWU |title=Labour 'never challenged the austerity narrative' {{!}} Owen Jones talks to Caroline Lucas |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-07-31 |accessdate=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==

Eco-socialists are critical of many past and existing forms of both [[Green politics]] and [[socialism]]. They are often described as "[[Red (political adjective)|Red]] Greens" - adherents to Green politics with clear [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] views, often inspired by [[Marxism]] (Red Greens are in contrast to [[Eco-capitalism|eco-capitalists]] and [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]]).

The term "watermelon" is commonly applied, often pejoratively, to [[Green politics|Greens]] who seem to put "[[social justice]]" goals above [[Ecology|ecological]] ones, implying they are "green on the outside but red on the inside"; the term is usually attributed to either [[Petr Beckmann]] or, more frequently, [[Warren T. Brookes]],&lt;ref name="RatsNestWatermelon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.win.net/ratsnest/archive-articles-13/fog0000000219.html |publisher=Rats Nest |format=Blog |title=''A Blogroll, please'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NoWatermelonBlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nowatermelons.blogspot.com/2007_02_25_archive.html |title=No Watermelons Allowed |format=Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAmericanSpectator"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://spectator.org/articles/45094/man-who-saw-tomorrow |journal=The American Spectator |date=13 July 2007 |title=The Man Who Saw Tomorrow }}&lt;/ref&gt; both critics of [[environmentalism]], and is common in Australia,&lt;ref name="AustrailianWatermelon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1198314.htm |publisher=Media Watch |title=Stolen watermelons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AustrailianWatermelon2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/09/07/1194186.htm |title=Brown dismisses Govt name-calling |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=September 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand&lt;ref name="WatermelonNZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewatermelon.org/ |title=The Watermelon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref name=Frontpage&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=7165 FrontPage magazine.com :: ''The Green Menace'' by Christopher Archangelli]&lt;/ref&gt;

A New Zealand website, ''The Watermelon'', uses the term proudly, stating that it is "green on the outside and [[Social liberalism|liberal]] on the inside", while also citing "socialist political leanings", reflecting the use of the term "liberal" to describe the [[left wing]] in many English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=WatermelonNZ/&gt; Red Greens are often considered "[[fundi (politics)|fundies]]" or "fundamentalist greens", a term usually associated with [[Deep ecology|Deep Ecology]] even though the [[German Green Party]] "fundi" faction included eco-socialists, and eco-socialists in other [[Green Parties]], like [[Derek Wall]], have been described in the press as fundies.&lt;ref name=Mail21Sep&gt;"Triumph for 'Fundies' hits Green Party", ''Daily Mail'', 21 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LynasBlog&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200707120024 Mark Lynas' ''New Statesman'' Blog - ''Even Greens need leaders'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-socialists also criticise bureaucratic and elite theories of self-described socialism such as [[Maoism]], [[Stalinism]] and what other critics have termed [[bureaucratic collectivism]] or [[state capitalism]]. Instead, eco-socialists focus on imbuing socialism with ecology while keeping the emancipatory goals of "first-epoch" socialism.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialists aim for communal ownership of the [[means of production]] by "freely associated producers" with all forms of domination eclipsed, especially [[Ecofeminism|gender inequality]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This often includes the restoration of [[commons]] land in opposition to [[private property]],&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;Guha, R. and Martinez-Alier, J., ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in which local control of resources valorizes the Marxist concept of [[use value]] above [[exchange value]].&lt;ref name=Kovel&gt;Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Practically, eco-socialists have generated various strategies to mobilise action on an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] basis, developing networks of grassroots individuals and groups that can radically transform society through [[Non-violence|nonviolent]] "prefigurative projects" for a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Anti-statism|post-statist]] world.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==History==

===1880s–1930s – Marx, Morris and influence on the Russian Revolution===
Contrary to the depiction of [[Karl Marx]] by some environmentalists,&lt;ref name=Eckersley&gt;Eckersley, R., ''Environmentalism and Political Theory'', 1992 (Albany, NY: SUNY Press)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologists]]&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, J., ''The Anarchist Moment'', 1984 (Montreal: Black Rose)&lt;/ref&gt; and fellow [[Socialism|socialists]]&lt;ref name=Benton&gt;Benton, T. (ed.), ''The Greening of Marxism'', 1996 (New York: Guildford)&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Productivism|productivist]] who favoured the domination of nature, eco-socialists have revisited Marx's writings and believe that he "was a main originator of the [[Ecology|ecological]] world-view".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialist authors, like [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name=JBF&gt;Foster, J.

[[William Morris]], the [[England|English]] novelist, poet and designer, is largely credited with developing key principles of what was later called eco-socialism.&lt;ref name=Babylon&gt;Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s and 1890s, Morris promoted his eco-socialist ideas within the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]].&lt;ref name=GLSite&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.uk Green Left (Green Party of England and Wales) Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205093251/http://www.greenleft.org.uk/ |date=5 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], some [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]]s and [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]]s attempted to integrate [[Ecology|ecological]] consciousness into [[Bolshevism]], although many such people were later purged from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Gare&gt;Gare, A., ''Soviet Environmentalism: The Path Not Taken'', in Benton, E.

=== Ecoanarchism ===
{{Green anarchism |Related}}
{{Main article|Green anarchism}}
Green anarchism, or ecoanarchism, is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of thought]] within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA.

[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |authorlink= |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–120 |publisher=Black Rose Books |location= |isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Murray Bookchin defined himself as an [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name="youtube2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd0hxVUIQvk |title=''Anarchism In America'' documentary |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology.

Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the [[counterculture]].

''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' is a collection of [[essay]]s written by [[Murray Bookchin]] and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, his book ''The Ecology of Freedom'' had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement, both in the United States and abroad. He was a principal figure in the Burlington Greens in 1986-90, an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to create neighborhood democracy.

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called "[[Communalism (Political Philosophy)|Communalism]]" (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[Social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[Libertarian Municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state.

===1970s–1990s – Rise of environmentalism and engagement with Marxism and 'actually existing socialism'===
In the 1970s, [[Barry Commoner]], suggesting a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] response to ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic [[resource depletion]] and spurred [[environmentalism]], postulated that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for [[environmental degradation]], as opposed to [[Human overpopulation|population pressures]].&lt;ref name=Commoner&gt;Commoner, B., ''The Closing Circle'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Germany|East German]] dissident writer and activist [[Rudolf Bahro]] published two books addressing the relationship between socialism and ecology – ''[[The Alternative in Eastern Europe]]''&lt;ref name=Bahro&gt;Bahro, R., ''The Alternative in Eastern Europe'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Socialism and Survival]]''&lt;ref name=Bahro1&gt;Bahro, R., ''Socialism and Survival'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; – which promoted a 'new party' and led to his arrest, for which he gained international notoriety.

At around the same time, [[Alan Roberts (activist)|Alan Roberts]], an Australian [[Marxism|Marxist]], posited that people's unfulfilled needs fuelled [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, A., ''The Self-Managing Environment'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Australian [[Ted Trainer]] further called upon [[socialists]] to develop a system that met human needs, in contrast to the capitalist system of created wants.&lt;ref name=Trainer&gt;Trainer, T., ''Abandon Affluence!'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A key development in the 1980s was the creation of the journal ''[[Capitalism, Nature, Socialism]]'' (CNS) with [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]] as founding editor and the first issue in 1988. The debates ensued led to a host of theoretical works by O'Connor, [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Paul Burkett]] and others.

The Australian [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Democratic Socialist Party]] launched the [[Green Left Weekly]] newspaper in 1991, following a period of working within Green Alliance and Green Party groups in formation. This ceased when the [[Australian Greens]] adopted a policy of proscription of other political groups in August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;"Green Politics at an impasse" http://www.dsp.org.au/node/140&lt;/ref&gt; The DSP also published a comprehensive policy resolution, "Socialism and Human Survival" in book form in 1990, with an expanded second edition in 1999 entitled "Environment, Capitalism &amp; Socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsp.org.au/node/85|title=Environment, Capitalism and Socialism - DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PERSPECTIVE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s onwards – Engagement with the anti-globalization movement and The Ecosocialist Manifesto===
The 1990s saw the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminists]] [[Mary Mellor]]&lt;ref name=Mellor&gt;Mellor, M., ''Breaking the Boundaries: Towards a Feminist, Green Socialism'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ariel Salleh]]&lt;ref name=Salleh&gt;Saller, A., ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; address environmental issues within an eco-socialist paradigm. With the rising profile of the [[anti-globalization]] movement in the [[Global South]], an "[[environmentalism]] of the poor", combining [[Ecology|ecological]] awareness and [[social justice]], has also become prominent.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; [[David Pepper (Eco-socialist)|David Pepper]] also released his important work, ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', in 1994, which critiques the current approach of many within Green politics, particularly [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]].&lt;ref name=DPepper&gt;Pepper, D., ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Joel Kovel]], a [[Social science|social scientist]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] and former candidate for the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party of the United States]] (GPUS) [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination in 2000, and [[Michael Löwy]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and member of the [[Reunified Fourth International]] (a principal [[Trotskyist]] organisation), released ''An ecosocialist manifesto'', which has been adopted by some organisations&lt;ref name=GLSite/&gt; and suggests possible routes for the growth of eco-socialist consciousness.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel's 2002 work, ''The Enemy of Nature: The End of Capitalism or the End of the World?'',&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt; is considered by many to be the most up-to-date exposition of eco-socialist thought.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

In October 2007, the [[International Ecosocialist Network]] was founded in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2007/10/383067.html|title=Ecosocialist International Founded - UK Indymedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on current Green and socialist movements===
Currently, many [[Green Parties]] around the world, such as the [[GreenLeft|Dutch Green Left Party]] (GroenLinks){{citation needed|date=January 2016}} , contain strong eco-socialist elements. Radical [[Red-green alliance]]s have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical [[Green politics|Greens]] and other radical left groups. In Denmark, the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the [[European Parliament]], a number of [[far-left]] parties from [[Northern Europe]] have organized themselves into the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]]. Red Greens feature heavily in the [[Green Party of Saskatchewan]] (in Canada but not necessarily affiliated to the [[Green Party of Canada]]) and then-recently [[Green Party (United States)|GPUS]] that officially adopted ideology within party.&lt;ref name="gp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=835|title=Green Party of the United States – National Committee Voting – Proposal Details|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], that was founded in June 2005 and whose members hold a number of influential positions within the party, including both the former [[Principal Speaker]]s [[Siân Berry]] and Dr. [[Derek Wall]], himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic, as well as prominent [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate and human rights activist [[Peter Tatchell]].&lt;ref name=GLSite/&gt; Many Marxist organisations also contain eco-socialists, as evidenced by [[Michael Löwy|Löwy's]] involvement in the [[reunified Fourth International]] and ''[[Socialist Resistance]]'', a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist]] newspaper that reports on eco-socialist issues and has published two collections of essays on eco-socialist thought: ''Ecosocialism or Barbarism?'', edited by [[Jane Kelly (eco-socialist)|Jane Kelly]] and [[Sheila Malone]], and ''The Global Fight for Climate Justice'', edited by [[Ian Angus (activist)|Ian Angus]] with a foreword by Derek Wall.&lt;ref name=SR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistresistance.net/|title=socialistresistance.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SRBooks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resistancebooks.blogspot.com/|title=Resistance Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on "existing socialist" regimes===
Eco-socialism has had a minor influence over developments in the [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]] of what can be called "existing [[Socialism|socialist]]" regimes, notably the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Pan Yue (politician)|Pan Yue]], Deputy Director of the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]'s [[State Environmental Protection Administration]], has acknowledged the influence of eco-socialist theory on his championing of [[environmentalism]] within [[People's Republic of China|China]], which has gained him international acclaim (including being nominated for the Person of the Year Award 2006 by ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]'',&lt;ref name=NSYue&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200612180028 ''The New Statesman'' 18 December 2006 - ''Person of the year: The man making China green'']&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United Kingdom|British]] current affairs magazine). [[Pan Yue (politician)|Yue]] stated in an interview that, while he often finds eco-socialist theory "too idealistic" and lacking "ways of solving actual problems", he believes that it provides "political reference for China’s scientific view of development", "gives socialist ideology room to expand" and offers "a theoretical basis for the establishment of fair international rules" on the [[Natural environment|environment]].

He echoes much of eco-socialist thought, attacking international "environmental inequality", refusing to focus on [[technological fix]]es and arguing for the construction of "a harmonious, resource-saving and environmentally-friendly society". He also shows a knowledge of eco-socialist history, from the convergence of radical green politics and socialism and their political "[[red-green alliance]]s" in the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era. This focus on eco-socialism has informed an essay, ''On Socialist Ecological Civilisation'', published in September 2006, which, according to [[chinadialogue]], "sparked debate" in [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name=YueInterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/493--The-rich-consume-and-the-poor-suffer-the-pollution-|title=The rich consume and the poor suffer the pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current [[Constitution of Bolivia]], promulgated in 2009, is the first both ecologic and pro-socialist Constitution in the world, making the Bolivian state officially ecosocialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocon.org/constitution-of/bolivia-2009/ |accessdate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726013753/http://www.ecocon.org/constitution-of/bolivia-2009/ |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosocialist International Network (EIN) and other international eco-socialist organisations===
In 2007, it was announced that attempts to form an [[Ecosocialist International Network]] (EIN) would be made and an inaugural meeting of the International occurred on October 7, 2007 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=InternationalAnnounce&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127193637/http://climateandcapitalism.blogspot.com/2007/06/international-ecosocialist-meeting.html ''Climate and Capitalism'' Blog - ''International Ecosocialist Meeting Planned'']&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting attracted "more than 60 activists from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States" and elected a steering committee featuring representatives from Britain, the United States, Canada, France, Greece, Argentina, Brazil and Australia, including [[Joel Kovel]], [[Michael Löwy]], [[Derek Wall]], [[Ian Angus (activist)|Ian Angus]] (editor of [http://www.climateandcapitalism.com Climate and Capitalism] in Canada) and [[Ariel Salleh]]. The Committee states that it wants "to incorporate members from China, India, Africa, Oceania and Eastern Europe". EIN held its second international conference in January 2009, in association with the next [[World Social Forum]] in Brazil".&lt;ref name=International&gt;[http://www.ecosocialistnetwork.org Ecosocialist International Network Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference released The Belem Ecosocialist Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecosocialistnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

International networking by eco-socialists has already been seen in the [[Praxis Research and Education Center]], a group on international researchers and activists. Based in [[Moscow]] and established in 1997, [[Praxis Research and Education Center|Praxis]], as well as publishing books "by [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], Marxist [[Humanism|humanists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [and] [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]]", running the [[Victor Serge]] Library and opposing [[Second Chechen War|war in Chechnya]], states that it believes "that capitalism has brought life on the planet near to the brink of catastrophe, and that a form of ecosocialism needs to emerge to replace capitalism before it is too late".&lt;ref name=PraxisUSSF&gt;[https://www.ussf2007.org/en/node/2833 United States Social Forum - ''Ecosocialism vs. Capitalist Ecoside: how do we get from here to there?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PraxisRU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praxiscenter.ru|title=Научно-просветительский центр "Праксис"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of capitalist expansion and globalisation==
Merging aspects of [[Marxism]], socialism, [[environmentalism]] and ecology, eco-socialists generally believe that the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]] through [[globalization]] and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures.

In the ''Ecosocialist manifesto'', [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] and [[Michael Löwy|Löwy]] suggest that capitalist expansion causes both "crises of ecology" through "rampant [[industrialization]]" and "societal breakdown" that springs "from the form of imperialism known as globalization". They believe that capitalism's expansion "exposes [[ecosystem]]s" to [[pollutants]], habitat destruction and [[resource depletion]], "reducing the sensuous vitality of [[nature]] to the cold exchangeability required for the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]", while submerging "the majority of the world's people to a mere reservoir of [[Labour (economics)|labor]] power" as it penetrates communities through "[[consumerism]] and depoliticization".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Other eco-socialists, like [[Derek Wall|Wall]], highlight how, in the [[Global South]], [[free-market]] capitalism structures economies to produce [[Cash crop|export-geared crops]] that take water from traditional [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farms]], increasing hunger and the likelihood of [[famine]]; furthermore, forests are increasingly [[Deforestation|cleared]] and [[Enclosure|enclosed]] to produce [[cash crops]] that separate people from their local [[means of production]] and aggravate [[poverty]]. [[Derek Wall|Wall]] shows that many of the world's poor have access to the [[means of production]] through "non-monetised communal [[means of production]]", such as [[subsistence farming]], but, despite providing for need and a level of prosperity, these are not included in conventional economics measures, like [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]].

[[Derek Wall|Wall]] therefore views [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] globalization as "part of the long struggle of the state and commercial interests to steal from those who subsist" by removing "access to the resources that sustain ordinary people across the globe".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; Furthermore, Kovel sees [[neoliberalism]] as "a return to the pure logic of capital" that "has effectively swept away measures which had inhibited capital’s aggressivity, replacing them with naked exploitation of humanity and nature"; for Kovel, this "tearing down of boundaries and limits to accumulation is known as globalization", which was "a deliberate response to a serious accumulation crisis (in the 1970s) that had convinced the leaders of the global economy to install what we know as neoliberalism.".&lt;ref name=KovelNSG&gt;Joel Kovel [http://newsocialist.org/attachments/131_NewSocialist-Issue61.pdf "Why Ecosocialism Today?",] ''New Socialist'', Issue No. 61 (Summer 2007), p.10.

Furthermore, [[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Juan Martinez-Alier|Martinez-Alier]] blame globalization for creating increased levels of [[waste]] and [[pollution]], and then dumping the [[waste]] on the most vulnerable in society, particularly those in the [[Global South]].&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; Others have also noted that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the [[Global North]] as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the [[environmental justice]] movement in the United States, consisting of [[working-class]] people and [[ethnic minorities]] who highlight the tendency for waste dumps, major road projects and [[incinerator]]s to be constructed around socially excluded areas. However, as [[Derek Wall|Wall]] highlights, such campaigns are often ignored or persecuted precisely because they originate among the most marginalized in society: the [[African-American]] radical green religious group [[MOVE]], campaigning for ecological revolution and [[animal rights]] from [[Philadelphia]], had many members imprisoned or even killed by US authorities from the 1970s onwards.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Eco-socialism disagrees with the elite theories of capitalism, which tend to label a specific [[Social class|class]] or social group as conspirators who construct a system that satisfies their greed and personal desires. Instead, eco-socialists suggest that the very system itself is self-perpetuating, fuelled by "extra-human" or "impersonal" forces. Kovel uses the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal industrial disaster]] as an example. Many [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] observers would blame the avarice of those at the top of many [[Multinational corporation|multi-national corporation]]s, such as the [[Union Carbide]] Corporation in [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal]], for seemingly isolated [[industrial accident]]s. Conversely, Kovel suggests that [[Bhopal disaster|Union Carbide]] were experiencing a decrease in sales that led to falling profits, which, due to [[stock market]] conditions, translated into a drop in share values. The depreciation of share value made many [[shareholders]] sell their stock, weakening the company and leading to cost-cutting measures that eroded the safety procedures and mechanisms at the Bhopal site. Though this did not, in Kovel's mind, make the Bhopal disaster inevitable, he believes that it illustrates the effect [[Free market|market]] forces can have on increasing the likelihood of ecological and social problems.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Use and exchange value===
Eco-socialism focuses closely on [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] posits that, within a [[market economy]], goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods; as we have to keep selling in order to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Such goods, in an eco-socialist analysis, produce [[exchange value]]s but have no [[use value]]. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities - such as caring for relatives full-time and basic [[subsistence]] – are unrewarded, while unnecessary commodities earn individuals huge fortunes and fuel [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The "second contradiction" of capitalism===
[[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]] argues for a "second contradiction" of underproduction, to complement [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s "first" contradiction of capital and labor. While the second contradiction is often considered a theory of environmental degradation, O'Connor's theory in fact goes much further. Building on the work of Karl Polanyi, along with Marx, O'Connor argues that capitalism necessarily undermines the "conditions of production" necessary to sustain the endless accumulation of capital. These conditions of production include soil, water, energy, and so forth. But they also include an adequate public education system, transportation infrastructures, and other services that are not produced directly by capital, but which capital needs in order accumulate effectively. As the conditions of production are exhausted, the costs of production for capital increase. For this reason, the second contradiction generates an underproduction crisis tendency, with the rising cost of inputs and labor, to complement the overproduction tendency of too many commodities for too few customers. Like Marx's contradiction of capital and labor, the second contradiction therefore threatens the system's existence.&lt;ref name=OConnor&gt;O'Connor, J., ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. 2011. "Transcending the Metabolic Rift: A Theory of Crises in the Capitalist World-Ecology," The Journal of Peasant Studies 38(1), 1-46, http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O'Connor believes that, in order to remedy environmental contradictions, the capitalist system innovates new technologies that overcome existing problems but introduce new ones.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt;

O'Connor cites [[nuclear power]] as an example, which he sees as a form of producing energy that is advertised as an alternative to carbon-intensive, non-renewable [[fossil fuels]], but creates long-term [[radioactive waste]] and other dangers to health and security. While O'Connor believes that capitalism is capable of spreading out its economic supports so widely that it can afford to destroy one [[ecosystem]] before moving onto another, he and many other eco-socialists now fear that, with the onset of globalization, the system is running out of new [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt; Kovel adds that capitalist firms have to continue to extract profit through a combination of intensive or extensive exploitation and selling to new markets, meaning that capitalism must [[Economic growth|grow]] indefinitely to exist, which he thinks is impossible on a planet of finite resources.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The role of the state and transnational organisations===
[[capitalism|Capitalist]] expansion is seen by eco-socialists as being "hand in glove" with "corrupt and subservient client states" that repress dissent against the system, governed by [[international organisation]]s "under the overall supervision of the [[Western world|Western powers]] and the [[superpower]] United States", which subordinate peripheral nations economically and militarily.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] further claims that capitalism itself spurs conflict and, ultimately, [[war]]. Kovel states that the '[[War on Terror]]', between [[Islamist extremists]] and the United States, is caused by "oil imperialism", whereby the capitalist nations require control over sources of [[energy]], especially oil, which are necessary to continue intensive [[Economic growth|industrial growth]] - in the quest for control of such resources, Kovel argues that the capitalist nations, specifically the United States, have come into conflict with the predominantly [[Muslim]] nations where oil is often found.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Eco-socialists believe that state or self-[[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of markets does not solve the crisis "because to do so requires setting limits upon accumulation", which is "unacceptable" for a [[Economic growth|growth]]-orientated system; they believe that [[terrorism]] and revolutionary impulses cannot be tackled properly "because to do so would mean abandoning the logic of [[empire]]". Instead, eco-socialists feel that increasing repressive [[counter-terrorism]] increases [[social alienation|alienation]] and causes further [[terrorism]] and believe that state [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] methods are, in Kovel and [[Michael Löwy|Löwy]]'s words, "evolving into a new and malignant variation of [[fascism]]". They echo [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s "stark choice" between "socialism or barbarism", which was believed to be a prediction of the coming of [[fascism]] and further forms of destructive capitalism at the beginning of the twentieth century ([[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]] was in fact murdered by proto-[[Fascism|fascist]] [[Freikorps]] in the revolutionary atmosphere of Germany in 1919).&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Tensions within the eco-socialist discourse==

Reflecting tensions within the environmental and socialist movements, there is some conflict of ideas. In practice however, a synthesis is emerging which calls for democratic regulation of industry in the interests of people and the environment, nationalisation of some key (environmental) industries, local democracy and an extension of co-ops and the library principle.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Scottish Green Peter McColl argues that elected governments should abolish poverty through a Citizens Income scheme, regulate against social and environmental malpractice and encourage environmental good practice through state procurement. At the same time economic and political power should be devolved as far as is possible through co-operatives, and increased local decision making. By putting political and economic power into the hands of the people most likely to be affected by environmental injustice it is less likely that the injustice will take place - see http://www.redflag.org.uk/frontline/frJune08/ecosoc2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of other forms of green politics==
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}
Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green politics|Green movement]] for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], for working within the existing [[Capitalism|capitalist]], [[Statism|statist]] system, for [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], or for reliance on technological fixes. The eco-socialist ideology is based on a critique of other forms of Green politics, including various forms of [[green economics]], [[localism (politics)|localism]], [[deep ecology]], [[bioregionalism]] and even some manifestations of radical green ideologies such as [[eco-feminism]] and [[social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

As Kovel puts it, eco-socialism differs from Green politics at the most fundamental level because the '[[Four Pillars of the Green Party|Four Pillars]]' of Green politics (and the 'Ten Key Values' of the [[Green Party (United States)|US Green Party]]) do not include the demand for the [[emancipation of labour]] and the end of the separation between producers and the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Many eco-socialists also oppose [[Malthusianism]]&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; and are alarmed by the gulf between Green politics in the [[Global North]] and the [[Global South]].&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt;

===Opposition to within-system approaches, voluntarism and technological fixes===
Eco-socialists are highly critical of those Greens who favour "working within the system". While eco-socialists like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] recognise the ability of within-system approaches to raise awareness, and believe that "the struggle for an [[Ecology|ecologically]] rational world must include a struggle for the state", he believes that the mainstream Green movement is too easily co-opted by the current powerful socio-political forces as it "passes from citizen-based [[activism]] to ponderous bureaucracies scuffling for 'a seat at the table'".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

For Kovel, capitalism is "happy to enlist" the Green movement for "convenience", "control over popular dissent" and "rationalization". He further attacks within-system green initiatives like [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]], which he sees as a "capitalist shell game" that turns [[pollution]] "into a fresh source of profit".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[Brian Tokar]] has further criticised carbon trading in this way, suggesting that it augments existing class inequality and gives the "largest 'players'... substantial control over the whole 'game'".&lt;ref name=Tokar&gt;Tokar, B., ''Earth for Sale'', 1997 (Boston:South End Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Kovel criticises the "defeatism" of [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] in some local forms of [[environmentalism]] that do not connect: he suggests that they can be "drawn off into [[individualism]]" or co-opted to the demands of capitalism, as in the case of certain [[recycling]] projects, where citizens are "induced to provide free labor" to [[waste management]] industries who are involved in the "capitalization of nature". He labels the notion on voluntarism "ecopolitics without struggle".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Technological fixes to ecological problems are also rejected by eco-socialists. [[Saral Sarkar]] has updated the thesis of 1970s '[[limits to growth]]' to exemplify the limits of new capitalist technologies such as [[hydrogen fuel cell]]s, which require large amounts of energy to split molecules to obtain hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;Sarkar, S., ''Eco-Socialism or Eco-Capitalism?: A Critical Analysis of Humanity's Fundamental Choices'', 1999 (London:Zed Books)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kovel notes that "events in nature are reciprocal and multi-determined" and can therefore not be predictably "fixed"; socially, technologies cannot solve social problems because they are not "mechanical". He posits an eco-socialist analysis, developed from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], that patterns of production and social organisation are more important than the forms of technology used within a given configuration of society.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Under capitalism, he suggests that technology "has been the ''sine qua non'' of [[Economic growth|growth]]" – thus he believes that, even in a world with hypothetical "free energy", the effect would be to lower the cost of [[automobile]] production, leading to the massive [[overproduction]] of [[vehicle]]s, "collapsing infrastructure", chronic [[resource depletion]] and the "paving over" of the "remainder of [[nature]]". In the modern world, Kovel considers the supposed efficiency of new [[post-industrial]] commodities is a "plain illusion", as [[Miniaturization|miniaturized]] components involve many substances and are therefore non-[[Recycling|recyclable]] (and, theoretically, only simple substances could be retrieved by burning out-of-date equipment, releasing more [[pollutant]]s). He is quick to warn "environmental [[Liberalism|liberals]]" against over-selling the virtues of [[Renewable energy|renewable energies]] that cannot meet the mass energy consumption of the era; although he would still support [[renewable energy]] projects, he believes it is more important to restructure societies to reduce energy use before relying on [[renewable energy]] technologies alone.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of Green economics===
Eco-socialists have based their ideas for political strategy on a critique of several different trends in [[Green economics]]. At the most fundamental level, eco-socialists reject what Kovel calls "[[ecological economics]]" or the "ecological wing of mainstream economics" for being "uninterested in social transformation". He furthers rejects the [[Adam Smith|Neo-Smithian]] school, who believe in [[Adam Smith]]'s vision of "a capitalism of small producers, freely exchanging with each other", which is self-regulating and competitive.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

The school is represented by thinkers like [[David Korten]] who believe in "regulated markets" checked by [[government]] and [[civil society]] but, for Kovel, they do not provide a critique of the expansive nature of capitalism away from localised production and ignore "questions of [[Social class|class]], [[gender]] or any other category of domination". Kovel also criticises their "fairy-tale" view of history, which refers to the abuse of "[[natural capital]]" by the [[materialism]] of the [[Scientific Revolution]], an assumption that, in Kovel's eyes, seems to suggest that "nature had toiled to put the gift of capital into human hands", rather than capitalism being a product of social relations in human history.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Other forms of [[community-based economics]] are also rejected by eco-socialists such as Kovel, including followers of [[E. F. Schumacher]] and some members of the [[cooperative movement]], for advocating "no more than a very halting and isolated first step". He thinks that their principles are "only partially realizable within the institutions of cooperatives in capitalist society" because "the internal cooperation" of cooperatives is "forever hemmed in and compromised" by the need to expand value and compete within the [[Free market|market]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Marx also believed that [[cooperative]]s within capitalism make workers into "their own capitalist... by enabling them to use the [[means of production]] for the employment of their own labour".&lt;ref name=Capital3/&gt;

For Kovel and other eco-socialists, community-based economics and Green [[localism (politics)|localism]] are "a fantasy" because "strict localism belongs to the aboriginal stages of society" and would be an "ecological nightmare at present population levels" due to "heat losses from a multitude of dispersed sites, the squandering of scarce resources, the needless reproduction of effort, and cultural impoverishment". While he feels that small-scale production units are "an essential part of the path towards an ecological society", he sees them not as "an end in itself"; in his view, small enterprises can be either capitalist or [[Socialism|socialist]] in their configuration and therefore must be "consistently anti-capitalist", through recognition and support of the emancipation of labour, and exist "in a dialectic with the whole of things", as human society will need large-scale projects, such as transport infrastructures.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

He highlights the work of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], who exemplifies what eco-socialists see as the good and bad points of [[ecological economics]] — while Daly offers a critique of capitalism and a desire for "workers ownership", he only believes in workers ownership "kept firmly within a capitalist market", ignoring the eco-socialist desire for struggle in the emancipation of labour and hoping that the interests of labour and management today can be improved so that they are "in harmony".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of deep ecology===
Despite the inclusion of both in political factions like the '[[Fundies]]' of the [[German Green Party]], eco-socialists and [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]] hold markedly opposite views. Eco-socialists like Kovel have attacked deep ecology because, like other forms of Green politics and [[Green economics]], it features "virtuous souls" who have "no internal connection with the critique of capitalism and the emancipation of labor". Kovel is particularly scathing about deep ecology and its "fatuous pronouncement" that Green politics is "neither left nor right, but ahead", which, for him, ignores the notion that "that which does not confront the system comes its instrument".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Even more scathingly, Kovel suggests that in "its effort to decentre humanity within nature", deep ecologists can "go too far" and argue for the "splitting away of unwanted people", as evidenced by their desire to preserve [[wilderness]] by removing the groups that have lived there "from [[time immemorial]]". Kovel thinks that this lends legitimacy to "capitalist elites", like the [[US State Department]] and the [[World Bank]], who can make preservation of wilderness a part of their projects that "have added value as sites for [[ecotourism]]" but remove people from their land. Between 1986 and 1996, Kovel notes that over three million people were displaced by "conservation projects"; in the making of the [[US National Parks]], three hundred [[Shoshone]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] were killed in the development of [[Yosemite]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel believes that deep ecology has affected the rest of the Green movement and led to calls from restrictions on [[immigration]], "often allying with reactionaries in a... cryptically [[Racism|racist]] quest".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Indeed, he finds traces of deep ecology in the "biological reduction" of [[Nazism]], an ideology many "organicist thinkers" have found appealing, including [[Herbert Gruhl]], a founder of the German Green Party (who subsequently left when it became more [[left-wing]]) and originator of the phrase "neither left nor right, but ahead". Kovel warns that, while '[[ecofascism]]' is confined to a narrow band of [[far right]] intellectuals and disaffected [[white power skinhead]]s who involved themselves alongside [[far left]] groups in the [[anti-globalization movement]], it may be "imposed as a [[revolution from above]] to install an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime in order to preserve the main workings of the system" in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of bioregionalism===
[[Bioregionalism]], a philosophy developed by writers like [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] who believe in the self-sufficiency of "appropriate bioregional boundaries" drawn up by inhabitants of "an area",&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;Sale, K., 'Principle of Bioregionalism', in Goldsmith, E., and Mander, J. (eds),''The Case against the Global Economy'', Sierra Club Books (San Francisco, CA), 1996&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} has been thoroughly critiqued by [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], who fears that the "vagueness" of the area will lead to conflict and further boundaries between communities.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} While Sale cites the bioregional living of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel notes that such ideas are impossible to translate to populations of modern proportions, and evidences the fact that Native Americans held land in [[commons]], rather than [[private property]] – thus, for eco-socialists, bioregionalism provides no understanding of what is needed to transform society, and what the inevitable "response of the capitalist state" would be to people constructing bioregionalism.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel also attacks the problems of self-sufficiency. Where [[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale]] believes in self-sufficient regions "each developing the energy of its peculiar ecology", such as "wood in the northwest [USA]",&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel asks "how on earth" these can be made sufficient for regional needs, and notes the environmental damage of converting [[Seattle]] into a "forest-destroying and smoke-spewing wood-burning" city. Kovel also questions Sale's insistence on bioregions that do "not require connections with the outside, but within strict limits", and whether this precludes journeys to visit family members and other forms of travel.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of variants of eco-feminism===
Like many variants of socialism and Green politics, eco-socialists recognise the importance of "the gendered bifurcation of nature" and support the emancipation of [[gender]] as it "is at the root of [[patriarchy]] and [[Social class|class]]". Nevertheless, while Kovel believes that "any path out of capitalism must also be [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminist]]", he criticises types of ecofeminism that are not anti-capitalist and can "essentialize women's closeness to nature and build from there, submerging history into nature", becoming more at place in the "comforts of the [[New Age]] Growth Centre". These limitations, for Kovel, "keep ecofeminism from becoming a coherent social movement".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of social ecology===
While having much in common with the radical tradition of [[Social ecology (theory)|Social Ecology]], eco-socialists still see themselves as distinct. [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] believes this is because social ecologists see hierarchy "in-itself" as the cause of [[Ecology|ecological]] destruction, whereas eco-socialists focus on gender and class domination embodied in capitalism and recognise that forms of authority that are not "an expropriation of human power for... self-aggrandizement", such as a student-teacher relationship that is "reciprocal and mutual", are beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In practice, Kovel describes [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] as continuing the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] tradition of [[non-violent direct action]], which is "necessary" but "not sufficient" because "it leaves unspoken the question of building an ecological society beyond capital". Furthermore, Social Ecologists and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] tend to focus on the state alone, rather than the class relations behind state domination (in the view of Marxists). Kovel fears that this is political, springing from historic hostility to [[Marxism]] among anarchists and sectarianism, which he points out as a fault of the "brilliant" but "dogmatic" founder of social ecology, [[Murray Bookchin]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Opposition to Malthusianism and Neo-Malthusianism===
While [[Malthusianism]] and eco-socialism overlap within the Green movement because both address [[Industrialization|over-industrialism]], and despite the fact that Eco-socialists, like many within the Green movement, are described as [[Neo-malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] because of their criticism of [[economic growth]], Eco-socialists are opposed to Malthusianism. This divergence stems from the difference between Marxist and Malthusian examinations of social injustice – whereas Marx blames [[Social inequality|inequality]] on class injustice, [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]] argued that the [[working-class]] remained poor because of their greater [[fertility]] and [[birth rate]]s.

Neo-Malthusians have slightly modified this analysis by increasing their focus on [[overconsumption]] – nonetheless, eco-socialists find this attention inadequate. They point to the fact that Malthus did not thoroughly examine ecology and that [[Garrett Hardin]], a key Neo-Malthusian, suggested that further [[enclosure|enclosed]] and privatised land, as opposed to commons, would solve the chief environmental problem, which Hardin labeled the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

===The "two varieties of environmentalism"===
[[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Juan Martinez-Alier|Martinez-Alier]] attack the gulf between what they see as the two "varieties of [[environmentalism]]" – the environmentalism of the North, an aesthetic environmentalism that is the privilege of wealthy people who no longer have basic material concerns, and the environmentalism of the South, where people's local environment is a source of communal wealth and such issues are a question of survival.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; Nonetheless, other eco-socialists, such as [[Derek Wall|Wall]], have also pointed out that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the Global North as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the [[environmental justice]] movement in the US and groups like [[MOVE]].&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

==Critique of other forms of socialism==
Eco-socialists choose to use the term '[[socialist]]', despite "the failings of its twentieth century interpretations", because it "still stands for the supersession of [[Capitalism|capital]]" and thus "the name, and the reality" must "become adequate for this time".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialists have nonetheless often diverged with other [[Marxist]] movements. Eco-socialism has also been partly influenced by and associated with [[agrarian socialism]] as well as some forms of [[Christian socialism]], especially in the United States.
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}

===Critique of 'Actually Existing Socialisms'===
For Kovel and [[Michael Lowy|Lowy]], eco-socialism is "the realization of the “first-epoch” socialisms" by resurrecting the notion of "free development of all producers", distancing themselves from "the attenuated, reformist aims of [[social democracy]] and the [[Productivism|productivist]] structures of the [[Bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic variations]] of socialism", such as forms of [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} They ground the failure of past [[socialist]] movements in "underdevelopment in the context of hostility by existing [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers", which led to "the denial of internal democracy" and "emulation of capitalist [[productivism]]".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel believes that the forms of 'actually existing socialism' consisted of "public ownership of the [[means of production]]", rather than meeting "the true definition" of socialism as "a [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]", with the Party-State bureaucracy acting as the "alienating substitute 'public'".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In analysing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Kovel feels that "conspiratorial" revolutionary movements "cut off from the development of society" will "find society an inert mass requiring leadership from above". From this, he notes that the anti-democratic [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] heritage meant that the [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]], who were aided into power by [[World War I|World War One]], were a minority who, when faced with a [[counter-revolution]] and invading [[Western world|Western]] powers, continued "the extraordinary needs of '[[war communism]]'", which "put the seal of [[authoritarianism]]" on the revolution; thus, for Kovel, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] "resorted to terror", shut down the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] (workers' councils) and emulated "capitalist efficiency and [[productivism]] as a means of survival", setting the stage for [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], in Kovel's eyes, came to oppose the nascent [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] [[environmentalism]] and its champion [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]], who was later attacked for "idealism"; Kovel describes [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s philosophy as "a sharply dualistic [[materialism]], rather similar to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] separation of matter and consciousness, and perfectly tooled... to the active working over of the dead, dull matter by the human hand", which led him to want to overcome Russian backwardness through rapid [[industrialization]]. This tendency was, according to Kovel, augmented by a desire to catch-up with the [[Western world|West]] and the "severe crisis" of the revolution's first years.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Furthermore, Kovel quotes [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], who believed in a [[Communism|Communist]] "superman" who would "learn how to move rivers and mountains".&lt;ref name=Trotsky&gt;Trotsky, L., ''Literature and Revolution'', 1924&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel believes that, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s "revolution from above" and mass terror in response to the early 1930s economic crisis, [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s writings "were given official imprimatur", despite the fact that [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] himself was eventually purged, as [[Stalinism]] attacked "the very notion of ecology... in addition to ecologies". Kovel adds that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] "would win the gold medal for enmity to nature", and that, in the face of massive [[environmental degradation]], the inflexible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bureaucracy became increasingly inefficient and unable to emulate capitalist accumulation, leading to a "vicious cycle" that led to its collapse.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of the wider socialist movement===
Beyond the forms of 'actually existing socialism', Kovel criticises [[Socialism|socialists]] in general as treating ecology "as an afterthought" and holding "a naive faith in the ecological capacities of a [[working-class]] defined by generations of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] production". He cites [[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]], who advocates increasing consumption levels under socialism, which, for Kovel, contradicts any notion of natural limits. He also criticises McNally's belief in releasing the "positive side of [[Capitalism|capital]]'s self-expansion"&lt;ref name=McNally&gt;McNally, D., ''Against the Market'', 1993 (London: Verso Books)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} after the emancipation of labor; instead, Kovel argues that a [[socialist]] society would "seek not to become larger" but would rather become "more ''realized''", choosing sufficiency and eschewing [[economic growth]]. Kovel further adds that the [[Socialism|socialist]] movement was historically conditioned by its origins in the era of [[industrialization]] so that, when modern [[Socialism|socialists]] like McNally advocate a socialism that "cannot be at the expense of the range of human satisfaction",&lt;ref name=McNally/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} they fail "to recognize that these satisfactions can be problematic with respect to nature when they have been historically shaped by the domination of nature".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Eco-socialist strategy==
Eco-socialists generally advocate the [[Non-violence|non-violent]] dismantling of capitalism and the state, focusing on collective ownership of the [[means of production]] by freely associated producers and restoration of the [[Commons]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} To get to an eco-socialist society, eco-socialists advocate [[working-class]] [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] resistance but also believe that there is potential for agency in autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups across the world who can build "prefigurative" projects for [[Non-violence|non-violent]] radical social change.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

These prefigurative steps go "beyond the [[Free market|market]] and the state"&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; and base production on the enhancement of [[use value]]s, leading to the internationalization of resistance communities in an 'Eco-socialist Party' or network of grassroots groups focused on [[Non-violence|non-violent]], radical social transformation. An 'Eco-socialist revolution' is then carried out.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}

===Agency===
Many eco-socialists, like Alan Roberts, have encouraged [[working-class]] action and resistance, such as the '[[green ban]]' movement in which workers refuse to participate in projects that are ecologically harmful.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; Similarly, [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] focuses on [[working-class]] involvement in the formation of eco-socialist parties or their increased involvement in existing [[Green Parties]]; however, he believes that, unlike many other forms of [[socialism|socialist]] analysis, "there is no privileged agent" or revolutionary [[Social class|class]], and that there is potential for agency in numerous autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups who can build "prefigurative" projects for [[Non-violence|non-violent]] radical social change. He defines "prefiguration" as "the potential for the given to contain the lineaments of what is to be", meaning that "a moment toward the future exists embedded in every point of the social organism where a need arises".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

If "everything has prefigurative potential", Kovel notes that forms of potential [[Ecology|ecological]] production will be "scattered", and thus suggests that "the task is to free them and connect them". While all "human [[ecosystem]]s" have "ecosocialist potential", Kovel points out that ones such as the [[World Bank]] have low potential, whereas internally democratic [[anti-globalization]] "affinity groups" have a high potential through a dialectic that involves the "active bringing and holding together of negations", such as the group acting as an alternative institution ("production of an [[Ecology|ecological]]/[[Socialism|socialist]] alternative") and trying to shut down a [[G8]] summit meeting ("resistance to capital"). Therefore, "practices that in the same motion enhance [[use-value]]s and diminish [[exchange-value]]s are the ideal" for eco-socialists.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Prefiguration===
For Kovel, the main prefigurative steps "are that people ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system... and that they include in this a consistent attack on the widespread belief that there can be no alternative to it", which will then "deligitimate the system and release people into struggle". Kovel justifies this by stating that "radical criticism of the given... can be a material force", even without an alternative, "because it can seize the mind of the masses of people", leading to "dynamic" and "exponential", rather than "incremental" and "linear", victories that spread rapidly. Following this, he advocates the expansion of the dialectical eco-socialist potential of groups through sustaining the confrontation and internal cohesion of [[human ecosystem]]s, leading to an "activation" of potentials in others that will "spread across the whole social field" as "a new set of orienting principles" that define an ideology or "'party-life' formation".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In the short-term, eco-socialists like Kovel advocate activities that have the "promise of breaking down the commodity form". This includes organizing labor, which is a "reconfiguring of the [[use-value]] of labor power"; forming [[cooperatives]], allowing "a relatively free association of labor"; forming localised currencies, which he sees as "undercutting the value-basis of money"; and supporting "radical media" that, in his eyes, involve an "undoing of the fetishism of commodities". [[Arran Gare]], [[Derek Wall|Wall]] and Kovel have advocated economic [[localism (politics)|localisation]] in the same vein as many in the [[Green politics|Green movement]], although they stress that it must be a prefigurative step rather than an end in itself.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gare2&gt;Gare, A., ''Creating an ecological socialist future'' in ''Capitalism, Nature, Socialism'' 11 (2), 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovel also advises political parties attempting to "democratize the state" that there should be "dialogue but no compromise" with established political parties, and that there must be "a continual association of electoral work with movement work" to avoid "being sucked back into the system". Such parties, he believes, should focus on "the local rungs of the political system" first, before running national campaigns that "challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel believes in building prefigurations around forms of production based on [[use value]]s, which will provide a practical vision of a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Anti-statism|post-statist]] system. Such projects include [[Indymedia]] ("a democratic rendering of the [[use-value]]s of new technologies such as the [[Internet]], and a continual involvement in wider struggle"), [[open-source software]], [[Wikipedia]], [[public libraries]] and many other initiatives, especially those developed within the [[anti-globalisation movement]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} These strategies, in [[Derek Wall|Wall]]'s words, "go beyond the [[Free market|market]] and the state" by rejecting the supposed dichotomy between [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] and [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] production, while also rejecting any combination of the two through a [[mixed economy]]. He states that these present forms of "amphibious politics", which are "half in the dirty water of the present but seeking to move on to a new, unexplored territory".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Wall suggests that [[open source software]], for example, opens up "a new form of [[commons]] regime in [[cyberspace]]", which he praises as production "for the pleasure of invention" that gives "access to resources without exchange". He believes that [[open source]] has "bypassed" both the [[Free market|market]] and the state, and could provide "developing countries with free access to vital computer software". Furthermore, he suggests that an "[[open source]] economy" means that "the barrier between user and provider is eroded", allowing for "cooperative creativity". He links this to [[Marxism]] and the notion of [[usufruct]], asserting that "Marx would have been a [[Firefox]] user".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

===Internationalization of prefiguration and the 'Eco-socialist Party'===
Many eco-socialists have noted that the potential for building such projects is easier for media workers than for those in heavy industry because of the decline in [[trade unionism]] and the [[Globalization|globalized]] [[division of labor]] which divides workers. However, Kovel believes that examples like the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bruderhof Communities]] (despite elements of [[patriarchy]] that he attacks) show that "communistic" organizations can "survive rather well in a heavily industrialized [[Free market|market]]" if they are "protected" from the dependence on the [[Free market|market]] by "[[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] intentionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further posits that [[class struggle]] is "internationalized in the face of globalization", as evidenced by a wave of [[Strike action|strikes]] across the [[Global South]] in the first half of the year 2000; indeed, he says that "labor's most cherished values are already immanently ecocentric".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel therefore thinks that these universalizing tendencies must lead to the formation of "a consciously 'Ecosocialist Party'" that is neither like a parliamentary or vanguardist party. Instead, Kovel advocates a form of [[political party]] "grounded in communities of resistance", where delegates from these communities form the core of the party's activists, and these delegates and the "open and transparent" assembly they form are subject to [[Recall election|recall]] and regular rotation of members. He holds up the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) and the [[Gaviotas]] movement as examples of such communities, which "are produced outside capitalist circuits" and show that "there can be no single way valid for all peoples".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Nonetheless, he also firmly believes in connecting these movements, stating that "ecosocialism will be international or it will be nothing" and hoping that the Ecosocialist Party can retain the autonomy of local communities while supporting them materially. With an ever-expanding party, Kovel hopes that "defections" by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] will occur, leading eventually to the [[armed forces]] and [[police]] who, in joining the [[revolution]], will signify that "the turning point is reached".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

=='The Revolution' and transition to eco-socialism==
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}
'The Revolution' as envisaged by eco-socialists involves an immediate socio-political transition. Internationally, eco-socialists believe in a reform of the nature of [[money]] and the formation of a 'World People's Trade Organisation' (WPTO) that democratizes and improves world [[trade]] through the calculation of an 'Ecological Price' (EP) for goods. This would then be followed by a transformation of socioeconomic conditions towards ecological production, [[commons]] land and notions of [[usufruct]] (that seek to improve the common property possessed by society) to end private [[property]]. Eco-socialists assert that this must be carried out with adherence to [[non-violence]]&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The immediate aftermath of the revolution===
Eco-socialists like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] use the term "Eco-socialist revolution" to describe the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those "whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production" (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those "whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to [[Capitalism|capital]]" (including the [[bourgeoisie]], advertising executives and more) and "the workers whose activity added surplus value to capitalist commodities".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In terms of political organisation, he advocates an "interim assembly" made up of the revolutionaries that can "devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained" (such as short-term continuation of "differential remuneration" for labor), "handle the redistribution of social roles and assets", convene "in widespread locations", and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an "executive council" that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that "productive communities" will "form the political as well as economic unit of society" and "organize others" to make a transition to eco-socialist production.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

He adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with "associate membership" of others, such as a [[Physician|doctor]] having main membership of healthcare communities as a [[Physician|doctor]] and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional "supervisory" roles over localities to monitor the development of [[ecosystem]]ic integrity, and administer "society-wide services" like transport in "state-like functions", before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to "the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Transnational trade and capital reform===
Part of the eco-socialist transition, in Kovel’s eyes, is the reforming [[money]] to retain its use in "enabling exchanges" while reducing its functions as "a commodity in its own right" and "repository of value". He argues for directing [[money]] to "enhancement of [[use-value]]s" through a "subsidization of [[use-value]]s" that "preserves the functioning core of the economy while gaining time and space for rebuilding it". Internationally, he believes in the immediate cessation of [[speculation]] in [[Currency|currencies]] ("breaking down the function of money as commodity, and redirecting funds on [[use-value]]s"), the cancellation of the debt of the [[Global South]] ("breaking the back of the value function" of money) and the redirecting the "vast reservoir of mainly phony value" to reparations and "ecologically sound development". He suggests the end of military aid and other forms of support to "[[comprador elites]] in the [[Global South|South]]" will eventually "lead to their collapse".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In terms of [[trade]], Kovel advocates a ‘World People’s Trade Organization’ (WPTO), "responsible to a confederation of popular bodies", in which "the degree of control over [[trade]] is... proportional to involvement with production", meaning that "farmers would have a special say over food trade" and so on. He posits that the WPTO should have an elected council that will oversee a reform of prices in favour of an ‘Ecological Price’ (EP) "determined by the difference between actual [[use-value]]s and fully realized ones", thus having low [[tariff]]s for forms of ecological production like [[organic agriculture]]; he also envisages the high [[tariff]]s on non-ecological production providing subsidies to ecological production units.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

The EP would also internalize the costs of current [[Externality|externalities]] (like [[pollution]]) and "would be set as a function of the distance traded", reducing the effects of long-distance transport like [[carbon emissions]] and increased [[packaging]] of goods. He thinks that this will provide a "standard of transformation" for non-ecological industries, like the [[automobile industry]], thus spurring changes towards ecological production.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Ecological production===
Eco-socialists pursue "[[ecology|ecological]] production" that, according to [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], goes beyond the [[Socialism|socialist]] vision of the emancipation of labor to "the realization of [[use-value]]s and the appropriation of intrinsic value". He envisions a form of production in which "the making of a thing becomes part of the thing made" so that, using a high quality meal as an analogy, "pleasure would obtain for the cooking of the meal" - thus activities "reserved as hobbies under capitalism" would "compose the fabric of everyday life" under eco-socialism.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This, for Kovel, is achieved if labor is "freely chosen and developed... with a fully realized [[use-value]]" achieved by a "negation" of [[exchange-value]], and he exemplifies the [[Food Not Bombs]] project for adopting this. He believes that the notion of "mutual recognition... for the process as well as the product" will avoid [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[hierarchy]]. With production allowing humanity to "live more directly and receptively embedded in [[nature]]", Kovel predicts that "a reorientation of human need" will occur that recognises [[Ecology|ecological]] limits and sees [[technology]] as "fully participant in the life of [[eco-system]]s", thus removing it from profit-making exercises.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In the course on an Eco-socialist revolution, writers like Kovel advocate a "rapid conversion to ecosocialist production" for all enterprises, followed by "restoring [[ecosystem]]ic integrity to the workplace" through steps like workers ownership. He then believes that the new enterprises can build "socially developed plans" of production for societal needs, such as efficient light-rail transport components. At the same time, Kovel argues for the transformation of essential but, under capitalism, non-productive labour, such as child care, into productive labour, "thereby giving reproductive labour a status equivalent to productive labour".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

During such a transition, he believes that income should be guaranteed and that money will still be used under "new conditions of value… according to use and to the degree to which ecosystem integrity is developed and advanced by any particular production". Within this structure, Kovel asserts that markets and will become unnecessary – although "market phenomena" in personal exchanges and other small instances might be adopted – and communities and elected assemblies will democratically decide on the allocation of resources.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[István Mészáros (professor)|Istvan Meszaros]] believes that such "genuinely planned and self-managed (as opposed to bureaucratically planned from above) productive activities" are essential if eco-socialism is to meet its "fundamental objectives".&lt;ref name=Meszaros&gt;Meszaros, I., ''Beyond Capital'', 1996 (New York:Monthly Review Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-socialists are quick to assert that their focus on "production" does not mean that there will be an increase in production and labor under Eco-socialism. Kovel thinks that the emancipation of labor and the realization of [[use-value]] will allow "the spheres of work and culture to be reintegrated". He cites the example of [[Guarani people|Paraguayan Indian]] communities (organised by [[Jesuits]]) in the eighteenth century who made sure that all community members learned musical instruments, and had labourers take musical instruments to the fields and takes turns playing music or harvesting.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Commons, property and 'usufruct'===
Most eco-socialists, including [[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Martinez Alier]], echo subsistence [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminists]] like [[Vandana Shiva]] when they argue for the restoration of [[commons]] land over [[private property]]. They blame [[Ecology|ecological]] degradation on the inclination to short-term, profit-inspired decisions inherent within a [[Free market|market]] system. For them, [[privatization]] of land strips people of their local communal resources in the name of creating markets for [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal globalisation]], which benefits a minority. In their view, successful [[commons]] systems have been set up around the world throughout history to manage areas cooperatively, based on long-term needs and [[sustainability]] instead of short-term profit.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt;

Many eco-socialists focus on a modified version of the notion of ‘[[Usufruct]]’ to replace capitalist private [[property]] arrangements. As a legal term, [[Usufruct]] refers to the legal right to use and derive profit or benefit from [[property]] that belongs to another person, as long as the property is not damaged. According to eco-socialists like Kovel, a modern interpretation of the idea is "where one uses, enjoys – and through that, improves – another’s property", as its [[Latin]] etymology "condenses the two meanings of use – as in [[use-value]], and enjoyment – and as in the gratification expressed in freely associated labour". The idea, according to Kovel, has roots in the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and was first mentioned in [[Roman law]] "where it applied to ambiguities between masters and slaves with respect to property"; it also features in [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia|Sharia law]], [[Aztec#Economy|Aztec]] law and the [[Napoleonic Code]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Crucially for eco-socialists, Marx mentioned the idea when he stated that human beings are no more than the planet’s "[[usufruct]]aries, and, like ''boni patres familias'', they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition".&lt;ref name=Capital3/&gt; Kovel and others have taken on this reading, asserting that, in an eco-socialist society, "everyone will have... rights of use and ownership over those means of production necessary to express the creativity of human nature", namely "a place of one’s own" to decorate to personal taste, some personal possessions, the body and its attendant sexual and [[reproductive rights]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

However, Kovel sees [[property]] as "self-contradictory" because individuals emerge "in a tissue of social relations" and "nested circles", with the self at the centre and extended circles where "issues of sharing arise from early childhood on". He believes that "the full self is enhanced more by giving than by taking" and that eco-socialism is realized when material possessions weigh "lightly" upon the self – thus restoration of [[use-value]] allows things to be taken "concretely and sensuously" but "lightly, since things are enjoyed for themselves and not as buttresses for a shaky ego".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This, for Kovel, reverses what Marxists see as the [[commodity fetishism]] and atomization of individuals (through the "unappeasable craving" for "having and excluding others from having") under capitalism. Under eco-socialism, he therefore believes that enhancement of [[use-value]] will lead to differentiated ownership between the individual and the collective, where there are "distinct limits on the amount of [[property]] individuals control" and no-one can take control of resources that "would permit the alienation of [[means of production]] from another". He then hopes that the "hubris" of the notion of "ownership of the planet" will be replaced with [[usufruct]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Non-violence===
Most eco-socialists are involved in peace and antiwar movements, and eco-socialist writers, like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], generally believe that "violence is the rupturing of [[ecosystem]]s" and is therefore "deeply contrary to ecosocialist values". Kovel believes that revolutionary movements must prepare for post-revolutionary violence from counter-revolutionary sources by "prior development of the democratic sphere" within the movement, because "to the degree that people are capable of self-government, so will they turn away from violence and retribution" for "a self-governed people cannot be pushed around by any alien government". It is therefore essential, in [[Joel Kovel|Kovel's]] view, that the revolution "takes place in" or spreads quickly to the United States, which "is capital's gendarme and will crush any serious threat", and that revolutionaries reject the [[death penalty]] and retribution against former opponents or counter-revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Criticisms==
While in many ways the criticisms of eco-socialism combine the traditional criticisms of both socialism and Green politics, there are unique critiques of eco-socialism, which are largely from within the traditional Socialist or Green movements themselves, along with conservative criticisms.

Some socialists are critical of the word 'eco-socialism'. [[David Reilly (Eco-socialist)|David Reilly]], who questions whether his argument is improved by the use of an "exotic word", argues instead that the "real socialism" is "also a green or 'eco'" one that you get to "by dint of struggle".&lt;ref name=LeftClickCritic&gt;[http://leftclickblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/what-is-ecosocialism.html LeftClick Blog: ''What is ecosocialism?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Other socialists, like [[Paul Hampton]] of the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] (a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Third camp|third camp socialist]] party), see eco-socialism as "classless ecology", wherein eco-socialists have "given up on the working class" as the privileged agent of struggle by "borrowing bits from Marx but missing the locus of Marxist politics".&lt;ref name=AWLCritic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/8390|title=Joel Kovel meeting - why I'm sceptical about "eco-socialism"|first=|last=PaulHampton|date=28 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]]'', [[Doug Boucher]], [[Peter Caplan]], [[David Schwartzman]] and [[Jane Zara]] criticise eco-socialists in general (and Joel Kovel in particular) for a deterministic "[[catastrophism]]" that overlooks "the countervailing tendencies of both popular struggles and the efforts of capitalist governments to rationalize the system" and the "accomplishments of the [[labor movement]]" that "demonstrate that despite the interests and desires of capitalists, progress toward [[social justice]] is possible". They argue that an ecological socialism must be "built on hope, not fear".&lt;ref name=CNSCritics&gt;[http://www.dccofc.org/Documents/Review%20of%20Kovel.htm ''Capitalism Nature Socialism'' September 2003 - ''Another look at the end of the world''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112173453/http://www.dccofc.org/Documents/Review%20of%20Kovel.htm |date=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatives have criticised the perceived opportunism of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] groups who have increased their focus on green issues since the fall of [[communism]]. [[Fred L. Smith (political writer)|Fred L. Smith]] Jr., President of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] think-tank, exemplifies the conservative critique of left Greens, attacking the "[[pantheism]]" of the Green movement and conflating "[[neopaganism|eco-paganism]]" with eco-socialism. Like many conservative critics, Smith uses the term 'eco-socialism' to attack non-socialist [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] for advocating restrictions on the market-based solutions to ecological problems. He nevertheless wrongly claims that eco-socialists endorse "the Malthusian view of the relationship between man and nature", and states that [[Al Gore]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Vice President of the United States]] and now a [[climate change]] campaigner, is an eco-socialist, despite the fact that [[Al Gore|Gore]] has never used this term and is not recognised as a such by other followers of either Green politics or socialism.&lt;ref name=SmithCritic&gt;[http://www.policycounsel.org/46101/48601.html Policy Counsel - ''Eco-Paganism - Eco-socialism: Severe Threats to America's Future'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmentalists and [[Conservation movement|conservation]]ists have criticised eco-socialism from within the Green movement. In a review of Joel Kovel's ''The Enemy of Nature'', [[David M. Johns]] criticises eco-socialism for not offering "suggestions about near term [[Conservation movement|conservation]] policy" and focusing exclusively on long-term societal transformation. Johns believes that [[species extinction]] "started much earlier" than capitalism and suggests that eco-socialism neglects the fact that an [[Ecology|ecological]] society will need to transcend the destructiveness found in "all large-scale societies".&lt;ref name=NPSCritic&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cnps/2003/00000025/00000001/art00009?crawler=true|title=Reviews Editor's Introduction|first=JOHN C.|last=BERG|date=1 March 2003|journal=New Political Science|volume=25|issue=1|pages=129–143|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/0739314032000071262}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very tendency that Kovel himself attacks among capitalists and traditional leftists who attempt to reduce nature to "linear" human models.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Johns questions whether non-hierarchical social systems can provide for billions of people, and criticises eco-socialists for neglecting issues of [[Over-population|population pressure]]. Furthermore, Johns describes Kovel's argument that human hierarchy is founded on raiding to steal women as "archaic".

'''Fyodor Ivanovich Uspensky''' or '''Uspenskij''' ({{IPA-ru|ˈfʲɵdər ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ ʊsʲˈpʲɛnskʲɪj}}; {{lang-ru|Фёдор Иванович Успенский}}) was the preeminent [[Russia]]n Byzantinist in the first third of the 20th century. His works are considered to be among the finest illustrations of the flowering of [[Byzantine studies]] in the [[Russian Empire]].

Uspensky was born near [[Galich, Russia|Galich]] in 1845. He was educated at the [[University of St. Petersburg]], with his first thesis (1872) dedicated to [[Nicetas Choniates]]. For two decades (1874-1894) he read lectures at the Novorossiysky University in [[Odessa]]. This position allowed him to spend considerable time abroad.

Uspensky's doctoral thesis (1879) dealt with the foundation of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. Although he specialized in the Byzantine-Bulgarian relations and investigated the Slavic influence on the Byzantine economy, Uspensky also researched and wrote extensively on the [[Crusade]]s.

In 1894 Uspensky, who shared [[Slavophile]] ideals, decided to move to [[Constantinople]] to study and protect the surviving monuments of Byzantine antiquity, which had been neglected by the Ottoman authorities for centuries. He founded the [[Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople|Russian Archaeological Institute]] (headquartered at [[Studion]]) and presided over its pioneering archaeological research in Constantinople, [[Asia Minor]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. In 1900, he was elected into the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Uspensky was forced to abandon his work and flee [[Turkey]]..

Back in [[Petrograd]], the 70-year-old professor was invited to edit the organ of Byzantine studies, ''[[Vizantiyskiy Vremennik]]''. After the [[October Revolution]], he delivered lectures at the Leningrad University (1922–27) and, enduring criticism of the Bolshevik authorities, prepared for publication the results of a lifelong study, a monumental three-volume account of the history of the Byzantine Empire.

Uspensky died in [[Leningrad]] in 1928. The posthumous publication of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], based on numerous unpublished sources and unprecedented in scope, demonstrated the wide range of his scholarship. His book about the [[Trapezuntine Empire]] also appeared posthumously. The [[Taktikon Uspensky]] is named after him.

'''Hans Staden''' (c. 1525 – c. 1576) was a [[German people|German]] soldier and explorer who voyaged to [[South America]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, where he was captured by the [[Tupinambá people]] of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. He managed to survive and return safe to Europe. In his widely read [[captivity narrative|account describing his travel and captivity]], he claimed that the native people that held him captive practiced [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staden|first=Hans|title=Hans Staden’s True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJljy1yQ6mUC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2008|publisher=Duke UP|isbn=9780822342311|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trips to South America==
Staden was born in [[Homberg (Efze)|Homberg]] in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]].  He had received a good education and was in moderate circumstances when desire for travel led him to enlist in 1547 on a ship that was bound for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. He returned from this first trip on 8 October 1548, and, going to [[Seville]], enlisted for a second trip as a volunteer in an expedition for [[Río de la Plata]] which sailed in March 1549. On reaching the mouth of the river, two ships sank in a storm. After vainly trying to build a [[barque]], part of the shipwrecked crew set out overland for [[Asunción]]. The rest of the crew, including Staden (a knowledgeable gunman), sailed upon the third vessel for the island of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], but were also wrecked. Staden, with a few survivors, reached the continent in 1552,&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Staden, Hans|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was hired by the Portuguese thanks to his knowledge of the Canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Matthew Restall, Kris|title=Latin America in colonial times|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-13260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks later, while engaged in a hunting and mercenary expedition to steal riches, Staden was captured by a party belonging to the [[Tupinambá people]] of Brazil, an enemy group of the [[Tupiniquim people|Tupinikin people]] and their [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] allies.&lt;ref name="DuffyMetcalf2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=Eve M.|last2=Metcalf|first2=Alida C.|title=The Return of Hans Staden: A Go-between in the Atlantic World|year=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-0421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}} &lt;ref&gt;STADEN, Hans. Duas viagens ao Brasil: primeiros registros sobre o Brasil. Porto Alegre: L&amp;PM, 2011, p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; As Staden was part of a Portuguese crew, he was perceived of as an enemy of the Tupinamba and they carried him to their village (the predecessor of today's [[Ubatuba]]) where he claimed he was to be devoured at the next festivity.&lt;ref name="Hemming1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemming|first=John|authorlink=John Hemming (explorer)|title=Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians|year=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}} However, Staden allegedly won the favor of the Tupinamba Chief Cunhambebe by translating between the Tupinamba and European traders as well as predicting a Tupinikin attack on the tribe, thus his life was spared.&lt;ref name="Hemming1978"/&gt;{{rp|38}} Furthermore, when Staden later claimed to have cured the tribal king and his household from illness through the power of prayer and Christianity, the Tupinamba embraced him and called him "Scheraeire", meaning "Son, do not let me die".&lt;ref name="Staden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staden|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Staden|title=Hans Staden: The True History of His Captivity, 1557 |date=21 October 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-28543-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88–89}}  The Portuguese tried several times to negotiate for Staden's ransom, but the Indians declined all overtures. At last he made his escape on a French ship, and on 22 February 1555, arrived at [[Honfleur]], in [[Normandy]], and from there went immediately to his native city.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/staden%20part%201.htm ''Hans Staden, The True Story of his Captivity''] translated by Malcolm Letts, the Broadway Travelers, 1928, edited by Sir E.

==Narrative of his captivity==

After his return to Europe, the support of Dr. [[Johann Dryander (Eichmann)|Johann Dryander]] in [[Marburg]] enabled Staden to publish an [[captivity narrative|account of his captivity]], entitled ''Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen'' (''True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America'') (1557); the book was printed by [[Andreas Kolbe]].&lt;ref name="DuffyMetcalf2011"/&gt;{{rp|123}}&lt;ref name="Wade2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Mara R.|title=Foreign Encounters: Case Studies in German Literature Before 1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVnghFT0X0sC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1686-6|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Warhaftige Historia'' provided detailed descriptions of Tupinambá life and customs, illustrated by [[woodcut]]s.  The book became an international bestseller and was translated into [[Latin]] and many other European languages, reaching a total of 76 editions. [[Theodor de Bry]] produced illustrative engravings of Staden's story for his book ''Grand Voyages to America'' (1593), volume 3.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil L Whitehead]], "Introduction," ''Hans Staden’s True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil'', trans. Neil L. Whitehead and Michale Harbsmeier (Duke University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as a "Go-Between"==
Though little is known about Staden outside of his written travel accounts, his writings proved that one way to find favor in a hostile setting was to establish oneself as a mediator between groups in a position known as a go-between.&lt;ref name="Staden2004"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Go-betweens could mediate business or trade transactions between indigenous and European groups or translate language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Alida C. Metcalf, “Domingo Fernandes Nobre: ‘Tomacauna,’ a Go-Between in Sixteenth-Century Brazil,” in ''The Human Tradition in Colonial Latin America'', ed. Kenneth J. Andrien. (Oxford: SR Books, 2002), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  In captivity, Staden used his extensive knowledge of Tupinambá culture, religious veneration, and allegiance with the French to take on the role of a transactional go-between. As he had learned about South American indigenous culture and politics on a previous expedition, Staden first aimed to manipulate the Tupinambá into granting him his freedom.&lt;ref name="DuffyMetcalf2011"/&gt;{{rp|49}} He first attempted to convince the Tupinambá that he was truly a Frenchman and an ally; when a French trader visited the group, however, and denied Staden's story, this method failed and Staden was forced to think of new ways to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Staden, The True History of His Captivity, 1557 (London: Routledge, 2004).  Accessed February 12, 2013, http://0lib.mylibrary.com.mercury{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} concordia.ca/Open.Aspx?id=17813# P. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He began to view himself in more nationalistic terms as a German, who could not rely on the Portuguese and French as Christian Europeans to save him.&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Discovery of Germany in America: Hans Staden, Ulrich Schmidel, and the Construction of a German Identity | journal = Traversea: Journal of Transatlantic History | year = 2011 | first = Gene Rhea | last = Tucker | volume = 1 | pages = 26–45 | id =  | url = http://www.uta.edu/history/traversea/ojs/index.php/traversea/article/view/23 | accessdate = 2013-10-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016035727/http://www.uta.edu/history/traversea/ojs/index.php/traversea/article/view/23 | archivedate = 2013-10-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Staden quickly changed course and became an important transactional go-between who shared information of an anticipated attack by the Tupinambá's enemies, the Tupinikin. When the attack happened, the Tupinambá's trust in Staden grew.&lt;ref name="DuffyMetcalf2011"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Staden also became a religious go-between. Staden attempted to deceive the Tupinambá tribe, convincing them that he had the ability to foresee future events and connect them with his Christian God's emotions. Staden repeatedly linked negative or dangerous circumstances, such as death and illness, with God's anger, telling the Tupinambá that God had been angered by their threats to kill and eat him.&lt;ref name="DuffyMetcalf2011"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Furthermore, when another prisoner died, an enemy (of Germans) because he was Portuguese, who had supported the idea of killing Staden, Staden used this as an example of God's anger towards those who lie about his nationality. Thus, once again, Staden falsely tried to claim he was a Frenchman in attempt to persuade the Tupinambá to free him. As the Tupinambá began to link their good fortunes with Staden's happiness, which apparently appeased God, and their misfortune with hostility to Staden, which apparently angered God, they began to trust his stories and value him within the tribe.&lt;ref name="Staden2004"/&gt;{{rp|101}} As a captive of the Tupinambá, Staden relied heavily on his position as a go-between to gain favor and good will with them. Through excelling in this role he became an important asset to the group and despite constant threats of death, his life was spared. In 1555, Staden was finally able to make his escape and return to Europe.

==Cannibalism==
The aspect of the book that received the most attention, from the time of publication up to the present, was [[cannibalism]]. Staden claimed that the Tupinambá were cannibals, gave vivid eyewitness accounts of the killing, preparing and eating of [[prisoner of war|war captives]]. According to one anecdote, the Indians at one point gave him a delicious soup; after finishing his dinner, he found in the bottom of the cauldron some small skulls, which he later found out to be those of the boys in his choir.

Some scholars, such as anthropologist William Arens, have challenged the book's reliability, arguing that Staden invented its sensational accounts of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arens|first=William|title=The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy|year=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-976344-3 | pages=22–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hans Staden, Neil L.

==Later life==
Staden died, in either [[Wolfhagen]] or [[Korbach]], probably in 1579.  The exact date of his death is unknown.

==Staden in film==
* ''Hans Staden - Lá Vem Nossa Comida Pulando'' ([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166635/ Hans Staden - There He Comes, Our Food Jumping]), a [[1999 film]], directed by [[Luis Alberto Pereira]]), spoken in the [[Old Tupi|Tupi]] indigenous language (with subtitles in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) explores his adventures while being held captive by the Tupinamba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dvdbrazil.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewitem.asp?idproduct=612 |title = DVD Hans Staden| date=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Como Era Gostoso o meu Francês'' (''[[How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman]]''), a [[1970 film]], was based on Staden's stories (but did not include him as a character) and adds a subplot about the main character's love affair with a young native woman.

'''Herri Batasuna''' ({{pronunciation needed}}; {{lang-en|Popular Unity}}; '''HB''') was a [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[Basque nationalist]] coalition in [[Spain]]. It was founded in 1978 and defined itself as [[abertzale left|abertzale]], [[left-wing]], [[socialism|socialist]], and supported the independence of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Greater Basque Country]]. It was refounded as [[Batasuna]] in 2001 and subsequently outlawed by the Spanish [[Supreme Court (Spain)|Supreme Court]] for being considered the political wing of the terrorist [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna]] (ETA).

==History==
The party was founded in April 1978 as '''Herri Batasuna''', a coalition of leftist nationalist political groups initially brought together to advocate for "No" in the [[Spanish constitutional referendum, 1978|referendum to be held that year]] on the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish constitution]]. 

Its constituent parties had been called together by senior Basque nationalist [[Telesforo de Monzón]] in a 1978 meeting called "The table of [[Alsasua]]". Herri Batasuna's founding convention was held in [[Lekeitio]], home of [[Santiago Brouard]], who was then the leader of [[HASI]] (Herriko Alderdi Sozialista Iraultzailea or Revolutionary Socialist People's Party). The party won 150,000 votes in the Basque Country (15%) and 22,000 additional votes in Navarre (9%) in its first [[Spanish general election, 1979|Spanish general election]] in March 1979. Thus, they won three seats in the Spanish Parliament, which they did not occupy. The same happened in 1980 in the [[Basque parliamentary election, 1980|first elections to the Basque Parliament]], in which HB stood as a second political force, with 151,636 votes (16.55%), winning 11 seats. Its absence allowed a [[Basque Nationalist Party|BNP]]-only Basque government led by [[Carlos Garaikoetxea]]. On 20 November 1984, Brouard was assassinated by two members of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]]. The killing is perhaps{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} the only one performed by the GAL [[death squad]] within Spain itself.

Another well-known Herri Batasuna leader, [[Josu Muguruza]], was also killed by members of the neo-fascist [[Bases Autónomas]] in 1989, while he was in a hotel in [[Madrid]]. He was a congressman in the Spanish Parliament when he was assassinated.

==Electoral performance==
Since its foundation, Herri Batasuna ran for every election in the Basque Country and in Navarre, as well as in Spanish general elections (from 1979 to 1996) and the European elections of 1987, 1989 and 1994. In the [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000 Spanish general election]], it supported abstention. In the elections held from 1998 to 2001 it was part of the coalition [[Euskal Herritarrok]].

Herri Batasuna refused to participate in many of the institutions it won seats in, with the exception of local town halls.

The '''''Hiéron du Val d'Or''''' (English: "Sanctuary of the Golden Valley") was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] esoteric [[secret society]] in [[France]], which existed from 1873 until 1926. It was founded by a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Victor Drevon]] and the half-Basque, half-Russian baron [[Alexis de Sarachaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dubois|2005|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1991|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was allied to concepts of [[royalism]] and was [[culturally conservative]]; it sought to erect a Catholic [[hermeticism|hermetic]] freemasonry, contrary to the “secular” freemasonry of the anti-clerical [[Grand Orient de France]] and was particularly devoted to [[Christ the King]].

==History==
The group was founded in 1873 near the shrine at [[Paray-le-Monial]], historical [[Burgundy]], where St. [[Marguerite-Marie Alacoque]] had visions of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]], establishing the popular devotion. The area was popular in France as a pilgrimage destination, due to these connections. The ''Hiéron'' developed a museum and research center in 1877, which still exists to this day as the [[:fr:Musée eucharistique du Hiéron|Musée du Hiéron]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V1bitX6KwHcC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Hieron+de+Val+d+Or&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwA2oVChMI9rr7uKPjxgIVCVQUCh28BQOF#v=onepage&amp;q=Hieron%20de%20Val%20d%20Or&amp;f=false Politica Hermetica, Les contrées secretes, pp 79 - 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The building itself incorporated geometrical symbolism similar to that used within other Hermetic Christian settings. The Hiéron attempted to demonstrate the origins of [[Christianity]] in the mystical [[Atlantis]], worked to prepare the way for the social political reign of Christ the King in the year 2000 and devoted themselves to the name ''aor-agi'' ("light-fire").

Following the death of de Sarachaga in 1918, Georges Gabriel de Noaillat and his wife Marthe Devuns de Noaillat stayed at Paray and continued on the work of the Hiéron. They sought to downplay some of the more unorthodox aspects of the Hiéron's mysticism and comply closer to [[Catholic orthodoxy]]. In particular, they pushed hard for the recognition of the [[Feast of Christ the King]], which in 1925 was instituted by [[Pope Pius XI]] with the encyclical ''[[Quas primas]]''. After the death of the de Noaillats and their collaborator [[Jeanne Lépine-Authelain]] in 1926, the ''Hiéron'' essentially came to an end. However, the building itself still stands and remains to this day as a [[museum]] displaying Catholic [[sacred art]].

In 1921, the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] priest Fr. [[Félix Anizan]] founded the ''Regnabit: The Universal Review of the Sacred Heart'' journal. This publication featured a wider array of Paray-associated Catholic writers than just Hiéron and was approved by the Catholic hierarchy in France. However, Georges Gabriel de Noaillat was among the first contributors to the journal. Another contributor was the historian [[:fr:Louis Charbonneau-Lassay|Louis Charbonneau-Lassay]] who drew in the traditionalist philosopher [[René Guénon]] to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waterfield|2005|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a [[Martinist]], Guénon eventually moved towards [[Sufism]] of [[Islam]] and was a key figure in the [[Traditionalist School]]. One of the collaborators of the de Naoillats; Jeanne Lépine-Authelain; corresponded with the esotericist [[:fr:Paul Le Cour|Paul Le Cour]] who displayed an interest in the ''Hiéron'''s claims about Atlantis. Le Cour inherited de Sarachaga's gold ring and some see him as a successor, "in spirit", at least. Le Cour would go on to become a precursor to the [[New Age movement]], with his 1937 work ''The [[Age of Aquarius]].''

==Symbolism==
The Hiéron du Val d'Or held significance of certain images or dates such as the octopus which stood for the inconsistency of man while The Sacred Heart  stands for an abyss of constancy and fidelity. Each of these symbols were identified in the Tuscan Secret Records of the Plantier (doc 6) titled "The Hieron of Val d'Or" dated February 5 or 6 and June 24.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The '''Holly Oak Gorget''' or '''Holly Oak Pendant''' is an artifact made from a section of [[Exoskeleton|shell]] that is engraved with the image of an extinct [[woolly mammoth]] reportedly found in [[Holly Oak, Delaware]] and initially identified as an example of [[Paleoindian]] art.  Purported to have been a [[gorget]] carved during the [[Pleistocene]], this object is now widely believed to be an [[archaeological forgery]].

==History==
The Holly Oak Gorget was claimed to have been found in 1864 near the railroad station in Holly Oak. The object was reportedly found by Hilborne T. Cresson in 1864, but was not brought to the attention of the scientific community until December 1889 or the public until February 1890.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Meltzer, David| title=Holly Oak shell game:  an historic archaeological fraud | journal=Lulu linear punctuated | year=1983 | issue=72| pages=325–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The supposed discovery of the gorget by Cresson coincides directly with the discovery of another depiction of a woolly mammoth, in France; while excavating the [[Abri de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]] rock shelter in 1864 [[Édouard Lartet]] discovered a clear depiction of a woolly mammoth on a fragment of mammoth tusk, providing evidence that humans and mammoths might once have co-existed in Europe.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Griffin, James B., David J. Meltzer, Bruce D. Smith, William C. Sturtevant | title=A Mammoth Fraud in Science | journal=American Antiquity | year=1988 | volume=53| issue=3| pages=578–582 | doi=10.2307/281218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Holly Oak gorget had been introduced to the scientific community and the public at large, the shell was put aside and rarely mentioned in the archaeological literature of the time. It was displayed in the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[World's fair|International Expositions]] of [[Madrid]] and [[Chicago]] before fading from the public eye, only to be resurrected in the 1970s when its authenticity was once again subject to debate.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;

==Description==
The object is a single piece of [[whelk]] shell that has an engraving of a mammoth on one surface while the opposite side is undecorated. The shell has two small perforations along one side where a cord would have been strung so as to allow the gorget to be worn around the neck. The depiction of the mammoth is oriented horizontally, along the shell, rather than vertically as is most common. This means that when worn, the mammoth is depicted with the head facing down.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; It now bears some damage where the object was crushed by a microscope while undergoing tests at the Smithsonian Institution in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Williams, Stephen | title=The Earliest Americans | journal=Fantastic Archaeology | year=1991 | volume=| issue=| pages=116–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Description of discovery===
In his original report, Cresson states that the pendant was discovered in a hole being dug in the peat along the [[Delaware River]] and across from the Holly Oak station of the railroad, from which the site gets its name.&lt;ref name="Kraft"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kraft, John C., Ronald A. Thomas | title=Early Man at Holly Oak, Delaware | journal=Science | year=1976 | volume=192| issue=4241| pages=756–761 | doi=10.1126/science.192.4241.756 | pmid=17777164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, Cresson says that the shell was found amongst peat that was already spread across a farmers field, making it impossible to know which layer of the strata it came from, and thus determine its age.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;

In 1890, when the entire Holly Oak [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] was presented to the Peabody Museum it included 275 additional [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].  This assemblage comprised [[stone tools]], animal bones, wood which showed evidence of having been chopped by a [[flint tool|stone axe]], a [[mastodon]] tooth, Archaic [[projectile points]] and more objects which "make little sense archaeologically".&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; Many of the materials appear to be from the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]]; however, other materials, such as the bone implements and the gorget itself, suggest an older, possible [[Paleoindian]] origin.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;

Scientists also question the 25-year delay in bringing the find forward, for which Cresson did not have a convincing explanation. He claims that he did not understand the significance of the find at the time,&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; although, he would undoubtedly have been aware of the artifact's significance due to the prominence of the La Madeleine carving discovered in France.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sturtevant, William C., David J. Meltzer | title=The Holly Oak Pendant | journal=Science | year=1985 | volume=227| issue=4684| pages=242–244 | doi=10.1126/science.227.4684.242 | pmid=17742082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresson also discusses a family dispute over the announcement of the discovery, as they were unwilling to risk a controversy such as had been seen with the faked mastodon pipes in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;

===Shell ===
The shell that the gorget comprises is of a type that is mostly restricted to the [[Ohio Valley]] in the late [[Prehistoric period]]. This style of gorget is referred to as [[Fort Ancient]], and is not common near Delaware.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"/&gt; Here, Cresson's reputation does not lend him any aid. "The obvious inference to be drawn from this — that the shell for the engraving had been procured from an archaeological site or collection — was fortified by the discovery that Cresson had a record of theft from archaeological sites".&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt; Cresson was fired from the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition Survey]] in December 1891 for stealing some of the specimens from the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] Site.

In 1986, a 0.3&amp;nbsp;gram shell sample was submitted for [[radiocarbon dating]].  The tests gave an age of 1530 ± 110 [[Before Present|B.P.]] which, in calibrated years, dates the pendant to A.D. 885.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"/&gt; This date is well after the time when mammoths had become extinct in North America. The gorget was also claimed to have been found in a peat bog; taking into account the shell's basic pH, there is very little chance that the shell could have survived for 10,000 years or more in said environment.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"/&gt;

===Style===
In 1892, D.G. Brinton expressed the need to be suspicious of objects purported to have been made by aboriginal artists, listing the gorget and Lenape Stone as examples of such, citing the constant recurrence of frauds, and in 1893, after having examined the gorget and Lenape Stone, deemed both to have been recently made.&lt;ref name="Brinton a"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brinton, D.G | title=Current Notes on Anthropology | journal=Science | year=1892 | volume=20| issue=497| pages=90–91 | pmid=17792204 | doi=10.1126/science.ns-20.497.90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinton b"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brinton, D.G | title=Current Notes on Anthropology | journal=Science | year=1893 | volume=21| issue=523| page=75 | pmid=17784427 | doi=10.1126/science.ns-21.523.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people who have viewed the Holly Oak gorget have commented on how similar the drawing is to the La Madeleine tusk. Frederick Ward Putnam of the Peabody Museum, Thomas Wilson of the United States National Museum, Daniel Brinton of the University of Pennsylvania, and even Cresson himself, have all discussed the similarities present between the two objects.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;  At the time the shell became public, there were less than a half-dozen depictions of a mammoth available, and of those the La Madeleine drawing is by far the clearest depiction.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"/&gt; At the time of the Holly Oak pendant, as there were so few ways known of drawing a mammoth, the marked similarities between the two were not thought of as being unduly suspicious.

David Meltzer lists several parallels between the two. They both have the same orientation and posture, and while most mammoths are shown with bulbous feet, the feet of both the Holly Oak and La Madeleine mammoths end abruptly; in La Madeleine's case, this was because part of the carving is missing, but there is room on the Holly Oak gorget where the ends of the feet could have been drawn. Furthermore, the contour of the back of the animal was drawn several times on the La Madeleine tusk, but only once on the Holly Oak gorget - the latter resembles more a modern elephant than a mammoth, which is consistent only with Charles Rau's drawing of the La Madeleine tusk, which was one of the few drawings available to the public. The trunk and tusks also more resemble those of a modern elephant than those of a mammoth, as if the artist misinterpreted the drawing.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;

Kraft and Thomas, who believe that it is possible that the gorget may be authentic, do list this explanation among the possible theories for the artifact's existence.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt; There is, in general, a consensus that the gorget was faked using the drawing by Rau as being the most logical explanation for the manufacture of the object.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

There are some clever designs made by him, that now reside in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library at Paris]], which were done for a [[Paschal mystery|mystery of the Passion]] acted at Valenciennes in 1547.

'''Tomás Joaquín de Acosta y Pérez de Guzmán''' was a Colombian explorer, historian, [[chorography|chorographer]], and [[geologist]].

A native of [[Colombia]] in South America, he served in the Colombian army and in 1834 attempted a scientific survey of the territory between [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] and the [[Magdalena River]]. Seven years later he explored western Colombia from [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] to [[Anserma, Caldas|Anserma]] studying its topography, its natural history and the traces of its [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] inhabitants.

In 1845 he went to Spain to examine such documentary material concerning Colombia and its colonial history as was then accessible, and three years later he published his ''Compendio'', a work on the discovery and colonization of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (Colombia). The map accompanying this work, now out of date, was very fair for the time, and the work itself is still valuable for its abundant bibliographic references and biographic notes. What he says in it of the writings of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] the conqueror of New Granada, is very incomplete and in many ways erroneous, but his biographies remain a guide to the student of Spanish-American history. One year after the ''Compendio'', another work called ''Semenario'' appeared at [[Paris]], embodying the botanical papers of [[Francisco José de Caldas]].

== Personal life ==
He was the son of Josef Acosta and Soledad Pérez de Guzman and married Caroline Kemble Rowe. His daughter [[Soledad Acosta|Soledad Acosta de Samper]], born May 5, 1833, became a historian and writer and married [[José María Samper]], Colombian lawyer, writer and politician.&lt;ref name=GeniJoaquinAcosta&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/General-Tomas-Joaquin-Acosta-Perez/6000000022836168536 Tomas Joaquín Acosta Pérez] - Geni&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Khosrau would use Maurice's murder in 602 as an excuse to resume war with the Byzantines. Khosrau is seen here, finally defeated by [[Heraclius]] in the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]].]]

'''John of Epiphania''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Επιφανεύς}}) was a late sixth century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[historian]]. 

John was born in Epiphania (modern [[Hama]], Syria). He was a [[Christian]] and served as a legal counselor to the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], Gregory (ca. 590). John was also a cousin of the church historian [[Evagrius Scholasticus]].

John obviously received good training. In his role as legal adviser, he was a witness to the [[Persia|Persian]] king, [[Khosrau II|Khosrau Parvez]]'s retreat into Roman territory, and may have even met the king. Khosrau was restored to the Persian throne by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]. John may have also visited Persia (cf. Fragment 1)

John wrote a history of the [[Perso-Byzantine_wars#Roman.E2.80.93Sassanid_Wars wars|Byzantine-Persian]] wars; from the campaigns of [[Khosrau I]] against [[Justin II]], to the flight of his grandson [[Khosrau II]] to the Byzantines. The work is lost, but a fragment is preserved. The history was used by [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]] and [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. As with many other Byzantine works, it is written in an [[Atticism|archaic]] form of [[Greek language|Greek]], meant to imitate the classical style (e.g. [[Thucidydes]]).

'''Louis Dutens''' (15 January 1730{{snd}}23 May 1812) was a French writer born in [[Tours]], of [[Protestant]] parents, who lived most of his life in Britain or in British service on the continent.
[[Image:Dutens - Du miroir ardent d'Archimede, 1775 - 1505075.jpg|thumb|''Du miroir ardent d'Archimede'', 1775]]

He went to London, where his uncle was a jeweller, and there obtained a situation as tutor in a private family. In this position he learnt mathematics, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and several oriental languages. He took orders, and was appointed chaplain and secretary to the English [[minister (diplomacy)|minister]] at the court of [[Turin]] in October 1758. From 1760 to 1762, he was [[chargé d'affaires]] at Turin. [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], before retiring from office in 1763, procured him a pension. He again went to Turin as chargé d'affaires; and during this second mission he collected and published an edition of the works of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (''Gothofridi Guillemi Leibnitii Opera Omnia'', Geneva, 6 vols., 1768) and wrote his ''Recherches sur l'origine des découvertes attribuées aux modernes'' (1766).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dutens, Louis|volume=8|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to England the [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] procured him the living of Elsdon, in [[Northumberland]], and made Dutens overseer and senior travel companion – in effect, tutor – to his younger [[Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley|son]] during his [[Grand Tour]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I was not considered in the capacity of Lord Algernon's tutor; but he had been commanded to conduct himself according to my advice, and to pay the same deference to me that he would to his father himself." from ''Memoirs of a Traveler, Now in Retirement'' (vol. 2, London, 1806), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; At Rome in 1769, Dutens published ''Le tocsin'' (later published in Paris as ''Appel au bon sens''),&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Traveler, Now in Retirement'' (vol. 2, London, 1806), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; a work of Christian [[apologetics]].  He was active in civic life beyond the parish and preached the annual sermon to the Charity School of St Nicholas, Newcastle, in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Newcastle Courant 7 May 1768.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, he became a member of the French [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|Academy of Inscriptions]] and a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. Dutens was for a third time chargé d'affaires at Turin. He was in Paris in 1783, and returned to London the following year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Between 1775 and 1805, he wrote his ''Memoirs of a Traveler, Now in Retirement'', which contains a wide-ranging miscellany of Dutens' life "interspersed with historical, literary, and political anecdotes relative to the principal personages of the present age".&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Traveler, Now in Retirement'' (vol. 1, London, 1806), title page and p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London in 1812.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">[[File:Venezia - Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta (Malamocco).JPG|thumb|Santa Maria Assunta]]

'''Malamocco''' ({{lang-vec|Małamoco}}) was the first, and for a long time, the only settlement on the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido of Venice]] [[barrier island]]. It was the location of the original home of the [[Doge of Venice]]. Located just south of the island's center, it is part of the Lido-Pellestrina borough of the [[Metropolitan City of Venice|Comune of Venice]]. It is sometimes mis-identified as ''Metamaucum'', though the latter town was located on a nearby island, and was submerged by rising sea levels.&lt;ref name="metamaucum"&gt;A previous version of this article identified ''Metamaucum'' as an older name for Malamocco. Some authors do equate the two locations.  For example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Flebhb_ZMHYC&amp;pg=PA17 Life and Works of Saint Gregentios, Archbishop of Taphar. Albrecht Berger, 2006.] Others (for example [https://books.google.com/books?id=J1sdAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA524 Handbook for Travelers in Northern Italy, John Murray, and Francis Palgrave, 1869]) suggests that these were separate locations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malamocco also refers to one of the three narrow channels in the barrier island chain that separates the [[Venetian Lagoon]] with the [[Adriatic Sea]], the other two being the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Chioggia]] channels. The Malamocco Channel, with a depth of 14 meters, is dedicated to cargo ships making use of the Marghera commercial/industrial port facilitites of the Port of Venice.&lt;ref name="port"&gt;[https://www.port.venice.it/en/access-from-the-sea.html Port of Venice website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malamocco has a parish church now devoted to Santa Maria Assunta, but which was originally dedicated to Madonna della Marina, "Our Lady of the Sea". The church dates from the 12th century and is built in Veneto-Byzantine style.&lt;ref name="church"&gt;See: [http://www.veneziasi.it/en/churches-venice-lido/church-saint-maria-assunta.html "Santa Maria Assunta, Malacocco.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529222133/http://www.veneziasi.it/en/churches-venice-lido/church-saint-maria-assunta.html |date=2014-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It underwent modifications in 1339 and 1557. The belltower has a peal of four bells in the chord of F major, cast in 1803.
It can be found in Piazza Maggiore in the picturesque district of Malamocco on Lido. In Malamocco there is also the ponte (bridge) Borgo,  the Palazzo Pretorio and a monument in hexagonal form with Pisani family’s coat of arms. The Pisani governed Malamocco around the middle of  1537.

The interior of the church is based on one nave and with  that dates in part to the 12th century, with 14th and 15th century additions. The 15th-century ''Palazzo del Podestà'' is in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].

[[Teodato Ipato|Theodatus]], the second [[doge of Venice]] (742-755), moved the ducal seat from [[Eraclea]] to Malamocco, where it remained until 812, when it was moved to the [[Rialto]] after the exile of doge [[Obelerio degli Antenori|Obelerius]], who returned with the support of Malamocco in 832, but was defeated and the district burnt. During the [[Republic of Venice|period of the Republic]], Malamocco was one of nine districts of the ''[[Dogado]]''. It was ruled by a ''[[podestà]]'' elected for a sixteen-month term.

'''Mount Nisir''' (also spelled '''Mount Niṣir''', and also called '''Mount Nimush'''), mentioned in the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', is supposedly the mountain known today as Pir Omar Gudrun (elevation 9000&amp;nbsp;ft. (approx. 2743 m)), near the city [[Sulaymaniyah]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. The name may mean "Mount of Salvation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scolnic|first=Benjamin Edidin|title=If the Egyptians Drowned in the Red Sea where are Pharaoh's Chariots?: Exploring the Historical Dimension of the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1afWPqclgHYC&amp;pg=PA40|year=2005|publisher=UP of America|isbn=9780761831471|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', Mt. Nisir is the resting place of the ship built by [[Utnapishtim]]. Despite the precise descriptions in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', those curious have never attempted to search for the remains of the giant ship on Mt. Nisir.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Keller, ''The Bible As History: A Confirmation of the Book of Books'', trans. William Neil (New York: William Morrow and Company, 1956) 39. From Chapter 4, entitled "A Flood Story From Old Babylonia."&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative translation of "Mount Nisir" in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' XI,141a is based on the ambiguous words: "KUR-ú &lt;sup&gt;KUR&lt;/sup&gt; ''ni-sir'' held tight the boat."&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Best, ''Noah's Ark and the Ziusudra Epic'', page 277, Eisenbrauns, 1999, {{ISBN|0-9667840-1-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerian word KUR can mean land or country or hill, but not mountain. In Akkadian, KUR with the [[phonetic complement]] -ú is read as ''shadû'' which can mean hill or mountain.  The second KUR is a [[determinative]] indicating that ''nisir'' is the name of a hill or land or country (or in Akkadian a mountain).  But Thompson &lt;ref&gt;R. Campbell Thompson, ''The Epic of Gilgamesh'', Clarendon Press, 1930, page 63, lines 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; read this determinative as ''matu'', an Akkadian word for country.  The country Nisir may have got its name from ''nisirtu''  which means a locality that is hidden, inaccessible, or secluded.  Hence the boat may have grounded on an inaccessible hill.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Best, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 543, during the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic Wars]], [[Totila]] briefly took the city for the Ostrogoths, but the Byzantines seized control of the area following the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]].&lt;ref name="ostrogoths" /&gt; Naples was expected to keep in contact with the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], which was the centre of Byzantine power on the [[Italian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="byz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleinhenz |first=Christopher |title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2SBRqpIVtEUC&amp;pg=PA755&amp;lpg=PA755&amp;dq=duchy+of+naples |isbn=978-0-415-22126-9 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[exarch]]ate fell, a [[Duchy of Naples]] was created. Although Naples' [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture endured, it eventually switched allegiance from [[Constantinople]] to Rome under Duke [[Stephen II of Naples|Stephen II]], putting it under [[Pope|papal]] [[suzerainty]] by 763.&lt;ref name="byz" /&gt;

However, the disgruntled general populace chased him from the city, and instead elected [[Stephen III of Naples|Stephen III]], a man who minted coins with his own initials, rather than those of the Byzantine Emperor. Naples gained complete independence by the early ninth century.&lt;ref name="duchy" /&gt; During the 850s, the city was sacked by [[Saracen]] raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmar C. Krueger.

The duchy was under the direct control of the [[Lombards]] for a brief period, after the capture by [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf IV]] of the [[Principality of Capua]], a long-term rival of Naples; however, this regime lasted only three years before the Greco-Roman-influenced dukes were reinstated.&lt;ref name="duchy" /&gt; By the 11th century, Naples had begun to employ [[Normans|Norman]] mercenaries to battle their rivals; Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples|Sergius IV]] hired [[Rainulf Drengot]] to wage war on Capua for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradbury |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Bradbury |title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1C54r8GgrUIC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Sergius+IV+hired+Rainulf+Drengot |isbn=978-0-415-22126-9 |date=8 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1137, the Normans had attained great influence in Italy, controlling previously independent principalities and duchies such as [[Principality of Capua|Capua]], [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]], [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]] and [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]]; it was in this year that Naples, the last independent duchy in the southern part of the peninsula, came under Norman control. The last ruling duke of the duchy, [[Sergius VII of Naples|Sergius VII]], was forced to surrender to [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]], who had proclaimed himself [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]] seven years earlier.

During the time of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]], the effects of the [[French Revolution]] were felt in Naples: [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], an ally of the Bourbons, even arrived in the city in 1798 to warn against the French republicans.

Public health conditions in certain areas of the city were poor, with twelve epidemics of [[cholera]] and [[typhoid fever]] causing the death of some 48,000 people in the half century 1834–1884, and a high (for the time) [[death rate]] of 31.84 per thousand even in the epidemic-free period 1878–1883.{{r|snowden}} Then in 1884, Naples fell victim to a major [[cholera]] epidemic, caused largely by the city's poor [[sewerage]] infrastructure.

[[File:S.FrancescoPaola.jpg|thumb|The [[Piazza del Plebiscito]]]]
[[File:Napoli 2010 -Castel dell'Ovo- by-RaBoe.jpg|thumb|The [[Castel dell'Ovo|Egg Castle]]]]
The main city square or ''[[piazza]]'' of the city is the [[Piazza del Plebiscito]]. Its construction was begun by the Bonapartist king [[Joachim Murat]] and finished by the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]]. The piazza is bounded on the east by the [[Royal Palace (Naples)|Royal Palace]] and on the west by the church of [[San Francesco di Paola (Naples)|San Francesco di Paola]], with the colonnades extending on both sides. Nearby is the [[Teatro di San Carlo]], which is the oldest [[opera house]] in Italy. Directly across from San Carlo is [[Galleria Umberto I|Galleria Umberto]], a shopping centre and social hub.

Naples is well known for its historic castles: The most ancient is [[Castel dell'Ovo]] ("Egg Castle"), which was built on the tiny [[islet]] of Megarides, where the original [[Cumae]]an colonists had founded the city. In Roman times the islet became part of [[Lucullus]]'s villa and later it was the site to which the last western Roman emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1433 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814033557/http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1433 |archivedate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Castel Nuovo]], also known as ''Maschio [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angioino]]'', is one of the city's foremost landmarks; it was built during the time of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], the first [[List of monarchs of Naples|king of Naples]]. Castel Nuovo has seen many notable historical events: for example, in 1294, [[Pope Celestine V]] resigned as pope in a hall of the castle, and following this [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was elected pope by the cardinal [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]], before moving to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1372 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112011805/http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1372 |archivedate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Castel Capuano]] was built in the 12th century by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the son of [[Roger II of Sicily]], the first monarch of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was expanded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and became one of his royal palaces. Along its history the castle was the residence of many kings and queens. In the 16th century it became the Hall of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondazionecastelcapuano.it/storia.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 July 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710195335/http://www.fondazionecastelcapuano.it/storia.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Neapolitan castle is [[Castel Sant'Elmo]], which was completed in 1329 and is built in the shape of a [[star]]. Its strategic position that overlook the entire city made it the aim of various invaders. During the uprising of [[Masaniello]] in 1647, the Spanish took refuge in Sant'Elmo to escape the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Grispello, Il mistero di Castel Sant'Elmo, Napoli, Guida, 1999, {{ISBN|88-7188-322-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carmine Castle]], built in 1392 and highly modified in the 16th century by the Spanish, was demolished in 1906 to make room for the Via Marina, although two of the castle's towers remain as a monument. The Vigliena Fort, which was built in 1702, was destroyed in 1799 during the royalist war against the Parthenopean Republic, and is now abandoned and in ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero Gennaro, I castelli di Napoli, Napoli, Newton &amp; Compton, 1995, {{ISBN|88-7983-760-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously a Bourbon palace, now a museum and art gallery, the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] is another museum of note. [[List of works in the Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte|The gallery features]] paintings from the 13th to the 18th centuries, including major works by [[Simone Martini]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], [[Caravaggio]], [[El Greco]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Luca Giordano]]. The royal apartments are furnished with antique 18th-century furniture and a collection of [[porcelain]] and [[Victorian majolica|majolica]] from the various royal residences: the famous [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte Porcelain Factory]] once stood just adjacent to the palace.

In front of the [[Royal Palace of Naples]] stands the [[Galleria Umberto I]], which contains the [[Coral Jewellery Museum]]. Occupying a 19th-century palazzo renovated by the Portuguese architect [[Álvaro Siza]], the Museo d'Arte Contemporanea Donnaregina (MADRE) features an [[enfilade]] procession of permanent installations by artists such as [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Richard Serra]], and [[Rebecca Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Aric Chen (18 September 2005).

[[File:GalleriaUmbertoIStatue.jpg|thumb|Inside [[Galleria Umberto I]]]]
Aside from the Piazza del Plebiscito, Naples has two other major public squares: the [[Piazza Dante (Naples)|Piazza Dante]] and the [[Piazza dei Martiri]]. The latter originally had only a memorial to religious [[martyr]]s, but in 1866, after the [[Italian unification]], four lions were added, representing the four rebellions against the Bourbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inaples.it/ita/dettaglio.asp?idp=92&amp;cod=65 |publisher=INaples.it |title=Piazza Dei Martiri |date=8 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722035628/http://www.inaples.it/ita/dettaglio.asp?idp=92&amp;cod=65 |archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Gennaro dei Poveri]] is a Renaissance-era hospital for the poor, erected by the Spanish in 1667. It was the forerunner of a much more ambitious project, the [[Ospedale L'Albergo Reale dei Poveri, Naples|Bourbon Hospice for the Poor]] started by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]. This was for the destitute and ill of the city; it also provided a self-sufficient community where the poor would live and work. Though a notable landmark, it is no longer a functioning hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ceva Grimaldi |first=Francesco |title=Della città di Napoli dal tempo della sua fondazione sino al presente |year=1857 |publisher=Harvard University via Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G9DOLMIjFb4C&amp;pg=PA521&amp;lpg=PA521&amp;dq=%22Albergo+Reale+dei+Poveri%22+napoli |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subterranean Naples ====
[[File:Galleria borbonica - War refuge (Naples).jpg|thumb|[[Naples underground geothermal zone|Underground Naples]]]]
{{Main|Beneath Naples|Catacombs of San Gennaro|Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus|San Pietro ad Aram}}
[[Naples underground geothermal zone|Underneath Naples]] lies a series of caves and structures created by centuries of mining, and the city rests atop a major [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] zone. 
There are also a number of ancient [[Greco-Roman]] reservoirs dug out from the soft [[tuff|tufo stone]] on which, and from which, much of the city is built. Approximately {{convert|1|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} of the many kilometres of tunnels under the city can be visited from the [[Naples underground geothermal zone|Napoli Sotteranea]], situated in the historic centre of the city in [[Via dei Tribunali (Naples)|Via dei Tribunali]]. This system of tunnels and cisterns underlies most of the city and lies approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} below ground level. During [[World War II]], these tunnels were used as [[air-raid shelter]]s, and there are inscriptions in the walls depicting the suffering endured by the refugees of that era.

There are large [[Catacombs of San Gennaro|catacombs]] in and around the city, and other landmarks such as the [[Piscina Mirabilis]], the main cistern serving the [[Bay of Naples]] during Roman times.

Several archeological excavations are also present; they revealed in [[San Lorenzo Maggiore, Naples|San Lorenzo Maggiore]] the [[macellum of Naples]], and in [[Santa Chiara, Naples|Santa Chiara]], the biggest thermal complex of the city in Roman times.

==== Parks, gardens, villas, fountains and stairways====
{{Main|Villas in Naples|Stairways in Naples|List of fountains in Naples}}
[[File:FantanaSantaLucia2.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Comunale]]]]
Of the various [[park|public parks]] in Naples, the most prominent are the [[Villa Comunale]], which was built by the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] in the 1780s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/blog19.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030829022247/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/blog19.htm |archivedate=29 August 2003 |publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu |title=Villa Comunale |date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the park was originally a "Royal Garden", reserved for members of the royal family, but open to the public on special holidays. The Bosco di Capodimonte, the city's largest verdant space served as a royal hunting preserve, within the Park there are a further 16 historic buildings including residences, lodges, churches as well as fountains, statues, orchards and woods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museocapodimonte.beniculturali.it/information-en/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important park is the [[Parco Virgiliano]], which looks towards the tiny volcanic islet of [[Nisida]]; beyond Nisida lie [[Procida]] and [[Ischia]].&lt;ref name="parkvirg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://events.skyteam.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=32829 |publisher=SkyTeam.com |title=Parco Virgiliano |date=8 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003085052/http://events.skyteam.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=32829 |archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parco Virgiliano (Mergellina)|Parco Virgiliano]] was named after [[Virgil]], the classical Roman poet and Latin writer who is thought to be [[Virgil's tomb|entombed]] nearby.&lt;ref name="parkvirg" /&gt;
Naples is noted for its numerous stately [[villa]]s, fountains and stairways, such as the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[Villa Floridiana]], the [[Fountain of Neptune, Naples|Fountain of Neptune]] and the [[Pedamentina stairways]].

==== Neo-Gothic, ''Liberty Napoletano'' and modern architecture ====
[[File:Napoli - Castello Aselmeyer.jpg|left|thumb|Aselmeyer Castle, built by [[Lamont Young (Naples)|Lamont Young]] in the Neo-Gothic style]]
[[File:Liberty Napoli.jpg|thumb|One of the city's various examples of ''Liberty Napoletano'']]
Various buildings inspired by the [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] are extant in Naples, due to the influence that this movement had on the Scottish-Indian architect [[Lamont Young (Naples)|Lamont Young]], one of the most active Neapolitan architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Young left a significant footprint in the cityscape and designed many urban projects, such as the city's first subway.

In the first years of the 20th century, a local version of the [[Art Nouveau]] phenomenon, known as "Liberty Napoletano", developed in the city, creating many buildings which still stand today. In 1935, the Rationalist architect Luigi Cosenza created a new fish market for the city. During the [[Benito Mussolini]] era, the first structures of the city's "service center" were built, all in a Rationalist-Functionalist style, including the Palazzo delle Poste and the Pretura buildings. The [[Centro Direzionale (Naples)|Centro Direzionale di Napoli]] is the only adjacent cluster of skyscrapers in southern Europe.

== Geography ==
[[File:Napoli 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Naples]]]]
The city is situated on the [[Gulf of Naples]], on the western coast of [[southern Italy]]; it rises from sea level to an elevation of {{convert|450|m|ft}}. The small rivers which formerly crossed the centre of the city have since been covered over by construction. It lies between two notable [[volcanic]] regions, [[Mount Vesuvius]] and the [[Campi Flegrei]] ([[English language|en]]: ''Phlegraean Fields''). The islands of [[Procida]], [[Capri]] and [[Ischia]] can all be reached from Naples by [[hydrofoil]]s and ferries. [[Sorrento, Italy|Sorrento]] and the [[Amalfi Coast]] are situated south of the city, while the Roman ruins of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Oplontis]] and [[Stabiae]], which were destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, are also visible nearby. The port towns of [[Pozzuoli]] and [[Baiae|Baia]], which were part of the Roman naval facility of [[Portus Julius]], lie to the north of the city.

=== Quarters ===
[[File:Palazzo Don.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Donn'Anna]] and Bagno Donn'Anna beach in [[Posillipo]]]]
The thirty quarters (''[[quartiere|quartieri]]'') of Naples are listed below. For administrative purposes, these thirty neighborhoods are grouped together into ten governmental community boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palapa.it/palapadnn/Quartieri/tabid/52/Default.aspx |publisher=Palapa.it |title=Quartieri |date=8 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904060527/http://www.palapa.it/palapadnn/Quartieri/tabid/52/Default.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Naples has a borderline [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa'') and [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]], since only one summer month has less than {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=out}} of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely Mediterranean or humid subtropical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification |publisher=Institute for Veterinary Public Health – Vienna |year=2011 |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate and fertility of the [[Gulf of Naples]] made the region famous during Roman times, when emperors such as [[Claudius]] and [[Tiberius]] holidayed near the city.&lt;ref name="rome" /&gt; The climate is a crossover between maritime and continental features, as typical of peninsular Italy. Maritime features moderate the winters, but summers are quite similar to inland areas much further north in the country. The continental influence still ensures summer highs averaging near {{convert|30|C|F}}, and Naples falls within the [[subtropical climate]] range with summer daily means of {{convert|23|C|F}}.

== Education ==
[[Image:UniversitàNapoli.jpg|thumb|Main building of the [[University of Naples Federico II]]]]
Naples is noted for its numerous higher education institutes and research centres. Naples hosts what is thought to be the oldest state university in the world, in the form of the [[University of Naples Federico II]], which was founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1224. The university is among the most prominent in Italy, with around 100,000 students and over 3,000 professors in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.international.unina.it/contenuto.php?id_group=6&amp;id_pag=20 |publisher=UNINA.it |title=University of Naples 'Federico II' |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229100244/http://www.international.unina.it/contenuto.php?id_group=6&amp;id_pag=20 |archivedate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is host to the [[Botanical Garden of Naples]], which was opened in 1807 by [[Joseph Bonaparte]], using plans drawn up under the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]]. The garden's 15 hectares feature around 25,000 samples of vegetation, representing over 10,000 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ortobotanico.unina.it/VerInglese/pstoria/StoriaE.htm |publisher=OrtoBotanico.UNINA.it |title=Orto Botanico di Napoli |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212125906/http://www.ortobotanico.unina.it/VerInglese/pstoria/StoriaE.htm |archivedate=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naples is also served by the "[[Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli|Second University]]" (today named [[Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli|University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli]]), a modern university which opened in 1989, and which has strong links to the nearby [[province of Caserta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.napoliaffari.com/napoliaffari/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=255 |publisher=NapoliAffari.com |title=Scuola: Le Università |date=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719030942/http://www.napoliaffari.com/napoliaffari/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=255 |archivedate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable centre of education is the [[Naples Eastern University|Istituto Universitario Orientale]], which specialises in [[Eastern world|Eastern culture]], and was founded by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary Matteo Ripa in 1732, after he returned from the court of [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ripa |first=Matteo |title=Memoirs of Father Ripa: During Thirteen Years Residence at the Court of Peking in the Service of the Emperor of China |publisher=New York Public Library |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ex8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Memoirs+of+Father+Ripa&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Campania}}
[[File:Pal Giacom.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo San Giacomo, Naples|Palazzo San Giacomo]], the city hall.]]

=== Governance ===
Each of the 8,101 ''[[comune]]'' in Italy is today represented locally by a [[city council]] headed by an elected mayor, known as a ''sindaco'' and informally called the first citizen (''primo cittadino''). This system, or one very similar to it, has been in place since the invasion of Italy by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] forces in 1808. When the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] was restored, the system was kept in place with members of the nobility filling mayoral roles. By the end of the 19th century, [[political party|party politics]] had begun to emerge; during the [[Italian Fascism|fascist era]], each commune was represented by a ''podestà''. Since [[World War II]], the political landscape of Naples has been neither strongly [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] nor [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] – both [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] have governed the city at different times, with roughly equal frequency. Currently, the mayor of Naples is [[Luigi de Magistris (mayor)|Luigi de Magistris]] of the [[Democrazia Autonomia|Democrazia e Autonomia]] party; de Magistris has held the position since the 2011 elections.

Naples has long been a centre of art and architecture, dotted with Medieval, Baroque and Renaissance-era churches, castles and palaces. In the 18th century, Naples went through a period of [[neoclassicism]], following the discovery of the remarkably intact Roman ruins of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]].

The [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli|Neapolitan Academy of Fine Arts]], founded by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III of Bourbon]] in 1752 as the Real Accademia di Disegno ([[English language|en]]: ''Royal Academy of Design''), was the centre of the artistic School of [[Posillipo]] in the 19th century. Artists such as [[Domenico Morelli]], [[Giacomo Di Chirico]], [[Francesco Saverio Altamura]], and [[Gioacchino Toma]] worked in Naples during this period, and many of their works are now exhibited in the Academy's art collection. The modern Academy offers courses in painting, [[Interior design|decorating]], sculpture, design, [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]], and urban planning. Naples is also known for its theatres, which are among the oldest in Europe – the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] [[opera house]] dates back to the 18th century.

Naples is also the home of the artistic tradition of [[Capodimonte porcelain]]. In 1743, Charles of Bourbon founded the Royal Factory of Capodimonte, many of whose artworks are now on display in the [[Museum of Capodimonte]]. Several of Naples' mid-19th-century porcelain factories remain active today.

Naples is internationally famous for its [[Neapolitan cuisine|cuisine]] and wine; it draws culinary influences from the numerous cultures which have inhabited it over the course of its history, including the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], Spanish and French. Neapolitan cuisine emerged as a distinct form in the 18th century. The ingredients are typically rich in taste, while remaining affordable to the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.italianfoodforever.com/iff/articles.asp?id=55 |publisher=ItalianFoodForever.com |title=The Foods of Sicily – A Culinary Journey |date=24 June 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212090911/http://www.italianfoodforever.com/iff/articles.asp?id=55 |archivedate=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naples is traditionally credited as the home of [[pizza]].&lt;ref name="pizza" /&gt; This originated as a meal of the poor, but under [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] it became popular among the upper classes: famously, the [[Margherita (pizza)|Margherita]] pizza was named after Queen [[Margherita of Savoy|Margherita]] of [[Kingdom of Savoy|Savoy]] after her visit to the city.&lt;ref name="pizza"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.holidaycityflash.com/italy/pizza_naples.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619115409/http://www.holidaycityflash.com/italy/pizza_naples.htm |archivedate=19 June 2006 |publisher=HolidayCityFlash.com |title=Pizza – The Pride of Naples |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooked traditionally in a wood-burning [[Masonry oven|oven]], the ingredients of Neapolitan pizza have been strictly regulated by law since 2004, and must include wheat flour type "00" with the addition of flour type "0" [[yeast]], natural mineral water, peeled tomatoes or fresh [[cherry tomato]]es, [[mozzarella cheese]], [[sea salt]] and extra virgin [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.fornobravo.com/vera_pizza_napoletana/VPN_spec.html "Proposal of recognition of the Specialita' Traditionale Garantita 'Pizza Napoletana'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208104542/http://www.fornobravo.com/vera_pizza_napoletana/VPN_spec.html |date=8 February 2009 }}.

Naples is well known for its sweet dishes, including colourful [[gelato]], which is similar to [[ice cream]], though more fruit-based. Popular Neapolitan pastry dishes include ''[[zeppole]]'' (more commonly called "'a Pasta Cresciuta" and "'e fFritt' 'e Viento") ''[[Rum baba|babà]]'', ''[[sfogliatelle]]'' and ''[[pastiera]]'', the latter of which is prepared specially for Easter celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.emmeti.it/Cucina/Campania/Prodotti/Campania.PRO.79.uk.html |publisher=Emmeti.it |title=Campania – Cakes and Desserts |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054804/http://www.emmeti.it/Cucina/Campania/Prodotti/Campania.PRO.79.uk.html |archivedate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another seasonal sweet is ''[[struffoli]]'', a sweet-tasting [[honey]] dough decorated and eaten around Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/tastysweettreats/r/blr0359.htm |publisher=About.com |title=Struffoli – Neapolitan Christmas Treats |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510084331/http://italianfood.about.com/od/tastysweettreats/r/blr0359.htm |archivedate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neapolitan coffee is also widely acclaimed.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Neapolitan language}}
The [[Naples dialect]], considered to be a distinct language and mainly spoken in the city, is also found in the region of [[Campania]] and has been diffused into other areas of [[Southern Italy]] by Neapolitan migrants. On 14 October 2008, a regional law was enacted by Campania which has the effect that the use of the Neapolitan language is protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=548026 |title=Tutela del dialetto, primo via libera al Ddl campano |work=Il Denaro |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727043316/http://www.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=548026 |archivedate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Neapolitan language" is often used to describe the language of all of [[Campania]], and is sometimes applied to the entire [[South Italian language]]; ''[[Ethnologue]]'' refers to the latter as ''Napoletano-Calabrese''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Napoletano-Calabrese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nap |title=Ethnologue Napoletano-Calabrese |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001812/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nap |archivedate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This linguistic group is spoken throughout most of southern continental [[Italy]], including the [[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Italy|Sora]] district of southern [[Lazio]], the southern part of [[Marche]] and [[Abruzzo]], Molise, [[Basilicata]], northern [[Calabria]], and northern and central [[Apulia]].

Naples is one of the main centres of Italian literature. The history of the Neapolitan language was deeply entwined with that of the [[Tuscan dialect]] which then became the current Italian language. The first written testimonies of the Italian language are the [[Placiti Cassinensi]] legal documents, dated 960 A.D., preserved in the [[Monte Cassino]] Abbey, which are in fact evidence of a language spoken in a southern dialect. The Tuscan poet [[Boccaccio]] lived for many years at the court of King [[Robert the Wise]] and used Naples as a setting for ''[[The Decameron]]'' and a number of his later novels. His works contain some words that are taken from Neapolitan instead of the corresponding Italian, e.g. "testo" (neap.: "testa") which in Naples indicates a large terracotta jar used to cultivate shrubs and little trees. King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] stated in 1442 that the Neapolitan language was to be used instead of [[Latin]] in official documents.

Later Neapolitan was replaced by Spanish during Spanish domination, and then by Italian. In 1458 the ''[[Accademia Pontaniana]]'', one of the first academies in Italy, was established in Naples as a free initiative by men of letters, science and literature. In 1480 the writer and poet [[Jacopo Sannazzaro]] wrote the first pastoral romance, ''Arcadia'', which influenced Italian literature. In 1634 [[Giambattista Basile]] collected ''[[Pentamerone|Lo Cunto de li Cunti]]'', five books of ancient tales written in the Neapolitan dialect rather than Italian. Philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who theorised the existence of infinite solar systems and the infinity of the entire universe, completed his studies at University of Naples. Due to philosophers such as [[Giambattista Vico]], Naples became one of the centres of the Italian peninsula for historic and [[philosophy of history]] studies.

[[Jurisprudence]] studies were enhanced in Naples thanks to eminent personalities of jurists like [[Bernardo Tanucci]], [[Gaetano Filangieri]] and [[Antonio Genovesi]]. In the 18th century Naples, together with [[Milan]], became one of the most important sites from which the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] penetrated into Italy. Poet and philosopher [[Giacomo Leopardi]] visited the city in 1837 and then died there. His works influenced [[Francesco de Sanctis]] who made his studies in Naples, and then eventually became Minister of Instruction during the Italian kingdom. De Sanctis was one of the first literary critics to discover, study and diffusing the poems and literary works of the great poet from [[Recanati]].

Writer and journalist [[Matilde Serao]] co-founded the newspaper [[Il Mattino]] with her husband [[Edoardo Scarfoglio]] in 1892. Serao was an acclaimed novelist and writer during her day. Poet [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] was one of the most famous writers in the Neapolitan dialect, and many of his poems were adapted to music, becoming famous Neapolitan songs. In the 20th century, philosophers like [[Benedetto Croce]] pursued the long tradition of philosophy studies in Naples, and personalities like jurist and lawyer [[Enrico De Nicola]] pursued legal and constitutional studies. De Nicola later helped to draft the modern Constitution of the Italian Republic, and was eventually elected to the office of President of the Italian Republic. Other noted Neapolitan writers and journalists include [[Antonio De Curtis]], [[Curzio Malaparte]], [[Giancarlo Siani]] and [[Roberto Saviano]].

=== Theatre ===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 12.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Pulcinella]] in 1700.|alt=|281x281px]]
Naples was one of the centres of the peninsula from which originated the modern theatre genre as nowadays intended, evolving from 16th century "[[commedia dell'arte|comedy of art]]". 
The masked character of [[Pulcinella]] is worldwide famous figure either as theatrical character or [[puppetry]] character.

The music Opera genre of [[opera buffa]] was created in Naples in the 18th century and then spread to Rome and to northern Italy. In the period of [[Belle Époque]] Naples rivalled with Paris for its [[Café-chantants]], and many famous neapolitan songs were originally created to entertain the public in the cafès of Naples. Perhaps the most well known song is "Ninì Tirabusciò". The history of how this song was born was dramatised in the eponymous comedy movie "[[Ninì Tirabusciò: la donna che inventò la mossa]]" starring [[Monica Vitti]].

The Neapolitan popular genre of "[[Sceneggiata]]" is an important genre of modern folk theatre worldwide, dramatising common canon themes of thwarted love stories, comedies, tearjerker stories, commonly about honest people becoming [[camorra]] outlaws due to unfortunate events. The Sceneggiata became very popular amongst the neapolitan people, and then became one of the best known genres of Italian cinema because of actors and singers like [[Mario Merola (singer)|Mario Merola]] and [[Nino D'Angelo]]. Many writers and playwrights such as [[Raffaele Viviani]] wrote comedies and dramas for this genre. Actors and comedians like [[Eduardo Scarpetta]] and then his sons [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Peppino De Filippo]] and [[Titina De Filippo]], contributed towards making the neapolitan theatre and its comedies and tragedy plays well known, such as "[[Filumena Marturano]]" and "[[Side Street Story|Napoli Milionaria]]".

Naples has had significant influence on Italian cinema. Because of the significance of the city, many films and television shows are set (entirely or partially) in Naples. In addition to serving as the backdrop for several movies and shows, many talented celebrities (actors, actresses, directors, and producers) are originally from the city of Naples.

Naples was the location for several early Italian cinema masterpieces. ''[[Assunta Spina (1915 film)|Assunta Spina]]'' (1915) was a silent film adapted from a theatrical drama by Neapolitan writer, [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]]. The film was directed by Neapolitan [[Gustavo Serena]]. Serena also starred in the 1912 film, ''Romeo and Juliet.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.naplesldm.com/saldigiac.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106181815/http://www.naplesldm.com/saldigiac.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 January 2015 |title=Salvatore Di Giacomo |last=Matthews |first=Jeff |website=''naplesldm.com'' |access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784988/ |title=Gustavo Serena |publisher=IMDb |access-date=23 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216191617/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784988/ |archivedate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GITRwfip1R4C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=Romeo+and+Juliet+gustavo+serena&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUNf3ayRJS&amp;sig=3eHz28s0jc4jcjZgp7wfLG8lRGc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIg7n63-_PAhUL72MKHf49CjgQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=gustavo%20serena&amp;f=false |title=Romeo and Juliet |last=Shakespeare |first=William |last2=Loehlin |first2=James N. |date=25 April 2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-66769-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tailoring ===
Neapolitan tailoring offers comfort and lightness; it was born as an attempt to loosen up the stiffness of English tailoring, which didn't suit the Neapolitan lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journal.styleforum.net/neapolitan-jacket-characteristics/ |website=journal.styleforum.net |author=Arianna Reggio |date=6 June 2017 |title=Your Guide to Neapolitan Jacket Characteristics |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905043251/http://journal.styleforum.net/neapolitan-jacket-characteristics/ |archivedate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of Neapolitan tailoring:

* '''The Shoulders''': the Neapolitan jacket has no shoulder padding. Neapolitan tailors removed the shoulder padding from their jackets in order to provide more freedom of movement. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve ("spalla a camicia") and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10&amp;nbsp;cm larger than the armhole, and it can be finished with the "repecchia" – that visually interesting shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair, which supposedly allows for even more freedom of movement, is known as "manica a mappina", and it gives the jacket a beautiful "rugged" appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a "rollino" – a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly.
* '''The Sleeves''': the Neapolitan sleeve is shorter than that found on other jackets, as Neapolitans like shirt cuffs to show right above their wrists, especially when adorned with cufflinks. The sleeves are cut closer to the arms, in order to avoid extra fabric hanging when these are raised.
* '''The Pockets''': the pockets of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called "a barchetta", which means "little boat", due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it the shape of a stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name "a pignata". Neither of these features have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed look of a jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand finished stitching runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.
* '''The Lining''': lining is considered an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined, in order to provide lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open ("volante," literally "flying") so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.
* '''The Lapels''': Neapolitan jackets are famous for their wide [[lapels]], which oftentimes are peaked ("a punta") for double-breasted jackets, formal jackets, and coats. The "risvolto dentellato" (the "classic" style of lapels – not peaked) are notoriously wider in Neapolitan jackets: they can be as wide as 4 inches (compared to the 3 inches of a regular lapel width). Just as is the case for the pockets, the Neapolitan lapel features double stitching running along the sides – a stunning detail that's peculiar of a Neapolitan creation – although reserved for the less formal pieces. The "scollo a martiello" (literally "hammer neck") is the opening of the jacket over the shirt, which in Neapolitan tailoring is perfectly parallel to the lapels. The cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck, and it is usually higher in Neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure.
* '''The Body''': Neapolitan jackets tend to be shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, they say the jacket "zompa arrèto," which roughly translates as "it jumps in the back". This characteristic allows for the jacket to "slide" gracefully along the body. The vents on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The [[darts]] in the front go all the way down, to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters.
* '''Buttons and Buttonholes''': the three-roll-two construction features a lapel that hides the third button, in order to provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called "occhiello" in Italian, and it means "little eye" for its elongated almond shape. There isn't really a tradition for a specific type of [[buttonhole]] in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while "regular" buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape at the end of the buttonhole, but that's an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns the buttons on the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.

The '''Oromo conflict''' was an armed conflict between the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) and the [[Government of Ethiopia]]. The conflict began in 1973, when [[Oromo people|Oromo]] [[Nationalism|nationalists]] established the OLF and its armed wing, the [[Oromo Liberation Army]] (OLA).&lt;ref name="Triulzi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Being and Becoming Oromo|last=Triulzi|first=Alessandro|publisher=Gotab|year=1996|isbn=91-7106-379-X|location=Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Oromo people]] are an ethnic group that mainly inhabit [[Ethiopia]], with communities in neighbouring [[Kenya]] and [[Somalia]] as well.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;Merriam-Webster Inc, Frederick C. Mish, ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', (Merriam-Webster: 2003), p.876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teseme17/&gt; They are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and the wider [[Horn of Africa]]; according to a 2007 census,&lt;ref name="census2007p66"&gt;{{Citation| author = Central Statistical Agency| contribution = TABEL {{sic}} 5: Population size of Regions by Nations/Nationalities (ethnic group) and Place of Residence: 2007| title = Census 2007| year = 2008| page = 16, Table 2.2| place = [[Addis Ababa]]| publisher = Central Statistical Agency| url = http://ecastats.uneca.org/aicmd/Portals/0/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf| format = PDF| authorlink = Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160927032857/http://ecastats.uneca.org/aicmd/Portals/0/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf| archivedate = 2016-09-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; they make up about 34.5% of Ethiopia's population, and others estimate that they make up about 40% of the population.&lt;ref name=Teseme17&gt;{{cite book |last=Ta'a |first=Tesema |date=2006 |title=The Political Economy of an African Society in Transformation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XwN2JdMYM4C |location= |publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]] |page=17 |isbn=978-3-447-05419-5 |access-date=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the [[Ethiopian Empire|imperial regime]] of [[Haile Selassie I]] outlawed the [[Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association]] (MTSHA), an Oromo social movement, and conducted mass arrests and executions of its members. The group's leader, Colonel General [[Tadesse Birru]], who was a prominent military officer, was among those arrested.&lt;ref name="Adejumobi"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Ethiopia|last=Adejumobi|first=Saheed|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=0-313-32273-2|location=United States of America|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions by the regime sparked outrage among the Oromo community, ultimately leading to the formation of the [[Ethiopian National Liberation Front]] in 1967&lt;ref name="gadaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadaa.com/OromoLiberationFront.html|title=The Birth of the Oromo Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="gadaa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadaa.com/06142007002.pdf|title=Insurrection and invasion in the southeast, 1963-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

=== 1970–1980 ===
In 1973, the Ethiopian military [[Ethiopian Revolution|ousted]] the [[Ethiopian Empire|imperial regime]] and seized control of the country. The new regime promptly arrested Oromo leaders; subsequently, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) was formed during a secret conference attended by Oromo leaders, including [[Hussein Sora]] and [[Elemo Qiltu]].&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt; A group of armed Oromo fighters in the [[Chercher Mountains]] were adopted as the OLF's armed wing, the [[Oromo Liberation Army]] (OLA). In 1974, the OLA increased its activities in the Chercher Mountains, prompting the Ethiopian regime to send its military to the region to quell the insurrection.&lt;ref name="gadaa2" /&gt;

In June 1974, General [[Tadesse Birru]], an Oromo nationalist who had been arrested by the imperial regime in 1966 along with other high ranking military officers, escaped from house arrest and joined Oromo rebels led by [[Hailu Regassa]] in [[Shewa]]. Birru and Regassa were later captured and executed by the [[Derg|Derg regime]].&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975ADDIS03052_b.html|title=ARREST OF OROMO INSURGENT LEADERS|publisher=Wikileaks|date=1975-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1974, an OLA unit came down from their stronghold in the Chercher Mountains and made their way closer to [[Gelemso]], hoping that nearby fully grown crops would be able to hide them from Ethiopian soldiers as they advanced towards other nearby towns. Three of the unit's new recruits were unaccustomed to climbing long distances, so they spent the night around the bottom of the mountains, while the rest of the soldiers camped at the top.&lt;ref name="Bakako"&gt;{{Cite news|title = 2004 Interview with Dhugassa Bakako, survivor of the Battle of Tiro|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an OLA soldier was sent to retrieve the three recruits, it was discovered that they had been killed by Ethiopian militiamen who had followed the unit to [[Tiro, Ethiopia|Tiro]]. A large group of Ethiopian policemen and militiamen surrounded the OLA position in the mountains, and the two opposing groups began to exchange gunfire. A group of Ethiopian soldiers led by General Getachew Shibeshi later arrived, and began to shell the stronghold with mortar rockets, killing most of the OLA's members, including Elemo Qiltu. The event became known as the [[Battle of Tiro]].&lt;ref name="Bakako" /&gt; Contingents of the OLA continued to fight the regime after the battle and later gained a massive influx of recruits and volunteers after the Derg regime executed Tadesse Birru and Hailu Regassa.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;

In 1976, the OLF established a stronghold in the Chercher Mountains and began reorganizing itself.&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gadaa2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AW1991"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evil Days: 30 Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia|publisher=Africa Watch|year=1991|isbn=1-56432-038-3|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[congress]] was created by Oromo leaders, which revised the 1973 ''OLF Political Program'' and issued a new detailed program. The program called for the "total liberation of the Oromo nation from Ethiopian colonialism". The conference is now known as the Founding Congress, and marked the beginning of modern Oromo nationalism.&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt;

=== 1980–1990 ===
In the 1980s, the OLF estimated that they had over 10,000 soldiers. They were poorly equipped in comparison to other rebel groups in Ethiopia at the time, such as the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) and the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF).&lt;ref name="AW1991" /&gt; The OLF also opened an office in [[Sudan]] in the 1980s, after its office in [[Somalia]] was closed down.&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt;

During the 1980s, the government of Ethiopia was accused of using [[scorched earth]] tactics, such as burning down entire villages and massacring inhabitants. The OLF also lost several prominent members due to government ambushes and heavy fire; the secretary general of the OLF at the time,
[[Galassa Dilbo]], was nearly killed in one such ambush.&lt;ref name="AW1991" /&gt;

=== 1990–2000 ===
In the early 1990s, the Derg regime began to lose its control over Ethiopia. The OLF failed to maintain strong alliances with the other two big rebel groups at the time; the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) and the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF).&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AW1991" /&gt; In 1990, the TPLF created an umbrella organization for several rebel groups in Ethiopia, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). The EPRDF's Oromo subordinate, the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) was seen as an attempted replacement for the OLF.&lt;ref name="Chairman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/5120964_interview-with-chairman-of-the-oromo-liberation-front-.html|title=Interview with Chairman of the Oromo Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the EPRDF seized power and established a [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia|transitional government]]. The EPRDF and the OLF pledged to work together in the new government; however, they were largely unable to cooperate, as the OLF saw the OPDO as an EPRDF ploy to limit their influence.&lt;ref name="gadaa" /&gt; In 1992, the OLF announced that it was withdrawing from the transitional government because of "harassment and [the]assassinations of its members". In response, the EPRDF sent soldiers to destroy OLA camps.&lt;ref name="Chairman" /&gt; Despite initial victories against the EPRDF, the OLF were eventually overwhelmed by the EPRDF's superior numbers and weaponry, forcing OLA soldiers to use [[guerrilla warfare]] instead of traditional tactics.&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38871c.html|title=Chronology for Oromo in Ethiopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, most of the OLF's leaders had escaped Ethiopia, and the land originally administer by the OLF had been seized by the Ethiopian government, now led by the EPRDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oromo.org/enocide-against-the-oromo-people-of-thiopia.html|title=Genocide against the Oromo people of Ethiopia?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000–2018 ===
[[File:002 Oromo Liberation Front rebels.JPG|right|thumb|OLF forces retreat into Kenya, February 3, 2006]]
After the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]], the OLF moved its leadership and headquarters to [[Eritrea]]. The OLA allegedly began receiving military training and arms from the Eritrean government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oromoliberationfront.org/News/2011/OLF%20Statement%2004-06-2011.pdf|title=Statement of the OLF regarding new faction|publisher=OLF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2000, OLF and IFLO signed a peace agreement after five days of negotiations, thus ending 20 years of inter-factional fighting.

In 2006, the OLA in southern Oromia retreated into Kenya in an attempt to regroup. That same year, Brigadier General [[Kemel Gelchu]] of the Ethiopian military took 100 of his soldiers and joined the OLF in Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian commander joins rebels|date=10 August 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4779189.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initially aiding the OLF as leader of its military wing, in 2008, General Kemel Gelchu took matters into his own hands and announced that the OLF would lay down its weapons and abandon its previous goal of seceding Oromia and instead work as a political party to democratize Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kemal Gelchu's faction of OLF clarifies position on Ethiopian Unity|date=January 2, 2012|url=http://www.ethiopianreview.us/35655|publisher=Ethiopian Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this announcement, he commanded OLF soldiers in south Oromia to lay down their weapons and surrender to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As separatists in Ethiopia disarm, a new chapter for D.C.'s Oromo community|date=April 1, 2012|publisher=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/as-separatists-in-ethiopia-disarm-a-new-chapter-for-dcs-oromo-community/2012/04/01/gIQArnUtpS_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2015, various media outlets reported that the OLF had attacked a federal police station in the Ethiopian side of [[Moyale, Oromia (woreda)|Moyale]] town killing 12 Ethiopian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OMN/SBO - Gootichi WBO Zoonii Kibbaa Mooraa Waraana Wayyaanee Magaalaa Moyyaalee Haleeluun 17 Ol Hojiin Ala Gochuun Injifannoo Galmeesse|url = http://finfinnetribune.com/Gadaa/2015/05/oduu-amma-nu-gahe-gootichi-wbo-zoonii-kibbaa-mooraa-waraana-wayyaanee-magaalaa-moyyaalee-haleeluun-17-ol-hojiin-ala-gochuun-injifannoo-galmeesse/|accessdate = 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OMN: Amharic News May 30, 2015|url = https://www.oromiamedia.org/2015/05/omn-amharic-news-may-302015/|accessdate = 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred weeks after Ethiopian forces swarmed across the Kenyan border and began absuing locals of Sololo town looking for OLF troops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4815">'''''Penny toys''''' is a name used for inexpensive [[tin toy]]s mostly manufactured in Germany between the 1880s and 1914 that were sold in the UK, Europe and America in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Description==
Penny toys, also known as [[tin toys]], were made of tin metal with painted surfaces that typically included excellent detail. Most penny toys were manufactured in Germany and were originally sold to [[wholesaler]]s by the [[Gross (unit)|gross]] for 8 [[shillings]] allowing the seller, often street [[peddler]]s to sell them for a substantial profit.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Allan, ''A Century of Toys from the London Toy &amp; Model Museum'' Michael Edgley, 1982, p. 17 {{ISBN|0949616001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically the toys were miniatures, that is; under 10&amp;nbsp;cm and often included elements that facilitated movement, adding to their charm.&lt;ref&gt;Pressland, David, ''Book of Penny Toys,'' Pei International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the toys were sold for one [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|Penny]], hence the popular name of ''penny toys.''

The advent of penny toys broadened the market for children's toys, by making them accessible and affordable for working-class families.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood,'' Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Although penny toys were manufactured into the first decades of the 20th century, the period 1885 -1914 is the peak period for their production. Today, penny toys are highly collectible.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, R., ''The Collector's Encyclopedia of Metal Toys: A Pictorial Guide to Over 2,500 Examples of Tinplate and Diecast Toys Dating from 1850 to the Present Day,'' Crescent Books, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly accessible examples can be found in museums in England, North America, Scandinavia and across Europe; including [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum|Birmingham Science Museum]] in England, [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in Canada, Plassenburg Zinnfiguren Museum in Germany and Museo des Soldados de Iberica in Valencia, Spain.

===Types===
Individual toys were manufactured for specific markets. Examples include; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America.&lt;ref&gt;Pressland, David, ''Book of Penny Toys,'' Pei International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Types of penny toys included toy [[doll]]s, whistles, [[toy trains|trains]], [[Model car|motorcoars]], public transport and emergency vehicles, trucks, [[toy soldiers|soldiers]], animals and even a small Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, Gale &amp; Stroud, Jean ''Honest Penny'' Pelham Books 1970, pp.120-127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
Offset color [[lithography]] enabled fine detail and color to be applied to sheets of [[tin plate]] quickly and economically. Shapes were machine-cut and stamped and then assembled by unskilled workers, sometimes in [[cottage industries]].&lt;ref&gt;Solis-Cohen, Lita ''These Little Toys are Penny Toys No Longer'' ''The Baltimore Sun'' August 02, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were manufactured by the Johann Philip Meier company of [[Nurenberg]].

== Life ==
Between 1987-1995 Karl studied ''Prehistory and Early History'', and a combination of subjects on Celtic at the [[University of Vienna]]. He attended additional courses in [[Egyptology]], [[Ethnology]], [[Classical Archaeology]], [[Ancient history]], [[numismatics]] and [[linguistics]]. This study was followed by a doctorate in prehistory and early history, in which he graduated in 2003. His [[habilitation]] process took place in 2005-2006, his habilitation thesis appeared in 2006 under the title ''Altkeltisch ("Old Celtic") Social Structures''. With over one hundred professional publications, including many large and basic ones, he is one of the best known of the prehistorians from Austria and Central and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karl|first=Raimund|title=Homepage of Karl, Raimund|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/raimund.karl/|publisher=University of Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001 he worked as an AHRB (now: AHRC) Research Fellow at the ''University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies'', where he was on the ''Project 5 - Celtic identity'' project, among others, creating an ''Atlas for Celtic Studies'' and cooperated on the Encyclopedia ''Celtic Culture - A Historical Encyclopedia''. He also taught in 2002 at the Centre for Continuing Education of the ''[[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]'' Archaeology. From January 2003 he joined Aberystwyth as Lecturer in Archaeology and Heritage at the University of Wales, Bangor.&lt;ref name=disco&gt;{{cite web|last=Karl|first=Raimund|title=Discovering the archaeologists of Europe|url=http://www.discovering-archaeologists.eu/national_reports/DISCO_national_Austria_English.final.pdf|publisher=Internationales Österreichisches Archäologie Forum|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he became its [[Senior Lecturer]], 2008 promoted to Professor of Archaeology and Heritage.&lt;ref name=disco/&gt; Since 2007 he is also Head of School of
History, Welsh History and Archaeology at Bangor University.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=disco/&gt;

Since 2004 he is a member of the Institute of Field Archaeologists and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of [[Scotland]]. In 2005 he became a member of the Board of [[Celtic Studies]], where he remained until its dissolution in 2007. Since 2007 he is the representative for prehistoric archeology in the successor organization of the Board of Celtic Studies, the "Publications and Collaborative Research Committee" of the ''Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies''. Also in 2007 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SALON - the Society of Antiquaries of London Online Newsletter|url=http://www.sal.org.uk/salon/index_html?id=761|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of London|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rosette''' {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|ˈ|z|ɛ|t}} is a small, circular device that is typically presented with a [[medal]]. The rosettes are either worn on the medal to denote a higher rank, or for situations where wearing the medal is deemed inappropriate, such as on a [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]. Rosettes are issued in nations such as [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. Rosettes are also sometimes called '''bowknots''', due to their shape.  Moreover, a large rosette is sometimes pinned onto the [[ribbon]] which suspends a medal, typically the [[Officer]] (and sometimes [[Grand Officer]])'s [[badge]] of certain [[orders of chivalry]].

Some small [[lapel]] rosettes are worn in the same manner as lapel pins. For instance, [[knight]]s of the [[Order of the British Empire]] now wear a lapel rosette bearing the order's cross in the center, whereas previously this was a purely metallic lapel pin. While a metal lapel pin mounted on a [[silk]] rosette is considered a decoration of distinction, this is not always true of a metal emblem lacking the ribbon backing.

== United States ==
[[File:Moh rosette.gif|thumb|right|30px|[[Medal of Honor]] rosette]]
In the United States, the [[Medal of Honor]] is issued with a 1/2 inch light blue rosette with white stars, authorized for civilian wear as a lapel button.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Medal of Honor site, History of the Medal of Honor, May 2, 1896 ("20 Stat. 473")&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, the [[Purple Heart]] was also presented with a purple and white rosette, but now has been replaced by a metallic [[lapel pin]]. The lapel pin is designed to be a smaller version of the rectangular [[service ribbon]], also for use on civilian wear. Most American military medals have the ribbon bar design scaled down to the size of a lapel pin.  Members of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] wear small, blue-and-buff rosettes as lapel buttons.  The colors match those of the uniform of Gen. [[George Washington]] and the [[Continental Army]].

== Belgium ==
A rosette adorns the ribbon of all national [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]] (namely the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]], the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]], the [[Order of Leopold II]], and the dormant [[Order of the African Star]] and [[Royal Order of the Lion]]) at the rank of Officer. Such rosette may also be worn in diminutive form on appropriate civilian dress. Ranks above that of Officer (Commander, Grand Officer and Grand Cross) may wear a rosette adorned with gold and/or silver bars (or "half-knots") on each side of the rosette on appropriate civilian dress. Such rosette also adorns ribbon bars worn on the semi-formal dress uniform.

== France ==
[[File:Legion of honor rosette.png|thumb|right|30px|[[Légion d'honneur]] rosette]]
Several of the top decorations of France, including the [[Légion d'honneur]] and the [[Ordre national du Mérite]], are presented with a rosette along with the medal. The Legion of Honor authorized a rosette for those who are the rank of officer or above. If the grade is higher, the rosette is adorned with gold and/or silver bars (or "half-knots") which are place beside each side of the rosette. The same manner is accorded to the Order of National Merit.  In occasions when ribbon bars are worn alone, the above-mentioned half-knots and/or rosettes are pinned onto the ribbon bars as appropriate to denote the wearer's grade.

== United Kingdom ==
[[File:Rosette Silver 200px.png|thumb|right|30px|Silver rosette]]
In the United Kingdom, small silver rosettes can be added to the ribbons that are worn in place of medals.  Usually these indicate multiple award bars, the number of times a decoration for merit or distinguished service has been awarded.  (Exceptions are the [[George Cross]] and [[Victoria Cross]], where the ribbons are issued only with miniatures of the medals attached.)  Holders of the [[1914 Star]], the [[1939-45 Star]], the [[Atlantic Star]], the [[Pacific Star]], the [[Burma Star]], the [[South Atlantic Medal]] (awarded for service in the [[Falklands War]]), the Gulf War Medal 1991 and the Sierra Leone medal could also receive these rosettes if they met certain criteria for combat service.

== Lineage societies ==
Several American-based [[family history society|lineage societies]] provide a rosette as an insignia of membership for informal wear.

It may also refer to ''[[Northern Catalonia]]'' ({{italics correction|{{lang-ca|Catalunya Nord|links=no}}}}) or ''[[French Catalonia]]'', the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it.

==History==
Its name is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day [[Perpignan]] where Gaulish chieftains met to consider [[Hannibal]]'s request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of [[Septimania]] to the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] [[Theodoric II]]. His successor, [[Amalaric]], on his defeat by [[Clovis I]] in 531, retired to [[Hispania]], leaving a governor in [[Septimania]].

In 719, the [[Saracens]] crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by [[Pepin the Short]], who went on to occupy Roussillon after [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|conquering Narbonne]]. Roussillon was occupied by the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]] in 760. On the invasion of Hispania in 778, [[Charlemagne]] found the [[Marca Hispanica]] wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Hispania]] and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count [[William of Gellone|Guillaume]] of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]] - regent of the child [[Louis the Pious]], King of [[Kingdom of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] - whose hegemony extended into [[History of Catalonia|Catalonia]].

The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into [[Allod|allodial fiefs]] and, in 893, [[Sunyer II]] became the first hereditary [[Count]] of [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]]. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the [[Cerdanya]] (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by [[Miro the Elder|Miró]] as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or [[Besalú]]. The Counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the Counts of [[County of Empúries|Empúries]] in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count [[Girard I]] participated in the [[First Crusade]] in the following of [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond IV]] of [[Count of Toulouse|Toulouse]], and was one of the first to set foot in [[Jerusalem]] when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the [[County of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]] began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them.

In 1111, [[Ramon Berenguer III]], Count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besalú, to which was added in 1117 [[Cerdanya]]. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, [[Girard II of Roussillon|Girard II]], was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], who took possession in 1172. Under the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese monarchs]], economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and [[Collioure]] ({{lang-ca|Cotlliure}}), the port of [[Perpignan]], became an important locus of [[Mediterranean]] trade.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

As the French and Spanish crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], [[Louis IX of France]] formally surrendered sovereignty over Roussillon and his claim to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[James I of Aragon]] had wrested the [[Balearic Isles]] from the [[Moors]] and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became [[James II of Majorca|James II]]. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] were exploited by [[Philip III of France]] in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the [[Two Sicilies]]. Philip III espoused James II's cause and led an army into Aragon but, retreating, died at [[Perpignan]] in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son Sanç I, or [[Sancho I of Majorca|Sancho I]], who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, [[James III of Majorca]], refused to do homage to [[Philip VI of France]] for the seigneury of [[Montpellier]], and applied to [[Peter IV of Aragon]] for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized [[Majorca]] and Roussillon in 1344.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The province was now reunited to the [[Crown of Aragon]], and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between [[John II of Aragon]] and [[Charles, Prince of Viana|his son]] over the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Crown of Navarre]] spurred [[Louis XI of France]] to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] evacuated the region as part of a settlement with the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ([[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I]] of the [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]], they were second-cousins, creators of the [[House of Trastámara|Trastamara]] dynasty that ruled over the two Crowns).

During a subsequent war between France and the Trastamara dynasty (1496–1498), the people suffered equally from the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] garrisons and the French invaders.

The [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs.

The dislike caused by the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilians]] during the Trastamara rule was effaced in the pride of sharing the glory of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. When [[Perpignan]] was [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|besieged]] by the forces of [[Henry II of France|Henry]], [[Dauphin of France]] in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of "Fedelissima" ("Most Faithful City").

When the [[Catalans]] rose against the Spanish Crown in 1641, [[Louis XIII of France]] entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) secured [[Languedoc-Roussillon|Roussillon]] and part of the [[Cerdanya]] (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon.

The next fifty years saw a concerted effort by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity.''' '''He was''' '''successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of [[Perpignan]], [[Catalan language|Roussillon]] remained distinctly [[Catalonia|Catalan]] in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien Régime]] province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the [[comarca]] of [[Fenouillèdes]]. [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French ''[[regions of France|région]]'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]].

'''Secondary antisemitism''' is a distinct kind of [[antisemitism]] which is said to have appeared after the end of [[World War II]].

As Zvi Rix he published an essay "The Great Terror" in the first issue (April 1975) of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s [[Kronos: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Synthesis]]. Cf.

An alternate explanation was proposed for the [[Anti-Jewish violence in Central and Eastern Europe, 1944–46|spate of postwar anti-Semitic violence in Eastern Europe]]. In 1946, the Slovak writer Karel František Koch argued that the anti-semitic incidents that he witnessed in [[Bratislava]] after the war were "not antisemitism, but something far worse—the robber’s anxiety that he might have to return Jewish property," a view that has been endorsed by Czech-Slovak scholar {{ill|Robert Pynsent|cs}}.{{sfn|Pynsent|2013|p=330}} It has been estimated that only 15% of Jewish property was returned after the war, and restitution was "negligible" in Eastern Europe. Property not returned has been valued at over $100 million in 2005 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Restitution of Holocaust-Era Assets: Promises and Reality|publisher= [[Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs]] |url=http://jcpa.org/article/restitution-of-holocaust-era-assets-promises-and-reality/ |website=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno, in a 1959 lecture titled "Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit" (published in his 1963 book ''Eingriffe. Neun kritische Modelle.''&lt;ref name="Adorno"&gt;{{cite book

According to Adorno's critique, an opinion had been readily accepted in Germany according to which the Jewish people were culpable in the crimes against them. [[Jewish guilt]] was assumed to varying extents, depending on the varying incarnations of that antisemitic notion, one of which is the idea that Jews were (and are) exploiting German guilt over the Holocaust.

{{quote|Sometimes the victors are declared to be the cause of what the defeated have done when they were still in charge, and for the crimes of Hitler those are declared guilty who acquiesced his rise to power, and not those who hailed him. The idiocy in all this is in fact an indication of something mentally uncoped-with, of a wound, although the thought of wounds should be dedicated to the victims.&lt;ref name="Adorno"/&gt;}}

Initially, members of the Frankfurt School spoke of "guilt-defensiveness anti-Semitism", an antisemitism motivated by a deflection of guilt.&lt;ref name="Markovits"&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrei S. Markovits

The rehabilitation of many lower and even several higher-ranking [[Third Reich]] officials and officers appears to have contributed to the development of secondary antisemitism. These officials were rehabilitated in spite of their considerable individual contributions to [[Nazi Germany]]'s crimes. Several controversies ensued early in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-World War II Germany]], e.g., when [[Konrad Adenauer]] appointed [[Hans Globke]] as [[German Chancellery|Chief of the Chancellery]] although the latter had formulated the emergency legislation that gave Hitler unlimited dictatorial powers and had been one of the leading legal commentators on the [[Nuremberg race laws]] of 1935.{{sfn|Wistrich|2001|pp=74-75}}{{sfn|Pendas|2005|p=18}} However, according to Adorno, parts of the German public never acknowledged these events and instead formed the notion of Jewish guilt in the Holocaust.

{{The Holocaust sidebar}}
'''''Sh'erit ha-Pletah''''' ({{lang-he|שארית הפליטה|lit=the surviving remnant}}) is a biblical ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 9:14 and [[1 Chronicles]] 4:43) term used by [[Jewish refugees]] who survived [[the Holocaust]] to refer to themselves and the communities they formed in postwar Europe following the liberation in the spring of 1945.

Hundreds of thousands of survivors spent several years following their repatriation in [[Displaced Persons camp|Displaced Persons (DP) camps]] in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Italy]]. The refugees became socially and politically organized, advocating at first for their political and human rights in the camps, and then for the right to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], most of which became the Jewish [[State of Israel]] where the majority ended up living by 1950.

==Formation of the DP camps==
[[File:DP class at Schauenstein camp.jpg|thumb|left|300px|School children at Schauenstein DP camp in 1946]]
In an effort to destroy the evidence of war crimes, [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities and military staff accelerated the pace of killings, forced victims on [[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]], and attempted to deport many of them away from the rapidly shrinking German lines. As the German war effort [[end of World War II in Europe|collapsed]], survivors were typically left on their own, on trains, by the sides of roads, and in [[Nazi extermination camp|camps]]. Concentration camps and death camps were liberated by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces in the final stages of the war, beginning with [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]], in July 1944, and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], in January 1945; [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], and other camps were liberated in April and May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. "[http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007724 Liberation]." ''Holocaust Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 8 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Germany's unconditional surrender on 7 May 1945 there were some 6.5 to 7 million displaced persons in the Allied occupation zones,&lt;ref&gt;Königseder, Angelika, and Juliane Wetzel. ''Waiting for Hope: Jewish Displaced Persons in Post-World War II Germany''. Trans. John A. Broadwin. Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2001. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; among them an estimated 55,000 &lt;ref&gt;Berger, Joseph. "Displaced Persons." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd Ed. Vol. 5. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 684-686; here: 684. Berger cites historian Jehuda Bauer as estimating that 200,000 Jews in total emerged alive from the concentration camps.&lt;/ref&gt; to 60,000&lt;ref&gt;Pinson, Koppel S. "Jewish Life in Liberated Germany: A Study of the Jewish DP's." ''Jewish Social Studies'' 9.2 (April 1947): 101-126; here: 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews. The vast majority of non-Jewish DPs were repatriated in a matter of months.&lt;ref&gt;According to Königseder and Wetzel (p. 15), in September 1945 there were a total of approximately one million DPs remaining, who, for various reasons, such as political differences with the new regime in their homeland, or fear of persecution, were considered to be "non-repatriable."&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Jewish DPs, however, subsequently grew many fold as Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe migrated westward. It is estimated that a total of more than 250,000 Jewish DPs resided in camps or communities in Germany, Austria, and Italy during the period from 1945 to 1952.&lt;ref name="USHMM-DPs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005462 |title=Displaced Persons |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first weeks after liberation, Allied military forces improvised relief in the form of shelter, food, and medical care. A large number of refugees were in critical condition as a result of [[malnutrition]], abuse, and disease. Many died, but medical material was requisitioned from military stores and German civilian facilities. Military doctors as well as physicians among the survivors themselves used available resources to help a large number recover their physical health. The first proper [[Jewish bereavement|funerals]] of Holocaust victims took place during this period with the assistance of Allied forces and military clergy.

Shelter was also improvised in the beginning, with refugees of various origins being housed in abandoned barracks, hotels, former concentration camps, and private homes.

As Germany and Austria came under [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied military administration]], the commanders assumed responsibility for the safety and disposition of all displaced persons. The Allies provided for the DPs according to nationality, and initially did not recognize Jews as constituting a separate group. One significant consequence of this early perspective was that Jewish DPs sometimes found themselves housed in the same quarters with former Nazi collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mankowitz, Zeev W. ''Life between Memory and Hope: The Survivors of the Holocaust in Occupied Germany. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the general policy of the Allied occupation forces was to repatriate DPs to their country of origin as soon as possible, and there was not necessarily sufficient consideration for exceptions; repatriation policy varied from place to place, but Jewish DPs, for whom repatriation was problematic, were apt to find themselves under pressure to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Mankowitz, 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George S. Patton|General George Patton]], the commander of the United States Third Army and military governor of Bavaria, where most of the Jewish DPs resided, was known for pursuing a harsh, indiscriminate repatriation policy.&lt;ref&gt;Mankowitz, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Michael. After the Holocaust: Rebuilding Jewish Lives in Postwar Germany. Trans. Barbara Harshav. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his approach raised objections from the refugees themselves, as well as from American military and civilian parties sympathetic to their plight. In early July 1945, Patton issued a directive that the entire Munich area was to be cleared of displaced persons with an eye toward repatriating them. [[Joseph Dunner]], an American officer who in civilian life was a professor of political science, sent a memorandum to military authorities protesting the order. When 90 trucks of the Third Army arrived at [[Buchberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Buchberg]] to transport the refugees there, they refused to move, citing Dunner's memo. Based on these efforts and blatant antisemitic remarks, Patton was relieved of this command.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Harrison report==
{{main|Harrison Report}}
By June 1945 reports had circulated back in the United States concerning overcrowded conditions and insufficient supplies in the DP camps, as well as the ill treatment of Jewish survivors at the hand of the U.S. Army. American Jewish leaders, in particular, felt compelled to act.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mankowitz, 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Earl G. Harrison]] was sent by president Truman to investigate conditions among the "non-repatriables" in the DP camps. Arriving in Germany in July, he spent several weeks visiting the camps and submitted his final report on 24 August. Harrison's report stated among other things that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Generally speaking... many Jewish displaced persons and other possibly non-repatriables are living under guard behind barbed-wire fences, in camps of several descriptions (built by the Germans for slave-laborers and Jews), including some of the most notorious of the concentration camps, amidst crowded, frequently unsanitary and generally grim conditions, in complete idleness, with no opportunity, except surreptitiously, to communicate with the outside world, waiting, hoping for some word of encouragement and action in their behalf....
:...While there has been marked improvement in the health of survivors of the Nazi starvation and persecution program, there are many pathetic malnutrition cases both among the hospitalized and in the general population of the camps... at many of the camps and centers including those where serious starvation cases are, there is a marked and serious lack of needed medical supplies...
:...many of the Jewish displaced persons, late in July, had no clothing other than their concentration camp garb-a rather hideous striped pajama effect-while others, to their chagrin, were obliged to wear German S.S. uniforms. It is questionable which clothing they hate the more...
:...Most of the very little which has been done [to reunite families] has been informal action by the displaced persons themselves with the aid of devoted Army Chaplains, frequently Rabbis, and the American Joint Distribution Committee...
:...The first and plainest need of these people is a recognition of their actual status and by this I mean their status as Jews... While admittedly it is not normally desirable to set aside particular racial or religious groups from their nationality categories, the plain truth is that this was done for so long by the Nazis that a group has been created which has special needs...
:...Their desire to leave Germany is an urgent one.... They want to be evacuated to Palestine now, just as other national groups are being repatriated to their homes... Palestine, while clearly the choice of most, is not the only named place of possible emigration. Some, but the number is not large, wish to emigrate to the United States where they have relatives, others to England, the British Dominions, or to South America...
:...No other single matter is, therefore, so important from the viewpoint of Jews in Germany and Austria and those elsewhere who have known the horrors of the concentration camps as is the disposition of the Palestine question...
:...As matters now stand, we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazis treated them except that we do not exterminate them. They are in concentration camps in large numbers under our military guard instead of S.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/exhibition/displaced-persons/resourc1.htm ''Report of Earl G. Harrison'']. As cited in United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "Resources," [http://www.ushmm.org/exhibition/displaced-persons/menu.htm ''Life Reborn: Jewish Displaced Persons, 1945-1951''] [online exhibition]. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harrison's report was met with consternation in Washington, and its contrast with Patton's position ultimately contributed to Patton being relieved of his command in Germany in September 1945.

==Growth of the camps==
The number of refugees in the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' continued to grow as displaced Jews who were in Western Europe at war's end were joined by hundreds of thousands of refugees from Eastern Europe. Many of these were Polish Jews who had initially been repatriated. Nearly 90% of the approximately 200,000 Polish Jews who had survived the war in the Soviet Union chose to return to Poland under a Soviet-Polish repatriation agreement.&lt;ref name="Königseder-Wetzel45"&gt;Königseder, Angelika, and Juliane Wetzel. ''Waiting for Hope: Jewish Displaced Persons in Post-World War II Germany''. Trans. John A. Broadwin. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; But Jews returning to their erstwhile homes in Poland met with a generally hostile reception from their non-Jewish neighbors. Between fall 1944 and summer 1946 as many as 600 Jews were killed in [[anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–46|anti-Jewish riots]] in various towns and cities,&lt;ref&gt;Engel, David. "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Poland/Poland_since_1939 Poland since 1939]." ''The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 9 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; including incidents in [[Cracow]], around August 20, 1945;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jta.org/1945/08/21/archive/serious-anti-jewish-disturiances-in-cracow-local-council-blames-reactionary-poles Serious Anti-Jewish Disturbances in Cracow; Local Council Blames Reactionary Poles]." ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', 21 August 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sosnowiec]], on October 25; and [[Lublin]], on November 19. Most notable was the [[Kielce pogrom|pogrom in Kielce]] on July 4, 1946, in which 42 Jews were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of 1946 the flight of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe toward the West amounted to a mass exodus that swelled the ranks of DPs in Germany and Austria, especially in the U.S. Zone.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hundreds of DP camps were in operation between 1945 and 1948, the refugees were mostly segregated, with several camps being dedicated to Jews. These camps varied in terms of the conditions afforded to the refugees, how they were managed, and the composition of their population.

In the American sector, the Jewish community across many camps organized itself rapidly for purposes of representation and advocacy. In the British sector, most refugees were concentrated in the [[Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp]] and were under tighter control.

==Humanitarian services in the DP camps==

The Allies had begun to prepare for the humanitarian aftermath of the war while it was still going on, with the founding of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)]], on 9 November 1943. However, the beginnings of the agency were plagued by organizational problems and corruption.&lt;ref name=ShephardCh8&gt;Shephard, Ben. ''The Long Road Home: The Aftermath of the Second World War''. New York: Knopf, 2011. 138-164.&lt;/ref&gt; The military authorities were, in any case, reluctant to yield significant responsibility for the DP assembly centers to a civilian organization, until it became clear that there would be a need to house and care for the DPs for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=ShephardCh8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point when it was supposed to begin its work the UNRRA was woefully understaffed in view of the larger than expected numbers of DPs, and additional staff that were hastily recruited were poorly trained.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency began to send staff into the field in summer 1945; its mission had been conceived mainly as a support to the repatriation process, including providing medical services, and assuring the delivery of adequate nutrition, as well as attending to the DPs' needs for comfort and entertainment; however, it often fell short of fulfilling these functions.&lt;ref&gt;Shephard, 140, 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 15 November 1945, the UNRRA officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the camps, while remaining generally subordinate to the military, which continued to provide for housing and security in the camps, as well as the delivery of food, clothing, and medical supplies. Over time the UNRRA supplemented the latter basic services with health and welfare services, recreational facilities, self-help programs, and vocational guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time that the UNRRA took the reins of administration of the camps, the Jewish DPs had already begun to elect their own representatives, and were vocal about their desire for self-governance. However, since camp committees did not yet have any officially sanctioned role, their degree of power and influence depended at first on the stance of the particular UNRRA director at the given camp.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNRRA was active mainly through the end of 1946 and had wound down its operations by mid 1947. In late 1947 a new successor organization, the [[International Refugee Organization|International Refugee Organization (IRO)]] absorbed some of the UNRRA staff and assumed its responsibilities, but with a focus turned toward resettlement, as well as care of the most vulnerable DPs, rather than repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Königseder and Wetzel, 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other organizations played an active role in the emerging Jewish community in the DP camps. The [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] ("Joint") provided financial support and supplies from American sources; in the British sector, the [[Jewish Relief Unit]] acted as the British equivalent to the Joint; and the [[World ORT|ORT]] established numerous vocational and other training.

==From representation to autonomy==
The refugees who found themselves in provisional, sparse quarters under military guard soon spoke up against the ironic nature of their liberation, invoking an oft-repeated slogan "From [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] to [[Feldafing]]."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Working committees were established in each camp, and on July 1, 1945 the committees met for a founding session of a federation for Jewish DP camp committees in Feldafing. The session also included representatives of the [[Jewish Brigade]] and the Allied military administration. It resulted in the formation of a provisional council and an executive committee chaired by [[Zalman Grinberg]]. Patton's attempt at repatriating Jewish refugees had resulted in a resolve within the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' to define their own destiny. Bolstered by the support from Harrison and Patton's frustrated attempts at forcing a solution upon them, the various camp committees convened a conference for the entire ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' on July 25 at the [[St. Ottilien]] camp. The delegates passed a fourteen-point program that established a broad mandate, including the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine with UN recognition, compensation to victims, participation in the trials against Nazi war criminals, archival of historical records, and full autonomy for the committees.

As it turned out, the American and British sectors developed independent organization structures.

The center for the British sector in Germany was at the [[Bergen-Belsen DP camp]], where [[Josef Rosensaft]] had been the primus motor for establishing what became the [[Central Committee for Displaced Persons in the British zone]]. In the American sector, [[Zalman Grinberg]] and [[Samuel Gringauz]] and others led the formation of the [[Central Committee of the Liberated Jews]], which was to establish offices first in the former [[Deutsches Museum]] and then in [[Siebertstrasse 3]] in [[Munich]].

The central organizations for Jewish refugees had an overwhelming number of issues to resolve, among them:
*Ensuring healthy and dignified living conditions for the refugees living in various camps and installations
*Establishing political legitimacy for themselves by establishing a constitution with a political process with debates, elections, etc.
*Facilitating and encouraging religious, educational, and cultural expression within the camps
*Arranging for employment for the refugees, though not in enterprises that would contribute to the German economy
*Supporting the absorption in the camp infrastructure of "new" refugees arriving from Eastern Europe
*Resolving acrimonious and sometimes violent disputes between the camps and German police
*Managing the public image of displaced persons, particularly with respect to [[black market]] activities
*Advocating immigration destinations for the refugees, in particular to the British Mandate in Palestine, but also the United States, Australia, and elsewhere

Military authorities were at first reluctant to officially recognize the central committees as the official representatives of the Jewish refugees in DP camps, though cooperation and negotiations carried characteristics of a de facto acceptance of their mandate. But on September 7, 1946, at a meeting in [[Frankfurt]], the American military authorities recognized the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews as a legitimate party to the issue of the Jewish displaced persons in the American sector.

==Political activism==
What the people of the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' had in common was what had made them victims in the first place, but other than that they were a diverse group. Their outlook, needs, and aspirations varied tremendously. There were strictly observant Jews as well as individuals that had earlier been assimilated into secular culture. Religious convictions ran from the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] group to [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionists]] and even ideological [[communism|communists]]. Although [[Yiddish]] was the common language within the community, individuals came from virtually every corner of Europe.

There was lively political debate, involving satire, political campaigns, and the occasional acrimony. The growth of Yiddish newspapers within the camps added fuel to the political culture.

The political environment of the community evolved during its years of existence. In the first year or two, it was predominantly focused on improving the conditions in the camps and asserting the legitimacy of the community as an autonomous entity. Over time, the emphasis shifted to promoting the Zionist goals of allowing immigration into the British Mandate in Palestine; political divisions within the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' mirrored those found in the [[Yishuv]] itself.

At every turn, the community expressed its opposition and outrage against British restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. In the British sector, the protests approached a level of civil disobedience; in the American sector, attempts were made to apply political pressure to alleviate these restrictions. The relationship between ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' and British authorities remained tense until the [[State of Israel]] was formed. This came to a head when Lieutenant General Sir [[Frederick E. Morgan]] - then UNRRA chief of operations in Germany - claimed that the influx of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe as "nothing short of a skillful campaign of anti-British aggression on the part of Zion aided and abetted by Russia... &lt;nowiki&gt;[meaning]&lt;/nowiki&gt; death to the British." (Morgan was allowed to remain in his post after this comment but was fired when making similar comments later).

In late 1945, the UNRRA conducted several surveys among Jewish refugees, asking them to list their preferred destination for emigration. Among one population of 19,000, 18,700 named "Palestine" as their first choice, and 98% also named "Palestine" as their second choice. At the camp in [[Fürth]], respondents were asked not to list Palestine as both their first and second choice, and 25% of the respondents then wrote "crematorium".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

All the while, the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' retained close relationships with the political leadership of the Yishuv, prompting several visits from [[David Ben-Gurion]] and other Zionist leaders. While officially detached from the committees, there was considerable support for clandestine immigration to Palestine through the [[Aliya Beth]] programs among the refugees; and tacit support for these activities also among American, UNRRA, Joint and other organizations. A delegation (consisting of [[Norbert Wollheim]], [[Samuel Schlumowitz]], [[Boris Pliskin]], and [[Leon Retter]] flew to the United States to raise funds for the community, appealing to a sense of pride over "schools built for our children, four thousand pioneers on the farms... thousands of youths in trades schools... self-sacrifice of doctors, teachers, writers... democratization... hard-won autonomy,"{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and also met with officials at the US War Department and Sir [[Raphael Salento]] over the formation of the [[International Refugee Organization]].

Over time, the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' took on the characteristics of a state in its own right. It coordinated efforts with the political leadership in the Yishuv and the United States, forming a transient power triangle within the Jewish world. It sent its own delegation to the Twenty-Second [[Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]].

==A community dedicated to its own dissolution==
With the exception of 10,000–15,000 who chose to make their homes in Germany after the war (see [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]]), the vast majority of the Jewish DPs ultimately left the camps and settled elsewhere. About 136,000 settled in Israel, 80,000 in the United States, and sizeable numbers also in Canada and South Africa.&lt;ref name="USHMM-DPs"/&gt;

Although the community established many of the institutions that characterize a durable society, and indeed came to dominate an entire section of Munich, the overriding imperative was to find new homes for the refugees. To make the point, many of the leaders emigrated at the first possible opportunity. Both overt lobbying efforts and underground migration sought to open for unrestricted immigration to Palestine. And the camps largely emptied once the state of Israel was established, many of the refugees immediately joining the newly formed [[Israel Defense Forces]] to fight the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

The Central Committee in the American sector declared its dissolution on December 17, 1950 at the Deutsche Museum in Munich. Of the original group that founded the committee, only rabbi [[Samuel Snieg]] remained for the dissolution. All the others had already emigrated, most of them to Israel. Rabbi Snieg had remained to complete the first full edition of the [[Talmud]] published in Europe after the Holocaust, the so-called [[Survivors' Talmud]].

The last DP camp, [[Föhrenwald]], closed in February 1957, by then populated only by the so-called "hardcore" cases, elderly, and those disabled by disease.

==Legacy==
While most Holocaust survivors view their time in the DP camps as a transitional state, the ''Sh'erit ha-Pletah'' became an organizing force for the repatriation of the remnant in general and to Israel in particular. Its experience highlighted the challenges of ethnic groups displaced in their entirety without recourse to their original homes. It also demonstrated the resolve and ingenuity of individuals who had lost everything but made a new life for themselves.

Some struggled with [[survivor guilt]] for decades. 

[[Suicide]] amongst survivors has been a subject of some disagreement amongst Israeli medical professionals. In 1947, Dr. [[Aharon Persikovitz]], a gynecologist who had survived the [[Dachau concentration camp]] gave a lecture called "The Psychological State Of the New Immigrant" in which he said: "Holocaust survivors do not commit suicide; they heroically prove the continuity of the Jewish people". According to Professor [[Yoram Barak]] this statement became "an accepted [[national myth]]". Barak says "The survivors themselves also did not want to be stigmatized as `sick, weak and broken;' rather, they wanted to join in the myth of the heroic [[Sabra (person)|sabra]] who just recently fought a glorious [[1948 Palestine war|War of Independence]] against the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Study: Holocaust Survivors 3 Times More Likely to Attempt Suicide| work = Haaretz| accessdate = 2018-04-16| date = 2005-08-10| url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4929773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3347">"'''Singleton'''" is a term for human beings who live in a single-person household, especially those who prefer the lifestyle of living alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/garden/the-freedom-and-perils-of-living-alone.html?pagewanted=all The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2012/02/size-matters-new-york-used-to-be-full-of-singletons-but-bigger-apartments-and-rising-prices-means-living-alone-is-harder-than-ever/ ''The New York Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by the ''[[Bridget Jones]]'' novels and films,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.theage.com.au/business/executivestyle/managementline/The%20Singleton%20Society.pdf The Age]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/04/netnotes.sheilapulham Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20145510,00.html ''People Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/debate/is-bridget-jones-still-relevant-in-2011 Stylist.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenpolitics/population/6762721/Bridget-Jones-singletons-threaten-housing-crisis-figures-suggest.html The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/72325/The-Hunger-Games-Jennifer-Lawrence-Wants-To-Play-Bridget-Jones Entertainmentwise.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1342928/Are-Lodder-Singletons-prepared-travel-average-23-miles-date.html The Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/03/going-solo-whats-the-appeal-of-living-alone.html PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; but is also a term used in sociology. 

==Patterns==
Sociologist Eric Klinenberg reports that before the 1950s, no society has had large numbers of people living alone. Historically, this has happened when elderly people outlive their spouses, and when men have migrated for work.  In modern times, large numbers of people have begun to live happily alone in cities and with the help of communication technologies like the [[telephone]], [[email]], and [[social networking service]]s. Klinenberg has found that the ability of women to work, own property, and initiate divorce creates more opportunities for living alone; in countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] where women do not have autonomy, relatively few  people live alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone |author=Eric Klinenberg  |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0143122777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Single people]] may live alone before their first romantic partner, after a divorce, or after their partner has died. When unmarried or married [[Couple (relationship)|couple]]s maintain separate residences as an alternative to [[cohabitation]], it may be a [[long distance relationship]], a temporary separation due to troubles in the relationship, or simply [[living apart together]].

Over the course of its existence the &lt;small&gt;SEHS&lt;/small&gt; has worked to retain and restore architectural integrity of the South End. The &lt;small&gt;SEHS&lt;/small&gt; supports research, conservation, and education to protect and promote interest in the local historic buildings, monuments, and public squares of the South End.

'''Louis "Studs" Terkel''' (May 16, 1912&amp;nbsp;– October 31, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Rick Kogan | title=Studs Terkel dies | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-studs-terkel-dead,0,2321576.story | work=The Chicago Tribune | date=31 October 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author, historian, actor, and broadcaster. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1985 for ''[[The Good War]]'', and is best remembered for his [[oral history|oral histories]] of common Americans, and for hosting a long-running radio show in Chicago.

==Early life==
Terkel was born to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] immigrants, Samuel Terkel, a tailor, and Anna (Annie) Finkel, a seamstress, in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=William Grimes | title=Studs Terkel, Listener to Americans, Dies at 96 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/books/01terkel.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | date=31 October 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eight he moved with his family to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he spent most of his life. He had two brothers, Ben (1907–1965) and Meyer (1905–1958). He attended [[McKinley High School (Chicago)|McKinley High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Studs Terkel |title=Studs Terkel's Chicago |location=New York |publisher=New Press |year=2012 |isbn=9781595587183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYs4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926 to 1936, his parents ran a [[rooming house]] that also served as a meeting place for people from all walks of life. Terkel credited his understanding of humanity and social interaction to the tenants and visitors who gathered in the lobby there, and the people who congregated in nearby [[Bughouse Square]]. In 1939, he married Ida Goldberg (1912–1999), and the couple had one son. Although he received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1934 (and was admitted to the Illinois Bar the following year), he decided instead of practicing law, he wanted to be a [[concierge]] at a hotel, and he soon joined a theater group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jane Ammeson | title=Storytelling with Studs Terkel | work=[[Chicago Life]] | url=http://chicagolife.net/content/interview/Storytelling_with_Studs_Terkel | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808212436/http://chicagolife.net/content/interview/Storytelling_with_Studs_Terkel | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A political [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], Terkel joined the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Writers' Project]], working in [[radio broadcasting|radio]], doing work that varied from voicing [[soap opera]] productions and announcing [[Broadcast journalism|news]] and [[sportscaster|sport]]s, to presenting shows of recorded [[music]] and writing radio scripts and advertisements. His well-known radio program, titled ''The Studs Terkel Program'', aired on 98.7 [[WFMT]] Chicago between 1952 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Sisson|author2=Christian K. Zacher |author3=Andrew Robert Lee Cayton |title=The American Midwest: an interpretive encyclopedia|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|pages=498}}&lt;br&gt;Previous Terkel radio work included WENR (1944 ''Wax Museum''), WCFL (beginning November 30, 1947). A TV show (''Stud's Place'', beginning November, 1949) lasted to 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The one-hour program was broadcast each weekday during those forty-five years. On this program, he interviewed guests as diverse as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Shepherd]], and [[Big Bill Broonzy]].

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Terkel was also the central character of ''Studs' Place'', an unscripted television drama about the owner of a [[greasy spoon|greasy-spoon]] diner in Chicago through which many famous people and interesting characters passed. This show, along with [[Marlin Perkins]]'s ''[[Zoo Parade]]'', ''[[Garroway at Large]]'' and the children's show ''[[Kukla, Fran, and Ollie]]'', are widely considered canonical examples of the [[Chicago School of Television]].

Terkel published his first book, ''[[Giants of Jazz (Terkel book)|Giants of Jazz]]'', in 1956. He followed it in 1967 with his first collection of [[oral history|oral histories]], ''Division Street America'' with 70 people talking about effect on the human spirit of living in an American metropolis.&lt;ref name="newpress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Division Street America by Studs Terkel|url=http://thenewpress.com/books/division-street|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aintlyon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Lyon |title=Chicago Voices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/26/specials/terkel-division.html|accessdate=September 27, 2016|work=Books|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chmrecordings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Studs Terkel, Recordings from Division Street|url=http://studsterkel.matrix.msu.edu/dstreet.php|website=Chicago History Museum|accessdate=September 27, 2016}} 23 original audio recordings as aired by Terkel&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a distinguished scholar-in-residence at the [[Chicago History Museum]]. He appeared in the film ''[[Eight Men Out]]'', based on the [[Black Sox Scandal]], in which he played newspaper reporter [[Hugh Fullerton]], who tries to uncover the White Sox players' plans to throw the [[1919 World Series]]. Terkel found it particularly amusing to play this role, as he was a big fan of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (as well as a vocal critic of major league baseball during the 1994 baseball strike), and gave a moving congratulatory speech to the White Sox organization after their [[2005 World Series]] championship during a television interview.

Terkel received his [[nickname]] while he was acting in a play with another person named Louis. To keep the two straight, the director of the production gave Terkel the nickname ''Studs'' after the fictional character about whom Terkel was reading at the time—[[Studs Lonigan]], of [[James T. Farrell]]'s trilogy.

Terkel was acclaimed for his efforts to preserve [[oral history|American oral history]]. His 1985 book ''[[The Good War|"The Good War": An Oral History of World War Two]]'', which detailed ordinary peoples' accounts of the country's involvement in World War II, won the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. For ''[[Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression]]'', Terkel assembled recollections of the [[Great Depression]] that spanned the socioeconomic spectrum, from [[Okie]]s, through prison inmates, to the wealthy. His 1974 book, ''[[Working (book)|Working]]'', in which (as reflected by its subtitle) ''People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do'', also was highly acclaimed. ''Working'' was made into a short-lived [[Working (musical)|Broadway show of the same title]] in 1978 and was telecast on [[PBS]] in 1982. In 1995, he received the [[Chicago History Museum]] "Making History Award" for Distinction in Journalism and Communications. In 1997, Terkel was elected a member of [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. Two years later, he received the [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Career Award]] in 1999.

==Later life==
[[File:Studs Terkel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Studs Terkel before his 95th birthday party at the Chicago History Museum]]

In 2004, Terkel received the [[Elijah P. Lovejoy|Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] Award as well as an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from [[Colby College]]. In August 2005, Terkel underwent successful [[open-heart surgery]]. At the age of ninety-three, he was one of the oldest people to undergo this form of surgery and doctors reported his recovery to be remarkable for someone of that advanced age. Terkel smoked two cigars a day until 2004.

On May 22, 2006, Terkel, along with other plaintiffs, including [[Quentin Young]], filed a suit in federal district court against [[AT&amp;T Inc.]], to stop the telecommunications carrier from giving customer telephone records to the [[National Security Agency]] without a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/25625prs20060522.html|title=Author Studs Terkel, Other Prominent Chicagoans Join in Challenge to AT&amp;T Sharing of Telephone Records with the National Security Agency|author=|date=|website=aclu.org|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Having been blacklisted from working in television during the [[Joe McCarthy|McCarthy]] era, I know the harm of government using private corporations to intrude into the lives of innocent Americans. When government uses the telephone companies to create massive databases of all our phone calls it has gone too far.}}

The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge [[Matthew F. Kennelly]] on July 26, 2006. Judge Kennelly cited a "[[state secrets privilege]]" designed to protect national security from being harmed by lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/25/173512.shtml |title=Judge Drops Studs Terkel NSA Lawsuit |publisher=NewsMax.com |date=July 25, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120132800/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/25/173512.shtml |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[The Guardian]]'' celebrating his 95th birthday, Terkel discussed his own "diverse and idiosyncratic taste in music, from [[Bob Dylan]] to [[Alexander Frey]], [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Woody Guthrie]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/23/history.usa |title=Let Me Tell You A Story |author=Gary Younge |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terkel published a new personal memoir entitled ''Touch and Go'' in fall 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2007-12-19-terkel_N.htm|title=Terkel records life in a 'Touch and Go' way |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=December 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terkel was a self-described [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2006 | title=This I Believe: The Personal Philosophies of Remarkable Men and Women | editor1=Jay Allison |editor2=Dan Gediman }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he jokingly defined as "a cowardly atheist" during a 2004 interview with [[Krista Tippett]] on [[American Public Media]]'s ''[[Speaking of Faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/studs-terkel-life-faith-and-death/180|title=Studs Terkel — Life, Faith, and Death -|author=|date=|website=onbeing.org|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his last interviews was for the documentary ''Soul of a People'' on [[Smithsonian Channel]]. He spoke about his participation in the [[Works Progress Administration]].

At his last public appearance, in 2007, Terkel said he was "still in touch—but ready to go".&lt;ref name="chicagotribuneobit"&gt;{{cite news | author=Rick Kogan | title=Studs Terkel dies | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=2008-10-31 | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-studs-terkel-dead,0,2321576.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave one of his last interviews on the [[BBC]] ''[[Hardtalk]]'' program on February 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/7226682.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Studs Terkel | date=February 4, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke of the imminent election of [[Barack Obama]] as President of the United States, and offered him some advice, in October 2008.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-lifson/studs-for-obama_b_137278.html|author=[[Edward Lifson]]|title=Studs for Obama|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terkel died in his Chicago home on Friday, October 31, 2008 at the age of ninety-six. He had been suffering ever since a fall in his home earlier that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikinews-inline|American prize-winning author Studs Terkel dead at 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Terkel and WFMT, the radio station which broadcast Terkel's long-running program, had donated approximately 7,000 tape recordings of Terkel's interviews and broadcasts to the [[Chicago History Museum]]. In 2010, the Museum and the Library of Congress announced a multi-year joint collaboration to digitally preserve and make available at both institutions these recordings, which the Library of Congress called, "a remarkably rich history of the ideas and perspectives of both common and influential people living in the second half of the 20th century." "For Studs, there was not a voice that should not be heard, a story that could not be told," said Gary T. Johnson, Museum president. "He believed that everyone had the right to be heard and had something important to say. He was there to listen, to chronicle, and to make sure their stories are remembered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-115.html|title=Library Collaborates With Chicago History Museum                         To Preserve Radio Icon Studs Terkel's Historic Recordings|author=|date=|website=loc.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 WFMT and the [[Chicago History Museum]] announced the creation of the website, Studsterkel.org (see studsterkel.wfmt.com), which will house the entire archive of Studs Terkel interviews.

'''Sugata Bose''' (born 7 September 1956) is an Indian historian and politician who has taught and worked in the United States since the mid-1980s. His fields of study are South Asian and Indian Ocean history. Bose taught at [[Tufts University]] until 2001, when he accepted the [[Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs|Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Lauren |title=Harvard hires Sugata Bose, Tufts' South Asian center founder|date= 1 April 2001|publisher=[[The Tufts Daily]]|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=200329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose is also the Director of the Netaji Research Bureau in [[Kolkata]], India, a research center and archives devoted to the life and work of Bose's great uncle, the Indian nationalist, [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2293696.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=India today needs legacy of Bose and Mahatma: Sugata Bose | date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose is the author most recently of ''His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire'' (2011) and ''A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire'' (2006).

Since 2014, Bose has served as a Member of India's Parliament from the [[Jadavpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Jadavpur Constituency]] in [[West Bengal]] with his party affiliation in [[Mamata Banerjee]] led [[All India Trinamool Congress]] (TMC).

==Early life and family==
Sugata Bose was born in [[Calcutta]], India. After studying at [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], Bose subsequently completed his PhD at the [[University of Cambridge]] before being named a [[Fellow#Cambridge and Oxford Colleges|Research Fellow]] of [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St. Catharine's College]] at Cambridge in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugata Bose Appointment to St Catharine's|url=http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1981r.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandnephew of [[Indian Independence movement|Indian nationalist]] [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]&lt;ref name="The Hindu"/&gt; and grandson of nationalist [[Sarat Chandra Bose]], Bose is the son of former [[Trinamool Congress]] [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarian]] [[Krishna Bose]] and paediatrician Sisir Kumar Bose. Bose's brother, [[Sumantra Bose]], teaches at the [[London School of Economics]]; his sister, [[Sarmila Bose]], is a researcher at Oxford University.&lt;ref name=lunch&gt;Anjali Puri, [http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/lunch-with-bs-sugata-bose-116030400361_1.html Lunch With BS: Sugata Bose], Business Standard, 4 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
After completing his Ph.D. at Cambridge, Sugata Bose began his career as a professor of history and diplomacy at [[Tufts University]].{{Sfn|Phillips|2001}} In 2001 Bose was appointed to the [[Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs|Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs]], a position that had lain vacant for almost two decades, one which had been previously occupied by historians of the [[Western Hemisphere]], but one for which Harvard specifically wanted a historian of South Asia.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt; From 2003 to 2010, Bose headed up the university's South Asia initiative as well as the graduate program in the history department.

==Books==
In 2011 Bose published ''His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire'', a biography of his great uncle Subhas Bose. The biography, a [[:wikt:trade book|trade book]],{{Sfn|Zachariah|2012|p=109|ps=: Quote: "Sugata Bose's biographical tribute to his great-uncle, the Indian nationalist politician Subhas Chandra Bose (1897–1945) is a gripping tale of a life of anti-colonial struggle and of a quiet, religiously oriented individual who spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile, tormented by his colonial overlords, becoming a politician, a warrior, and a legend and inspiration to some after his death. ...  As a trade book, it also eschews some of the scholarly paraphernalia that enable a more critical engagement with its contents.  Academic circles have long had in Leonard Gordon's ''Brothers against the Raj: A Biography of Indian Nationalists Sarat and Subhas Chandra Bose'' (1990) a careful and detailed account of the lives of Subhas Bose and his elder brother Sarat.  Sugata Bose's book is not likely to replace Gordon's account."}} has been criticised in scholarly reviews for soft-peddling or oversimplifying  Subhas Chandra Bose's alliances with Italian Fascism, German [[Nazi Germany|National Socialism]], and Japanese [[imperialism]].{{Sfn|Framke|2012|p=365|ps=: Quote: "While one can only highly recommend this book as a fine introduction to readers interested in the history of the national independence movement in the first half of the 20th century, in regard to Bose's encounters and interactions with National Socialism and Fascism, the monograph does not provide important new insights. ... Not only this episode, but also several others are interpreted by Sugata Bose in a rather unambiguous way that strongly rejects all possible affinities of Subhas Chandra Bose towards Fascism and National Socialism. In doing so, the author in my understanding, presents a relatively simplistic account of a much complex nature of engagement which Bose nurtured with international and national ideological contexts."}}{{Sfn|Zachariah|2012|pp=109–110|ps=: Quote: "The fact that he (Subhas Bose) considered himself a socialist, often expressed his displeasure or disagreement with aspects of the Italian or German dictatorships or with Japanese imperialism, and had Jewish friends in Germany and Austria, or that he wrote in his autobiography of the need for a "synthesis" between socialism and fascism, is not a substitute for a more nuanced intellectual history that engages seriously with what these ideologies were."}}  The book has also been criticised for its optimistic speculations on what Subhas Bose might have accomplished had he lived.{{Sfn|Wainwright|2013|p=361|ps=: Quote: "Less certain are some of the author’s speculations regarding how Bose’s presence in India after the Allied victory might have affected the partition and political culture of the subcontinent."}} Some popular reviews have been more positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sabyasachi|journal=Biblio|year=2011|title=Review|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674047549&amp;content=reviews|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Rudrangshu|title=A Hero's Story|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110729/jsp/opinion/story_14301827.jsp|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 March 2014|location=Calcutta, India|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malik|first=Ashok|title=Son of the Nation|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/books/son-of-the-nation/article1-729878.aspx|work=The Hindustan Times|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323194243/http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/books/son-of-the-nation/article1-729878.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motadel|first=David|title=India's Enemy's Enemy|journal=The Times Literary Supplement|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his earlier ''A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire'' (2006), Bose attempts to challenge the thesis pioneered by [[Kirti N. Chaudhuri]] in {{citation|last=|first=|title=Trade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByT1l36ZxGoC|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press}} and developed by Andre Wink and others, which holds that the world's first "global economy," the trans-Indian-ocean maritime economy—whose trade was assisted by the alternating winds and currents of the monsoons and which arose in the wake of the spread of Islam—was in turn undercut by European capitalism in the early 18th century.{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=1040–1041}}  Instead, Bose contends, in the main thesis of his book, an inter-regional economy of middle-level bazaar merchants and traders continued well into the late 1920s, existing between the dominant European capitalists at the top and the peasants and peddlers at the bottom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=1040–1041}}  This according to Bose, was not just the case in the market of goods and services, but also in the barter of ideas and culture.{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=1040–1041}}  Attempting to bolster the latter notion are sections in the book on [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and Bose's great uncle [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=1040–1041}} ''A Hundred Horizons'' was praised by academic reviewers for explicating the transformations to networks which linked Indian Ocean societies, beyond the influence of colonial empires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chatterjee | first = Kumkum | title = Review: A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire by Sugata Bose | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 499–500 | date = Winter 2008 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2008.38.3.499 | jstor=20143696}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for exploring "cosmopolitan notions of anticolonialism" throughout the Indian Ocean world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bertz | first = Ned | title = Review: A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire by Sugata Bose | journal = Journal of World History | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–379 | date = September 2007 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v018/18.3bertz.html | accessdate = 26 March 2014 | doi=10.1353/jwh.2007.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bose's delineation of that economy has been criticised for not going much beyond India and Indians,{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|p=1141a|ps=: Quote: "Thus Bose promises the reader an exposé of the continuity into the modern era of an ancient and sophisticated maritime system of long-distance exchange. ... If only that promise were upheld. Instead, we are treated to what increasingly, chapter by chapter, becomes a nationalist Indian version of Indian Ocean history. The key actors are all Indian and the only country in the region that counts is India."}}{{Sfn|Bertz|2007|p=378|ps=:  The method employed here is to sketch the histories of the "circular migrants" listed above, centring their encounters with the Indian Ocean as the backdrop. However, one can see the challenge in trying to hold these stories together within a single ambitious book. ... A surprisingly narrow aspect of the text is that its main actors are almost universally male and nearly all Indian.}} for reducing the complex exchange between the British and India to a clash of Indian nationalism and British tyranny;{{Sfn|Campbell|2007|p=1141b|ps=: Quote:"Of far greater significance for Bose arc the British—and not for establishing the Pax Britannica in the region that permitted the expansion of the Indian trading network. Rather, Bose summons up a caricature of the unrelenting coloniser and oppressor against whose narrow racist and capitalist vision he pits the liberating universalism and profound antimaterialism of Indians."}} and for not providing sufficient warrant for the main thesis in the book.{{Sfn|Campbell|p=1141c|ps=: Quote: "In sum, this is a curious book. A historical and literary dance through the history of rising Indian nationalist sentiment against British imperial rule, it appears aimed more for domestic Indian nationalist consumption than for scholars of the Indian Ocean world. In it, Bose grossly underestimates the complexities of the British imperial presence, and the many divisions along ethnic, caste, religious, economic, and political lines that existed among Indians, at home and overseas. More importantly, his concern with the Indian nationalist cause leads Bose increasingly to lose sight of his initial thesis and the wider enduring rhythms of trans-Indian Ocean world exchange."}}

Bose is also the author and editor of books on the economic, social and political history of modern South Asia.  Beginning his career with work on the economy of agrarian [[Bengal]], Bose published two volumes on his research. ''Agrarian Bengal: Economy, Social Structure and Politics, 1919–1947'', published in 1986, contextualised rural economic life within the wider currents of the global economy,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} while a 1993 contribution to the ''New Cambridge History of India'', ''Peasant Labour and Colonial Capital: Rural Bengal since 1770'', analysed two and a half centuries of regional economic and social change.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Bose has been active in researching, speaking, and publishing on [[Rabindranath Tagore]], contributing to projects across different media.

''The Heroic Age'' started as a [[Semiannual|biannual journal]]: it had a spring/summer and a fall/winter issue in 1999 and in 2000. Two issues were published also in 2010, the first one in August and the second in November. However, the frequency of published issues decreased in the new millennium. No issues of the journal were published in 2002, 2011, 2013, and 2014. Otherwise (that is, in 2001, 2003–2009, 2012, and 2015), one issue per year was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Heroic Age Archives|url = http://www.heroicage.org/archive.php|website = www.heroicage.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Swain wrote that the original idea was that ''The Heroic Age'' should appear quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.heroicage.org/issues/12/letter.php|title = Letter from the Editor|last = Swain|first = Larry|date = May 2009|journal = The Heroic Age.

Mason is one of the leaders of the 2nd Mass, a group of survivors fighting against the aliens.

The character was created by series creator [[Robert Rodat]]. Noah Wyle was cast in the role in 2009, on recommendation by executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] who produced Wyle's previous series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]].''

== Character history ==

=== Season one ===

At the opening of the series, most of the human race has been destroyed in an [[alien invasion]]. Tom Mason, a history professor from [[Boston]] who almost always wears the same bike gloves, is made second-in-command of the 2nd Massachusetts Militia Regiment, a group of civilians and fighters fleeing the city. Tom's three sons are Hal, Ben, and Matt; his wife perished during the initial stages of the invasion. At the start of the series, Ben has been captured by the "Skitters" &amp;ndash; six-legged beings who make up the alien ground forces &amp;ndash; and fitted with a "harness" that is making him perform [[slave labor]] through [[mind control]]. Around this time, Tom encounters a group of scavengers led by a man named John Pope ([[Colin Cunningham]]). After a firefight with Skitters, Pope's group is reluctantly taken in by the 2nd Mass.

After learning that Ben is being kept in a hospital with other brainwashed children, Tom, Hal, and the 2nd Mass' commanding officer, Captain Dan Weaver ([[Will Patton]]), formulate a plan to infiltrate the building, kill the Skitter guarding them, and rescue Ben and the other captives. Ben's harness is removed, but Hal notices that his brother has undergone physical and behavioral changes during his time in captivity. Meanwhile, Terry Clayton ([[Henry Czerny]]), an old friend of Weaver's and the commander of another survivor group, is revealed to be a [[collaborator (politics)|collaborator]] who is giving human children to the Skitters. After Clayton's treachery is revealed, Tom fatally shoots him.

When Skitter forces draw back in major cities, the 2nd Mass decide to launch an offensive on the alien base in Boston; Tom and Weaver scout it to detect weaknesses. It is during this expedition that they realize the Skitters are being commanded by another race of aliens later identified as the "Overlords." During the initial stages of the attack, Tom evacuates the 2nd Mass' civilian population from the school where they are hiding, then joins the fight in Boston. Using a [[grenade launcher]] given to him by Pope, Tom shoots down a spacecraft which crashes into and destroys the alien base. The Overlords, having underestimated the human resistance, offer to begin negotiations with the 2nd Mass. Tom begrudgingly agrees when he is told that it will save Ben from his transformation by the harness. The season ends with Tom being led aboard an Overlord ship.

=== Season two ===

Three months after the battle in Boston, a [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] Tom is returned to the 2nd Mass and is accidentally shot by Ben. In [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], it is revealed that Tom was put through agonizing [[torture]] before being brought before the Overlords, who offered to allow the 2nd Mass to peacefully live in a "neutral zone" in exchange for their [[surrender (military)|surrender]]; Tom refused. A "Mech" &amp;ndash; one of the robotic beings fighting alongside the Skitters &amp;ndash; [[massacre]]d a group of humans as a [[reprisal]]. After he recovers, Tom becomes the focus of suspicion by other members of the 2nd Mass, who fear that he turned or was brainwashed while in alien captivity; this tension leads to a conflict between Tom and Pope, who forms a parallel group called the Berserkers. A parasitical alien [[Endoscope|probe]] is found and removed from Tom's eye, leading him to question his own loyalty.

The 2nd Mass decides to travel to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where they have been told that other groups of survivors &amp;ndash; led by former members of the [[United States government|U.S. government]] &amp;ndash; are organizing. Over the course of the journey, Tom grows ever closer to Anne Glass ([[Moon Bloodgood]]), the medical doctor for the 2nd Mass. The group comes across a Skitter that Tom identifies as one of the aliens who tortured him during his time on the ship. They learn that a large group of Skitters have fought off the control of the harness and are mounting a [[rebellion]] against the Overlords; the Skitter rebels desire an alliance with the humans. During a firefight with alien forces, Tom briefly holds an Overlord &amp;ndash; who was also present during Tom's own captivity &amp;ndash; captive.

Upon arriving in Charleston, Tom is reunited with his academic mentor, Arthur Manchester ([[Terry O'Quinn]]). Manchester, the "Majority Leader" of Charleston's government, is overeager to prevent hostilities with the aliens, a position that Tom and Weaver consider reckless. When given the option of joining forces with the approaching Skitter rebellion, Manchester refuses and eventually orders that all members of the 2nd Mass be arrested. However, General Cole Bressler ([[Matt Frewer]]), the commander of Charleston's resistance force, mounts a ''[[coup]]'' and deposes Manchester. Tom facilitates dialogue between the rebel Skitters and the humans, resulting in a plot to assassinate the Overlord that was briefly captured by the 2nd Mass. The 2nd Mass is forced to work with the Skitters with no help from Bressler or his men. During the attack on an Overlord weapon, the location of which had been provided by the rebel Skitters, Tom, Weaver, Hal, Ben, Maggie and Anne are captured by Karen and her Overlord master. While torturing them to find out what they know, Karen reveals to Tom that Anne is pregnant with his child. Before she can inflict harm on either of them, Tom says that he will talk.

At that moment, the rebel Skitters attack and free the humans while taking care of the Overlord's forces. The Overlord himself is attacked by the rebel leader, "Red Eye", but Red Eye is killed. Tom seizes the electrostaff that Karen had used to torture them and used to kill the Overlord. As he does so, Karen flees, screaming that they will never win. The weapon is successfully destroyed, marking one of humanity's first major victories since the beginning of the invasion. However, despite the victory and Manchester's offer that Tom be elected to succeed him as Majority Leader, Tom and Weaver believe that the best thing for the 2nd Mass is to leave Charleston and continue their life on the road. However, before they can leave, a firestorm apparently engulfs Charleston and several pod-like ships land, revealing new aliens.

=== Season three ===

As Season Three begins, the 2nd Mass is still in Charleston and Tom has been elected President of the New United States. Also, the human resistance and their Skitter allies have formed an alliance with the new aliens, known as the Volm, who have provided them with the technology to effectively combat the Overlords, whose name has been revealed as being the Espheni. They have also provided a device to remove harnesses from enslaved captives, which Dr. Glass (now well advanced in pregnancy) is seen using. One of the Volm, whom Tom names Cochise, is now serving as an adviser to and fights alongside the 2nd Mass. After seven months of combat, the humans are finally drawing blood against the invaders, so much so that the Espheni have had to resort to espionage to gain an advantage over the humans and their intergalactic enemies, the Volm.

While Tom carries on his duties as President of the New United States, he has to deal with many of the hardships of being a leader - including the issue of a mole within Charleston. Manchester is given the job of uncovering the mole's identity, and is on the verge of doing so when the mole kills him in his office with an energy weapon. Anne later gives birth to Tom's daughter Alexis, but his joy is short-lived when Charleston is attacked by a group of soldiers working for a man they call the President of the United States, Benjamin Hathaway. Tom successfully defuses the situation, but loses a member of the Berserkers along the way. Then, with the help of Lt. Fisher, Tom makes contact with Benjamin Hathaway forces and decides to travel to Keystone to meet them along with Cochise, Pope and Bressler. After receiving a somewhat subdued reaction from President Hathaway and his troops, he is later forced to leave Keystone, leaving behind Cochise, and while en route back to Charleston has his plane shot down by an Espheni ship.

Tom then finds himself in a dangerous situation when he awakens in the burning wreckage of the plane to find Bressler dead, and Pope unconscious. When Tom saves Pope's life, he then successfully leaves the area with Pope's help, evading Espheni forces along the way. Much to Tom's shock and dismay, when he awakens in the hospital in Charleston he learns from his sons that Anne and Alexis have fled Charleston due to the revelation of her baby being part alien, and she has been abducted by Karen.

During Tom's absence, his sons Hal, Ben, Matt and Maggie lead an initial search team to try to locate Anne and Alexis, but later return home to Charleston under the realization that the Espheni have them, and that the best course of action as suggested by Ben was to try and use the Rebel Skitters within the Espheni ranks to try to locate Anne and the baby.

When Tom has recovered enough to walk around and resume his duties, he is thrust into further danger when his son Hal, implanted with an Espheni eyebug, attacks him and Peralta as they are discussing the Volm weapon. To his horror, he finds himself abducted by Hal, who demands information on the Volm weapon, and ends up being held hostage in a nearby building which the 2nd Mass later surrounds. Coming to the realization that his son may end up being killed for being the mole, Tom attempts to connect with Hal by bringing up the past and his mother to defuse the situation without any loss of life. As the situation begins to escalate and Hal's demands of Tom to reveal the information on the weapon increase, his other two sons, Ben and Matt, enter the room along with Maggie, bringing the situation to a close. Tom later decides to go along with a dangerous remedy to cure Hal of the eyebug and invites him along on the search for Anne and Alexis.

He then makes the decision to step down as President of the New United States and offers up the information on the Volm weapon, which has been called Project Orange, to Peralta, knowing that she will be elected the next President, and she is sworn in during his departure from Charleston.

Tom then leads a rescue party out of Charleston consisting of himself, Hal, Matt and Ben to locate Anne and Alexis. During their journey they find themselves robbed of their supplies by a local family, the Picketts. After successfully retrieving the supplies, but with the unfortunate loss of one of the family members who had robbed them, they resume their search for Anne and Alexis. Tom later decides to return to the Pickett house to check on their well being, after telling them about Charleston, but is ambushed by several Espheni mechs and skitters.

Now captured by Karen, Tom awakens in a dream world where the invasion has not happened and he and his wife and sons have been living a normal but happy life. As Tom continued to live out this false reality as a college professor, he starts to receive messages from Anne Glass but with no memory of her, the 2nd Mass or of the alien invasion; things around him start to fall apart. When three locations are made exceedingly clear to him during the dream, he later realizes what he has been seeing was not real and awakens inside an Espheni base in Boston. He then discovers that Karen was attempting to manipulate him into revealing what tower the 2nd Mass will attack during their operation. Shortly afterwards Tom is rescued and shoots Karen dead, when he awakens in Charleston and discovers he is still being manipulated by Karen. Finally awakening in the real world, Karen informs him to his despair that she had Anne and Alexis killed. After initially trying to attack Karen, Tom breaks down in tears and is then shown the activation of the Espheni planetary defense grid and is informed that within three months all life on Earth will be lost.

Realizing that he needs to return to Charleston, Tom then jumps from a ledge, evading the Espheni forces in the area and successfully returns to Charleston unharmed. Upon returning to Charleston Tom immediately reveals that Anne and Alexis had been killed, and the vulnerability of the Boston tower to assault. Fueled by a desire for revenge, Tom wants to lead a team once the weapon is ready to be deployed, but before he could act an explosion is felt in the Charleston area and Tom discovers that the Volm complex has been destroyed. After Tom discovers Cochise severely wounded, he helps him to the hospital and after being told his wounds will regenerate if left alone, he orders that he be left alone. When another explosion rocks Charleston, killing many and wounding others, Tom finds himself trapped underground and makes a horrifying discovery as he learns that Lourdes was the mole. After being taunted by a possessed Lourdes, Tom uses a Volm gun and makes an opening for himself and others to escape to the surface with.

While on the surface Tom and Cochise discuss the situation with the Volm weapon and come to the conclusion that the Volm weapon was adequately protected from the initial blast and that it should be just be a simple matter of digging it out. He then leads a team along with Cochise, Kadar and several members of the 2nd Mass on a boat with the weapon mounted onto it and attacks and successfully destroys the Boston tower, bringing down the Espheni planetary defense grid along with it. As a result, the Volm successfully land reinforcements on their city-sized ship in the area the tower once stood.

Believing the battle to be over for now Tom along with the other members of the 2nd Mass celebrate their victory but are left shocked when the Volm reveal their plans to relocate them to Brazil. Strongly opposed to this, Tom makes his feelings clear to the Volm commander who is revealed to be Cochise's father. After a minor disagreement, he is held captive and is visited by the Volm commander and explains that after everything that has happened, he along with the other members of the 2nd Mass wish to continue fighting the Espheni to the end and that he, and they wish to liberate the planet. The Volm commander understands Toms feelings and lets him go, and as the other members of the 2nd Mass are about to be taken away by Cochise and several other Volm, is informed that they are free to go.

Though somewhat concerned that the battle against the Espheni will be a three-way fight, Tom decides to travel back to Charleston along with the rest of the 2nd Mass but along the way is met by Karen, who informs him that the Volm can't be trusted and is later given Anne and Alexis in return as a sign of good faith. When Tom shoots Karen, after the dust had settled he reunites with Anne and Alexis and discovers that Alexis his daughter is now the size of a 6 year old child. To his surprise he witnesses Alexis draw out and destroy the eyebugs inside Lourdes.

=== Season four ===

23 days later, Tom along with the 2nd Mass arrive back at Charleston, but before he can celebrate the group are attacked by Espheni ships and mechs, and are seemingly ensnared by the Espheni obelisks, Tom is separated from Anne, Lexi, Matt and Ben, and other members of the 2nd Mass.

4 months later, Tom is held in solitary confinement in an Espheni ghetto, a place set up by the Espheni for reasons he does not yet know, to hold prisoners, including Weaver, Pope, Hal, and other members of the 2nd Mass, and people who had been captured. When Weaver is held in a room next to his, Tom informs him that he is working on a plan to escape from the ghetto, and then reveals that he had been leaving confinement to gather more intelligence on the area, and the skitter locations. Fearing the area to be monitored by the Espheni, Tom covers his face before leaving confinement. However his actions which sometimes involved provoking the skitters, were not unnoticed by the Espheni, a single overlord aboard a ship monitoring the ghetto sends a message to an unknown person demanding that the vigilante, which some residents dub 'The Ghost' be handed over, or the residents of the ghetto will be killed.

Meanwhile, Tom learns from Cochise that the Volm had no choice but to leave the Earth, and have left behind several scout teams. He is then informed that the Espheni had set up ghettos all across the planet, for reasons he does not yet know, and that the Espheni are developing a new power source. Fearing the extinction of humanity, Cochise offers Tom words of support, and when Tom requests that he try to find Anne, Lexi, Matt, and Ben, he agrees.

Now freed from solitary confinement along with Weaver, he is then faced with an Espheni speaking through a harnessed child who tells him, along with the Ghettos residents that until the vigilante is handed over, the residents will receive no further food shipments. With their survival now in doubt, Tom discusses the situation with Weaver, who believes Pope may have a supply of food they could use.

Meanwhile, Tom meets up with Hal who tells him of the new escape plan, and together they meet with Dingaan Botha, who informs Tom that he had constructed a Faraday suit which can be used to scale the fence, and that he had escaped from an Espheni camp before. When he also is told of a working radio, he uses it to contact Cochise who tells him that the Espheni power source is offensive in nature, unlike the grid used before, and that he knows where Matt is being held. When Tom requests that he rescue Matt, he agrees.

Buoyed by the news about Matt, Tom decides to dress as the vigilante and hands himself over to the Overlord. Aboard the ship he learns that the Espheni plan to use humanity as hybrid soldiers in a new war, and is presented with a choice to save his family from the transformation, but when the Overlord gives him the choice between extinction or evolution, the ghettos residents dressed the Ghost, launch projectiles against the ship, during the chaos Tom uses the opportunity to study the camps layout and power source. When he later is released by the Overlord, Tom informs Hal and Weaver that he had promised not to resist anymore.

Faced with the news that humanity will be skitterized by the Espheni in the coming days, Tom puts the finishing touches on his escape plan with Dingaan, and then offers him a place among the 2nd Mass when they escape. Later that day, with Pope, Hal, Weaver, Tector and Digaan gathered, Tom, with a scale model of the ghetto in front of him, informs them that he will draw the attention of the ghettos skitter guards while Dingaan scales the fence. He then informs them that Hal will lead the ghettos residents into the tunnels in 15 man groups to avoid suspicion while Pope and Weaver cover for Dingaan, but faced with a skeptical Pope, Tom explains that when he manages to gather the skitters into one area, he will blow the building he was once held in with the explosive charges.

The next day, Tom meets with an Overlord and a harnessed child and informs them that the deal they had is now off, and that they should surrender, but when the Overlord threatens his life, he attacks it with a flamethrower and severely injures it. With the escape plan now in motion, Tom is now pursued by skitters and Pope is forced to scale the fence when Dingaans hand is injured, meanwhile Hal waits with the ghetto residents in the tunnels. With the fence now down, Tom leads the skitters to the building and blows it up and jumps into the water in triumph. That night, Tom reunites with Hal and the group and then thanks Pope for his part in the escape.

Now on the run from the Espheni and faced with increasing Beamer patrols, Tom arrives at the Volm hideout in an abandoned warehouse and is immediately greeted by Cochise. When Cochise explains that with the help of recon drones they now have Matts location, he decides to set out and rescue him. Weaver explains to Tom that he empathizes with how he must be feeling, and joins him. Tom then leaves Hal in charge of the group and tasks him with gathering supplies and ammunition. Now outside of the re education center, Cochise is forced into a meditative trance after being attacked by a mutated Jeanne Weaver, so Tom leaves him behind.

Inside the camp, when the children raise the alarm, Tom is forced to separate from Weaver and is led by Mira to Matts cell. He immediately rescues Matt who is being attacked by Kent Matthews by striking him, and with the help of Mira who distracts the skitters, leaves along with Matt. Shortly afterwards, Tom is reunited with an emotional Weaver who explains to him, Matt and Cochise what had happened with Jeanne. Though unbeknownst to Tom, he is currently being tracked by the scorched Overlord.

After 3 days of travel Tom arrives back at the Volm hideout with Matt, Cochise and Weaver, he notices the message left by Hal and takes measures to decipher it, he however is unaware that the Scorched Overlord along with several Skitters are patrolling the warehouse and is forced to make a quick retreat after learning where Hal was headed. Shortly afterwards, Cochise informs Tom that he needs to rejoin his recon team and then leaves. As Tom and the group make their way through the forest, they come across a camp inhabited by 2 men, who introduce themselves as Nick and Cooper, who are brothers. When they tell Tom that they had escaped from the Espheni, he's skeptical and voices his concerns to Weaver.

Tom is then abducted by the men who tell him the Espheni have a high price on his head, concerned for Matt, he attempts to talk with Cooper and tells him about how Matt was only 8 when the Espheni invaded. Cooper tells him that he had 2 sons who are now dead, as Tom continues to engage with him, he learns that Nick had caused the death of Coopers sons, which causes Cooper to kill Nick. As Cooper turns to kill Tom, Weaver shoots him dead. That night, he bonds with Matt and tells him about the meaning of family and brothers.

Now in Chinatown, Tom is reunited with his family and immediately asks Anne about Lexi, but before they can talk Lourdes interrupts and tells them that she's in a cocoon. He stops Anne from freeing her and tells her not to act irrationally as it may get Lexi killed. When Anne undergoes memory regression for answers, he spends time by Lexi's side and is joined by Weaver who offers him words of comfort. Later that night, Tom interrupts a 2nd Mass meeting and overhears Pope suggesting Lexi should be killed, he then warns them against acting and is told by Pope that there's clearly a conflict of interest going on. As he leaves, Hal tells him that they have a valid point but he doesn't listen, he tells him of his disgust that he was there. Realizing that people are scared of Lexi and that he may need to use force to protect her, he discusses the situation with Lourdes.

Warned by Ben who stands by his side, Tom is faced with an angry Pope and 2nd Mass members who demand access to Lexi. Tom defuses the situation by telling them should she become a monster, he will deal with her. He then hears from Anne before she puts her hand on the cocoon that Lexi needs her.

When Lexi emerges from her cocoon seemingly unchanged, Tom is faced with Lexi's proclamation that she is leaving Chinatown and then voices his concerns to her along with Anne, but she doesn't listen. He watches on as she walks into the crowd gathered outside and is shocked when Lexi kills Lourdes through pity. Believing that the Espheni may have done something to Lexi, Tom turns to Dr. Kadar and learns that she has changed at a cellular level.

Faced with an impending attack from the scorched Overlord, Tom tasks the 2nd Mass with laying traps around Chinatown and to prepare for a ground assault, he tells them that he believes they haven't attacked with Beamers as the Overlord is seeking vengeance against him. That night, the Espheni begin their ground assault and the 2nd Mass is hit with an explosion from a ruptured gas line that kills most of the group. With the survivors now gathered, Tom orders them to evacuate to an underground bomb shelter and tells them that the attack won't stop until the Espheni believe they are dead. But before Tom can evacuate himself, he is faced with tragedy when he discovers that Dr.Kadar has suffered a fatal shrapnel wound. With Dr.Kadar now dead, Tom becomes distressed by the deaths suffered during the attack and turns to Tector and asks him for his rifle to attack the Overlord. Tector however tricks Tom and sends him away before attacking the Overlord himself while dressed as the Ghost and then blows himself up.

With Chinatown now in ruin, Tom awakens under the rubble unharmed and discovers a distressed Dingaan while attempting to escape. Together they manage to find a crashed Beamer and are able to get inside. Believing that they may be able to use the Beamer to escape, Tom decides to investigate and is implanted with a parasite after touching a panel and tasks Dingaan with removing. However, when he accidentally triggers an onboard missile, Tom shields himself behind a panel along with Dingaan and anxiously awaits the explosion. When Dingaan tells him that the beeping sound reminded him of his wife's heart monitor before she died, Tom comforts him. He is then rescued when the explosion draws the 2nd Mass to them. Later that night, Tom and the 2nd Mass decide to gather around a camp fire to mourn the loss of Tector and Lourdes, and after learning that Ben had given some of his spikes to save Maggie, he then talks with Hal and they both notice a strange pulsating light on the moon.

Believing the light on the moon to be the Espheni power source, Tom decides that they need to dig the Beamer out of the rubble to use against it, but when he learns that they don't have the tools to do it quickly, Cochise tells him about a Volm supply cache that may hold something of use to help unearth the buried Beamer. He then decides to lead a small team consisting of himself, Anne, Matt, Weaver and Cochise. When Tom and the group arrive at the site Cochise informs him that they will need to wear gasmasks as the air is toxic where the cache is buried, they are then greeted by Mira who tells them that she had escaped the Espheni camp, Matt believes her but Tom is suspicious and ties her up before unearthing the cache. After hearing from Matt that Mira had escaped, Tom is attacked by Kent Matthews and with Annes help, he is able to shoot him dead. With the cache destroyed, Tom decides to head back to Chinatown with the group.

After the Beamer is inadvertently brought to life and flown out of the rubble, Tom is faced with uncertainty when the 2nd Mass demand that he should give them a chance to pilot the Beamer on the mission to the moon. Tom is against the idea but is convinced by Anne to give them a vote, and tells them that anyone is free to put their name in contention for the role. That night, with the 2nd Mass gathered, Tom draws Bens name, and his own. He then admits to Anne that he had rigged the draw as he couldn't allow Ben to go without him. The next day, Tom and Ben prepare to enter the Beamer, but are interrupted when Beamers attack. He then watches on as Lexi destroys them.

Tom is angered by Lexi's return and she apologizes to him. Tom tells her that he doesn't want anything more to do with her, as she had betrayed both him and the 2nd Mass who he calls his family. Anne convinces him to give her a chance, and he allows her to join him on the mission to the moon. Believing Lexi to be a threat, Hal gives Tom a poison to use on her just in case. When the Beamer leaves the Earths atmosphere, he realizes that the life support system won't be able to maintain them both ways. Lexi suggests to him that they enter a cocoon together until they reach the moon, to which he agrees. However he dreams that he's now back on Earth with the power core destroyed and the Espheni on the back foot and quickly realizes what he is experiencing is not real. Believing Lexi to be the cause, he demands that she release him. When they both have a father-daughter moment and reconcile the issues they once had, they awaken and discover they're now close to the moon.

When their Beamer is captured by the Scorched Overlord, Tom decides to board the ship along with Lexi. While inside they are confronted by the Scorched Overlord who attacks Lexi and reveals his plan through Mira who is now harnessed to them both. Tom attacks the Overlord and injects him with a lethal Volm poison which kills him, but before he dies he destroys the ships auto pilot system to prevent them using against the power core. Tom however is told by Lexi to return to the Beamer and is distraught when he hears what he believes to be Lexi saying goodbye, she explains to him that as the auto pilot is destroyed she has no choice but to pilot the ship to destroy the core. Tom reluctantly says goodbye to Lexi, but they are attacked by a squadron of Beamers and are rescued by the Volm. Tom watches on as Lexi destroys the power core, but the explosion sends his Beamer spiraling into space out of control. He then awakens on a bed aboard an unknown spaceship and hears what he believes to be an old radio broadcast, immediately he decides to look around the room and realizes he's in space. He is then interrupted when an unknown alien makes their presence known, to which Tom responds with familiarity.

=== Season five ===
Tom is rescued from space by the Espheni's ancient enemy, the Dornia who tell him to find his inner warrior to defeat the Espheni once and for all before returning him to Earth. Guided by the Dornia who communicates with him in the image of his deceased wife Rebecca Mason, Tom rallies all the militias across the world into a global resistance to attack the Espheni bases and retake the planet. For his part, Tom leads a march on [[Washington, D.C.]]. After an encounter with a militia running a [[witch hunt]] under the leadership of an Espheni clone, Tom learns of the existence of an Espheni queen when Ben uses an Espheni communications device. Shortly afterwards, Tom is approached by the Dornia who offer him a bioweapon that when used on the Espheni queen, will wipe the race out and free the Earth. Tom takes the weapon and has Anne and resistance fighter Marty work on modifying it so it's non-lethal to humans, but is confronted by the possible return of his daughter Alexis. Tom learns that the Espheni queen only comes to a planet when victory is certain and the Espheni are moving from invasion to occupation. Alexis also informs him that the Espheni have been to Earth before. Alexis, revealed to be an Espheni clone, attacks Tom, but is killed by Ben with the Dornia bioweapon before she can kill him. The next day, Tom leads an attack on Washington, D.C., having the militias attack an impenetrable defensive wall while he leads a strike team through the city's service tunnels to reach the queen herself. Tom is separated from the rest of the team by an explosion, but continues on alone and confronts the queen face to face in the ruins of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. The queen explains to Tom that the invasion is revenge for the death of her daughter at the hands of humanity 1,500 years ago in another failed invasion. The queen starts draining Tom's blood, but he takes advantage of this and infects himself with the Dornia bioweapon. Thanks to the modifications Anne and Marty made to it, Tom is immune to the weapon's effects, but the virus passes through his blood into the Espheni queen, killing her. The bioweapon spreads through the queen's connection to her species and the Espheni are wiped out by the bioweapon, freeing Earth and humanity. Shortly afterwards, Tom learns that Anne has died and desperately takes her to the Dornia for help. As Tom awaits her return, a mortally injured John Pope, who has been seeking revenge against Tom, arrives but takes no pleasure in Tom's pain and lays down his weapon. Tom refuses to kill Pope since the war is over and he no longer has to kill anyone. Pope dies of his wounds and Anne is returned to Tom alive. Months later, Anne is pregnant with their second child and Tom rejects offers to be the new leader of a united humanity, saying that he is just a teacher. As humanity gathers at the rebuilt Lincoln Memorial, Tom gives a speech on how the Espheni invasion gave them a second chance as a species.

He has previously worked with TNT on ''[[The Librarian (franchise)|The Librarian]]'' films and was sent scripts for various shows on their network. Wyle said part of the reason he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children.

'''''United States v. [[Paramount Pictures]], Inc.''''', 334 U.S. 131 (1948),&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|334|131|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as  the '''Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948''', the '''Paramount Case''', the '''Paramount Decision''' or the '''Paramount Decree''')&lt;ref name=cobbles&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hollywood Antitrust Case |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/1film_antitrust.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] [[antitrust]] case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films.  It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, [[distribution (film)|distributed]], and exhibited.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the [[antitrust]] laws of the [[United States]], which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements.

The case is important both in U.S. antitrust law and film history. In the former, it remains a landmark decision in [[vertical integration]] cases; in the latter, it is responsible for putting an end to the old Hollywood [[studio system]].

==Background==
The legal issues originated in the silent era, when the [[Federal Trade Commission]] began investigating film companies for potential violations under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890.

The major film studios owned the theaters where their motion pictures were shown, either in partnerships or outright. Thus specific theater chains showed only the films produced by the studio that owned them. The studios created the films, had the writers, directors, producers and actors on staff (under contract), owned the film processing and laboratories, created the prints and distributed them through the theaters that they owned: In other words, the studios were [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]], creating a de facto [[oligopoly]]. By 1945, the studios owned either partially or outright 17% of the theaters in the country, accounting for 45% of the film-rental revenue.

Ultimately, this issue of the studios' allegedly illegal trade practices led to all the major movie studios being sued in 1938 by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=cobbles/&gt; As the largest studio, Paramount was the primary defendant, but all of the other Big Five (Loew's ([[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]), [[Warner Bros.]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[RKO Pictures]]) and Little Three ([[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[United Artists]]) were named, as well as numerous subsidiaries and executives from each company.&lt;ref name=cobblesdefendants&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Original Defendants in the Paramount Case |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountdoc_1938list.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate cases were also filed against large independent chains, including the 148-theater Schine.&lt;ref name=cobblescases&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theater Monopoly Cases |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_2studios1939.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government's case was settled with a [[consent decree]] in 1940,&lt;ref name=cobblesconsent&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 3:  The Consent Decree of 1940 |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_3consent1940.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,849344,00.html | work=Time | title=SHOW BUSINESS: Consent Decree | date=November 11, 1940 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the government to reinstate the lawsuit if, by November 1943, it had not seen a satisfactory level of compliance.  Among other requirements, the consent decree included the following conditions:
# The [[Major film studio#The majors during the Golden Age|Big Five]] studios could no longer block-book [[short film]] subjects along with [[feature film]]s (known as one-shot, or full force, [[block booking]]);
# The Big Five studios could continue to block-book features, but the block size would be limited to five films;
# Blind buying (buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) would now be outlawed and replaced with "trade showing," special screenings every two weeks at which representatives of all 31 theater districts in the United States could see films before they decided to book a film; and
# The creation of an administration board to enforce these requirements.
The studios did not fully implement the consent decree, and in 1942 with [[National Association of Theatre Owners|Allied Theatre Owners]] proposed an alternate "Unity Plan". They proposed booking larger blocks of theatres with the caveat of allowing theaters to reject films.&lt;ref name=cobblessimpp&gt;{{cite web |title=Independents Protest the United Motion Picture Industry (1942) |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/simpp_1942umpi.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the [[Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers]] (SIMPP),&lt;ref name=cobblessimpp/&gt; which also filed a lawsuit against Paramount Detroit Theaters, the first major lawsuit of producers against exhibitors. The government declined the Unity proposal and reinstated the 1943 lawsuit.&lt;ref name=cobblesattygeneral&gt;{{cite web |title=The Government Reactivates the Paramount Case |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountdoc_1944biddle.htm |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case went to trial on October 8, 1945, one month and six days after the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=cobbles/&gt; The case was decided in favor of the studios, and the government immediately appealed.

The case reached the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1948; their verdict went against the movie studios, forcing all of them to divest themselves of their movie theater chains.&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt; This, coupled with the advent of television and the attendant drop in movie ticket sales, brought about a severe slump in the movie business, a slump that would not be reversed until 1972, with the release of ''[[The Godfather]]'', the first modern [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].

The ''Paramount'' decision is a bedrock of corporate antitrust law, and as such is cited in most cases where issues of vertical integration play a prominent role in restricting fair trade.

==Decision==

The Court ruled 7-1 in the government's favor, affirming much of the consent decree (Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] took no part in the proceedings). [[William O. Douglas]] delivered the Court's opinion, with [[Felix Frankfurter]] dissenting in part, arguing the Court should have left all of the decree intact but its arbitration provisions.&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt;

===Douglas===

Douglas's opinion reiterated the facts and history of the case and reviewed the District Court's opinion, agreeing that its conclusion was "incontestable".&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt; He considered five different trade practices addressed by the consent decree:

*''Clearances and runs'', under which movies were scheduled so they would only be showing at particular theatres at any given time, to avoid competing with another theater's showing;
*''Pooling agreements'', the joint ownership of theaters by two nominally competitive studios;
*''Formula deals, master agreements, and franchises'': arrangements by which an exhibitor or distributor allocated profits among theaters that had shown a particular film, and awarded exclusive rights to independent theatres, sometimes without competitive bidding;
*''[[Block booking]]'', the studios' practice of requiring theaters to take an entire slate of its films, sometimes without even seeing them, sometimes before the films had even been produced ("blind bidding"), and
*''Discrimination'' against smaller, independent theaters in favor of larger chains.

Douglas let stand the District Court's sevenfold test for when a clearance agreement was a restraint of trade, as he agreed they had a legitimate purpose. Pooling agreements and joint ownership, he agreed, were "bald efforts to substitute monopoly for competition ... Clearer restraints of trade are difficult to imagine."&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt;{{rp|149}} He allowed, however, that courts could consider how an interest in an exhibitor was acquired and sent some other issues back to the District Court for further inquiry and resolution. He set aside the lower court findings on franchises so that they might be reconsidered from the perspective of allowing competitive bidding. On the block booking question, he rejected the studios' argument that it was necessary to profit from their copyrights: "The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration".&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt;{{rp|158}} The prohibitions on discrimination he let stand entirely.

===Frankfurter===

Frankfurter took exception to the extent to which his brethren had agreed with the studios that the District Court had not adequately explored the underlying facts in affirming the consent decree. He pointed to another recent Court decision, ''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'' that lower courts are the proper place for such findings of fact, to be deferred to by higher courts. Also, he reminded the Court that the District Court had spent fifteen months considering the case and reviewed almost 4,000 pages of documentary evidence: "I cannot bring myself to conclude that the product of such a painstaking process of adjudication as to a decree appropriate for such a complicated situation as this record discloses was an abuse of discretion."&lt;ref name="USSCOpinion"/&gt;{{rp|180}} He would have modified the District Court decision only to permit the use of [[arbitration]] to resolve disputes.

==Consequences==

Movie studios previously charged low rents to exhibitors because they were owned by the studio. When the studios were forced to sell their theaters, the result was higher rental rates charged to exhibitors (rising from an average of approximately 35% to its current level of approximately 50%), so the studios could recoup their expenses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The inability to block-book an entire year's worth of movies caused studios to be more selective in the movies they made, resulting in higher production costs and dramatically fewer movies made. This caused studios to further raise the rates they charged theaters, since the volume of movies fell.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The court orders forcing the separation of motion picture production and exhibition companies are commonly referred to as the '''Paramount Decrees'''. Paramount Pictures Inc. was forced to split into two companies: the film company [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Corp.]] and the theater chain ([[United Paramount Theaters]]) which merged in 1953 with the [[American Broadcasting Company]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Consequences of the decision include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*More independent producers and studios to produce their film product free of major studio interference.
*The beginning of the end of the old Hollywood [[studio system]] and its [[Classical Hollywood cinema#In the Sound Era|golden age]].
*The weakening of the ([[Will H. Hays|Hays]]) [[Production Code]], since it saw the rise of independent and "[[art house]]" theaters which showed foreign or independent films made outside of its jurisdiction.

Following the decision, and with the rise of television, the major studios felt that the loss of their exclusive theatre arrangements would reduce the opportunity to re-release product from their film libraries. Paramount, for example, sold its pre-1950 sound feature film library to [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], which created [[EMKA, Ltd.|EMKA]] (today [[Universal Television]]) to manage this library.  Other studios, such as [[20th Century Fox]] or [[Warner Bros.]], also sold or leased their classic back catalogs to other companies such as [[Associated Artists Productions]] or [[National Telefilm Associates]].  By contrast, [[Walt Disney]] believed his film library was much more valuable than RKO had estimated it to be; in 1953, he formed [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|a holding company]] that held rights to work he did prior to 1953 as well as distributed new material from his studio—that company became its own in-house distribution unit, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. The growth of television in subsequent years has resulted in these supposedly "worthless" films earning billions of dollars in rentals from television stations and networks.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Yahya of Antioch''', full name '''Yaḥya ibn Saʿīd al-Anṭākī''' (Ar. يحيى بن سعيد الأنطاكي), was a [[Melkite]] Christian physician and historian of the 11th century.

He was most likely born in [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]. He became a physician, but the anti-Christian pogroms of Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (r. 996–1021) forced him to flee to [[Byzantine]]-held [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium| page=2213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His chief work is a continuation of Eutychius' ''[[Annals]]'', stretching from 938 to 1034. Drawing on a variety of sources, his history deals with events in the [[Byzantine Empire]], Egypt, as well as [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Kievan Rus']]. Whilst in Antioch, he also wrote theological works in defence of Christianity and refutations of Islam and Judaism. He died ca. 1066.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; 

His history was published, edited and translated by I. Kratchkovsky and A. Vasiliev into [[French language|French]] in Volumes 18, 24, and 47 of the ''[[Patrologia Orientalis]]'', and into Italian.
