}}

In July 2017 the municipalities of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], in the United States, opposed extension of an [[eruv]] within their borders. An eruv is a land area surrounded by a boundary of religious significance, often marked by small plastic pipes (called ''lechis'') attached to [[utility pole]]s. The demarcation permits [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jews to push or carry objects (such as prayer books, keys or baby strollers) within the eruv on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], in a way that is otherwise considered forbidden under Orthodox Jewish law. Other [[Jewish_religious_movements#Modern_movements_or_denominations|Jewish denominations]], such as [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], do not hold such views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/living/eruv_1.shtml |title=Eruvs |date=July 23, 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2007/01/29/eruv-in-oak-park-splits-community/ |title=Eruv in Oak Park Splits Community |date=January 29, 2007 |publisher=Los Angeles Daily News |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three municipalities ordered that the borders of the eruv be dismantled having been erected without the appropriate consents. Many Mahwah residents angrily protested against the prospect of Orthodox Jews from [[Rockland County, New York]], using local parks or seeking to buy homes there.

After no agreement could be reached short of litigation, the eruv association brought suit against each of the municipalities. Mahwah's actions in passing a [[local ordinance|township ordinance]] to bar nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks, and the hostility of some residents and council members towards those who supported the eruv led Democratic candidate for [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Phil Murphy]] and others to make accusations of anti-Semitism. The presiding judge in the lawsuits, [[John Michael Vazquez]], in January 2018 made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain. Mahwah has settled a lawsuit from the [[New Jersey Attorney General]] accusing it of discrimination.

==Background==
[[File:Bergen County, NJ municipalities labeled.svg|thumb|upright|Bergen County, New Jersey. Mahwah is the large area at upper left (northwest), with Upper Saddle River and Montvale the next to the east along the state line (at top).]]
[[File:Location map of Bergen County, New Jersey.svg|thumb|upright|Location map of Bergen County in New Jersey. Rockland County in New York is seen, in part, to the north.]]
The [[Township (New Jersey)|township]] of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], and the [[borough (New Jersey)|boroughs]] of [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]], are neighboring municipalities in northwestern [[Bergen County, New Jersey]]. All three are adjacent to the state line with New York,&lt;ref name="have a talk"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah mayor wants to talk with eruv association |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |newspaper = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212005506/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other side of which is [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], where there are large communities of [[Orthodox Jew]]s.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt;

An [[eruv]] (plural "eruvin", or sometimes "eruvim") is an enclosure defined by string, rope, wires, cables, etc., that allows observant Jews, including the Orthodox, to carry or push objects further than is normally permitted on [[Shabbat|the Jewish Sabbath]] (or Shabbat). Normally, on Shabbat, an object may not be taken from a private domain, such as a house, into a public one, such as a street or sidewalk, or moved, in a public area, more than 4 [[cubit]]s (about 6 feet; 1.7 meters). Note that "domain" is a technical term referring to how enclosed an area is, not property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabadwmc.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/2270313/jewish/About-Eruv.htm |title=About Eruv |publisher=Chabad of West Monmouth County |access-date=July 27, 2018 |quote=Private and public do not refer to ownership. An enclosed area is considered a private domain, whereas an open area is considered public for the purposes of these laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects may be moved freely if they remain within a private domain, and an eruv effectively extends the private domain through the area it encloses, including streets and sidewalks. The boundary of an eruv is often marked by utility poles surrounding a given area, with the space between regarded as doorways, topped by lintels, the telephone or power wires.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv"&gt;{{cite web |last = Lozovsky |first = Lorne |url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |title = What is an Eruv? |publisher = chabad.org |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208024846/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poles are regarded as doorposts, and are marked by lechis (singular: lechi), solid objects such as lengths of twine or of plastic pipe, which run from near the ground to just below the wires.&lt;ref name="eruvglossary"&gt;{{cite web |title = Eruv Glossary |publisher = Greater Boston Eruv Corporation |url = http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the act of stringing such a boundary around a public area by a Jewish community creates the pretense for its members that that public area is enclosed for the limited purpose of allowing the members to do some otherwise forbidden things in that public area on the Sabbath.

There are many requirements for eruvin; the [[Talmud]] devotes [[Eruvin (Talmud)|an entire tractate]] to the subject. This complexity makes [[Rabbi#Functions|rabbinic supervision]] and regular inspection mandatory. An operating eruv allows observant Jews to carry prayer books from home to synagogue on Shabbat, or to push strollers or baby carriages.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv" /&gt;

[[File:Eruv segment.jpg|thumb|left|An eruv boundary, Airmont, New York. Note the white plastic lechi at right of nearest pole.]]
In [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], in southeastern Bergen County and home to large numbers of Orthodox Jews, an eruv has existed since the 1970s with little controversy, and, as the Jewish population increased, was extended to nearby [[Bogota, New Jersey|Bogota]] and [[Bergenfield, New Jersey|Bergenfield]]. Other eruvin in Bergen County are in [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]] and in [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]].&lt;ref name="prepare"&gt;{{cite news |title = Jewish group prepares for legal fight over religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |date = July 27, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |last2 = Burrow |first2 = Megan |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910121250/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |archivedate = September 10, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous instance in which an eruv had been constructed in Bergen County, and had been challenged by local authorities, occurred in [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]], in the eastern part of the county. Attempts by municipal authorities to ban eruvin had failed when challenged in the federal courts, and the settlement in 2006 after a six-year battle obliged the borough to pay $325,000 for the eruv association's legal costs.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; In some cases involving conflict over whether an eruv should be permitted, the municipality has lost and the construction of the eruv allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="three towns"&gt;{{cite news |title = Three North Jersey towns face lawsuits over alleged Orthodox Jewish discrimination |url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |date = October 29, 2017 |last = Banco |first = Erin |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081351/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and controversy==
[[File:Lechi Mahwah.jpg|thumb|upright|Portion of a lechi attached to a utility pole, Mahwah, New Jersey]]
Orthodox Jews in Rockland County gained a license from [[Orange and Rockland Utilities]] (which serves parts of both Rockland County in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey) to construct an eruv using its utility poles in 2015,&lt;ref name = "Montvale" /&gt; and in March 2017 the company granted permission for the South [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] Eruv Fund to install lechis, made from white [[PVC]] pipe, on its utility poles in northwestern Bergen County.&lt;ref name="engineer"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah engineer orders Jewish group to take down religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170909173825/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |archivedate = September 9, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extension of an existing eruv in Rockland County, and was intended to run through Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale.&lt;ref name = "construction" /&gt; According to Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, head of the eruv association, the purpose was to accommodate those living in Rockland County close to the border, near [[New York State Route 59]].&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; The boundaries had to be run through New Jersey due to the lack of a road along the state line.&lt;ref name = "eruv live" /&gt; Mahwah police noted construction being done on utility poles in May and made inquiries. On learning that Orange and Rockland had authorized the work, they provided police protection, for which the department was paid about $2,000 by the eruv fund. The work in Mahwah was complete by June.&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;{{cite news |title = Attorney: Mahwah PD supervised eruv installation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200615/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |archivedate = September 4, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the matter became generally known in mid-July, there was what local reporter Tom Nobile called a "firestorm of opposition" from local residents, with some expressing concerns that the eruv would allow Orthodox communities in Rockland County to expand into New Jersey.&lt;ref name = "construction"/&gt; Groups formed on [[social media]], including one named Mahwah Strong, in opposition to the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah residents voice opposition, support for eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170912230307/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |archivedate = September 12, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahwah Strong claimed 3,000 members within days; a founder, Robert Ferguson, stated that his group would act as a check and balance to ensure the township enforced its laws, and noted, "I don't view this as a hostile takeover of the town."&lt;ref name = "200 people"/&gt; Two hundred people gathered in a Mahwah park on July 22 to support the eruv's removal. An online petition to "Protect the Quality of Our Community in Mahwah", initiated by former township council member John Roth, reached 1,200 names before being taken down due to what Roth called inappropriate comments, made by some signers.&lt;ref name="200 people"&gt;{{cite news |title = 200 people meet to support removal of Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195157/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Mahwah Strong lost its [[Facebook]] page following an influx of comments deemed "hateful".&lt;ref name="Facebook page"/&gt;

==Municipal and public reaction==
[[File:Sam Braen Field.jpg|thumb|Mahwah tried to ban out-of-staters from its parks. Airmount Park shown; seen in 2018.]]

This was done prior to construction with the result that the eruv did not extend into Montvale.&lt;ref name = "200 people" /&gt; On July 18, Upper Saddle River's attorney sent a letter demanding the removal of the lechis that had been erected there,&lt;ref name="yeshiva"&gt;{{cite news |title = Orthodox Jewish community and Mahwah residents at war over orders to remove the eruv |url = https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1325047/mahwah-nj-orders-removal-jewish-communitys-eruv.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |newspaper = The Yeshiva World |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180214014517/https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1325047/mahwah-nj-orders-removal-jewish-communitys-eruv.html |archivedate = February 14, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a deadline of July 26, but the borough agreed to let them remain for the time being after two New York State residents filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] in Newark, requesting a [[temporary restraining order]] against the borough and Mayor Joanne Minichetti. The borough's agreement was in exchange for an undertaking from the eruv association not to expand the eruv, and the motion for a restraining order was withdrawn. The eruv was vandalized on July 26 and 27, requiring immediate repair work.&lt;ref name="usr"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usrtoday.org/2017/10/11/update-on-eruv-litigation |title = Update on eruv litigation |date = October 11, 2017 |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |publisher = Borough of [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011519/https://www.usrtoday.org/2017/10/11/update-on-eruv-litigation/ |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restraining"&gt;{{cite news |title = Plaintiffs withdraw request for restraining order in eruv dispute |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/07/29/restraining-order-sought-prevent-removal-eruv/521982001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 29, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170903130516/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/07/29/restraining-order-sought-prevent-removal-eruv/521982001/ |archivedate = September 3, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahwah's township engineer, Mike Kelly, sent a letter to the eruv association on July 21, taking a stance similar to Montvale's, and demanding the removal of the eruv by August 4. Mayor  Bill Laforet stated, "This sends a very strong message to those who choose to violate our sign ordinances."&lt;ref name = "yeshiva" /&gt;

On June 29, the Mahwah Township Council had passed an ordinance, effective July 27, barring nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks. Residents had complained that out-of-staters were flooding Mahwah's parks, sometimes by the busload. After the ordinance passed, but before it went into effect, Mahwah police chief James Batelli received many phone calls from residents asking that it be enforced against Orthodox Jews. He contacted the Bergen County Prosecutor, [[Gurbir Grewal]], for advice. On July 27, the date the ordinance was to go into effect, Grewal issued a directive ordering Mahwah police to disregard the ban, stating that the ban could lead to racial profiling, unlawful searches and seizures and the illegal targeting of Orthodox Jews.&lt;ref name="nj parks"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor: Mahwah park ban could illegally target Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |first = Svetlana |last = Shkolnikova |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913021311/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |archivedate = September 13, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Rob Hermansen, president of the township council, stated that that body would rework the ordinance to continue putting Mahwah residents first.&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor tells NJ police to ignore rule that may target Jews |url = http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |publisher = WPIX-TV |agency = Associated Press |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223075638/http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |archivedate = December 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mahwah Township Council met on the evening of July 27, it did so before an overflow crowd. Despite warnings from the township attorney not to discuss issues of religion, some did. Others complained of nonresidents crowding parks, and that they had been visited by people wanting to buy their homes. The lawyer for Mahwah Strong urged the council to enforce the law by requiring the takedown of the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"/&gt; Ferguson was quoted as saying at the meeting, "We do not not want these people living in our neighborhoods. We want them following the law."&lt;ref name = "have a talk" /&gt;

As the eruv controversy intensified, Mahwah and Montvale, as well as neighboring boroughs, enacted or made stricter ordinances restricting those making unsolicited offers to buy houses from knocking on doors. Municipal officials stated that this was being done because of the concerns of residents, who feared the Orthodox moving in would result in a population explosion, that the schools would suffer, and high-density housing built.

To a standing ovation from some 200 residents in attendance, the Mahwah council on August 10 unanimously voted to issue [[summons]]es because the eruv had not been taken down. Mayor Laforet, though, urged the council not to take this step, pointing to the large expense the unsuccessful eruv litigation had cost Tenafly, and advocated negotiation. In response to the council's action, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey group is a part) and several Orthodox Jews resident in Rockland County filed suit in federal court against Mahwah on August 11, and promised to defy any summonses.&lt;ref name="need to know"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |title = Here's what you need to know about the eruv dispute brewing in North Jersey |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Jerde |first = Sara |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170914185253/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |archivedate = September 14, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mahwah lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/09/15/n-y-group-sues-expand-eruv-upper-saddle-river/670790001/ |title = Orthodox Jewish group sues Mahwah over plan to issue eruv summonses |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |first2 = Svetlana |last2 = Shkolnikova |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Teaneck and [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], each in southeastern Bergen County and home to large communities of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their views at council meetings.

Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screenshot of the Teaneck council schedule online, urging members to mark their calendars with the dates.

==Litigation==
Following failed settlement negotiations and a closed-door council meeting on October 10, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association and individual plaintiffs sued Montvale on October 18, alleging that Mayor Ghassali's stop work order inhibited them in practicing their religion. They cited a 2015 statement from then-mayor Roger Fyfe, from when rumors of an eruv had first circulated, that an eruv was a simple accommodation and a matter in which the borough had only a slight part. The plaintiffs also alleged that Mahwah and Upper Saddle River were aware of the eruv construction, but had no problem with it until they gave in to a campaign of xenophobia and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Montvale"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale sued for blocking eruv expansion |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171020223732/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |archivedate = October 20, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Democratic candidate for governor, [[Phil Murphy]], accused the residents of Mahwah of causing an "overarching perception of anti-Semitism and discrimination".&lt;ref name = "Murphy" /&gt; According to Murphy, "When a Holocaust survivor at a public meeting is heckled, and then denounced as a fraud, there is a problem. When well-intentioned residents are disparaged as 'paid actors' for a 'Jewish money conspiracy scheme' there is a problem."&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news |title = Murphy slams 'anti-Semitic' rhetoric around Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171023235938/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |archivedate = October 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]], [[Christopher Porrino]], sued Mahwah and its council, alleging that by voting for the parks ban and for the summonses, they had violated the constitutional rights of Orthodox Jews. The case, filed in [[New Jersey Superior Court|state court]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], sought nullification of the council's actions, statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and the return of $3.5 million in state-provided Green Acres funds with which Mahwah had purchased and maintained parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks benefitting from the funds may not discriminate, including on the basis of religion or residency. Porrino stated, "To think that there are local governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws on the basis of some archaic, fear-driven and discriminatory mindset, is deeply disappointing and shocking to many, but it is exactly what we are alleging in this case. Of course, in this case we allege the target of the small-minded bias is not African-Americans, but Orthodox Jews. Nonetheless, the hateful message is the same."&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite press release |title = Attorney General Porrino announces state lawsuit charging Mahwah Township Council with excluding Orthodox Jews |publisher = Attorney General of New Jersey |date = October 24, 2017 |url = http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171026042437/http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |archivedate = October 26, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Laforet accused Council President Hermansen of fear-mongering and stoking passions, "His disgraceful behavior is now worsened by the severe potential financial penalties facing the township's taxpayer."&lt;ref name="second suit"&gt;{{cite news |title = New Jersey sues Mahwah over eruv, alleging discriminatory ordinance against Orthodox Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 24, 2017 |last = Racioppi |first = Dustin |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208133940/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the municipal election on November 7, Mahwah voters easily re-elected two anti-eruv council members, defeating challengers supported by Laforet.&lt;ref name="patch"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mayor Laforet says election results have no bearing on him |url = https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 9, 2017 |last = Hubbard |first = Daniel |work = Mahwah Patch |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083150/https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was removed from state to federal court by Mahwah on November 22 as it raised questions under [[United States Constitution|the federal constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format = PDF |title = Letter from Eric L.

In the Upper Saddle River case, on October 10, 2017, the eruv association moved for a  [[preliminary injunction]] allowing the eruv to remain pending the outcome of the litigation. In support, the association provided documentation showing that Mayor Minichetti had told the borough council about the proposed eruv in 2015, and the new sign ordinance had rapidly followed.&lt;ref name = "preliminary injunction"&gt;{{cite web |title = Notice of Motion for Preliminary Injunction |url = http://www.eruvlitigation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17cv5512_25.pdf |format = PDF |date = October 10, 2017 |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |author = Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP |via = EruvLitigation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the motion, filed on November 2, Upper Saddle River stated that the sign law was tightened because of a divisive municipal election in 2014, that had seen many signs. The borough argued that the lawsuit was premature, as the eruv association had not sought permission. It argued that it had not violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs; its sign ordinance was content-neutral, banning all signs of whatever sort, and thus the plaintiffs had not been discriminated against. It alleged that permission to erect the lechis from Orange and Rockland was insufficient; the eruv association also had to comply with local law, and in any event the communications company [[Verizon]] had joint use of the poles and had not been asked for consent. Upper Saddle River distinguished its situation from that of Tenafly, stating that in Tenafly, exceptions had been made to the sign ordinance, but in Upper Saddle River it had been strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="usr brief"&gt;{{cite web |title = Defendant Borough of Upper Saddle River's Memorandum of Law |url = https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |format = PDF |pages = 3–5 |publisher = Borough of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 2, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of December, Montvale Mayor Ghassali indicated that his borough was negotiating with the plaintiffs, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the federal lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Montvale negotiations"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale working to settle eruv lawsuit |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 28, 2017 |last = Nolan |first = Sarah |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104100021/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |archivedate = January 4, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements==
Murphy was elected governor in November and designated Bergen County Prosecutor Grewal as the new Attorney General. Thus, once they took office, opponents of Mahwah's position would hold powerful posts in the state capital of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and municipal officials began to have second thoughts about whether to fight the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah change"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah changes its mind |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 21, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |work = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212085109/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar "other matter" (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles.&lt;ref name = "Mahwah walk back" /&gt; The "other matter" language would have imitated the 2015 changes to the Upper Saddle River sign law which had followed Minichetti informing the borough council about the plans for the eruv, and was withdrawn, according to Hermansen, lest Mahwah's motives be misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="usr discrimination"&gt;{{cite news |title = Upper Saddle River sign ordinance targeted eruv, Orthodox Jewish group alleges |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 6, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171206125835/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |archivedate = December 6, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote to repeal the park ban was unanimous, with one council member absent. After the vote, Laforet called the ordinances "ill-advised" before being silenced by the council. He resumed outside the council chamber and disclosed that the members could have faced prosecution. "They are hiding from you that if they failed to do so, the Attorney General can come into Mahwah to press civil or criminal bias charges.

The Upper Saddle River lawsuit was scheduled for argument before Judge [[John Michael Vazquez]] of the federal court for New Jersey. When he convened that hearing on January 9, 2018, rather than hear the lawyers argue the positions set forth in the legal briefs, Judge Vazquez told them his views. He questioned whether the borough had consistently enforced the ordinance, as plaintiffs' lawyers had discovered a number of signs and even mailboxes attached to utility poles, that Upper Saddle River had not taken down. The judge voiced his skepticism that the 2015 sign ordinance had been passed because of a contentious municipal election the previous year, as the borough maintained, and indicated that he was inclined to believe it was passed because of the eruv. He urged Upper Saddle River to try to settle the case, and to do so in coordination with the other two municipalities—he was also presiding judge in those cases.&lt;ref name = "January 9 settlement"&gt;{{cite news |title = Judge urges Upper Saddle River to settle eruv litigation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2018/01/09/upper-saddle-river-urged-settle-eruv-litigation/1018844001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = January 9, 2018 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2018, the Mahwah council voted 5–2 to accept a negotiated settlement of the eruv litigation, despite  some residents who urged the council to fight all the way to the Supreme Court.

Montvale also undertook negotiations with the eruv association plaintiffs.

Montvale will pay the eruv association attorneys at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP $10,000 towards legal costs and be shielded from further lawsuits from it for two years. Yehudah Buchweitz, an attorney for the eruv association, stated: "Our lawsuit against Montvale was filed to permit an eruv in a small portion of Montvale, so families could enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond.

The '''AD–AS''' or '''aggregate demand–aggregate supply model''' is a [[macroeconomic model]] that explains [[price level]] and [[output (economics)|output]] through the relationship of [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]].

It is based on the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] presented in his work ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''. It is one of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of [[macroeconomics]], and is used by a broad array of economists, from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[monetarist]] supporters of [[laissez-faire]], such as [[Milton Friedman]], to [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] supporters of [[economic interventionism]], such as [[Joan Robinson]].

The conventional "aggregate supply and demand" model is, in actuality, a Keynesian visualization that has come to be a widely accepted image of the theory. The Classical supply and demand model, which is largely based on [[Say's law]]—that supply creates its own demand—depicts the aggregate supply curve as being vertical at all times (not just in the long-run)

==Modeling==
The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] model of the [[business cycle]]. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various [[exogeny|exogenous]] events will have on two variables:  real [[GDP]] and the [[price level]].  Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time).  The AD–AS model can be related to the [[Phillips curve]] model of wage or price inflation and unemployment. A special case is a horizontal AS curve which means the price level is constant. The AD curve represents the locus of equilibria in the [[IS–LM model]]. The two models produce the same results with a constant price level.

==Aggregate demand curve==
{{main|Aggregate demand}}
The AD (aggregate demand) curve is defined by the [[IS–LM model|IS–LM]] equilibrium income at different potential price levels. 
The downward sloping AD curve is derived from the [[IS–LM model]].
[[File:AS AD.png|thumb|IS–LM diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the interest rate plotted vertically]]
[[File:AS AD (2).png|thumb|AD–AS diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the price level plotted vertically]]
It shows the combinations of the price level and level of the output at which the goods and assets markets are simultaneously in equilibrium.
The above figure showing IS and LM curves, where LM curve shifts downward to the right to LM’ and thus shifting the new equilibrium to E’ where both goods and money market gets cleared. Now, the new output level Y’ correspond to the lower price level P’.
Thus a reduction in price, which is shown in the figure, leads to an increase in the equilibrium and spending.

The equation for the AD curve in general terms is:

: &lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{d}(\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1)&lt;/math&gt;

where Y is real [[GDP]], M is the nominal [[money supply]], P is the [[price level]], G is real [[government spending]], T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied, and Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve (exogenous influences on any component of spending) or the LM curve (exogenous influences on money demand).  The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending (meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction, aggregate demand changes in the same direction); the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it.

==Slope of AD curve==
The slope of AD curve reflects the extent to which the real balances change the equilibrium level of spending, taking both assets and goods markets into consideration.
An increase in real balances will lead to a larger increase in equilibrium income and spending, the smaller the interest responsiveness of money demand and the higher the interest responsiveness of investment demand.
An increase in real balances leads to a larger level of income and spending, the larger the value of multiplier and the smaller the income response of money demand.

This implies that:
The AD curve is flatter the smaller is the interest responsiveness of the [[demand for money]] and larger is the interest responsiveness of investment demand.
Also, the AD curve is flatter, the larger is the multiplier and the larger the income responsiveness of the demand for money.

==Effect of monetary expansion on the AD curve==
[[File:AD-AS model.png|thumb|Aggregate demand curve shifts rightward in case of a monetary expansion]]
An increase in the nominal money stock leads to a higher real money stock at each level of prices. In the asset market, the decrease in interest rates induces the public to hold higher real balances. It stimulates the aggregate demand and thereby increases the equilibrium level of income and spending.Thus, as we can see from the diagram, the aggregate demand curve shifts rightward in case of a monetary expansion.

==Aggregate supply curve==
{{main|Aggregate supply}}
The aggregate supply curve may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium. In either case, it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels. The aggregate supply curve (AS curve) describes for each given price level, the quantity of output the firms plan to supply.

The '''Keynesian aggregate supply curve''' shows that the AS curve is significantly horizontal implying that the firm will supply whatever amount of goods is demanded at a particular price level during an [[economic depression]]. The idea behind that is because there is unemployment, firms can readily obtain as much labour as they want at that current wage and production can increase without any additional costs (e.g. machines are idle which can simply be turned on). Firms' average costs of production therefore are assumed not to change as their output level changes. This provides a rationale for Keynesians' support for government intervention. The total output of an economy can decline without the price level declining; this fact, in conjunction with the Keynesian belief of wages being inflexible downwards, clarifies the need for government stimulus. Since wages cannot readily adjust low enough for aggregate supply to shift outward and improve total output, the government must intervene to accomplish this result. However, the Keynesian aggregate supply curve also contains a normally upward-sloping region where aggregate supply responds accordingly to changes in price level. The upward slope is due to the [[law of diminishing returns]] as firms increase output, which states that it will become marginally more expensive to accomplish the same level of improvement in productive capacity as firms grow. It is also due to the scarcity of natural resources, the rarity of which causes increased production to also become more expensive. The vertical section of the Keynesian curve corresponds to the physical limit of the economy, where it is impossible to increase output.

The '''classical aggregate supply curve''' comprises a short-run aggregate supply curve and a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run curve visualizes the total planned output of goods and services in the economy at a particular price level. The "short-run" is defined as the period during which only final good prices adjust and factor, or input, costs do not. The "long-run" is the period after which factor prices are able to adjust accordingly. The short-run aggregate supply curve has an upward slope for the same reasons the Keynesian AS curve has one: the law of diminishing returns and the scarcity of resources. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because factor prices will have adjusted. Factor prices increase if producing at a point beyond full employment output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply inwards so equilibrium occurs somewhere along full employment output. Monetarists have argued that demand-side expansionary policies favoured by Keynesian economists are solely inflationary. As the aggregate demand curve is shifted outward, the general price level increases. This increased price level causes households, or the owners of the [[factors of production]] to demand higher prices for their goods and services. The consequence of this is increased production costs for firms, causing short-run aggregate demand to shift back inwards. The theoretical ultimate result is inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanville |first=Alan |title=Economics From a Global Perspective |edition=Third |publisher=Glanville Books |year=2011 |page=224 |isbn=9780952474685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream AS-AD model contains both a long-run aggregate supply curve (LRAS) and a short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve essentially combining the classical and Keynesian models. In the short run wages and other resource prices are sticky and slow to adjust to new price levels. This gives way to the upward sloping SRAS. In the long-run, resource prices adjust to the price level bringing the economy back to a full employment output; along vertical LRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apeconreview.com/asad-model.html|title=AP Macroeconomics Review: AS-AD Model|last=Reed|first=Jacob|date=2016|website=APEconReview.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifts in aggregate supply curves===
The Keynesian model, in which there is no long-run aggregate supply curve and the classical model, in the case of the short-run aggregate supply curve, are affected by the same determinants. Any event that results in a change of production costs shifts the curves outwards or inwards if production costs are decreased or increased, respectively. Some factors which affect short-run production costs include: taxes and subsidies, price of labour (wages), and price of raw materials. These factors shift short-run curves ''exclusively''. Changes in the quantity and quality of labour and capital affect both long-run and short-run supply curves. A greater quantity of labour or capital corresponds to a lower price for both. A greater quality in labour or capital corresponds to a greater output per worker or machine.

The long-run aggregate supply curve of the classical model is affected by events that affect the [[potential output]] of the economy. Factors revolve around changes in the quality and quantity of factors of production.

==Fiscal and monetary policy under Classical and Keynesian cases==
Keynesian Case:
If there is a fiscal expansion i.e. there is an increase in the government spending or a cut in the taxes, it will shift the AD curve rightwards. The shift would then imply an increase in the equilibrium output and employment.

In the Classical case, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level of output. Firms will supply the equilibrium level of output whatever the price level may be.

Now, the fiscal expansion shifts the AD curve rightwards, thus leading to an increase in the demand for goods, but the firms cannot increase the output as there is no labour force which can be obtained.
As firms try to hire more labour, they bid up wages and their costs of production and thus they charge higher prices for the output.
The increase in prices reduces the real money stock and leads to an increase in the interest rates and reduction in spending.

The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is
:&lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \ \  P/P^{e}, \ \  Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;

where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), P&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge).  The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply.  The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices.

The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate.  In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation.  The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply
:&lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{s}(Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;

and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome.

==Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply==
The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right. Exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction.

===Shifts of aggregate demand===
The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would go up.  In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged.

Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve:
* An exogenous increase in consumer spending
* An exogenous increase in investment  spending on [[physical capital]]
* An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment
* An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services
* An exogenous increase in [[transfer payments]] from the government to the people
* An exogenous decrease in taxes levied
* An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries
* An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries

Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve:
* An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply
* An exogenous increase in the demand for money supply i.e. liquidity preference

===Shifts of aggregate supply===
The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase.
* An exogenous decrease in the wage rate
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress — improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output

The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right:
* An increase in population
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress

===Transition dynamics===
* Movement back to the steady state is fastest when the economy is furthest from its steady state.
* This means that as the aggregate supply is shocked by factors of production, it will move away from its steady state. In response, the supply will slowly shift back to the steady state equilibrium, first with a large reaction, then consequently smaller reactions until it reaches steady state. The reactions back to equilibrium are largest when furthest from steady state, and become smaller as they near equilibrium.

For example, a shock increase in the price of oil is felt by producers as an increase in the factors of production. This shifts the supply curve upward by raising expected inflation. This slows the adjustment of the AS curve back to its steady state. As the inflation slowly falls, so will the AS curve back to its steady state.

==Monetarism==
The modern quantity theory states that the price level is directly affected by the quantity of money.
Friedman is the recognized intellectual leader of an influential group of economists, called Monetarists, who emphasize the role of money and monetary policy in affecting the behaviour of output and prices.
Modern quantity theory also disagrees with the strict quantity theory in not believing that the supply curve is vertical in the short run.
Thus, Friedman and other monetarists made an important distinction between the short run and long run effects of changes in money. They said that in the long run money is more or less neutral. Changes in the nominal money stock have no real effects and only change prices. But in the short run, they argue that the monetary policy and changes in the money stock can have important real effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Amende honorable''' was originally a mode of punishment in France which required the offender, barefoot and stripped to his shirt, and led into a church or auditory with a torch in his hand and a rope round his neck held by the public executioner, to beg pardon on his knees of his God, his king, and his country; now used to denote a satisfactory apology or reparation.&lt;ref name="Nut"&gt;{{Nuttall|inline=1|title=Amende honorable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amende honorable forbade revenge.

The ''amende honorable'' was sometimes incorporated into a larger ritual of [[capital punishment]] (specifically the [[hanging, drawing and quartering#French "quartering"|French version of drawing and quartering]]) for [[parricide]]s and [[regicide]]s; this is described in the 1975 book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]], notably in reference to [[Robert-François Damiens]] who was condemned to make the ''amende honorable'' before the main door of the Church of Paris in 1757.

'''Ārjava''' (Sanskrit: आर्जव) literally means sincerity, straightness and non-hypocrisy.&lt;ref name=jsinha&gt;J Sinha, {{Google books|VCwmmWXJBqEC|Indian Psychology|page=142}}, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidas, {{oclc|1211693}}, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+arjava&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Arjava] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the ten [[Yamas]] in ancient Hindu and Jaina texts.&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"&gt;KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1164026419}}, Chapter 22, pages 173-176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''Ārjava'' means straightness, sincerity and harmony in one’s thought, words and actions towards oneself and towards others.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|Kane]] translates ''arjava'' as straightforwardness.&lt;ref&gt;PV Kane (1974), History of Dharmaśāstra: (ancient and Mediæval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol 2, Issue 1, {{oclc|134943}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is explained in ancient Indian texts as “self-restraint from hypocrisy", and "the absence of hypocrisy”. It is included as one of several ethical virtuous restraints in an individual's path to spirituality. The Maharashtrian poet Vāmana in Avigita, at xvi.1, posits ''arjava'' is a form of honesty and purity in a person, and an essential virtue so that one may treat everyone equally, whether that other is one’s child, wife, relative, friend, a stranger, someone hostile or oneself without any discrimination.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt;

The ethical concept of ''Arjava'' is synonymously referred to as ''Adambha'' (अदम्भ, composite word from अ+दम्भ). Adambha also means&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=adambha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Adambha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; non-deceitful, straightforwardness and sincerity. It is listed as a virtue in the Indian Epics.&lt;ref name=ianp/&gt;

==Literature==
Arjava is one of the ten yamas listed by [[Shandilya Upanishad|Śāṇḍilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"/&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|ISBN= 9781605066370|page=14|quote=&lt;br&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br&gt; दयार्जवं मिताहारः शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520018426|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn= 9780945497998 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the virtuous restraints (yamas) taught in ancient Indian texts. The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahiṃsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791439494}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; [[Mitahara|Mitāhāra]] (मितहार): measured diet, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.

In some texts, such as by [[Adi Sankara]], this virtue is called as ''bhavasamsuddhi'', and explained as purity of motive and freedom of mind from hypocrisy, both in one’s social conduct, as well as within oneself where one’s thoughts, words and actions resonate.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; It is considered as a virtue that empowers one to act and live without anxiety, anger, prejudice, inner conflict or confusion. It is also discussed in [[Bhagwad Gita]] in verse 17.16.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, page 649&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahabharata, in Book 12 Chapter 60, lists ''Adambha'' (non-hypocrisy) as a virtue along with ''Akrodha'' (non-anger), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness) and others.&lt;ref name=ianp&gt;Ian Proudfoot, Ahiṃsā and a Mahābhārata Story, Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University, {{ISBN|978-0731501434}}, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, in Chapter 278, the Epic explains how and why hypocrisy arises, suggesting that it is a derivative of the sin of covetousness, greed and attachment to superficial possessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b100.htm Shanti Parva] The Mahabharata, Section CCLXXIII, KM Ganguli (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's treatise on Yoga lists only five [[yamas]], which includes non-covetousness and non-possessiveness (''Asteya'' and ''Aparigraha'' respectively), but does not include ''Arjava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Woods | first =James Haughton (translator) | year =2003 | title = The yoga-system of Patañjali; or, The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind | url=https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft|publisher =Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-43200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asset-based egalitarianism''' is a form of [[egalitarianism]] which theorises that [[social equality|equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources, usually in the form of a [[Financial capital|capital]] grant provided at the [[age of majority]]. Names for the implementation of this theory in [[policy]] include '''universal basic capital''' and '''stakeholding''', and are generally synonymous within the equal opportunity egalitarian framework.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe, J 2004"&gt;Cunliffe, J &amp; Erreygers, G (2004) The Origins of Universal Grants: An Anthology of Historical Writings on Basic Capital and Basic Income&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==

The idea has been around since [[Thomas Paine]] (January 29, 1737 – June 8, 1809) in his work ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'' 1795, and complemented his other thesis of [[basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine, T (1795) Agrarian Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

Two independent schools of thought were developed on the subject, involving individuals from the [[American labor movement|American Labour Movement]] and scholars of the Belgian School.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe, J 2004" /&gt; However, the same reasoning (given by both schools) behind the basic capital proposal is the redistribution of wealth usually funded by an [[inheritance tax]] in order to provide a universal and unconditional sum of money (or capital assets) at the age of majority. From most authors, the intention was to create a nominal grant for everyone based on a deserved natural inheritance of the earth.

==Relationship with policy==

In the policy format, asset-based egalitarianism is usually seen as the opposite policy proposal of [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and his thesis of [[basic income]],&lt;ref&gt;Van Parijs, P (1995) Real Freedom for All: what if anything can justify capitalism?&lt;/ref&gt; but asset-based egalitarian proposals have received less academic attention. However, more recently the wave of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] politics has seen much more emphasis placed on [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] and [[equality of opportunity]] and has reopened an old debate.

Some famous recent work on the policy efficaciousness of universal basic capital or asset-based egalitarianism has been conducted by [[Bruce Ackerman]] and Anne Alstott in ''The Stakeholder Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-300-07826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this policy proposal, the method of funding the 'stake' was by means of a [[wealth tax]] and provides a sum of $80,000 for those reaching the age of majority.

In actual policy, [[Gordon Brown]] and the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] initiated the United Kingdom [[Child Trust Fund]], while in the [[United States]] the idea has been implemented in the form of [[Individual Development Accounts]] and argued for by Michael Sherraden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pegasus.xssl.net/~admin315/assets/files/reports/ABW.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923055039/http://pegasus.xssl.net/~admin315/assets/files/reports/ABW.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These remain the nearest practical examples.

One of the motivations of the related policy such as the Child Trust Fund is clear from this excerpt:
{{quotation|The account can give your child a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] as a young adult. It will help your child understand personal finance and the importance of saving for their future. The account belongs to them and when they turn 18, the money is theirs to use as they think best.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childtrustfund.gov.uk/templates/Page____1171.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==

Asset-based egalitarian policies, such as the Ackerman and Alstott proposals, are often criticised as not being egalitarian. Due to different people having different abilities and talents to utilise financial wealth, there is always a risk that those without formal financial education would alienate their own freedom by dissipating their capital or "stakeblowing". Stuart White argued that unless education corrected for this, there would be an inegalitarian outcome, as people fundamentally have different asset-management capacities.&lt;ref&gt;White, S (2006) “The Citizen’s Stake and Paternalism” in Ackerman, B et al. (eds) Redesigning Distribution&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Time preference]] and [[Deferred gratification]].

An '''associative entity''' is a term used in [[relational model| relational]] and [[entity–relationship model|entity–relationship]] theory. A relational database requires the implementation of a base relation (or base table) to resolve [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many relationships]]. A base relation representing this kind of entity is called, informally, an '''associative table'''.  [[Image:Associate_Entity.png|frame|An associative entity (using [[Peter Chen|Chen]] notation)]]

As mentioned above, associative entities are implemented in a database structure using associative tables, which are tables that can contain references to columns from the same or different database tables within the same database.

[[File:mapping_table_concept.png|right|Concept of a mapping table]]
An associative (or junction) table maps two or more tables together by referencing the primary keys of each data table. In effect, it contains a number of foreign keys, each in a many-to-one relationship from the junction table to the individual data tables. The PK of the associative table is typically composed of the FK columns themselves.

Associative tables are colloquially known under many names, including '''association table''', '''bridge table''', '''cross-reference table''', '''crosswalk''', '''intermediary table''', '''intersection table''', '''join table''', '''junction table''', '''link table''', '''linking table''', '''many-to-many resolver''', '''map table''', '''mapping table''', '''pairing table''', '''pivot table''' (as used incorrectly in [[Laravel]] - not to be confused with the correct use of [[pivot table | pivot table in spreadsheets]]), or  '''transition table'''.

==Using associative tables==

An example of the practical use of an associative table would be to assign permissions to users. There can be multiple users, and each user can be assigned zero or more permissions.  Individual permissions may be granted to one or more users. 

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserLogin varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    UserPassword varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    UserName varchar(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Permissions (
    PermissionKey varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    PermissionDescription varchar(500) NOT NULL
);

-- This is the junction table.
CREATE TABLE UserPermissions (
    UserLogin varchar(50) REFERENCES Users (UserLogin),
    PermissionKey varchar(50) REFERENCES Permissions (PermissionKey),
    PRIMARY KEY (UserLogin, PermissionKey)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Junction Table.svg|center|A visual depiction of the table schema described, with relationships indicated]]
{{-}}

A [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]]-statement on a junction table usually involves [[Join (SQL)|joining]] the main table with the junction table:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Users
JOIN UserPermissions USING (UserLogin);
&lt;/source&gt;

This will return a list of all users and their permissions.

[[Insert (SQL)|Inserting]] into a junction table involves multiple steps: first inserting into the main table(s), then updating the junction table.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
-- Creating a new User
INSERT INTO Users (UserLogin, UserPassword, UserName)
VALUES ('SomeUser', 'SecretPassword', 'UserName');

-- Creating a new Permission
INSERT INTO Permissions (PermissionKey, PermissionDescription)
VALUES ('TheKey', 'A key used for several permissions');

-- Finally, updating the junction
INSERT INTO UserPermissions (UserLogin, PermissionKey)
VALUES ('SomeUser', 'TheKey');
&lt;/source&gt;

Using foreign keys, the database will automatically dereference the values of the UserPermissions table to their own tables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">In [[intellectual history]] and the [[history of political thought]], the '''Cambridge School''' is a loose historiographical movement traditionally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]], where many of those associated with the School held or continue to hold academic positions, including [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], [[Peter Laslett]], [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], as well as [[David Runciman]] and [[Raymond Geuss]].

==Overview==
The Cambridge School can broadly be characterised as a [[historicism|historicist]] or [[contextualism|contextualist]] mode of interpretation, placing primary emphasis on the historical conditions and the intellectual context of the [[discourse]] of a given historical era, and opposing the perceived [[anachronism]] of conventional methods of interpretation, which it believes often distort the significance of texts and ideas by reading them in terms of distinctively modern understandings of social and political life. In these terms, the Cambridge School is 'idealist' in the sense that it accepts ideas as constitutive elements of human history in themselves, and hence contradicts social-scientific [[positivism]] in historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanheste|first=Jeroen|authorlink= |title=Guardians of the Humanist Legacy: The Classicism of T.S. Eliot's Criterion Network and Its Relevance to Our Postmodern World|url= |accessdate= |year=2007|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn= |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text often held as the original declaration of the principles of the School&lt;ref name="blackledge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge|first=Peter|authorlink= |title=Reflections on the Marxist Theory of History|url= |accessdate= |year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn= |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Quentin Skinner's 1969 article 'Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Skinner|first1=Quentin|year=1969|title=Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas|journal=History and Theory|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3–53|doi=10.2307/2504188|jstor=2504188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Skinner attacks what he describes as two "orthodoxies": "perennialism", the view that philosophers have always debated the same fundamental questions; and the notion that context is irrelevant to a historical understanding of texts, which can be read as self-standing material.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mark Bevir]]'s words, Skinner and his colleagues "defended the history of political theory against both reductionists who dismissed ideas as mere epiphenomena and canonical theorists who approached texts as timeless philosophical works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|editor1-last=Klosko|editor1-first=George|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Political Philosophy|chapter=Chapter 1. The Contextual Approach|page=14|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has been criticised on a number of fronts. On the one hand, historians working in more materialist contexts such as [[social history]] have criticised the school's focus on ideas.&lt;ref name="blackledge" /&gt; Christopher Goto-Jones has argued that the school has developed in an [[orientalism|orientalist]] direction by neglecting non-Western contributions to intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goto-Jones |first=Christopher |title=Re-politicising the Kyoto School as Philosophy |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative cultural studies''' is a contextual approach to the study of culture in a global and intercultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=October 32, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is placed on the theory, method, and application of the study process(es) rather than on the "what" of the object(s) of study.

==Overview==
In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of [[comparative literature]] are merged with selected tenets of the field of [[cultural studies]] (including [[cultural theory|culture theories]], (radical) [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], [[communication]] theories, and [[systems theories]]) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude [[textual analysis]] proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

A '''crash simulation''' is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] recreation of a destructive [[crash test]] of a [[car]] or a highway [[Traffic barrier|guard rail system]] using a [[computer simulation]] in order to examine the level of safety of the car and its occupants. Crash [[simulation]]s are used by [[automaker]]s during [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) analysis for [[crashworthiness]] in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) process of modelling new cars. During a crash simulation, the [[kinetic energy]], or energy of motion, that a [[vehicle]] has before the impact is transformed into [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] [[energy]], mostly by [[plastic deformation]] ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]) of the car body material ([[Body in White]]), at the end of the impact.

Data obtained from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a [[collision]] (and also [[pedestrian]]s hit by a car) against [[injury]]. Important results are the deformations (for example, [[steering wheel]] intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, [[passenger]]s) and the [[deceleration]]s (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal [[car safety]] [[regulations]]. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] and of passive safety devices ([[seat belts]], [[airbags]], shock absorbing [[dash boards]], etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.

== Origin ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PLANE CRASH1a.JPG|thumb|right|Simulation of an aircraft impact on a nuclear power plant (program HEMP-ESI)]] --&gt;
In the years 1970 attempts were made to simulate car crash events with [[non-linear]] spring-mass systems after [[calibration]], which require as an input the results of physical destructive laboratory tests, needed to determine the mechanical crushing behavior of each spring component of the modeled system.  "[[First principle]]" simulations like more elaborate finite element models, however, need only the definition of the structural geometry and the basic material properties ([[rheology]] of car body steel, glass, plastic parts, etc.) as an input to generate the numerical model.

The origins of industrial first principle computerized car crash simulation lie in [[military defense]], [[outer space]] and civil [[nuclear power plant]] applications. Upon presentation of a simulation of the accidental crash of a military [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] plane into a nuclear power plant on May 30, 1978 by [http://www.esi-group.com ESI Group] in a meeting organized by the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] (VDI) in [[Stuttgart]], car makers became alerted to the possibility of using this technology for the simulation of destructive car crash tests (Haug 1981).

[[Image:POLO1a.JPG|thumb|left|The first successful frontal full car crash simulation: a Volkswagen Polo collided with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h (ESI 1986).]]
In the following years, German car makers produced more complex crash simulation studies, simulating the crash behavior of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half car bodies in white ([[Body in White|BIW]]). These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers ([[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Opel]], [[Porsche]], and [[Volkswagen]]), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers were able to make efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behavior of the analyzed car body structure.

== Application ==
Crash simulations are used to investigate the [[safety]] of the car occupants during impacts on the front end structure of the car in a "[[head-on collision]]" or "frontal impact", the lateral structure of the car in a “[[side collision]]” or “side impact”, the rear end structure of a car in a "[[rear-end collision]]" or “rear impact”, and the roof structure of the car when it overturns during a "[[rollover]]". Crash simulations can also be used to assess injury to [[pedestrians]] hit by a car.

== Benefits ==
A crash simulation produces results without actual [[destructive testing]] of a new car model. This way, tests can be performed quickly and inexpensively in a computer, which permits optimization of the design before a real prototype of the car has been manufactured. Using a simulation, problems can be solved before spending time and money on an actual crash test. The great flexibility of [[Printing|printed]] output and [[graphical display]] enables designers to solve some problems that would have been nearly impossible without the help of a computer.

== Analysis ==
[[Image:Thin Shell FE.JPG|thumb|right|340px|A subdivision of the metal exterior of the car, called a finite element, is connected to nodes at each vertex.]] 
Large number of crash simulations use a method of analysis called the [[Finite Element Method]]. The complex problems are solved by dividing a surface into a large but still finite number of elements and determining the motion of these elements over very small periods of time. Another approach to crash simulations is performed by application of [[Macro Element Method]]. The difference between two mentioned above methodologies is that the structure in case of Macro Element Method consists of smaller number of elements. The calculation algorithm of structure deformation is based on experimental data rather than calculated from partial differential equations.
 
Pam-Crash started crash simulation and together with [[LS-DYNA]] is a software package which is widely used for application of Finite Element Method. This method allows detailed modeling of a structure, but the disadvantage lies in high processing unit requirements and calculation time. 
The Visual Crash Studio uses Macro Element Methodology. In comparison with FEM it has some modeling and boundary condition limitations but its application does not require advanced computers and the calculation time is incomparably smaller. Two presented methods complement each other. Macro Element Method is useful at early stage of the structure design process while Finite Element Method performs well at its final stages.

=== Structural analysis ===
In a typical crash simulation, the car body structure is analyzed using spatial [[discretization]], that is,  breaking up the continuous movement of the body in real time into smaller changes in position over small, discrete time steps. The discretization involves subdividing the surface of the constituent, thin, [[sheet metal]] parts into a large number (approaching one million in 2006) of [[quadrilateral]] or triangular regions, each of which spans the area between "nodes" to which its corners are fixed. Each element has mass, which is distributed as concentrated masses and as [[moment of inertia|mass moments of inertia]] to its connecting nodes. Each node has 6 kinematic [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]], that is,  one node can move in three linear directions under [[translation (physics)|translation]] and can [[rotation|rotate]] about three independent axes. The spatial [[coordinates]] (''x''), [[displacement (distance)|displacement]] (''u''), [[velocity]] (''v''), and [[acceleration]] (''a'') of each node is mostly expressed in a three-dimensional rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]] with axes ''X'',''Y'', and ''Z''.

If the nodes move during a crash simulation, the connected elements move, stretch, and bend with their nodes, which causes them to impart forces and [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] to their nodal connections. The forces and moments at the nodes correspond to the inertia forces and moments, caused by their translational (linear) and [[angular acceleration]]s and to the forces and moments transmitted by the [[strength of materials|resistance]] of the structural material of the connected elements as they deform. Sometimes, additional external [[structural loads]] are applied, like gravity loads from the self weight of the parts, or added loads from external masses.

The forces and moments of all nodes are collected into a [[column vector]] (or column matrix), and the time dependent [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (in dynamic equilibrium) can be written as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma} = \mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; 
where vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma}&lt;/math&gt;  (mass times acceleration vector) collects the inertia forces at the nodes, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; collects the external nodal loads, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; collects the internal resisting forces from the deformation of the material. ''M'' is a [[diagonal matrix]] of the nodal masses.  Each vector (''u'', ''v'', ''a'', ''F'', etc.) has [[dimension]] 6 times the total number of nodes in the crash model (about 6 million “[[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]” for every 1 million "nodes" in 3-D thin shell finite element models).

=== Time analysis ===
A crash simulation uses time discretization as well to separate the continuous changes in time into very small, usable segments. The dynamic [[equations of motion]] hold at all times during a crash simulation and must be integrated in time, ''t'', starting from an [[initial condition]] at time zero, which is just prior to the crash. According to the explicit [[finite difference]] [[time integration method]] used by most crash codes, the accelerations, velocities, and displacements of the body are related by the following equations.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}(\mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int})_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} = \mathbf{v}_{n-1/2} + \mathbf{a}_{n}\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = \mathbf{u}_n + \mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
In these equations the subscripts ''n''±1/2, ''n'', ''n''+1 denote past, present, and future times, ''t'', at half and full-time intervals with time steps &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

=== Solution ===
The above [[system of linear equations]] is solved for the accelerations, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the velocities, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the displacements, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, at each discrete point in time, ''t'', during the crash [[interval (time)|duration]]. This solution is trivial, since the mass matrix is diagonal. The computer time is proportional to the number of finite elements and the number of solution time steps. The stable solution time step, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, is limited for [[numerical stability]], as expressed by the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition]] (CFL), which states that “in any time-marching computer simulation, the time step must be less than the time for some significant action to occur, and preferably considerably less." In a crash simulation, the fastest significant actions are the acoustic signals that travel inside the structural material.

The solid elastic stress wave speed amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{E_0/\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial elastic modulus (before [[plastic deformation]]) of the material and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density. The largest stable time step for a given material is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = d_{min}\sqrt{\rho/E_0}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;d_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance between any two nodes of the numerical crash simulation model.

Since this distance can change during a simulation, the stable time step changes and must be updated continually as the solution proceeds in time. When using [[steel]], the typical value of the stable time step is about one [[microsecond]] when the smallest discrete node distance in the mesh of the finite element model is about 5 millimeters. It needs then more than 100,000 time intervals to solve a crash event that lasts for one tenth of a second. This figure is exceeded in many industrial crash models demanding optimized crash solvers with High-Performance Computing ([[High-performance computing|HPC]]) features, such as [[Array programming|vectorization]] and [[parallel computing]].

'''Curiosity''' (from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:curiositas#Latin|cūriōsitās]]'', from ''cūriōsus'' "careful, [[Diligence|diligent]], curious", akin to ''cura'' "care") is a quality related to inquisitive thinking such as [[exploration]], investigation, and [[learning]], evident by observation in [[human]]s and [[animal|other animals]].&lt;ref name="pmid13190171"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Berlyne DE. | title = A theory of human curiosity. | journal = Br J Psychol | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–91 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13190171 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1954.tb01243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13252149"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Berlyne DE. | title = The arousal and satiation of perceptual curiosity in the rat. | journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol. | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 238–46 | year = 1955 | pmid = 13252149 | doi=10.1037/h0042968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curiosity is heavily associated with all aspects of human development, in which derives the process of learning and desire to acquire knowledge and skill.&lt;ref&gt;Zuss, M. (2012) ''The Practice of Theoretical Curiosity''. New York, N.Y.: Springer Publishing. {{ISBN missing|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''curiosity'' can also be used to denote the behavior or [[emotion]] of being curious, in regard to the desire to gain knowledge or information. Curiosity as a behavior and emotion is attributed over millennia as the driving force behind not only human development, but developments in science, language, and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, H., Schneider, K., Henderson, B. (Eds.) (1994). ''Curiosity and Exploration''. New York, N.Y.: Springer Publishing. {{ISBN missing|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Curiosity..... what are they reading.jpg|thumb|Children peer over shoulders to see what their friends are reading.]]

Curiosity can be seen as an innate quality of many different species. It is common to [[human]] beings at all ages from [[infancy]]&lt;ref name="pmid10207585"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ofer G, Durban J | title = Curiosity: reflections on its nature and functions. | journal = Am J Psychother | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–51 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10207585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[adulthood]],&lt;ref name="pmid13190171"/&gt; and is easy to observe in many other [[animal]] species; these include [[ape]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[rodent]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid13252149"/&gt;  Early definitions cite curiosity as a motivated desire for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loewenstein | first1 = G | year = 1994 | title = The psychology of curiosity: a review and reinterpretation | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 116 | issue = 1| pages = 75–98 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.116.1.75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivational desire has been said to stem from a passion or an appetite for knowledge, information, and understanding.

These traditional ideas of curiosity have recently expanded to look at the difference between ''curiosity as the innate exploratory behavior'' that is present in all animals and ''curiosity as the desire for knowledge'' that is specifically attributed to humans.

== Theories ==
Like other desires and need states that take on an appetitive quality (e.g. food), curiosity is linked with exploratory behavior and experiences of reward. Curiosity can be described as positive emotions and acquiring knowledge; when one's curiosity has been aroused it is considered inherently rewarding and pleasurable. Discovering new information may also be rewarding because it can help reduce undesirable states of uncertainty rather than stimulating interest. Theories have arisen in attempts to further understand this need to rectify states of uncertainty and the desire to participate in pleasurable experiences of exploratory behaviors.

=== Curiosity-drive theory ===
Curiosity-drive theory relates to the undesirable experiences of "uncertainty". The reduction of these unpleasant feelings, in turn, is rewarding. This theory suggests that people desire coherence and understanding in their thought processes. When this coherence is disrupted by something that is unfamiliar, uncertain, or ambiguous, it is curiosity-drive that attempts to gather information and knowledge of the unfamiliar to restore coherent thought processes. Through this theory, the general concept dictates that curiosity is developed strictly out of the desire to make sense of unfamiliar aspects of one's environment through interaction of exploratory behaviors. Once understanding of the unfamiliar has been achieved and coherence has been restored, these behaviors and desires will subside.

Subsets of curiosity-drive theory differ on whether curiosity is a primary or secondary drive and if this curiosity-drive is originated due to one's need to make sense of and regulate their environment or if it is caused by an external stimulus.&lt;ref name="csun.edu"&gt;Edleman, S. 1997. Curiosity and Exploration. California State University, Northridge.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcpsy00h/students/explore.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230213048/http://www.csun.edu/~vcpsy00h/students/explore.htm |archivedate=2011-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Causes can range from basic needs that need to be satisfied (e.g. hunger, thirst) to needs in fear induced situations.&lt;ref name="csun.edu"/&gt; Each of these subset theories state that whether the need is primary or secondary curiosity is developed from experiences that create a sensation of uncertainty or perceived unpleasantness. Curiosity then acts as a means in which to dispel this uncertainty. By exhibiting curious and exploratory behavior, one is able to gain knowledge of the unfamiliar and thus reduce the state of uncertainty or unpleasantness. This theory, however, does not address the idea that curiosity can often be displayed even in the absence of new or unfamiliar situations.&lt;ref name="litman"&gt;{{cite journal

Take the example of a human toddler who, if bored in his current situation devoid of arousing stimuli, will walk about until something interesting is found. The observation of curiosity even in the absence of novel stimuli pinpoints one of the major shortcomings in the curiosity-drive model.

=== Optimal-arousal theory ===
Optimal-arousal theory developed out of the need to explain the desire for some to seek out opportunities to engage in exploratory behaviors without the presence of uncertain or ambiguous situations. Optimal-arousal theory attempts to explain this aspect of curiosity by suggesting that one can be motivated to maintain a pleasurable sense of arousal through these exploratory behaviors.

The concept of optimal-arousal of curiosity suggests that the desire is to maintain an optimal level of arousal. If the stimulus is too intensely arousing, a "back-away" type behavior is engaged. In contrast, if the environment is boring and lacks excitement, exploratory behavior will be engaged until something optimally arousing is encountered. In essence, there is an intrinsic motivation to search for a perfect balance of arousal states.&lt;ref name = litman /&gt; This idea attempts to address the observed behaviors of curiosity even in the absence of uncertain or unfamiliar situations. While optimal-arousal theory addresses some discrepancies within curiosity-drive theory, there seems to be a distinctive counter-intuitiveness about their designs. For example, if there is an ideal state of curiosity that should be maintained, then gaining new knowledge to eliminate that state of curiosity would be counter-productive.&lt;ref name="csun.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name = litman /&gt;

=== Integration of the reward pathway into theory ===
Taking into account the shortcomings of both curiosity-drive and optimal-arousal theories, attempts have been made to integrate neurobiological aspects of [[Reward system|reward]], wanting, and pleasure into a more comprehensive theory for curiosity. Research suggests that the act of wanting and desiring new information directly involves [[mesolimbic pathway]]s of the brain that directly account for [[dopamine]] activation. The use of these pathways and dopamine activation may account for the assigning of value to new information and then interpreting as reward.&lt;ref name="csun.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=Vincent D.|last2=Tran|first2=Valery L.|last3=Turchi|first3=Janita|last4=Averbeck|first4=Bruno B.|title=Dopamine modulates novelty seeking behavior during decision making|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=2014|volume=128|issue=4|pages=1–11|pmid=24911320|doi=10.1037/a0037128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kakade|first1=Sham|last2=Dayan|first2=Peter|title=Dopamine: Generalization and bonuses|journal=Neural Networks|date=2002|volume=15|issue=4–6|pages=549–559.|pmid=12371511|url=https://zenodo.org/record/890565|doi=10.1016/s0893-6080(02)00048-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183503/https://zenodo.org/record/890565|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of neurobiology can accompany curiosity-drive theory in motivating exploratory behavior.

== Role of neurological aspects and structures ==
Although the phenomenon of curiosity is widely regarded, its root causes are  relatively unknown beyond theory. However, recent studies have provided some insight into the neurological mechanisms that make up what is known as the [[reward pathway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-08-04/how-curiosity-changes-your-brain |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804215305/http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-08-04/how-curiosity-changes-your-brain |archivedate=2017-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may impact characteristics associated with curiosity, such as [[learning]], [[memory]], and [[motivation]]. Due to the complex nature of curiosity, research that focuses on specific neural processes with these characteristics can help create a better understanding the phenomenon of curiosity as a whole. The following are characteristics of curiosity and their links to neural aspects that can be thought of as essential in creating exploratory behaviors:

===Motivation and reward===

[[File:Dopamine Pathways.png|thumb|Dopamine Pathway in the Brain]]
The drive to learn new information or perform some action is often initiated by the anticipation of [[Reward system|reward]]. In this way, the concepts of [[motivation]] and [[Reward system|reward]] are naturally tied to the notion of curiosity.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

This idea of [[Reward system|reward]] is defined as the positive reinforcement of an action that encourages a particular behavior by using the [[emotion]]al [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s of relief, pleasure, and satisfaction that correlate with [[happiness]]. Many areas in the brain are used to process reward and come together to form what is called the reward pathway. In this pathway many [[neurotransmitters]] play a role in the activation of the reward sensation- including [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]] and [[opioid]] chemicals.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Dopamine is linked to the process of curiosity, as it is responsible for assigning and retaining reward values of information gained. Research suggests higher amounts of dopamine is released when the reward is unknown and the stimulus is unfamiliar, compared to activation of dopamine when stimulus is familiar.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==== Nucleus accumbens ====
The nucleus accumbens is a formation of neurons and is important in reward pathway activation. As previously mentioned, the reward pathway is an integral part in the induction of curiosity. The release of dopamine in investigating response to novel or exciting stimuli.  The fast dopamine release observed during childhood and adolescence is important in development, as curiosity and exploratory behavior are the largest facilitators of learning during early years.

In addition, the sensation pleasure of "liking" can occur when [[opioids]] are released by [[nucleus accumbens]]. This helps someone evaluate the unfamiliar situation or environment and attach value to the novel object. These processes of both wanting and liking play a role in activating the [[reward system]] of the brain, and perhaps in the stimulation of curious or information-seeking tendencies as well.&lt;ref name = litman /&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thewick /&gt;

====Caudate nucleus====
The [[caudate nucleus]], is a region of the brain that is highly responsive to dopamine. The caudate nucleus is another component of the reward pathway. Research has suggested the role of the caudate nucleus anticipates the possibility of and is in anticipation of reward of exploratory behavior and gathered information, thus contributing to factors of curiosity.&lt;ref name=Thewick /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Itch of Curiosity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LEHRER|first1=JONAH|title=The Itch of Curiosity|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/the-itch-of-curiosity/|website=wired.com|publisher=Wired|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724023705/http://www.wired.com/2010/08/the-itch-of-curiosity/|archivedate=24 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anterior cortices ====
Regions of the anterior cortices correspond to both conflict and arousal and, as such, seem to reinforce certain exploratory models of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Jepma, M. 2012"&gt;Jepma, M., Verdonschot, R., van Steenbergen, H., Rombouts, S., &amp; Nieuwenhuis, S. (2012). Neural mechanisms underlying the induction and relief of perceptual curiosity. Frontiers In Behavioral Neuroscience, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cortisol ====
[[Cortisol]] is a chemical known for its role in stress regulation. However, cortisol may also be associated with curious or exploratory behavior. Findings in recent studies suggesting the role of cortisol with curiosity support the idea of optimal arousal theory. It is suggested the release of a small amount cortisol causing stress encourages curious behavior, while too much stress can initiate a "back away" response.&lt;ref name="The Itch of Curiosity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karen | first1 = J. | last2 = Kimberly | first2 = L. | last3 = Christine | first3 = L. | last4 = Alan | first4 = F. | last5 = Steven | first5 = E. | last6 = David | first6 = M. | year = 2007 | title = Early life stress and novelty seeking behavior in adolescent monkeys | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 327 | issue = 7| pages = 85–792 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.05.008 | pmc = 2716798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attention===
[[Attention]] is important to the understanding of curiosity because it directly correlates with one's abilities to selectively focus and concentrate on particular stimuli in the surrounding environment. As there are limited cognitive and sensory resources to understand and evaluate various stimuli, attention allows the brain to better focus on what it perceives to be the most important or relevant of these stimuli. Individuals tend to focus their energies on stimuli that are particularly stimulating or engaging. Indicating that the more attention a stimulus garners, the more frequent one's energy and focus will be directed towards that stimulus. This idea suggests an individual will focus their attention on new or unfamiliar stimuli in an effort to better understand or make sense of the unknown over the more familiar or repetitive stimuli. Creating the idea that curiosity demands attention.&lt;ref name = Zola/&gt;

====Striatum====
The [[striatum]], is a part of the brain which coordinates motivation with body movement. It would seem natural that the striatum plays a role in attention and reward anticipation, both of which are important in the provocation of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Jepma, M. 2012"/&gt;

==== Precuneus ====
The [[precuneus]] is a region of the brain that is involved in attention, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing. There has been a correlation found between the amount of grey matter in the precuneus and levels of curious and exploratory behaviors; suggesting that the precuneus density has an influence on levels of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimberley | first1 = A. | last2 = Francys | first2 = S. | last3 = Chet | first3 = C. | year = 2012 | title = Curious monkeys have increased gray matter density in the precuneus | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 518| issue = 2| pages = 172–175 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.05.004 | pmid=22579821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory and learning===
[[Memory]] plays an important role in the understanding of curiosity. If curiosity is the desire to seek out and understand unfamiliar or novel stimuli, one's memory is important in determining if the stimuli is indeed unfamiliar.

Memory is the process by which the brain can store and access information. In order to determine if the stimulus is novel, an individual must remember if the stimulus has been encountered before. Thus, memory plays an integral role in dictating the level of novelty or unfamiliarity, and the level of need for curiosity.

It can also be suggested that curiosity can affect memory. As previously mentioned, stimuli that are novel tend to capture more of our attention. Additionally, novel stimuli usually have a reward value associated with them, the anticipated reward of what learning that new information may bring. With stronger associations and more attention devoted to a stimulus, it is probable that the memory formed from that stimulus will be longer lasting and easier to recall, both of which facilitate better [[learning]].

==== Hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus====
The [[hippocampus]] is important in memory formation and recall and therefore instrumental in determining the novelty of various stimuli.&lt;ref name="pmid19755107"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Saab BJ, Georgiou J, Nath A, Lee FJ, Wang M, Michalon A, Liu F, Mansuy IM, Roder JC | title = NCS-1 in the dentate gyrus promotes exploration, synaptic plasticity, and rapid acquisition of spatial memory. | journal = Neuron | volume = 63 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–56 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19755107 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests the hippocampus is involved in generating the underlying motivation to explore for the purpose of learning.&lt;ref name="pmid13252149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21460835"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sahay A, Scobie KN, Hill AS, O'Carroll CM, Kheirbek MA, Burghardt NS, Fenton AA, Dranovsky A, Hen R | title = Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation. | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | issue = 7344 | pages = 466–70 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21460835 | doi = 10.1038/nature09817 | pmc=3084370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23237312"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Leussis MP, Berry-Scott EM, Saito M, Jhuang H, de Haan G, Alkan O, Luce CJ, Madison JM, Sklar P, Serre T, Root DE, Petryshen TL | title = The ANK3 Bipolar Disorder Gene Regulates Psychiatric-Related Behaviors That Are Modulated by Lithium and Stress. | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 7 | pages = 683–90 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23237312 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.10.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[parahippocampal gyrus]] (PHG), the area of grey matter surrounding the hippocampus, has recently been implicated in the process of curiosity. This finding suggests that the PHG may be involved in the amplification of curiosity more so than the primary induction of curiosity.&lt;ref name = Thewick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Min Jeong | first1 = K. | last2 = Ming | first2 = H. | last3 = Krajbich | first3 = I.

==== Amygdala ====
The [[amygdala]], often is associated with emotional processing, particularly for the emotion of fear, as well as memory. It is suggested the amygdala is important in processing emotional reactions towards novel or unexpected stimuli and the induction of exploratory behavior. This implies a potential connection between curiosity levels and the amygdala. However, more research is needed on direct correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montgomery | first1 = K | year = 1955 | title = The Relation Between Fear Induced By Novel Stimulation and Exploratory Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 254–260 | doi=10.1037/h0043788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early development ==

Piaget is considered to be the most influential child researcher. He argued that babies and children are constantly trying to make sense of their reality and that it contributed to their intellectual development. According to Piaget, children develop hypotheses, conduct experiments and then reassess their hypotheses depending on what they observe. Piaget was the first to closely document children's actions and interpret them as consistent, calculated effort to test and learn about their environment.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;Engel, S. 2011. Children’s need to know: Curiosity in schools. Harvard Educational Review.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1268822/Children_s_Need_to_Know_Curiosity_in_Schools |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710014622/http://www.academia.edu/1268822/Children_s_Need_to_Know_Curiosity_in_Schools |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no universally accepted definition for curiosity in children. Most research on curiosity has been focused on adults and which typically used self-report measures are inappropriate and inapplicable for studying children. Curiosity is mostly thought of as attributable to a mature person and is characterized in young children as a fledgling feature of their outlook on the world.&lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"&gt;Jirout, J. &amp; Klahr, D. 2012. Children’s scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~klahr/pdf/curiosity_dr_finalrev.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082849/http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~klahr/pdf/curiosity_dr_finalrev.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploratory behaviour is commonly observed in children and is associated with their curiosity development. Several studies look at children's curiosity by simply observing their interaction with novel and familiar toys.&lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;
 
There has been evidence found of a relationship between the anxiety children might feel and their curiosity. One study found that object curiosity in 11-year-olds was negatively related to psychological maladjusted so children who exhibit more anxiety in classroom settings engaged in less curious behaviour. It has also been suggested that certain aspects of classroom learning is dependent on curiosity which can be affected by students' anxiety .&lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;

Other measures of childhood curiosity have used exploratory behaviour as a basis but differing on how which parts of this behaviour is best to focus on. Some studies have examined children's preference for complexity/the unknown as a basis for their curiosity measure; others have relied on novelty preference as their basis.&lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;

Researchers have also looked at the relationship between a child's reaction to surprise and curiosity. It has been suggested that children are further motivated to learn when dealing with uncertainty. It is argued that their reactions to not having their expectations met would fuel their curiosity more than the introduction of a novel or complex object would.&lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;

==Ethicality==
There is a widely held belief that children's curiosity becomes discouraged throughout the process of formal education: "Children are born scientists. From the first ball they send flying to the ant they watch carry a crumb, children use science's tools—enthusiasm, hypotheses, tests, conclusions—to uncover the world's mysteries. But somehow students seem to lose what once came naturally." &lt;ref name="psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;

[[Sir Ken Robinson]] discusses a similar phenomenon in his [[TED Talk]] titled "Do schools kill creativity?" When curiosity in young people leads to knowledge-gathering it is widely seen as a positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Robert|title=The Development of Spatial Cognition|date=2013|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; However curiosity according to some researchers is also at times seen as dangerous, for instance when concerns arise around opposite-sex [[sibling]]s [[roomsharing|sharing a room]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baughner|first1=Sherene|title=Archaeology and Preservation of Gendered Landscapes|date=2010|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact from disease ==

[[File:Alzheimer's disease brain comparison.jpg|thumb|Left: normal brain. Right: AD afflicted brain. Severe degeneration of areas implicated in curiosity]]

Different [[neurodegenerative disease]]s or other psychological disorders can affect various characteristics of curiosity, for instance [[Alzheimer's disease]]'s effects on memory or [[depression (mood)|depression]] on motivation and reward. [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that directly affects the capability and capacity for memory. Depression is a mood disorder that is characterized by a lack of interest in one's environment and feelings of sadness or hopelessness. 
A lack of curiosity for novel stimuli might also be used as a potential predictor for these and other illnesses.&lt;ref name = Zola&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = Z. | last2 = Cecelia | first2 = M. | last3 = Allan | first3 = L. | last4 = James | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Predicting the onset of Alzheimer's disease with a behavioral task | url = | journal = Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = S549 | doi = 10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.1549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morbid curiosity==
{{Redirect|Morbid curiosity|the magazine|Morbid Curiosity (magazine)}}
[[File:Accident Nehoda Uherský Brod.jpg|thumb|A crowd mills around the site of a car accident in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1980.]]

A '''morbid curiosity''' exemplifies an aspect of curiosity that can be seen as focused on objects of [[death]], [[violence]], or any other event that may cause harm physically or emotionally.

The idea of morbid curiosity typically is described as having an addictive quality. This addictive aspect of the need to understand or make sense of topics that surround harm, violence or death can be attributed to the idea of one's need to relate unusual and often difficult circumstances to a primary emotion or experience of their own, described as [[meta-emotions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zuckerman|first=Marvin|author2=Patrick Litle|title=Personality and Curiosity About Morbid and Sexual Events|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=1986|volume=7|issue=1|pages=49–56|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(86)90107-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding these difficult circumstances dates back to [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], stating "enjoy contemplating the most precise images of things whose sight is painful to us".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==State and trait curiosity ==
There are two distinct classifications of types of curiosity: '''state''' and '''trait curiosity'''. Both of these types determine whether curiosity comes from within or outside of a person. State curiosity is external such as wondering why things happen for the sake of just curiousness, for example, wondering why most stores open at 8 a.m. This type of curiosity tends to be the most relatable for people on a day-to-day basis since state curiosity relates to high levels of reward. On the other hand, trait curiosity relates to people who are interested in learning. Generally, it could be trying out a new sport or food, or traveling to a new unknown place. One can look at curiosity as the urge that draws people out of their comfort zones and fears as the agent that keeps them within those zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity2.htm|title=How Curiosity Works|author=|date=28 January 2010|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918221137/http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity2.htm|archivedate=18 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic citizenship''' can be used to represent both the economic contributions requisite to become a citizen as well as the role in which one's economic standing can influence his or her rights as a citizen. The relationship between economic participation and citizenship can be considered a contributing factor to increasing inequalities and unequal representation of different socioeconomic classes within a country.

== Republican notions of citizenship ==
The republican model of citizenship emphasizes one’s active participation in civil society as a means of defining his or her citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/citizenship/ "Citizenship (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)." Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 13 Oct. 2006. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially used to describe citizenship in ancient Greece, the republican notion focuses on how political participation is linked with one’s indent as a citizen, stemming from Aristotle’s definition of citizenship as the ability to rule and be ruled.

In relation to economic citizenship, the civil participation discussed by [[Aristotle]] can be described as economic participation so critical to the capitalist system. Defining one’s ability to be a full citizenship by his or her economic participation will establish a variegated system of citizenship in which those who can contribute most to the economy will be better represented and have a broader range of rights than those who cannot contribute as much. Variegated citizenship represents the concept that those within a different regime or status receive different levels of rights and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Aihwa. Flexibile Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality. Durham: Duke University Press, 1999. 217. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic citizenship in theory ==
[[T. H. Marshall]] acknowledges this concept in his discussion on the relationships between social class, capitalism and citizenship. He argues that capitalism is reliant upon social classes which directly relates to differentiated concepts of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, T. H. "Citizenship and Social Class." The Citizenship Debates: a Reader. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1998. 93–111. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Alice Kessler-Harris]] discusses the relationship between one’s ability to labor, and his or her right to equal wages as a component of citizenship. Her central argument addresses how denying a woman the right to labor and equal wages limits her identity as a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. "In Pursuit of Economic Citizenship," Social Politics, vol. 10, no. 2 (summer 2003): 157–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments by both of these theorists contribute to the notion of economic citizenship because they highlight both how economic standing and participation can be linked to one’s identity and privileges as a citizen.

== Citizenship by investment ==
{{main|Immigrant investor programs}}
Citizenship-by-investment enables individuals to acquire an additional [[citizenship]] by making an exceptional economic contribution to another country. This can be done by successfully completing a citizenship-by-investment program (also referred to as [[immigrant investor programs]]). Most of these programs are structured to ensure that the investment contributes to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the country in which they wish to reside or belong to. It is more often more about making an economic contribution than just an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biznews.com/undictated/2016/06/30/how-to-get-a-second-passport-citizenship-by-investment-is-booming/|title=How to get a second passport: "Citizenship by investment" is booming - BizNews.com|date=2016-06-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs must be run in a manner which is legal and transparent, and in keeping with the [[constitution]] of the nation offering citizenship. This ideally should prevent corruption at the same time as giving the individual obtaining citizenship a sound legal right to their new citizenship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook, 5th Edition|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0992781859|location=|pages=xxii-xxiv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries are currently able to offer investors citizenship or residence in return for an economic investment. This is usually in the form of requiring a substantial investment, coupled with compliance, residence and language requirements, among others. These countries are very selective in the type of individual they will allow to gain citizenship, however these individuals are more often than not motivated by more than just capital gains, and are looking to invest in a country more substantially from a family, social or cultural perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifcreview.com/restricted.aspx?articleId=9238&amp;areaId=64|title=IFC Review - The Global Citizen|website=www.ifcreview.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals who bring their family with them as dependents commonly contribute to the economy in a variety of ways, including paying for private schooling, purchasing real estate, extending their business and creating employment. Previously, the majority of countries with citizenship-by-investment programs were located in the [[Caribbean]], for example [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Dominica]]. More recently in the [[European Union]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] have both developed successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-02-01/local-news/120-million-generated-through-IIP-scheme-income-for-2016-estimated-at-80-million-6736152648|title=€120 million generated through IIP scheme, income for 2016 estimated at €80 million  - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/x/507782/Investment+Immigration/CySECs+Consultation+Report+For+Application+And+Adherence+Of+Articles+61+62+Of+The+Prevention+Suppression+Of+Money+Laundering|title=Cyprus Citizenship By Investment Remains Preferred Citizenship In Europe - Immigration - Cyprus|website=www.mondaq.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that each year, hundreds of wealthy people spend a collective USD 2 billion to add a second or third passport to their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27674135|title=Where is the cheapest place to buy citizenship? - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, countries may offer certain options to secure a [[permanent residency|permanent residence]]. Examples of countries offering such residence programs are the [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[Portugal]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://best-citizenships.com/countries.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible advantages of citizenship-by-investment ==
* Better quality of life — Citizenship-by-investment programs often provide individuals with the ability to relocate permanently to another country to improve many aspects of lifestyle
* Mobility — A second, or even third, passport from a country with a high level of [[Henley &amp; Partners Visa Restrictions Index|visa-free access]] gives an individual the ability to travel widely without time-consuming visa application processes
* Security — Securing the option to [[permanent residency|permanently reside]] or retire in a safe country. This alternative passport, most likely from a peaceful country, is critical when travelling and in times of political unrest, civil war, terrorism and other situations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=The Passport King|last=Clenfield|first=Jason|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Education — Provide your children with the ability to live, work, and study in multiple countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://next.ft.com/content/155936ec-2728-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89|title=Citizenship for sale to the wealthy|last=Houlder|first=Vanessa|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial planning — An [[Multiple citizenship|alternative citizenship]] offers more privacy and economic security across banking and investment portfolios. Investors also enjoy tax breaks and the possibility of improved personal and corporate tax exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.za/top-benefits-of-citizenship-by-investment-programmes/|title=Top benefits of citizenship by investment programmes|date=2015-12-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible disadvantages of citizenship-by-investment ==
* The time it takes to complete the process differs between countries and programs, and this can also be delayed by the time it takes the applicant to submit all the necessary documentation. For example, the time to citizenship for Cyprus is as little as 90 days, while Malta and Antigua and Barbuda take between three and six months. To qualify for citizenship in Canada, the applicant has to be physically present for four years in a six-year period&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The level of investment required also varies between countries and programs. For example, Caribbean citizenship-by-investment programs require less of an investment than those programs in the EU. In Dominica the minimum investment required is USD 200,000, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis the minimum investment required is USD 400,000 in real estate, while Malta requires USD 870,000 and Cyprus USD 2,875,000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Governments may change their policies or requirements at any time, or increase the investment amount without much notice. Applicants who have already submitted their documents may have to make the necessary changes to still qualify for the programs
* Generally, citizenship-by-investment programs have come under much scrutiny over the years, over concerns over a lack of transparency and accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nearshoreamericas.com/citizenship-investment-programs-caribbean-fdi/|title=The High Price of 'Citizenship by Investment' in the Caribbean - Nearshore Americas: Premium Intelligence and Better Outcomes in Latin America Outsourcing|date=2014-09-09|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain governments may limit or prohibit the use of [[dual-citizenship]].

'''Energy-efficient landscaping''' is a type of [[Landscape architecture|landscaping]] designed for the purpose of [[energy conservation|conserving energy]]. There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.

Design techniques include:
* Planting [[trees]] for the purpose of providing [[shade (shadow)|shade]], which reduces cooling costs.
* Planting or building [[windbreak]]s to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss.
* Wall sheltering, where [[shrubbery]] or vines are used to create a windbreak directly against a wall.
* [[Earth sheltering]] and positioning buildings to take advantage of natural landforms as windbreaks.
* [[Green roof]]s that cool buildings with extra [[thermal mass]] and [[evapotranspiration]].
* Reducing the [[heat island effect]] with pervious paving, high [[albedo]] paving, shade, and minimizing paved areas.
* Site lighting with full cut off fixtures, light level sensors, and high efficiency fixtures

Energy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce [[greenwaste]] [[hauling]], [[hand tool]]s instead of gasoline-powered, and also may involve using [[drought-resistant]] plantings in [[arid]] areas, [[buy local|buying stock from local growers]] to avoid energy in [[transportation]], and similar techniques.

'''Eudaimonia'''  ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]] {{IPA-el|eu̯dai̯moníaː|}}), sometimes [[anglicized]] as '''eudaemonia''' or '''eudemonia''' {{IPAc-en|j|uː|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|i|ə}}, is a Greek word commonly translated as [[happiness]] or [[welfare]]; however, "human [[flourishing]] or [[prosperity]]" has been proposed as a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Citing a book without a page number , making it impractical for others to verify, does not fulfill Wikipedia's requirement for verifiability|date=April 2018}} Etymologically, it consists of the words "''eu''" ("good") and "''[[daemon (mythology)|daimōn]]''" ("spirit"). It is a central concept in [[Aristotelian ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], along with the terms "[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]", most often translated as "[[virtue]]" or "excellence", and "[[phronesis]]", often translated as "practical or ethical wisdom".&lt;ref name=twsJun5e&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosalind Hursthouse|title=Virtue Ethics|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But although modern virtue ethics does not have to take the form known as "neo-Aristotelian", almost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient Greek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it. These are areté (excellence or virtue) phronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia (usually translated as happiness or flourishing.) As modern virtue ethics has grown and more people have become familiar with its literature, the understanding of these terms has increased, but it is still the case that readers familiar only with modern philosophy tend to misinterpret them.|date=July 18, 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.

Discussion of the links between virtue of character (''ēthikē aretē'') and happiness ''(eudaimonia)'' is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle&lt;ref name=twsJun5a&gt;{{cite news|author=Verena von Pfetten|title=5 Things Happy People Do|publisher=''Huffington Post''|quote=But researchers now believe that eudaimonic well-being may be more important. Cobbled from the Greek eu ("good") and daimon ("spirit" or "deity"), eudaimonia means striving toward excellence based on one's unique talents and potential—Aristotle considered it to be the noblest goal in life. In his time, the Greeks believed that each child was blessed at birth with a personal daimon embodying the highest possible expression of his or her nature. One way they envisioned the daimon was as a golden figurine that would be revealed by cracking away an outer layer of cheap pottery (the person's baser exterior). The effort to know and realize one's most golden self—"personal growth," in today's vernacular—is now the central concept of eudaimonia, which has also come to include continually taking on new challenges and fulfilling one's sense of purpose in life.|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/04/5-things-happy-people-do_n_124002.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.&lt;ref name="Klein2012"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Klein |year=2012 |title=Reason, Religion, and Natural Law: From Plato to Spinoza |publisher=OUP USA |isbn=9780199767175 |lccn=2012001316 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONF3OLtRx2kC&amp;pg=PA63 |pages=63–64 |quote=According to Irwin, the Stoic thesis that loss and tragedy do not affect an agent's welfare does not imply that a rational agent has no reason to regret such a loss, for on Irwin's account of Stoic theory the life of virtue and happiness and the life that accords with nature constitute independently rational aims... A number of considerations tell against this interpretation, however. One such consideration is merely an ''ex silentio'' appeal. No Stoic source, to my knowledge, suggests that actions may be justified with respect to anything other than what contributes to the end of happiness, and virtue alone does this in the Stoics view. A few texts, moreover, are explicit on this point. Cicero's summary of Stoics' ethics in ''De finibus'' 3 considers and rejects the suggestion that Stoic theory is implicitly committed to two final ends, virtue and a life that accords with nature, where these are conceived as independent objectives at which a rational agent might aim... Independent, that is, in the strong sense according to which one of these rational objectives may be realized while the other is not. See Irwin (2007), p. 316: 'Virtuous action. therefore, is not sufficient for achieving the life according to nature, which includes the natural advantages.' Irwin is certainly correct to point out that virtue is not sufficient for attaining the natural advantages, preferred indifferents such as health and wealth. But it is the Stoics' critics, not the Stoics themselves, who maintain that the actual possession of these items is a necessary condition of the life according to nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''[[Definitions (Plato)|Definitions]]'', a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to [[Plato]] himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in  [[Platonic Academy|the Academy]],  provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia: "The good composed of all goods; an ability which suffices for living well; perfection in respect of virtue; resources sufficient for a living creature."

In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (§21; 1095a15–22), Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings, but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well; i.e. eudaimon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Verbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour… [1095a17]&lt;ref name=twsJun5c&gt;{{cite news|author=Aristotle, also David Ross, Lesley Brown|title=The Nicomachean Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Verbally there is very general agreement, for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement...|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHkp7t6ISvEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Verbally+there+is+a+very+general+agreement%3B+for+both+the+general+run+of+men+and+people+of+superior+refinement+say+that+it+is&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QI2bp7lMzx&amp;sig=SVWPQlfkhX3jxPSss8KC-U-RIGw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fG0KTOaEEIL58AakkJmMBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=very%20general%20agreement&amp;f=false|accessdate= 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, as Aristotle points out, saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable, and means living well, is not saying very much. Everyone wants to be eudaimon; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual's well being. The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well. Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings. The candidates that he mentions are a (1) life of pleasure, (2) a life of political activity and (3) a philosophical life.

One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, "arete" ("[[virtue]]"). Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of "virtuous activity in accordance with reason" [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. And even [[Epicurus]] who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue. So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (areté is bound up with eudaimonia). However, they disagree on the way in which this is so. We shall consider the main theories in a moment, but first a warning about the proper translation of areté.

As already noted, the Greek word areté is usually translated into English as "virtue". One problem with this is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense, which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For a Greek, areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty. So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘virtue' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom, courage and compassion. The sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like "speed is a virtue in a horse", or "height is a virtue in a basketball player". Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.) has its own set of virtues. The alternative translation "excellence" (or "a desirable quality") might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term. The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.

Positive Psychology defines Eudaimonia as a self-discovery, perceived development of one's best potentials, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, intense involvement in activities, investment of significant effort, and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive, deep relationships.&lt;ref&gt;https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4275774/3168522.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and translation==
In terms of its etymology, eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from ''eu'' meaning "well" and ''daimon'' (daemon), which refers to a minor deity or a guardian spirit.&lt;ref name=twsJun5a/&gt;

Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach. A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity. As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed. Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance.

In his ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' (1095a15&amp;ndash;22) [[Aristotle]] says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘[[happiness]] is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is "a very happy person", we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life. We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone's life: they concern a person's really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle's discussion: ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' book 1.10–1.11.)

Because of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness, some alternative translations have been proposed. W.D. Ross suggests "well-being" and John Cooper proposes "flourishing". These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by "happiness" although each tends to raise some problems of its own. In some modern texts therefore, the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek, as "eudaimonia".

==Main views on eudaimonia and its relation to aretē==

===Socrates===
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting.|French painter [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] portrayed the philosopher in ''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787).]]
What we know of [[Socrates]]' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's writings. Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the ''[[Phaedo]]'' and the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' This division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of Socrates and Plato on eudaimonia.

As with all other ancient ethical thinkers, Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else. (see Plato, ''Apology'' 30b, ''Euthydemus'' 280d&amp;ndash;282d, ''Meno'' 87d&amp;ndash;89a). However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that [[virtue]] is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control, courage, justice, piety, wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy (eudaimon) life. Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia. For example, in the ''Meno'', with respect to wisdom, he says: "everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness" [''Meno'' 88c].

In the ''Apology,'' Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul [29e].&lt;ref name=twsJun5d&gt;{{cite news|author=Uncertain|title=How "God" functioned in Socrates' life|publisher=DD:Religion|quote=Men of Athens, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy, to exhort you and in my usual way to point out to any of you whom I happen to meet: "Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?"|date=19 September 2008|url=http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|accessdate=2010-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226163749/http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|archivedate=26 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for ''virtue''. [31a&amp;ndash;b; italics added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one's soul, that one's soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue. So Socrates' point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches. Virtues are states of the soul. When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected it possesses the virtues. Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good. The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than (e.g.) wealth and political power. Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the ''Crito'', where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body? Not at all. It is much more valuable…? Much more… (47e–48a)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=twsJun5f&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Parry|title=Ancient Ethical Theory|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=Socrates says that a man worth anything at all does not reckon whether his course of action endangers his life or threatens death. He looks only at one thing — whether what he does is just or not, the work of a good or of a bad man (28b&amp;ndash;c).|date=Aug 7, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.

===Plato===
Plato's great work of the middle period, the ''Republic'', is devoted to answering a challenge made by the [[sophist]] [[Thrasymachus]], that conventional morality, particularly the 'virtue' of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia. Thrasymachus's views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the ''Gorgias'', through the mouthpiece of Callicles. The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires. This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the ''Republic'' when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus' challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges. According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment. When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne. The thrust of Glaucon's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim. But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality. (This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]].) Throughout the rest of the ''Republic'', Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the [[virtue of justice]] is necessary for eudaimonia.
[[File:Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens, by italian Rafael.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[The School of Athens]] by [[Raffaello Sanzio]], 1509, showing [[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right)]]

The argument of the ''Republic'' is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person's benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man's soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato's version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle's account is articulated in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''. In outline, for Aristotle, eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]'' sometimes translated as excellence) in accordance with [[reason]]. This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle's [[essentialism|essentialist]] understanding of [[human nature]], the view that [[reason]] (''logos'' sometimes translated as [[rationality]]) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (''ergon'') of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason. Basically, well being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are "the rational animal". It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (''areté'') in reason.

According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires [[energeia|activity]], action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition. Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity. Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby. Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions. For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills,  one might say "doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist". From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success. The rest of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason. Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.

Aristotle's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. However, it is Aristotle's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia. While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other ‘goods' such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic. He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘good birth, good children, and beauty'. So, a person who is hideously ugly or has "lost children or good friends through death" (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon. In this way, "dumb luck" ([[Chance (philosophy)|chance]]) can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia.

===Epicurus===
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|left|alt=Sculpture of a face.|[[Epicurus]] identified eudaimonia with the life of pleasure.]]
[[Epicurus]]' ethical theory is [[Hedonism|hedonistic]]. (His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of [[utilitarianism]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].) Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad. An object, experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is. Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value. An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money. Someone asks them "why do you want the money?", and they answer: "So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean, and a red sports car." This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case, the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities.

Epicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure. He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and, also, freedom from pain and distress. But it is important to notice that Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure. Rather, he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized "in the long run". In other words, Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains, and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures. The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.

Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual's well being. Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue. He believes that we  do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure. Epicurus' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous. This thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] as "eudaimonia is the good life" would be: rather, it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in.

One important difference between Epicurus' eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness. To this difference, consider Aristotle's theory. Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree). He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason. The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1099a5). However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure. Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous. Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia. Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we aren't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason. Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.
By contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness. His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon. Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness. So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure, Epicurus would endorse this claim.

===The Stoics===
[[File:Raffael 070.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] thought happiness was a "good flow of life." ]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Zeno of Citium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a sculpture.|Zeno of Citium thought happiness was a "good flow of life."]] --&gt;
Stoic philosophy begins with [[Zeno of Citium]] c.300 BC, and was developed by [[Cleanthes]] (331&amp;ndash;232 BC) and [[Chrysippus]] (c.280–c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity.&lt;ref name=twsJun5g&gt;{{cite news|author=Dirk Baltzly|title=Stoicism|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But what is happiness? The Epicureans' answer was deceptively straightforward: the happy life is the one which is most pleasant. (But their account of what the highest pleasure consists in was not at all straightforward.) Zeno's answer was "a good flow of life" (Arius Didymus, 63A) or "living in agreement", and Cleanthes clarified that with the formulation that the end was "living in agreement with nature" (Arius Didymus, 63B). Chrysippus amplified this to (among other formulations) "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature"; later Stoics inadvisably, in response to Academic attacks, substituted such formulations as "the rational selection of the primary things according to nature". The Stoics' specification of what happiness consists in cannot be adequately understood apart from their views about value and human psychology.|date=Feb 7, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno believed happiness was a "good flow of life"; Cleanthes suggested it was "living in agreement with nature", and Chrysippus believed it was "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues.) We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by ''virtue'', which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).

The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely "neutral".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers such as [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one's family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], who argues that the possession of a "good will" is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.

=="Modern Moral Philosophy"==
Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" (1958) argued that [[duty]]-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a "law without a lawgiver".&lt;ref name=twsJun5h&gt;{{cite news|title=The ethics of virtue: The Ethics of Virtue and the Ethics of Right Action|publisher=wutsamada.com|quote=legalistic ethics rest on the incoherent notion of a "law" without a lawgiver: DCT unacceptable; and the alternative sources of moral "legislation" are inadequate substitutes|date=2010-06-05|url=http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/ethics/rachelsd.htm|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the [[Ten Commandments]] depends on someone having made these rules.&lt;ref name=twsJun5i&gt;{{cite news|author=G. E. M. Anscombe|title=Modern Moral Philosophy|publisher=Philosophy 33, No. 124|quote=Originally published in Philosophy 33, No. 124 (January 1958). ... The first is that it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking. The second is that the concepts of obligation, and duty&amp;mdash;moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say—and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of "ought", ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it. My third thesis is that the differences between the well‑known English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance.|date=January 1958|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.

[[Julia Driver]] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anscombe's article ''Modern Moral Philosophy'' stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as "morally ought", "morally obligated", "morally right", and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of [[moral authority]]. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.&lt;ref name=twsJun5j&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Driver|title=Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe: 5.1 Virtue Ethics|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.|date=Jul 21, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/#VirEth|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Eudaimonic well-being Joshanloo.jpg|thumb|Eudaimonic well-being in 166 nations based on Gallup World Poll data]]

Models of eudaimonia in [[psychology]] emerged from early work on [[self-actualization]] and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as [[Erik Erikson]], [[Gordon Allport]], and [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=ryff1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryff | first1 = C.

Central theories are Diener's [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], Ryff's [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], Keyes work on [[flourishing]], and Seligman's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and P.E.R.M.A. Related concepts are [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].

[[Image:belkinFM.jpg|thumb|right|Belkin TuneCastII FM Transmitter with a modified antenna connected to an iPod music player.]]

A '''personal FM transmitter''' is a low-power [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[transmitter|radio transmitter]] that broadcasts a signal from a portable audio device (such as an MP3 player) to a standard FM radio. Most of these transmitters plug into the device's [[headphone jack]] and then broadcast the signal over an [[FM broadcast band]] frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio. This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home [[audio system]] or [[car stereo]] without requiring a wired connection. They are often used in cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips on Using FM Transmitters|url=http://www.overstock.com/guides/tips-on-using-fm-transmitters|website=Guides at Overstock.com|publisher=Overstock.com|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be in fixed locations such as broadcasting from a computer [[sound card]] throughout a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stream Music to Every Radio in the House—Cheap!|url=https://gizmodo.com/5905695/stream-music-to-every-radio-in-a-housecheap|website=Gizmodo.com|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100–300 feet (30–100 metres), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM [[frequency]] from 87.5 to 108.0 [[MHz]] in most of the world, 76.0 - 95.0 MHz for Japan, 65.0 - 74.2 MHz for Russia (or 88.1 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz in the US and Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/ftp/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/pn910724.pdf |format=PDF |title=FCC Public Notice Dated July 24, 1991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304112834/http://www.fcc.gov/ftp/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/pn910724.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Personal FM transmitters are commonly used as a workaround for playing portable audio devices on car radios that don't have an Auxiliary "AUX" input [[jack (connector)|jack]] or [[List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_.28A2DP.29|Bluetooth audio connectivity]]. They are also used to broadcast a stationary audio source, like a computer or a television, around a home. They can also be used for [[low-power broadcasting]] and [[pirate radio]] but only to a very limited audience in near proximity. They can also be used as a "talking sign" in [[real estate]] sales or similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeFelice|first1=Bill|title=Micro-Broadcasting: Getting The Most Out Of Part 15 Radio|url=https://www.hobbybroadcaster.net/resources/Micro-Broadcasting-02.php|website=hobbybroadcaster.net|accessdate=14 October 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
The legality and maximum permitted power levels or field strengths of these devices varies by country. In 2006 these devices became legal in most countries in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Standards, Regulations and Law|url=http://lpra.org/resources/european-standards-regulations-and-law/|website=Low Power Radio Association|publisher=Low Power Radio Association|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industry Canada]] permits transmitters that have an output lower than 100 µV/m at 30 meters (approximately 1 microwatt output).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Low-Power FM Broadcasting from Industry Canada|url=https://sites.google.com/site/lowpowerradio2/canadian-low-power-radio/ric40e.pdf|publisher=Industry Canada|accessdate=14 October 2014|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[United States]], Part 15 of the [[Federal Communications Commission|U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] rules specifies that no license is needed if FM transmitters have a Maximum Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of 0.01 microwatts or 250 µV/m measured at 3 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permitted Forms of Low Power Broadcast Operation|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297510A1.pdf|website=fcc.gov|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mathematical discipline of [[category theory]], the '''Freyd cover''' or '''scone category''' is a construction that yields a set-like construction out of a given category.  The only requirement is that the original category has a terminal object.  The scone category inherits almost any categorical construct the original category has.  Scones can be used to generally describe proofs that use [[logical relations]].

==Definition==
Formally, the scone of a category ''C'' with a terminal object 1 is the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;1_\text{Set} \downarrow \operatorname{Hom}_C(1,-)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=Freyd+cover|title=Freyd cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program design ==
The program is partitioned into several sessions of 30-60&amp;nbsp;minutes length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Stacy|last2=Dixon|first2=Marlene A.|last3=Schumann|first3=Christyn|date=2009-04-01|year=|title=Enhancing Girls' Physical Activity and Self-Image: A Case Study of the GoGirlGo Program|url=https://ows.edb.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/users/mnewhousebailey/WSPAJ%20Dixon%20article_spring09.pdf|journal=Women in Sport and Physical Activity Journal|volume=18|issue=1|pages=31|doi=10.1123/wspaj.18.1.28|issn=1063-6161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are administered over a dozen weeks and focused on six topics:{{#tag:ref|Earlier versions were administered in shorter periods of time.&lt;ref name="Nuño" /&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MSB23GPB-oC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Go+Grrrls%22|title=Handbook of Prevention and Intervention Programs for Adolescent Girls|last=Mann|first=Joyce E.|date=2008-06-02|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470115237|editor-last=LeCroy|editor-first=Craig W.|pages=21–34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Being a girl": introduction and evaluation, identifying gender roles and challenging [[Peer pressure|societal pressures]].
# Positive body image and mindset: activities to boost [[self-image]]; understanding the effects of [[self-criticism]], depression and eating disorders.
# Making and keeping friends: social and life skills, independent critical thinking and developing satisfactory peer relationships.
# When it all seems like too much: teach girls when to seek help and how to find resources for help. 
# Let’s talk about sex: basics of reproduction, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases|sexually transmitted diseases]], how to refuse [[Rape#Consent|unwanted advances]], and the effects of drugs and alcohol. 
# "Planning for the future": teach girls to make goals and work to achieve them.

== Criticism ==
The program has been criticized for lacking "the capacity to measure prevention." According to William Epstein, the program is also unlikely to make an impression on girls because of the didactic nature of its curriculum. He referred to the evaluation done by the LeCroy in 2004 as a "poorly designed study." confirming the need for a more authoritative evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZSiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22go+grrrls%22|title=Empowerment as Ceremony|last=Epstein|first=William M.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412851602|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's [[law of continuity]] and [[transcendental law of homogeneity]] found mathematical implementation (by means of [[non-standard analysis]]). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of [[mechanical calculator]]s. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [[Pascal's calculator]], he was the first to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1685&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMITH|David Smith]], pp. 173–181 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; and invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], used in the [[arithmometer]], the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the [[binary number]] system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.

In philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his [[Philosophical optimism|optimism]], i.e. his conclusion that our [[universe]] is, in a restricted sense, the [[Best of all possible worlds|best possible one]] that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as [[Voltaire]]. Leibniz, along with [[René Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.

Leibniz made major contributions to [[physics]] and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, [[probability theory]], [[biology]], medicine, geology, [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and [[philology]]. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.;  introduction by Donald G.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gottfried Leibniz was born on 1 July 1646, toward the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], in [[Leipzig]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], to [[Friedrich Leibniz]] and Catharina Schmuck. Friedrich noted in his family journal:
{{quote|21. Juny am Sontag 1646 Ist mein Sohn Gottfried Wilhelm, post sextam vespertinam 1/4 uff 7 uhr abents zur welt gebohren, im Wassermann.}}
In English:
{{quote|On Sunday 21 June {{bracket|[[New Style|NS]]: 1 July}} 1646, my son Gottfried Wilhelm is born into the world a quarter before seven in the evening, in Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that the words "in Aquarius" refer to the Moon (the Sun in Cancer; Sagittarius rising (Ascendant)); see [http://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi?wgid=wgeJw9js0KwjAQhJ9GUFilG2z9CXsOiHfPKYlpsIklTSnp07tFkTkMzLfszOxfnoR0gTTKaOhufRv9Auqd8zN5ayAAwgmwOTaA5yvWEFBYUYGbeqiA74fFO1A2BR0LfFmNES8wMWdJbdqog6X_z42ofj0rMzpbQs5uU1_Y1iq2rUvWHXayzWXghSF3pPMsu7HQHmUaCR_qAw0rOyM Astro-Databank chart of Gottfried Leibniz].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original has "1/4 uff 7 uhr" and there is good reason to assume that also in the 17th century this meant a quarter ''to'' seven, since the "uff", in its modern form of "auf", is still, {{as of|2018|lc=y}} exactly in this vernacular, in use in several Low German speaking regions. The quote is given by Hartmut Hecht in ''Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz'' (Teubner-Archiv zur Mathematik, Volume 2, 1992), in the first lines of chapter 2, ''Der junge Leibniz'', p. 15; see [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-663-05995-0_2#page-1 H. Hecht, ''Der junge Leibniz'']; see also [https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=fHJMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.RA1-PA3 G. E. Guhrauer, ''G. W. Frhr. v. {{notatypo|Leibnitz}}''. Vol. 1. Breslau 1846, Anm. p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leibniz was baptized on 3 July of that year at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]]; his godfather was the [[Lutheran]] theologian {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Geier|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Müller, Gisela Krönert, ''Leben und Werk von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Eine Chronik''. Frankfurt a.M., Klostermann 1969, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was six years old, and from that point on he was raised by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Leibniz: Metaphysics and Language|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3M8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Gottfried+Leibniz+father+died+when+he+was+six+and+a+half+years+old#v=onepage&amp;q=Gottfried%20Leibniz%20father%20died%20when%20he%20was%20six%20and%20a%20half%20years%20old&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-19-505946-5|author1=Mates|first1=Benson|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]], and the boy later inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven. While Leibniz's schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works—ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Access to his father's library, largely written in [[Latin]], also led to his proficiency in the Latin language, which he achieved by the age of 12.  He also composed 300 [[hexameters]] of [[Latin poetry|Latin verse]], in a single morning, for a special event at school at the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1661 he enrolled in his father's former university at age 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz.html|title=Leibniz biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 26&lt;/ref&gt; and completed his [[bachelor's degree]] in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his ''Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui'' (''Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation''),&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; which addressed the [[principle of individuation]], on 9 June 1663. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. He published and defended a [[dissertation]] ''Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum'' (''An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right''),&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt; arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Busche, ''Leibniz' Weg ins perspektivische Universum: Eine Harmonie im Zeitalter der Berechnung'', Meiner Verlag, 1997, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation was titled ''De conditionibus'' (''On Conditions'').&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt;

In early 1666, at age 19, Leibniz wrote his first book, ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (''On the Combinatorial Art''), the first part of which was also his [[habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy, which he defended in March 1666.&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few copies of ''De Arte Combinatoria'' were produced as requested for the habilitation procedure; it was reprinted without his consent in 1690.&lt;/ref&gt; His next goal was to earn his license and Doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study. In 1666, the University of Leipzig turned down Leibniz's doctoral application and refused to grant him a Doctorate in Law, most likely due to his relative youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}:20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=George|title=Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics|year=2007|publisher=MAA}}:143&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz then enrolled in the [[University of Altdorf]] and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 39&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his thesis was ''Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure'' (''Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases'').&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt; Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, saying that "my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction".&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as "Gottfried [[von]] Leibniz". Many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as "[[Freiherr]] G. W. von Leibniz." However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Aiton 1985: 312&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz-Louis-Dutens-opera-omnia MG 1180.tif|thumb|Engraving of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]Leibniz's first position was as a salaried secretary to an [[alchemy|alchemical]] society in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Ariew R., G.W. Leibniz, life and works, p. 21 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz'', ed. by N. Jolley, Cambridge University Press, 1994, {{isbn|0-521-36588-0}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&amp;pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]&lt;/ref&gt; He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met [[Johann Christian von Boyneburg]] (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of [[Mainz]], [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Von Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a diplomatic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in European geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [[Louis XIV of France]], backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [[Thirty Years' War]] had left [[German language in Europe|German-speaking Europe]] exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows. France would be invited to take [[Egypt]] as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to Paris for discussion,&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 58–61&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and became irrelevant. Napoleon's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|failed invasion of Egypt in 1798]] can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Thus Leibniz went to Paris in 1672. Soon after arriving, he met Dutch physicist and mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]] and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of [[self-study]] that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral [[calculus]]. He met [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]], the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], unpublished as well as published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/#Life|title=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended a German mathematician, [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]]; they corresponded for the rest of their lives.

[[File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg|thumb|[[Stepped reckoner]]]]

When it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [[Henry Oldenburg]] and [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]]. He met with the [[Royal Society]] where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.

The mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career.

In this regard, a 1669 invitation from the [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]] of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the [[Habsburg]] imperial court, was forthcoming.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Martin|title=The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-138-50208-1|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1675 he tried to get admitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] as a foreign honorary member, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came. He left Paris in October 1676.

===House of Hanover, 1676–1716===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Leibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen Newton's unpublished work on calculus in advance.&lt;ref&gt;On the encounter between Newton and Leibniz and a review of the evidence, see Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War: The Quarrel Between Newton and Leibniz'', (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 44–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in [[The Hague]] where he met [[van Leeuwenhoek]], the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], who had just completed his masterwork, the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the [[duke|ducal]] library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and [[theological]] matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.

Leibniz began promoting a project to use windmills to improve the mining operations in the Harz Mountains. This project did little to improve mining operations and was shut down by Duke Ernst August in 1685.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"/&gt;

Among the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630–1714), her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]] (1668–1705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the consort of her grandson, the future [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king [[George I of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;For a study of Leibniz's correspondence with Sophia Charlotte, see MacDonald Ross, George, 1990, "Leibniz's Exposition of His System to Queen Sophie Charlotte and Other Ladies." In ''Leibniz in Berlin'', ed. H. Poser and A. Heinekamp, Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1990, 61–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The British [[Act of Settlement 1701]] designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King [[William III of England|William III]] and his sister-in-law and successor, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the [[British Parliament]].

The Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and [[Otto Mencke]] founded in 1682, the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy.

[[File:Korespondencja Gottfrieda Leibniza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Leibniz's correspondence, papers and notes from 1669 to 1704, [[National Library of Poland]].]]

The Elector [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]] commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of [[Charlemagne]] or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a [[genealogy]] with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.

Leibniz was appointed Librarian of the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]], [[Lower Saxony]], in 1691.

In 1708, [[John Keill]], writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 109&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus priority dispute]] which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.

In 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in [[Vienna]], where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the [[Habsburg]]s. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King [[George I of Great Britain]], under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714.

===Death===
Leibniz died in [[Hanover]] in 1716: at the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]], neither organization saw fit to honor his death. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by [[Bernard de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], before the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Duchess of Orleans]], a niece of the Electress Sophia.

===Personal life===
Leibniz never married. He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus controversy]]. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;See Wiener IV.6 and Loemker §40. Also see a curious passage titled "Leibniz's Philosophical Dream," first published by Bodemann in 1895 and translated on p. 253 of Morris, Mary, ed. and trans., 1934. ''Philosophical Writings''. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. On Leibniz's religious views, though he was a [[protestant]], Leibniz learned to appreciate aspects of [[Catholicism]] through his patrons and colleagues. He never admitted the Protestant view of Pope as an Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~mroinila/reunion.html|title=Leibniz's Attempts to the Reunification of the Churches|first=|last=Markku|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz was claimed as a [[philosophical theism|philosophical theist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Mathematicians – Leibniz – God &amp; Math – Thinking Christianly About Math Education|url=http://godandmath.com/2012/01/30/christian-mathematicians-leibniz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discourse on Metaphysics and Other Writings|year=2012|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=978-1-55481-011-6|pages=23–24|author=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|editor=Peter Loptson|quote=The answer is unknowable, but it may not be unreasonable to see him, at least in theological terms, as essentially a deist. He is a determinist: there are no miracles (the events so called being merely instances of infrequently occurring natural laws); Christ has no real role in the system; we live forever, and hence we carry on after our deaths, but then everything—every individual substance—carries on forever. Nonetheless, Leibniz is a theist. His system is generated from, and needs, the postulate of a creative god. In fact, though, despite Leibniz's protestations, his God is more the architect and engineer of the vast complex world-system than the embodiment of love of Christian orthodoxy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Owen's Ape &amp; Darwin's Bulldog: Beyond Darwinism and Creationism|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22051-6|pages=102–103|author=Christopher Ernest Cosans|quote=In advancing his system of mechanics, Newton claimed that collisions of celestial objects would cause a loss of energy that would require God to intervene from time to time to maintain order in the solar system (Vailati 1997, 37–42). In criticizing this implication, Leibniz remarks: "Sir Isaac Newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move." (Leibniz 1715, 675) Leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on God to perform miracles after He had first made the universe indicates that God lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place. In defense of Newton's theism, Clarke is unapologetic: "'tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection"' (Leibniz 1715, 676–677). Clarke is believed to have consulted closely with Newton on how to respond to Leibniz. He asserts that Leibniz's deism leads to "the notion of materialism and fate" (1715, 677), because it excludes God from the daily workings of nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversy in Marketing Theory: For Reason, Realism, Truth, and Objectivity|year=2003|publisher=M.E.

== Philosopher ==
Leibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented, because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces: journal articles, manuscripts published long after his death, and many letters to many correspondents. He wrote only two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the ''Théodicée'' of 1710 was published in his lifetime.

Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'', which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]]. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 69; Loemker, §§36, 38&lt;/ref&gt; it and the ''Discourse'' were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entrée into European philosophy with a journal article titled "New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances".&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 138; Loemker, §47; Wiener, II.4&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', a lengthy commentary on [[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the ''New Essays'' were not published until 1765. The ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'', composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms.

Leibniz met [[Spinoza]] in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 272–284; Loemker, §§14, 20, 21; Wiener, III.8&lt;/ref&gt; especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy.

Unlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his [[Leipzig]] professor [[Jakob Thomasius]], who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 13"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz also eagerly read [[Francisco Suárez]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] respected even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[linguistic philosophy]] of the 20th century.

=== Principles===&lt;!--Linked from "Difference (philosophy)"--&gt;
Leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:&lt;ref&gt;Mates (1986), chpts. 7.3, 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]/[[contradiction]]. If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa.
* [[Identity of indiscernibles]]. Two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. If every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa, then entities x and y are identical; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. Frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy, the "identity of indiscernibles" is often referred to as Leibniz's Law. It has attracted the most controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics.
* [[principle of sufficient reason|Sufficient reason]]. "There must be a sufficient reason for anything to exist, for any event to occur, for any truth to obtain."&lt;ref&gt;Loemker 717&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;See Jolley (1995: 129–131), Woolhouse and Francks (1998), and Mercer (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he appropriate nature of each substance brings it about that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others, without, however, their acting upon one another directly." (''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XIV) A dropped glass shatters because it "knows" it has hit the ground, and not because the impact with the ground "compels" the glass to split.
* [[Law of Continuity]]. ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''&lt;ref name="Saltus"&gt;Gottfried Leibniz, [[New Essays on Human Understanding|''New Essays'']], IV, 16: "''la nature ne fait jamais des sauts''". ''Natura non-facit saltus'' is the Latin translation of the phrase (originally put forward by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'', 1st ed., 1751, Chapter III, § 77, p. 27; see also [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ "Continuity and Infinitesimals"] and [[Alexander Baumgarten]], ''Metaphysics: A Critical Translation with Kant's Elucidations'', Translated and Edited by Courtney D.

A variant translation is "''natura non-saltum facit''" (literally, "Nature does not make a jump") ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goW6JsEUz4EC|title=Ökonomische Theorie und christlicher Glaube|last1=Britton|first1=Andrew|last2=Sedgwick|first2=Peter H.|last3=Bock|first3=Burghard|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=2008|isbn=978-3-8258-0162-5|page=289}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=goW6JsEUz4EC&amp;pg=PA289 Extract of page 289].)&lt;/ref&gt; (literally, "Nature does not make jumps").
* [[Philosophical optimism|Optimism]]. "God assuredly always chooses the best."&lt;ref&gt;Loemker 311&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Principle of plenitude|Plenitude]]. Leibniz believed that the best of all possible worlds would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in ''Théodicée'' that this best of all possible worlds will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Lovejoy]], ''The [[Great Chain of Being]]''. Harvard University Press, 1936, Chapter V "Plenitude and Sufficient Reason in Leibniz and Spinoza", pp.&amp;nbsp;144–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz would on occasion give a rational defense of a specific principle, but more often took them for granted.&lt;ref&gt;For a precis of what Leibniz meant by these and other Principles, see Mercer (2001: 473–484). For a classic discussion of Sufficient Reason and Plenitude, see Lovejoy (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monads===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Leibniz Monadology 1.jpg|thumb|A page from Leibniz's manuscript of the ''[[Monadology]]'']]
Leibniz's best known contribution to [[metaphysics]] is his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]], as exposited in ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]''. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Leary-Hawthorne|first1=John|last2=Cover|first2=J.A.|title=Substance and Individuation in Leibniz|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-07303-0|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [[Mechanical Philosophy]] of René Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the "ultimate units of existence in nature". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=G.W. Leibniz's Monadology: an edition for students|date=1991|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh|isbn=0-8229-5449-4|page=40|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monads are centers of [[force]]; substance is force, while [[space]], [[matter]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] are merely phenomenal.

Leibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the ''[[Théodicée]]''.&lt;ref name="Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=Franklin|title=Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=0-8264-8921-4|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reason is governed by the [[principle of contradiction]] and the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.&lt;ref name="Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed"/&gt; All that we see and experience are subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be a some reason for the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=Franklin|title=Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=0-8264-8921-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz concluded that there must be the "''monas monadum''" or God.

The [[ontology|ontological]] essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of [[pre-established harmony]], each monad follows a preprogrammed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [[free will]] is problematic.

Monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:
* interaction between [[mind]] and matter arising in the system of [[Descartes]];
* lack of [[Principle of individuation|individuation]] inherent to the system of [[Spinoza]], which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.

===Theodicy and optimism===
{{further|Best of all possible worlds|Philosophical optimism}}

The ''[[Théodicée|Theodicy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].&lt;/ref&gt; tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.

Leibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both "gifts of God" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The ''Theodicy'' is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Magill, Frank (ed.). ''Masterpieces of World Philosophy''. New York: Harper Collins (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion as compared to its purportedly less advanced non-Western counterparts. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science).

Because reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:&lt;ref&gt;Magill, Frank (ed.) (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; if God is [[Omnibenevolent|all good]], [[Omniscience|all wise]] and [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], how did [[Problem of evil|evil come into the world]]? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their [[free will]]. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both ''moral evil'' (sin) and ''physical evil'' (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of ''metaphysical evil'' (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.

Further, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God, and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a "wonderful spontaneity" that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.

=== ''Discourse on Metaphysics'' ===
For Leibniz, "God is an absolutely perfect being." He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content "with all that comes to us according to his will" (IV).

Because God is "an absolutely perfect being" (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III). His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also affects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, we have to understand that God "is the best of all masters" and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will—or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. ''Discourse on Metaphysics. The Rationalists: Rene Descartes – Discourse on Method, Meditations''. N.Y.: Dolphin., n.d., n.p.,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental question of metaphysics===
Leibniz wrote: "[[Problem of why there is anything at all|Why is there something rather than nothing?]] The sufficient reason ... is found in a substance which ... is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] called this question "the fundamental question of metaphysics".&lt;!--"Warum ist überhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr Nichts?"--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|publisher=hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=978-3-644-04511-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de|date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic thought===
Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate [''calculemus''], without further ado, to see who is right.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Discovery'' 1685, Wiener 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz's [[calculus ratiocinator]], which resembles [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda&lt;ref&gt;Many of his memoranda are translated in Parkinson 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his ''calculus''—off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by C.I. Gerhardt (1859). L. Couturat published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and by [[Gottlob Frege]].

Leibniz thought [[symbol]]s were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for [[calculus]] is an example of his skill in this regard. Peirce, a 19th-century pioneer of [[semiotics]], shared Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, and his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics.

But Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [[Grapheme|character]] as any written sign, he then defined a "real" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Chinese character]]s, and the symbols of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], he deemed not real.&lt;ref&gt;Loemker, however, who translated some of Leibniz's works into English, said that the symbols of chemistry were real characters, so there is disagreement among Leibniz scholars on this point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is this paragraph correct up to this point?--&gt; Instead, he proposed the creation of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' or "universal characteristic", built on an [[alphabet of human thought]] in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique "real" character:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters ''insofar as they are subject to reasoning'' all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to the General Science'', 1677. Revision of Rutherford's translation in Jolley 1995: 234. Also Wiener I.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [[prime factorization]] suggests a central role for [[prime numbers]] in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [[Gödel numbering]]. Granted, there is no intuitive or [[mnemonic]] way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. 

Because Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the ''characteristic'', at first he did not conceive it as an [[algebra]] but rather as a [[universal characteristic|universal language]] or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of "algebra of thought", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting ''characteristic'' included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his ''analysis situs'' (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his ''characteristica universalis'' and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.&lt;ref&gt;A good introductory discussion of the "characteristic" is Jolley (1995: 226–240). An early, yet still classic, discussion of the "characteristic" and "calculus" is Couturat (1901: chpts. 3, 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century developments in formal systems, such as [[Turing completeness]], where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [[Turing degree]]).

===Formal logic===
{{Main|Algebraic logic}}
Leibniz has been noted as one of the most important logicians between the times of Aristotle and [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, W., 2004, "Leibniz's Logic," in ''Handbook of the History of Logic'' by D. M. Gabbay/J. Woods (eds.), volume 3: ''The Rise of Modern Logic: From Leibniz to Frege'', Amsterdam et al.: Elsevier-North-Holland, pp. 1–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[negation]], [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], set [[subset|inclusion]], and the [[empty set]]. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:

# All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [[alphabet of human thought]].
# Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication.

The formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]].

Leibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his book ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later.

Russell's principal work on Leibniz found that many of Leibniz's most startling  philosophical ideas and claims (e.g., that each of the fundamental [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]] mirrors the whole universe) follow logically from Leibniz's conscious choice to reject ''relations'' between things as unreal. He regarded such relations as (real) ''qualities'' of things (Leibniz admitted [[unary function|unary]] [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] only): For him "Mary is the mother of John" describes separate qualities of Mary and of John. This view contrasts with the relational logic of [[Augustus de Morgan|De Morgan]], [[Charles S. Peirce|Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]] and Russell himself, now standard in [[predicate logic]]. Notably, Leibniz also declared space and time to be inherently relational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz|publisher=The University Press, Cambridge|date=1900|first=Bertrand|last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematician==
Although the mathematical notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]] was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [[abscissa]], [[ordinate]], [[tangent]], [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and the [[Normal (geometry)|perpendicular]].&lt;ref&gt;Struik (1969), 367&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations. Leibniz also believed that the sum of an infinite number of zeros would equal to one half using the analogy of the creation of the world from nothing.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz was also one of the pioneers in [[actuarial science]], calculating the purchase price of life annuities and the liquidation of a state's debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leader|first1=editor, Timothy Gowers ; associate editors, June Barrow-Green, Imre|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's discoveries of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], also relevant to mathematics, are discussed in the preceding section. The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).&lt;ref name="Douglas M. Jesseph, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas M.|title=Leibniz on the Foundations of the Calculus: The Question of the Reality of Infinitesimal Magnitudes|journal=[[Perspectives on Science]]|year=1998|volume=6.1&amp;2|pages=6–40|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/perspectives_on_science/v006/6.1jesseph.html|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear systems===
Leibniz arranged the coefficients of a system of [[linear equation]]s into an array, now called a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], in order to find a solution to the system if it existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew L.|title=The Good Life in the Scientific Revolution: Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and the Cultivation of Virtue|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-40955-4|pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was later called [[Gaussian elimination]]. Leibniz laid down the foundations and theory of [[determinants]], although [[Seki Kowa]] discovered determinants well before Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leader|first1=editor, Timothy Gowers ; associate editors, June Barrow-Green, Imre|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=744}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works show calculating the determinants using cofactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knobloch|first1=Eberhard|title=Leibniz’s Theory of Elimination and Determinants|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-54272-8|pages=230–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the determinant using cofactors is named the [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]].  Finding the determinant of a matrix using this method proves impractical with large ''n'', requiring to calculate ''n!'' products and the number of n-permutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|publisher=V&amp;S Publishers|isbn=978-93-81588-83-3|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also solved systems of linear equations using determinants, which is now called [[Cramer's rule]]. This method for solving systems of linear equations based on determinants was found in 1684 by Leibniz (Cramer published his findings in 1750).&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"/&gt; Although Gaussian elimination requires &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations, linear algebra textbooks still teach cofactor expansion before [[LU factorization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lay|first1=David C.|title=Linear algebra and its applications|date=2012|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-321-38517-8|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(ed.)|first1=Takeshi Tokuyama|title=Algorithms and Computation: 18th International Symposium, ISAAC 2007, Sendai, Japan, December 17–19, 2007 : proceedings|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [etc.]|isbn=978-3-540-77120-3|page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
The [[Leibniz formula for π|Leibniz formula for {{pi}}]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;1 \,-\, \frac{1}{3} \,+\, \frac{1}{5} \,-\, \frac{1}{7} \,+\, \cdots \,=\, \frac{\pi}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
Leibniz wrote that circles "can most simply be expressed by this series, that is, the aggregate of fractions alternately added and subtracted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew L.|title=The Good Life in the Scientific Revolution : Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and the Cultivation of Virtue|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-226-40954-2|page=169|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this formula is only accurate with a large number of terms, using 10,000,000 terms to obtain the correct value of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} to 8 decimal places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Martin|title=The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing, Third Edition|date=2018-02-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-138-50208-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz attempted to create a definition for a straight line while attempting to prove the [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Risi|first1=Vincenzo|title=Leibniz on the Parallel Postulate and the Foundations of Geometry|date=2016|isbn=978-3-319-19863-7|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most mathematicians defined a straight line as the shortest line between two points, Leibniz believed that this was merely a property of a straight line rather than the definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Risi|first1=Vincenzo|title=Leibniz on the Parallel Postulate and the Foundations of Geometry|publisher=Birkhäuser, Cham|isbn=3-319-19862-9|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculus===
Leibniz is credited, along with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], with the discovery of [[calculus]] (differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function {{math|1={{var|y}} = {{var|f}}({{var|x}})}}.&lt;ref name="Leibniz1920"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von|last2=Gerhardt|first2=Carl Immanuel (trans.)|title=The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QG_QAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1920|publisher=Open Court Publishing|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [[integral sign]] {{math|∫}}, representing an elongated S, from the Latin word ''summa'', and the {{math|d}} used for [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]], from the Latin word ''differentia''. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of this paper, see Struik (1969: 271–284), who also translates parts of two other key papers by Leibniz on calculus.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation, later called the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], by means of a figure&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Jan Struik]], ''A Source Book in Mathematics'' (1969) pp.&amp;nbsp;282–284&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1693 paper ''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae...''.&lt;ref&gt;''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae, seu generalissima omnium tetragonismorum effectio per motum: similiterque multiplex constructio lineae ex data tangentium conditione'', ''Acta Euriditorum'' (Sep. 1693) pp. 385–392&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] is credited for the theorem's discovery in geometric form, [[Isaac Barrow]] proved a more generalized geometric version, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] developed supporting theory. The concept became more transparent as developed through Leibniz's formalism and new notation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stillwell]], ''Mathematics and its History'' (1989, 2002) p.159&lt;/ref&gt; The [[product rule]] of [[differential calculus]] is still called "Leibniz's law". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [[Leibniz integral rule]].

Leibniz exploited [[infinitesimal]]s in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [[paradox]]ical [[algebra]]ic properties. [[George Berkeley]], in a tract called ''[[The Analyst]]'' and also in ''De Motu'', criticized these. A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

From 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill, Newton and others, over whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton. This subject is treated at length in the article [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy]].

The use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of [[Karl Weierstrass]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]. Beginning in 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [[model theory]], in the context of a field of [[hyperreal number]]s. The resulting [[non-standard analysis]] can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. Robinson's [[transfer principle]] is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic [[law of continuity]], while the [[standard part function]] implements the Leibnizian [[transcendental law of homogeneity]].

===Topology===
Leibniz was the first to use the term ''analysis situs'',&lt;ref&gt;Loemker §27&lt;/ref&gt; later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [[topology]]. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [[Jacob Freudenthal]], argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [[Euler]], in the famous 1736 paper solving the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|Königsberg Bridge Problem]] and its generalizations, used the term ''geometria situs'' in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... [It] is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Mates (1986), 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |title=Leibniz's Cultural Pluralism And Natural Law |last=Hirano |first=Hideaki |accessdate=10 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130455/http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in "packing",&amp;nbsp;... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In ''Euclidis Prota''&amp;nbsp;..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states&amp;nbsp;...: "I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets." This claim can be proved today.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1977), 419. Quoted in Hirano (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of [[self-similarity]] and the principle of continuity: ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''.&lt;ref name="Saltus"/&gt; We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that "the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for "packing", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.

==Scientist and engineer==
Leibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's ''Mathematical Writings''.

===Physics===
{{See also|Dynamism (metaphysics)|Conatus#In Leibniz}}
Leibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], time and motion are relative, not absolute: "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."&lt;ref&gt;See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz held a [[Relational theory|relationist]] notion of space and time, against Newton's substantivalist views.&lt;ref&gt;Futch, Michael.  ''Leibniz's Metaphysics of Time and Space''. New York: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Christopher. ''Time, Space and Philosophy''. London: Routledge, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickles, Dean. ''Symmetry, Structure and Spacetime''. Oxford: Elsevier, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, on the other hand, describes [[space and time]] as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of [[general relativity]] and subsequent work in the [[history of physics]] has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light.

One of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation|vortex theory]].&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 56"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion of matter]].&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 56"/&gt;

The [[principle of sufficient reason]] has been invoked in recent [[cosmology]], and his [[identity of indiscernibles]] in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. Those who advocate [[digital philosophy]], a recent direction in cosmology, claim Leibniz as a precursor. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics.

====The ''vis viva''====
Leibniz's ''[[vis viva]]'' (Latin for "living force") is {{math|{{var|m}}{{var|v}}{{sup|2}}}}, twice the modern [[kinetic energy]]. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.&lt;ref&gt;See Ariew and Garber 155–86, Loemker §§53–55, W II.6–7a&lt;/ref&gt; Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His ''vis viva'' was seen as rivaling the [[conservation of momentum]] championed by Newton in England and by [[Descartes]] in France; hence [[academics]] in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. In reality, both energy and [[momentum]] are conserved, so the two approaches are equally valid.

===Other natural science===
By proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern geology. In [[embryology]], he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [[life sciences]] and [[paleontology]], he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, ''[[Protogaea]]'', unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [[organismic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz and biology, see Loemker (1969a: VIII).&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.

===Psychology===
Psychology had been a central interest of Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Loemker: ''Introduction to Philosophical papers and letters: A selection.'' Gottfried W. Leibniz (transl. and ed., by Leroy E. Loemker). Dordrecht: Riedel (2nd ed. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Verhave: ''Contributions to the history of psychology: III. G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716)''. ''On the Association of Ideas and Learning''. ''Psychological Report'', 1967, Vol. 20, 11–116.&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to be an "underappreciated pioneer of psychology" &lt;ref&gt;R. E. Fancher &amp; H. Schmidt: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: ''Underappreciated pioneer of psychology''. In: G. A. Kimble &amp; M. Wertheimer (Eds.). ''Portraits of pioneers in psychology'', Vol. V. American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 2003, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology: [[attention]] and [[consciousness]], [[memory]], [[learning]] ([[Association (psychology)|association]]), [[motivation]] (the act of "striving"), emergent [[individuality]], the general dynamics of development ([[evolutionary psychology]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. His discussions in the ''New Essays'' and ''Monadology'' often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed ''petite perceptions'' to the distinct, self-aware [[apperception]], and [[psychophysical parallelism]] from the point of view of causality and of purpose:  “Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.” &lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W. (1714/1720). ''The Principles of Philosophy known as Monadology'' (transl. by Jonathan Bennett, 2007). http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This idea refers to the mind-body problem, stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Larry M. Jorgensen, The Principle of Continuity and Leibniz's Theory of Consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz, however, did not use the term ''psychologia''.&lt;ref&gt;The German scholar Johann Thomas Freigius was the first to use this Latin term 1574 in print: ''Quaestiones logicae et ethicae'', Basel, Henricpetri).&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz’ epistemological position—against [[John Locke]] and English [[empiricism]] ([[sensualism]])—was made clear: “Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.” – “Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.” &lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Nouveaux essais, 1765, Livre II, Des Idées, Chapitre 1, § 6. ''New Essays on Human Understanding'' Book 2. p. 36; transl. by Jonathan Bennett, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: logical inferences, categories of thought, the principle of [[causality]] and the principle of [[purpose]] ([[teleology]]). 
 
Leibniz found his most important interpreter in [[Wilhelm Wundt]], founder of psychology as a discipline. Wundt used the "… nisi intellectu ipse" quotation 1862 on the title page of his ''Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on Leibniz&lt;ref&gt;Wundt: ''Leibniz zu seinem zweihundertjährigen Todestag, 14. November 1916.'' Alfred Kröner Verlag, Leipzig 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt shaped the term [[apperception]], introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling – an excellent example of how a concept created by a great philosopher could stimulate a psychological research program. One principle in the thinking of Leibniz played a fundamental role: “the principle of equality of separate but corresponding viewpoints.” Wundt characterized this style of thought ([[perspectivism]]) in a way that also applied for him—viewpoints that "supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply."&lt;ref&gt;Wundt (1917), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahrenberg, J. (2017) ''The influence of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz on the Psychology, philosophy, and Ethics of Wilhelm Wundt'' PsyDok ZPID [http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11780/3772.].&lt;/ref&gt;    
Much of Leibniz's work went on to have a great impact on the field of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brett King, Wayne Viney and William Woody. ''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'' (2009), 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz thought that there are many petites perceptions, or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls and Leibscher ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought'' (2010), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the [[stages of sleep]]. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the [[The unconscious|unconscious]]. Leibniz was a direct influence on [[Ernst Platner]], who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewußtseyn (unconscious).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls and Leibscher (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the idea of [[subliminal stimuli]] can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;King et al. (2009), 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref&gt;Klempe SH (2011). "''The role of tone sensation and musical stimuli in early experimental psychology''". ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''. 47 (2): 187–199. {{PMID|21462196}}. doi:10.1002/jhbs.20495.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science===
In public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over [[epidemiology]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the [[balance of trade]]. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [[game theory]]. In sociology he laid the ground for [[communication theory]].

===Technology===
In 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto ''theoria cum praxi'', he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [[applied science]]. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [[Denis Papin]], he invented a [[steam engine]]. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the [[Harz Mountains]], but did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Aiton (1985), 107–114, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computation====
Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2000) discusses Leibniz's prophetic role in the emergence of calculating machines and of formal languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in life, he documented the [[binary numeral system]] ([[radix|base]] 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;See Couturat (1901): 473–478.&lt;/ref&gt; While Leibniz was examining other cultures to compare his metaphysical views, he encountered an ancient Chinese book ''[[I Ching]]''. Leibniz interpreted a diagram which showed yin and yang and corresponded it to a zero and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=James|title=Leibniz' Binary System and Shao Yong's "Yijing"|journal=University of Hawaii Press|pages=59–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information can be found in the [[#Sinophile |Sinophile]] section. Leibniz may have plagiarized [[Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz]] and [[Thomas Harriot]], who independently developed the binary system,  as he was familiar with their works on the binary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ares|first=J.|last2=Lara|first2=J.|last3=Lizcano|first3=D.|last4=Martínez|first4=M.|date=2017|title=Who Discovered the Binary System and Arithmetic? Did Leibniz Plagiarize Caramuel?|url=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=24|issue=1|pages=173–188|eissn=1471-5546|via=Springer|pmid=28281152|doi=10.1007/s11948-017-9890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz worked extensively on logarithms including logarithms with base 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navarro-Loidi|first1=Juan|title=The Introductions of Logarithms into Spain|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=May 2008|volume=35|issue=2|pages=83–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Harriot's manuscripts contained a table of binary numbers and their notation, which demonstrated that any number could be written on a base 2 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Booth|first1=Michael|title=Thomas Harriot's Translations|journal=The Yale Journal of Criticism|date=2003|volume=16|issue=2|page=345|issn=0893-5378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and the empty set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lande|first1=Daniel|title=Development of the Binary Number System and the Foundations of Computer Science|journal=The Mathematics Enthusiast|pages=513–540}}&lt;/ref&gt; He anticipated [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrangian interpolation]] and [[algorithmic information theory]]. His [[calculus ratiocinator]] anticipated aspects of the [[universal Turing machine]]. In 1961, [[Norbert Wiener]] suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, N., ''Cybernetics'' (2nd edition with revisions and two additional chapters), The MIT Press and Wiley, New York, 1961, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This "[[stepped reckoner]]" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [[Royal Society]] in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [[Hanover]] by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry operation]]. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.&lt;ref&gt;Couturat (1901), 115&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by [[Nicholas Rescher]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See N. Rescher, ''Leibniz and Cryptography'' (Pittsburgh, University Library Systems, University of Pittsburgh, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called "integraph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://amatterofmind.org/Pierres_PDFs/TRANSLATIONS/4._GOTTFRIED_LEIBNIZ_SELECTIONS_FROM_ACTA_ERUDITORUM.pdf  "The discoveries of principle of the calculus in Acta Eruditorum"] (commentary, pp. 60–61), translated by Pierre Beaudry, amatterofmind.org, Leesburg, Va., September 2000. (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]]. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/schirrmacher_eurotech.html|title=The Reality Club: Wake Up Call for Europe Tech|website=www.edge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.

===Librarian===
Later in Leibniz’s career (after the death of von Boinburg), Leibniz moved to Paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the Hanoverian court of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg. Leibniz’s predecessor, Tobias Fleischer, had already created a cataloging system for the Duke’s library but it was a clumsy attempt. At this library, Leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging. For instance, within a month of taking the new position, he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library. He was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt “that a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous, but a well-stocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schulte-Albert, H. (1971). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Library Classification. The Journal of Library History (1966–1972), 6(2), 133–152. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/25540286&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner. After working at this library, by the end of 1690 Leibnez was appointed as privy-councilor and librarian of the Bibliotheca Augusta at Wolfenbuettel. It was an extensive library with at least 25,946 printed volumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At this library, Leibniz sought to improve the catalog. He was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog, but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately. He created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented. While serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in [[Hanover]] and [[Wolfenbuettel]], Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of [[library science]]. He also designed a book [[library classification|indexing system]] in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Library]].

He called for the creation of an [[empirical]] [[database]] as a way to further all sciences. His ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', [[calculus ratiocinator]], and a "community of minds"—intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe—can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and its rivals), [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], even the [[World Wide Web]].

===Advocate of scientific societies===
Leibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the [[Royal Society|British Royal Society]] and the French Academie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, [[Saint Petersburg]], Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz's projects for scientific societies, see Couturat (1901), App. IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawyer and moralist==
With the possible exception of [[Marcus Aurelius]], no philosopher has ever had as much experience with practical affairs of state as Leibniz. Leibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ariew and Garber 19, 94, 111, 193; Riley 1988; Loemker §§2, 7, 20, 29, 44, 59, 62, 65; W I.1, IV.1–3&lt;/ref&gt; were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.&lt;ref&gt;See (in order of difficulty) Jolley (2005: chpt. 7), Gregory Brown's chapter in Jolley (1995), Hostler (1975), and Riley (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Leibniz was no apologist for [[absolute monarchy]] like [[Hobbes]], or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary [[John Locke]], views invoked in support of liberalism, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for&amp;nbsp;... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of [[Grotius]], that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Loemker: 59, fn 16. Translation revised.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;&lt;ref&gt;Loemker: 58, fn 9&lt;/ref&gt; this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the [[European Union]]. He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715.

But at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to propose it, he combined linguistics, especially sinology, moral and law philosophy, management, economics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego: 42. “Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz’s Universal (Chinese) Dream”: Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118–132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenism===
Leibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] endeavor, seeking to reconcile first the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] churches, and later the Lutheran and [[Reformed]] churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]]—both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] remained Lutheran because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with the French bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]], and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

==Philologist==
Leibniz the [[philologist]] was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars in his day, that [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] was the primeval language of the human race. He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] was the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. He puzzled over the origins of the [[Slavic languages]] and was fascinated by [[classical Chinese]]. Leibniz was also an expert in the [[Sanskrit]] language.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"/&gt;

He published the ''princeps editio'' (first modern edition) of the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] ''[[Chronicon Holtzatiae]]'', a Latin chronicle of the [[County of Holstein]].

==Sinophile==
[[File:Diagram of I Ching hexagrams owned by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1701.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams sent to Leibniz from [[Joachim Bouvet]]. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (2004), 117&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Leibniz was perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read ''[[Confucius]] Sinarum Philosophus'' on the first year of its publication,&lt;ref name="Mungello"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22 |doi=10.2307/1397760|jstor=1397760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [[Chinese character]]s were an unwitting form of his [[Characteristica universalis|universal characteristic]]. He noted with fascination how the ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams correspond to the [[binary numbers]] from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz, the ''I Ching'', and binary numbers, see Aiton (1985: 245–248). Leibniz's writings on Chinese civilization are collected and translated in Cook and Rosemont (1994), and discussed in Perkins (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz communicated his ideas of the binary system representing Christianity to the Emperor of China hoping it would convert him.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"/&gt; Leibniz may be the only major Western philosopher who attempted to accommodate Confucian ideas to prevailing European beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Daniel|title=Leibniz, China, and the Problem of Pagan Wisdom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/591609|website=Project Muse|publisher=Project Muse|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's attraction to [[Chinese philosophy]] originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt; The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of "simple substance" and "pre-established harmony" were directly influenced by [[Confucianism]], pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period that he was reading ''Confucius Sinarum Philosophus''.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt;

== As polymath ==
While making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in [[Vienna]] between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [[Harz mountains]]. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [[rapeseed oil]] was implemented. During a formal audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [[Concordat]] between the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [[mechanics]].

Leibniz also wrote a short paper, ''Primae veritates'', first published by [[Louis Couturat]] in 1903 (pp.&amp;nbsp;518–523)&lt;ref&gt;Later translated as Loemker 267 and Woolhouse and Francks 30&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing his views on [[metaphysics]]. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90.&lt;ref&gt;A VI, 4, n. 324, pp. 1643–1649 with the title: ''Principia Logico-Metaphysica''&lt;/ref&gt; Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.

==Posthumous reputation==
[[File:Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin]]

When Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the ''[[Théodicée]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{see also |Irenaean theodicy#Gottfried Leibniz}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose supposed central argument [[Voltaire]] lampooned in his popular book ''[[Candide]]'', which concludes with the character Candide saying, "''[[Non liquet]]''" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of "not proven". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his ''Candide'' bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced [[David Hume]] who read his ''[[Théodicée]]'' and used some of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v19n1/vasilyeu/vasilyeu-v19n1.pdf|title=Vasilyev, 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.

Much of Europe came to doubt that Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote ''Candide'' at least in part to discredit Leibniz's claim to having discovered calculus and Leibniz's charge that [[Newton's theory of universal gravitation]] was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Leibniz's long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the ''Nouveaux Essais'', which [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] read closely. In 1768, [[Louis Dutens]] edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Sophia of Hanover]], and her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], began.

In 1900, [[Bertrand Russell]] published a critical study of Leibniz's [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, [[Louis Couturat]] published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] and [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [[Bernhard Riemann]]). For example, Leibniz's phrase ''[[salva veritate]]'', meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [[Willard Quine]]'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [[Leroy Loemker]] (1904–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).

[[Nicholas Jolley]] has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;Jolley, 217–219&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[Principle of individuation|individuation]], and [[possible worlds]]. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [[history of ideas|ideas]] has revealed more clearly the 17th-century "Intellectual Revolution" that preceded the better-known [[industrial revolution|Industrial]] and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In 1985, the German government created the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize|Leibniz Prize]], offering an annual award of 1.55&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s for experimental results and 770,000 euros for theoretical ones. It was the worlds largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the [[Fundamental Physics Prize]].

The collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek – Niedersächische Landesbibliothek were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Letters from and to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz within the collection of manuscript papers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719082140/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22464%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 19 July 2010 |date= 16 May 2008 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 15 December 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and edition==
Leibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic [[Latin]], French and German. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two "philosophical" books, the ''Combinatorial Art'' and the ''[[Théodicée]]''. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], most notably the "De jure suprematum" a major consideration of the nature of [[sovereignty]].) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his ''[[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain]]'', which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of [[John Locke]]. Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's ''[[Nachlass]]'' become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has been so only in recent decades. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Vincent Placcius]], 15 September 1695, in [[Louis Dutens]] (ed.), ''Gothofridi Guillemi Leibnitii Opera Omnia'', vol. 6.1, 1768, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The extant parts of the critical edition&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;[http://www.leibniz-edition.de/ www.leibniz-edition.de]. See photograph there.&lt;/ref&gt; of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:
* Series 1. ''Political, Historical, and General Correspondence''. 25 vols., 1666–1706.
* Series 2. ''Philosophical Correspondence''. 3 vols., 1663–1700.
* Series 3. ''Mathematical, Scientific, and Technical Correspondence''. 8 vols., 1672–1698.
* Series 4. ''Political Writings''. 7 vols., 1667–99.
* Series 5. ''Historical and Linguistic Writings''. Inactive.
* Series 6. ''Philosophical Writings''. 7 vols., 1663–90, and ''Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain''.
* Series 7. ''Mathematical Writings''. 6 vols., 1672–76.
* Series 8. ''Scientific, Medical, and Technical Writings''. 1 vol., 1668–76.

The systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's ''Nachlass'' began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and decades of German division in two states with the cold war's "iron curtain" in between, separating scholars, and also scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with seven languages contained in some 200,000 pages of written and printed paper. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (''Länder'') academies. Since then the branches in [[Potsdam]], [[Münster]], [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]] have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] works.

=== Leibniz in popular media ===

Leibniz is receiving popular attention. The [[Google Doodle]] for July 1, 2018 celebrated Leibniz's 372nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;https://g.co/doodle/yf8w5ev{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-doodle-celebrates-mathematician-gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz/ accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2018/06/30/sundays-google-doodle-celebrates-mathematician-gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz/#49745a8e1398 accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[quill]], his hand is shown writing "Google" in binary [[ASCII]] code.

One of the earliest popular but indirect exposition of Leibniz was [[Voltaire]]'s satire ''[[Candide]]'', published in 1759. Leibniz was lampooned as Professor Pangloss, described as "the greatest philosopher of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]".

Leibniz also appears as one of the main historical figures in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s series of novels ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]''. Stephenson credits readings and discussions concerning Leibniz for inspiring him to write the series.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Neal. "How the Baroque Cycle Began" in P.S. of ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]'' Perennial ed. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''grid format''' has been an important component of [[avant-garde]] visual art throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Early appearances of the grid format include work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Kazimir Malevich]] and other artists belonging to the [[De stijl|De Stijl]] and Constructivist movements. The grid format also features prominently in minimalist and conceptual art of the 60's and 70's. The art theorist Rosalind Krauss writes,

"In the temporal dimension, the grid is an emblem of modernity by being just that: the form that is ubiquitous in the art of our century, while appearing nowhere, nowhere at all, in the art of the last one. In that great chain of reactions by which modernism was born out of the efforts of the nineteenth century, one final shift resulted in breaking the chain. By "discovering" the grid, cubism, de Stijl, Mondrian, Malevich . .. landed in a place that was out of reach of everything that went before. Which is to say, they landed in the present, and everything else was declared to be the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krauss|first=Rosalind|authorlink = Rosalind E. Krauss|title=Grids|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1050153.files/Grids_Rosalind%20Krauss.pdf|format= pdf |journal=[[October (journal)|October]]|date=Summer 1979|volume=9|pages=50–64 |jstor= 778321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable occurrences of the grid format include [[Sol LeWitt|Sol Lewitt]]'s modular structures, [[Chuck close|Chuck Close]]'s photorealist grids and more recently in [[Damien Hirst]]'s Spot Paintings. Other contemporary artists such as [[Penelope Umbrico]] have used it to imply non-hierarchical organization in massive collections of objects.

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], an '''immutable truth''' is an unchanging universal fact or reality that is not influenced by human opinion. According to [[positivism]], [[observation]] and [[experience]] are the only ways for immutable truths to become fully realized or understood.

'''James Hugo Sporleder''' (born February 21, 1938) is a civil rights activist recognized for his work with the [http://shsmo.org/manuscripts/stlouis/s0509.pdf Freedom of Residence Movement]:  the driving force behind the landmark [[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.|Jones v. Mayer]] Supreme Court case that invalidated racist practices of homebuilders in St. Louis, Missouri.

== Biography ==

{{Empty section|date=April 2016}}

== Freedom of Residence ==
&lt;br /&gt;He was the lead staff person of Freedom of Residence, an early fair housing organization in the 1960s.  Freedom of Residence was the driving force behind the landmark Jones v. Mayer Supreme Court case that invalidated racist practices of homebuilders in St. Louis.  The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse said this of [http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/a-look-back-couple-win-landmark-housing-rights-case-never/article_08928410-2a54-5da6-b749-243ac259a83f.html Jones v. Mayer], “This case was one of the most important civil rights precedents of the 1960s. It began when the Plaintiffs, prospective African-American homebuyers, applied to purchase a property from Defendant-home developer, who rejected them solely on the basis of their race. Plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983, and 2000e, alleging that a race-based denial of a home purchase violated federal civil rights laws, especially the requirement in 42 U.S.C. 1982 that: ‘All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.’”

Jim began working at Freedom of Residence in 1968 and the case was already en route to the Supreme Court.  He worked with the legal team, headed by Sam Lieberman, to bring to fruition this landmark case.  As important he then continued to push the implementation of the new law of the land through Freedom of Residence.  When he testified to the United States Senate in May of 1972 on these same unfair practices of lenders and real estate developers he said, “When Lockheed was in trouble, this government figured out a way to help.  When the oil industry was in trouble, we helped them.  When ITT got into trouble somebody figured a way to help out.  And now the people are in trouble.  The people are hurting and asking for help. . . . We cannot sweep these practices and exploitive operations of the combination of lenders, real estate dealers, insurance people, and politicians under the table.  It must stop.”  Always fighting for what was right.

== History ==
Jim also worked for the Urban League, the Nurse Home Visitation Program, the Judevine Center and Jeff Vander Lou, Inc. (JVL).  His work at JVL is the second highlight of his professional career.  He was the de facto Chief Operating Officer of JVL from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s working side by side with Macler Shepard the longtime leader and founder of the organization.  JVL was a community development organization working in the north city area bounded by Jefferson, Vandeventer and St. Louis Avenues.  JVL was a leader in the region in that it was run by local residents and produced affordable housing for both families and seniors, created an innovative partnership with Brown Shoe Company that led to a production plant in the neighborhood, opened a coffee shop and day care center.  Simply amazing and that type of work rarely gets accomplished today.

'''Late modernity''' (or '''liquid modernity''') is the characterization of today's highly developed global [[society|societies]] as the continuation (or [[social development|development]]) of [[modernity]] rather than as an element of the succeeding era known as [[postmodernity]], or the postmodern.

Introduced as 'liquid' modernity by the Polish-British sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]], late modernity is marked by the [[Globalization|global]] capitalist economies with their increasing privatisation of services and by the [[information revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Harris, ''Future Girl'' (2004) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus postmodernity==
[[Social theory|Social theorists]] and [[sociologists]] such as [[Scott Lash]], [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] maintain (against [[postmodernity|postmodernists]]) that modernization continues into the contemporary era, which is thus better conceived as a radical state of late modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Cools et al., ''Safety, Societal Problems and Citizens' Perceptions'' (2010) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; On [[technological change|technological]] and [[social change]]s since the 1960s, the concept of "late modernity" proposes that contemporary societies are a clear continuation of [[modernity|modern]] institutional transitions and cultural developments. Such authors talk about a [[reflexive modernization]] process: in Giddens' words, "social practices are constantly examined and reformed in the light of incoming information about those very practices, thus constitutively altering their character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernsocieties.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/seminar-two-classical-modernity-late-modernity/ Giddens, in "Classical modernity and late modernity"] (1990) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity now tends to be self-referring, instead of being defined largely in opposition to traditionalism, as with classical modernity.

Anthony Giddens does not dispute that important changes have occurred since "high" modernity, but he argues that we have not truly abandoned modernity. Rather, the modernity of contemporary society is a developed, radicalized, 'late' modernity—but still modernity, not postmodernity. In such a perspective, postmodernism appears only as a hyper-technological version of modernity.&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi et al., ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 126 and p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
The subject is constructed in late modernity against the backdrop of a fragmented world of competing and contrasting identities&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Craik, ''The Face of Fashion'' (London 1994) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and life-style cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The framing matrix of the late modern personality is the ambiguous way the fluid social relations of late modernity impinge on the individual, producing a reflexive and multiple self.&lt;ref&gt;John Mandalios, ''Civilization and the Human Subject'' (1999) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid modernity==
Zygmunt Bauman, who introduced the idea of liquid modernity, wrote that its characteristics are about the individual, namely increasing feelings of uncertainty and the privatization of [[ambivalence]]. It is a kind of chaotic continuation of modernity, where a person can shift from one social position to another in a fluid manner. Nomadism becomes a general trait of the 'liquid modern' man as he flows through his own life like a tourist, changing places, jobs, spouses, values and sometimes more{{mdash}}such as political or sexual orientation{{mdash}}excluding himself from traditional networks of support, while also freeing himself from the restrictions or requirements those networks impose.

Bauman stressed the new burden of responsibility that fluid modernism placed on the individual{{mdash}}traditional patterns would be replaced by self-chosen ones.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, ''Liquid Modernity'' (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Entry into the globalized society was open to anyone with their own stance and the ability to fund it, in a similar way as was the reception of travellers at the old-fashioned [[caravanserai]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a normative mindset with emphasis on shifting rather than on staying{{mdash}}on provisional in lieu of permanent (or 'solid') commitment{{mdash}}which (the new style) can lead a person astray towards a prison of their own [[existential]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown, in Neil Corcoran ed, ''Do you, Mr Jones?'' (London 2002) p. 196 and p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:31337 h4x0r.jpg|thumb|A "31337 h4x0r" laptop sticker, along with a [[Kevin Mitnick]] sticker]]
'''Leet''' (or "'''1337'''"), also known as '''eleet''' or '''leetspeak''', is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the [[Internet]]. It often uses character replacements  in ways that play on the similarity of their [[glyph]]s via [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many [[dialects]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|linguistic varieties]] in different [[online communities]].

The term "leet" is derived from the word ''[[elite]]'', used as an adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment, especially in the fields of [[online game|online gaming]] and [[Hacker (hobbyist)|computer hacking]]. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as ''1337'' or ''l33t''.

==History==
Leet originated within [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS) in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;Mitchell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;An Explanation of l33t Speak.&lt;/ref&gt; where having "elite" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms.  The [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Mello, John P.(2015) "[http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Google-Expands-Bug-Bounty-Program-81668.html] Google Expands Bug Bounty Program" February 2, 2015. ''E-Commerce Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or [[Internet Relay Chat]] [[system operators]] for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like [[Software cracking|cracking]] and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]].&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. 

Once the reserve of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], crackers, and [[script kiddie]]s, leet has since entered the mainstream.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; It is now also used to mock [[newbie|newbies]], also known colloquially as noobs, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider [[emoticon]]s and [[ASCII art]], like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance "@$$" (ass) and "$#!+" (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.

Leet symbols, especially the number 1337, are [[Internet meme]]s that have spilled over into popular culture. Signs that show the numbers "1337" are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across the Internet.

==Orthography==

One of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to [[orthography]], using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word.&lt;ref name=sterling&gt;Sterling, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goss 80"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use [[homoglyph]]s, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the [[argot]] (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the ''average'' reader ''cannot'' make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.

Some examples of leet include ''[[B1ff]]'' and ''[[Newbie|n00b]]'', a term for the stereotypical [[newbie]]; the l33t programming language; and the web-comic ''[[Megatokyo]]'', which contains characters who speak leet.

==Morphology==

Text rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive, recurring forms.

;''-xor'' suffix
:The meaning of this suffix is parallel with the English ''-er'' and ''-r'' suffixes (seen in ''hacker'' and ''lesser''),&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; in that it derives [[agent noun]]s from a verb [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]. It is realized in two different forms: ''-xor'' and ''-zor'', {{IPAc-en|-|s|ɔːr}} and {{IPAc-en|-|z|ɔːr}}, respectively. For example, the first may be seen in the word ''hax(x)or'' (''H4x0r'' in leet) {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|s|ɔːr}} and the second in ''[[pwn]]zor'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|z|ɔːr}}. Additionally, this [[nominalization]] may also be [[inflection|inflected]] with all of the suffixes of regular [[English verbs]]. The letter 'o' is often replaced with the numeral 0.

;''-age'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching ''-age'' to the base form of any verb. Attested derivations are ''pwnage'', ''skillage'',  and ''speakage''. However, leet provides exceptions; the word ''leetage'' is acceptable, referring to actively being ''leet''.&lt;ref name="goss 79"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; These nouns are often used with a form of "to be" rather than "to have," e.g., "that was pwnage" rather than "he has pwnage". Either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler "he pwns," but the former implies that the person is ''embodying'' the trait rather than merely possessing it.

;''-ness'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching ''-ness'' to any adjective. This is entirely the same as the English form, except it is used much more often in Leet. Nouns such as ''lulzness'' and ''leetness'' are derivations using this suffix.

;Words ending in ''-ed''
:When forming a past participle ending in ''-ed'', the Leet user may replace the ''-e'' with an apostrophe, as was common in [[poetry]] of previous centuries, (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwn'd"). Sometimes, the apostrophe is removed as well (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwnd"). The word ending may also be substituted by ''-t'' (e.g. ''pwned'' becomes ''pwnt'').&lt;ref name="blanc33"&gt;LeBlanc, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Use of the ''-&amp;'' suffix
:Words ending in ''-and'', ''-anned'', ''-ant'', or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an [[ampersand]] (''&amp;'') to express the ending sound (e.g. "This is the [[Sandbox (software development)|s&amp;box]]," "I'm sorry, you've been b&amp;", "&amp;hill/&amp;farm"). This is most commonly used with the word ''banned.'' An alternate form of "B&amp;" is "B7", as the ampersand is typed with the "7" key in the standard US keyboard layout.  It is often seen in the phrase "IBB7" (in before banned), which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site, channel, or board on which they are both posting.

==Grammar==

Leet can be pronounced as a single syllable, {{IPA|/ˈliːt/}}, rhyming with ''eat,'' by way of [[aphesis]] of the initial vowel of "elite". It may also be pronounced as two syllables, {{IPA|/ɛˈliːt/}}. Like [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard English.&lt;ref name=rome/&gt; The loose grammar, just like loose spelling, encodes some level of emphasis, ironic or otherwise. A reader must rely more on intuitive [[parsing]] of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure. In particular, speakers of leet are fond of [[verbing]] nouns, turning verbs into nouns (and back again) as forms of emphasis, e.g. "Austin rocks" is weaker than "Austin roxxorz" (note spelling), which is weaker than "Au5t1N is t3h r0xx0rz" (note grammar), which is weaker than something like "0MFG D00D /\Ü571N 15 T3H l_l83Я 1337 Я0XX0ЯZ" ([[SMS language#Common abbreviations|OMG]], dude, Austin is the [[über]]-elite rocks-er!). In essence, all of these mean "Austin rocks," not necessarily the other options. Added words and misspellings add to the speaker's enjoyment. Leet, like hacker slang, employs analogy in construction of new words. For example, if ''haxored'' is the past tense of the verb "to hack" (hack → haxor → haxored), then ''winzored'' would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of "to win," even if the reader had not seen that particular word before.

Leet has its own colloquialisms, many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of [[cyberculture]] and history.&lt;ref name="goss 81"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, while it may be referred to as a "[[cipher]]", a "dialect", or a "language", leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term ''leet'' itself is often written ''31337'', or ''1337'', and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, ''10100111001'' came to be used in its place, because it is the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form of ''1337'' decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This appears as an in-joke for technical illustrations such as these: [[:Commons:File:Ami encoding.svg|''(a)'']][[:Commons:File:Manchester encoding.svg|''(b)'']]&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the "[[All your base are belong to us]]" phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.

==Vocabulary==

Many words originally derived from leet slang have now become part of the modern [[Internet slang]], such as "[[pwn]]ed".&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as "[[teh]]" (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional misspellings,&lt;ref name="goss 83"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the "z" at the end of words ("skillz").&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is ''[[w00t]]'', an exclamation of joy.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; w00t is sometimes used as a [[backronym]] for "We owned the other team."

New words (or corruptions thereof) may arise from a need to make one's username unique. As any given Internet service reaches more people, the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced. While many users may wish to have the username "CatLover," for example, in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker. As such, degradations of the name may evolve, such as "C@7L0vr." As the leet cipher is highly dynamic, there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the "same" name, through combinations of spelling and transliterations.

Additionally, ''leet''—the word itself—can be found in the [[User (computing)|screen-names]] and [[gamertags]] of many Internet and video games. Use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill, though such an announcement may be seen as baseless [[hubris]].&lt;ref name=hope&gt;Computer Hope Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE: ANY FURTHER ADDITIONS MUST HAVE A PROPER REFERENCE OR WILL BE REMOVED PER WP:OR --&gt;

===Terminology and common misspellings===

''[[Warez]]'' (nominally {{IPAc-en|w|ɛər|z}}) is a plural shortening of "software", typically referring to cracked and redistributed software.&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; ''[[Phreaking]]'' refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other non-Internet equipment.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; ''[[Teh]]'' originated as a typographical error of "the", and is sometimes spelled ''t3h''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc34 35"&gt;LeBlanc, 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; ''j00'' takes the place of "you",&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; originating from the [[affricate]] sound that occurs in place of the [[palatal approximant]], {{IPA|/j/}}, when ''you'' follows a word ending in an [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[plosive]] consonant, such as {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}. Also, from German, is ''[[wiktionary:Über|über]]'', which means "over" or "above"; it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives, and is frequently written without the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over the ''u''.&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;Van de Velde &amp; Meuleman.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haxor and suxxor (suxorz)===

''Haxor'', and derivations thereof, is leet for "hacker",&lt;ref name="blanc30 32"&gt;LeBlanc, 30; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' (pronounced suck-zor) is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multi-user environments such as multiplayer video games and [[instant messaging]]; it, like ''haxor'', is one of the early leet words to use the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' is a modified version of "sucks" (the phrase "to suck"), and the meaning is the same as the English slang. Its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of ''roxxor'', and both can be used as a verb or a noun. The letters ''ck'' are often replaced with the Greek Χ (chi) in other words as well.

===n00b===
{{main|Newbie}}

Within leet, the term ''n00b'', and derivations thereof, is used extensively. The word means and derives from ''newbie'' (as in new and inexperienced or uninformed),&lt;ref name="goss 83"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name=acronym/&gt; and is used as a means of segregating them as less than the "elite," or even "normal," members of a group.

===Owned and pwned===
{{Main|Owned|Pwn}}

''Owned'' and ''pwn3d'' (generally pronounced "owned" and "poned", respectively) both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument (rather than just a win), or the successful hacking of a website or computer.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc32 33"&gt;LeBlanc, 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is a common characteristic of leet, the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms,&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt; ''ownage'' and ''pwnage'', which can refer to the situation of ''pwning'' or to the superiority of its subject (e.g., "He is a very good player. He is pwnage.").

===Pr0n&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pr0n]] --&gt;===

''Pr0n'' is [[slang]] for ''[[pornography]]''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; This is a deliberately inaccurate spelling/pronunciation for ''porn'',&lt;ref name=acronym&gt;The Acronym Finder.&lt;/ref&gt; where a zero is often used to replace the letter O. It is sometimes used in legitimate communications (such as email discussion groups, [[Usenet]], chat rooms, and Internet web pages) to circumvent language and [[content filter]]s, which may reject messages as offensive or [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. The word also helps prevent [[search engines]] from associating commercial sites with pornography, which might result in unwelcome traffic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Pr0n'' is also sometimes spelled backwards (n0rp) to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readers.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This can be observed by searching for "n0rp" on a search engine.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[ASCII art]] depicting pornographic images, or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware. ''Prawn'', a spoof of the misspelling, has started to come into use, as well; in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', a pornographer films his movies on "Prawn Island". Conversely, in the [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]'', ''[[prawn]]'', referring to a kind of [[crustacean]], is spelled ''pr0n'', leading to the creation of food items such as "pr0n chow mein".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">A '''literary element''', or '''narrative element''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lunsford|Horowitz|2005|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''element of literature'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constituent of all works of [[narrative]] [[fiction]]—a necessary feature of verbal storytelling that can be found in any written or spoken narrative. This distinguishes them from [[literary technique]]s, or non-universal features of literature that accompany the construction of a particular work rather than forming the essential characteristics of all narrative. For example, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Theme (narrative)|theme]], [[Character (arts)|character]] and [[Tone (literature)|tone]] are literary elements, whereas [[figurative language]], [[irony]], or [[foreshadowing]] would be considered literary techniques.

Literary elements aid in the discussion of and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be produced by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. For the most part, they are popular concepts that are not limited to any particular branch of [[literary criticism]], although they are most closely associated with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist method]] of professional literary criticism. There is no official definition or fixed list of terms of literary elements; however, they are a common feature of literary education at the [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] level, and a set of terms similar to the one below often appears in institutional student evaluation. For instance, the New York State Comprehensive English [[Regents Examinations|Regents Exam]] requires that students use and discuss literary elements relating to specific works in each of the three essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regents High School Comprehensive Examination in English|url=http://www.nysedregents.org/ComprehensiveEnglish/113/engl12013-exam.pdf|work=Office of State Assessment|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spectrograph causes the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler shift]]-induced frequency distribution of the collected light to manifest as a spatial distribution through differential refraction, revealing the amplitude of the rotation curve.

==Velocity profiles==
[[File:Nebula velocity profiles.jpg|thumb|300px|Typical velocity profiles of several nebulae observed using long-slit spectroscopy.]]
This technique can be used to observe the [[rotation curve]] of a galaxy, as those stars moving towards the observer are [[blueshift|blue-shifted]], while stars moving away are [[redshift|red-shifted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Long-slit spectroscopy can also be used to observe the expansion of [[optical depth|optically-thin]] nebulae. When the spectrographic slit extends over the diameter of a nebula, the lines of the velocity profile meet at the edges. In the middle of the nebula, the line splits in two, since one component is redshifted and one is blueshifted. The blueshifted component will appear brighter as it is on the "near side" of the nebula, and is as such subject to a smaller degree of [[attenuation]] as the light coming from the far side of the nebula. The tapered edges of the velocity profile stem from the fact that the material at the edge of the nebula is moving perpendicular to the line of sight and so its line of sight velocity will be zero relative to the rest of the nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Several effects can contribute to the transverse broadening of the velocity profile. Individual stars themselves rotate as they orbit, so the side approaching will be blueshifted and the side moving away will be redshifted. Stars also have random (as well as [[orbit]]al) motion around the galaxy, meaning any individual star may depart significantly from the rest relative to its neighbours in the rotation curve. In [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] this random motion is small compared to the [[Orbital eccentricity|low-eccentricity]] orbital motion, but this is not true for an [[elliptical galaxy]]. Molecular-scale [[Doppler broadening]] will also contribute.

==Advantages==
Long-slit spectroscopy can ameliorate problems with [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] when observing structures near a very [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminous]] source. The structure in question can be observed through a slit, thus [[Occultation|occulting]] the luminous source and allowing a greater [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. An example of this application would be the observation of the [[kinematics]] of [[Herbig–Haro object|Herbig-Haro objects]] around their parent star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A '''MET''' ('''M'''aterials, '''E'''nergy, and '''T'''oxicity) '''Matrix''' is an [[analysis]] tool used to evaluate various [[environmental impact]]s of a product over its [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]].  The tool takes the form of a 3x3 matrix with descriptive text in each of its cells.  One dimension of the matrix is composed of a qualitative input-output model that examines environmental concerns related to the product's materials use, energy use, and [[toxicity]].  The other dimension looks at the [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]] of the product through its production, use, and [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.  The text in each cell corresponds to the intersection of two particular aspects.  For example, this means that by looking at certain cells, one can examine aspects such as energy use during the production phase, or levels of [[toxicity]] that may be a concern during the [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;René van Berkel, Esther Willems, and Marije Lafleur (1997) "Development of an industrial ecology toolbox for the introduction of industrial ecology in enterprises - I" ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 1997, 5:1-2, pp 11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7413">'''Models of consciousness''' are used to illustrate and aid in understanding and explaining distinctive aspects [[consciousness]]. Sometimes the models are labeled '''theories of consciousness'''. [[Anil Seth]] defines such models as those that relate brain phenomena such as fast irregular electrical activity and widespread brain activation to properties of consciousness such as qualia. Seth allows for different types of models including mathematical, logical, verbal and conceptual models.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Seth, A. K. &amp; Baars, B. J. 2005 Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'' 14, 140-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural correlates of consciousness ==
{{Main|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[Neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCC) formalism is used as a major step towards explaining consciousness. The NCC are defined to constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, and consequently sufficient for consciousness. In this formalism, consciousness is viewed as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system. &lt;ref&gt; Crick F. and Koch C. (1990) Towards a neurobiological theory of consciousness. ''Seminars in Neuroscience'' Vol2, 263–275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Koch, Christof (2004). The quest for consciousness: a neurobiological approach. Englewood, US-CO: Roberts &amp; Company Publishers. {{ISBN|0-9747077-0-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Squire, Larry R. (2008). ''Fundamental neuroscience'' (3rd ed.). Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-374019-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness ==
{{Main|Eight-circuit model of consciousness}}

[[Timothy Leary]] introduced&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology''. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]] elaborated  the [[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]] as hypothesis that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".

== Multiple drafts model ==
{{Main|Multiple drafts model}}
[[Daniel Dennett]] proposed a physicalist, information processing based [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness described more fully in his 1991 book, [[Consciousness Explained]].

== Dehaene–Changeux model ==
{{Main|Dehaene–Changeux model}}

The [[Dehaene–Changeux model]] (DCM), also known as the global neuronal workspace or the global cognitive workspace model is a computer model of the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlates of consciousness]]  programmed as a neural network.  [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] introduced this model in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. ''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing''. Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with [[Bernard Baars]]'s [[Global workspace theory]] for consciousness. 

== Clouding of consciousness ==
{{Main|Clouding of consciousness}}
[[Clouding of consciousness]], also known as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in medicine denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium&lt;ref&gt;Plum and Posner's diagnosis of stupor and coma. Oxford University Press. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. It is part of an overall model where there's regulation of the "overall level" of the consciousness of the brain and aspects responsible for "arousal" or "wakefulness" and awareness of oneself and of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Caraceni; Luigi Grassi (2011). ''Delirium: Acute Confusional States in Palliative Medicine''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Electromagnetic theories of consciousness ==
{{Main|Electromagnetic theories of consciousness}}
 
[[Electromagnetic theories of consciousness]] propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan. ''The Nature of Consciousness''. {{ISBN|0-595-12215-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan (2012). "The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness: a testable hypothesis about the characteristics of conscious as opposed to non-conscious fields". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies''. 19 (11-12): 191–223.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some electromagnetic theories are also quantum mind theories of consciousness; examples include [[quantum brain dynamics]] (QBD).&lt;ref&gt;Mari Jibu; Kunio Yasue. ''Quantum brain dynamics and consciousness''. {{ISBN|1-55619-183-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orchestrated objective reduction ==
{{Main|Orchestrated objective reduction}}
 
Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model is based on the hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from quantum processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be associated with molecular structures called [[microtubules]]. The hypothesis was advanced by [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]] and has been the subject of extensive debate&lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Consciousness in the universe: A review of the 'Orch OR' theory". Physics of Life Reviews. Elsevier. 11 (1): 39–78. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.08.002. {{PMID|24070914}}. &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Reply to seven commentaries on "Consciousness in the universe: Review of the 'Orch OR' theory"". ''Physics of Life Reviews''. Elsevier. 11 (1): 104–112. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness ==

Min proposed in a 2010 paper a Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Min, B. K. (2010). A thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness. ''Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling'', 7(1), 10. https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1742-4682-7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests consciousness as a "mental state embodied through TRN-modulated synchronization of thalamocortical networks". In this model the [[thalamic reticular nucleus]] (TRN) is suggested as ideally suited for controlling the entire cerebral network, and responsible (via [[GABAergic]] networking) for synchronization of neural activity.

== Functionalism (philosophy of mind) ==
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}

Functionalism is a view in the theory of the mind. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.

== Sociology of human consciousness ==
{{Main|Sociology of human consciousness}} 

[[Sociology of human consciousness]] uses the theories and methodology of sociology to explain human consciousness. The theory and its models emphasize the importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. It argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9047">A '''moral entrepreneur''' is an individual, group or formal organization that seeks to influence a group to adopt or maintain a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. Moral entrepreneurs are those who take the lead in labeling a particular behaviour and spreading or popularizing this label throughout society. This can include attributing negative labels to behaviour as well as the removal of negative labels, positively labeling, or removing positive labels. The moral entrepreneur may press for the creation or enforcement of a norm for any number of reasons, altruistic or selfish. Such individuals or groups also hold the power to generate [[moral panic]]; similarly multiple moral entrepreneurs may have conflicting goals and work to counteract each other. Some examples of moral entrepreneurs are: [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving|MADD (mothers against drunk driving)]], the [[anti-tobacco]] lobby, the [[gun control]] lobby, anti-pornography groups, [[LGBT social movements]], and the [[Opposition to legalized abortion|pro-life]] and [[Support for the legalization of abortion|pro-choice]] movements (an example of two moral entrepreneurs working against each other on a single issue).

== Rule creator and rule enforcer==
The term "moral entrepreneur" was coined by [[Howard S. Becker]]. In his view, moral entrepreneurs fall into roughly two categories: ''rule creators'', and ''rule enforcers''. 

Rule creators generally express the conviction that some kind of threatening social evil exists that must be combated. They can be seen as moral crusaders, who are concerned chiefly with the successful persuasion of others, but are not concerned with the means by which this persuasion is achieved. Successful moral crusades are generally dominated by those in the upper social strata of society (Becker, 1963). They often include religious groups, lawmaking bodies, and stakeholders in a given field. There is political competition in which these moral crusaders originate crusades aimed at generating reform, based on what they think is moral, therefore defining deviance. Moral crusaders must have power, public support, generate public awareness of the issue, and be able to propose a clear and acceptable solution to the problem (Becker, 1963). The degree of a moral entrepreneur's power is highly dependent upon the social and cultural context (Reinarman, 1994). Social position determines one's ability to define and construct reality; therefore, the higher one's social position, the greater his or her moral value.

After a time, crusaders become dependent upon experts or professionals, who serve to legitimize a moral creed on technical or scientific grounds. Rule enforcers, such as policemen, are compelled by two drives: the need to justify their own role, and the need to win respect in interactions. They are in a bind; if they show too much effectiveness one might say they are not needed, and if they show too little effectiveness one might say they are failing. Rule enforcers just feel the need to enforce the rule because that is their job; they are not really concerned with the content of the rule. As rules are changed, something that was once acceptable may now be punished and vice versa. Such officials tend to take a pessimistic view of [[human nature]] because of constant exposure to willful deviance.

The sociology of [[social control]] seeks to predict and explain the behavior of both rule creators and rule enforcers. The creation and application of explicit rules are seen as characteristics of moralism, or the tendency to treat people as enemies. Among the social conditions that are identified as sources of moralism are status superiority and social remoteness between the agents of social control and the people whose behavior they regulate. Thus, the most likely targets of both rule creators and rule enforcers are those who are socially inferior, culturally different, and personally unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald. "Making Enemies." Pp. 144-57 in The Social Structure of Right and Wrong. San Diego, CA: Academic Press. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It is their behavior that is most likely to seem objectionable and to call forth the strenuous efforts of moral entrepreneurs. Once moral entrepreneurs or claimsmakers define the behaviors of these individuals or groups as deviant or a moral threat, then the entire group may be seen by society as a [[deviant subculture]]. Similarly, they or their behavior may be seen as the roots of the next moral panic. This is often the goal of the moral entrepreneurs; to rally the support of society behind their specific aims through the redefining of behaviors and groups as deviant or problematic. Alternately, those individuals with social power, wealth, high status, or large public support bases are the most likely to assert this power and to act as a moral entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggle, Justin and Holmes, Malcolm. "Blowing Smoke: Status Politics and the Smoking Ban". 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social problems ==
[[Social issue|Social problems]] are born largely from socially constructed campaigns by moral entrepreneurs. In the [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] approach to social problems (including [[labeling theory]]), social policy is not seen as the implementation of a shared consensus about what is best. Rather the society is viewed as consisting of a plurality of understandings of what is best. In order for social policy to arise, some individual or group has to initiate a social movement whose task is to articulate a definition of a social problem such that a desired social policy is consistent with this definition of the problem. These individuals or groups are referred to as moral entrepreneurs. 

Moral entrepreneurs are critical for moral emergence because they call attention to issues or even 'create' issues by using language that names, interprets, and dramatizes them.&lt;ref&gt;Finnemore and Sikkink. International Norm Dynamics and Political Change. in "International Organization." 52 (autumn): Pp. 887-917. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typifying]] is a prominent rhetorical tool employed by moral entrepreneurs when attempting to define social problems. Typification is when claimsmakers characterize a problem's nature which is most commonly done by suggesting that a problem is best understood from a particular perspective (i.e. medical, moral, criminal, political, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Best, Joel. "typification and Social Problems Construction." Pp. 3-10 in Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, moral entrepreneurs often engage in typification by claiming that certain behaviors or groups are acting in morally dangerous ways. Moral entrepreneurs are more successful at defining deviance when they can identify an entire group with a particular behavior and create fear that the behavior represents a danger not only to the group but also to the rest of society. Through typification and the creation of a dangerous class, moral entrepreneurs aim to place the activities of a particular group on the public's agenda and label certain actions as social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Anne L., and Helen M. Ingram. Deserving and Entitled: Social Constructions and Public Policy. Albany: State University of New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimsmakers in areas such as the problem of drinking and driving, child abuse, or date rape play an important role in the creation of the rhetoric that creates and determines what is deviant and what is a considered a problem in society.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Nathan. "How Social Problems are Born". 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Through creating and popularizing definitions for terms relevant to the issue (such as "rape", "abuse" and "drunk"), claimsmakers and moral entrepreneurs can not only further their interests, but also sway the social movement and understanding of the issues themselves.

== Lawmaking ==

Moral entrepreneurs are also central in the construction of social deviance, including the development of drug scares. The role of moral entrepreneurs in this instance, for example, is to assign responsibility to drugs for an array of preexisting public problems. (The Social Construction of Drug Scares, Reinarman). Over the course of the past century, drug laws have been passed with the intent of reducing drug problems; even if they have not done this, they have certainly expanded the power of the social control held by moral entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Reinarman, Craig. "The Social Construction of Drug Scares". 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of laws created by moral entrepreneurs are: [[Prohibition in the United States]] 1919, San Francisco's anti-opium den ordinance of 1875, and the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914.

Sustainable [[energy]] management in the [[wastewater]] sector applies the concept of [[sustainable management]] to the energy involved in the treatment of wastewater. The energy used by the wastewater sector is usually the largest portion of energy consumed by the urban water and wastewater utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeHaas|first=David|date=November 2015|title=WASTEWATER TREATMENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY|url=http://www.watercentre.org/awa-journal-november-2015-article/|journal=Australian Water Association Journal|volume=November 2015|pages=53–58|via=International Water Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising costs of electricity, the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions of the energy sector and the growing need to mitigate global warming, are driving wastewater utilities to rethink their energy management, adopting more energy efficient technologies and processes and investing in on-site renewable energy generation.

== Importance ==
Among the water and wastewater services of a city, wastewater treatment is usually the most energy intense process.&lt;ref&gt;Cook S., Hall M., Gregory A. (2012). Energy use in the provision and consumption of urban water in Australia: an update. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, Australia. Prepared for the Water Services Association of Australia. A. P. f. t. W. S. A. o. A. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, [[CSIRO]].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wastewater treatment plants are designed with the purpose of treating the influent sewage to a set quality before discharging it back into a water body, without real concern for the energy consumption of the treating units of a plant. These facilities play the important role to protect not only the water systems but also the human health, preventing the discharge of pathogens normally present in the municipal sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery|last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Tchobanoglous G., Stensel H. D., Tsuchihashi R., Burton F. L.|first=|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the key role of wastewater facilities, energy consumption can not be ignored anymore because of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce the emissions to mitigate global warming, as established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1997 and most recently, by the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2016). Paris Agreement. United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is uncertainty concerning energy costs. Because for a wastewater utility energy costs represent the second highest cost after labour,&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Claudia. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; an increase in energy rate would further increase the operational budget of a municipality, and consequently, the service rates for consumers. 
 
Therefore, it is important for the wastewater sector to invest in strategies to limit the demand of energy from the grid in order to mitigate both costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

== Global challenges ==
[[Population growth]], [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], [[climate change]] and increasing demand for [[natural resource]]s are among the future biggest challenges for the urban wastewater sector.

=== Population growth and urbanisation ===
World population and population density in urban settlements are expected to growth by 32% and 66% by 2050, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision, (ST/ESA/SER.A/366), United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision, Key Findings and Advance Tables. Working Paper No. ESA/P/WP.241., United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in population is expected to increase the volume of wastewater and [[sewage sludge]] requiring treatment. To handle a higher volume of sewage and sewage sludge, it is necessary to upgrade the existing wastewater facilities and the collection networks to collect, store and treat the expected additional volume. Therefore, an increase in volume translates in high future investment costs for a sector that has a low cost recovery rate.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2015). East Asia and Pacific Wastewater to Energy Processes: a Technical Note for Utility Managers in EAP countries, World bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as shown by Mizuta,&lt;ref&gt;Mizuta K., Shimada M. (2010). "Benchmarking energy consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants in Japan." Water Science and Technology '''62'''(10): 2256-2262.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a direct correlation between the volume of sewage treated and the energy consumption of a wastewater treatment plant. Hence, a rise in energy demand is expected with the upgrading of the existing wastewater facilities and the construction of new ones to cope with future population increase.

=== Climate change ===
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have almost doubled between 1970 and 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in greenhouse gases is held responsible for the changes in climate that have caused impacts on natural systems across all continents and oceans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;IPCC (2014). ''Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers''. IPCC Assessment Report. '''5'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, climate change has affected the [[water cycle]], increasing the precipitation intensity and variability, increasing in this way the risks of floods and droughts in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, B. C., Z. W. Kundzewicz, S. Wu and J. P. Palutikof, Eds., 2008: ''Climate Change and Water. Technical Paper of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'', IPCC Secretariat, Geneva, 210 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes that have affected the water cycle have had substantial impacts on the aquatic ecosystems, increasing and worsening the stressors already affecting these systems. Nutrient loading represents one of those stressors as, with the change in precipitation patterns, it is expected a substantial increase in nutrients entering aquatic ecosystems due to increased erosion events and frequent sewage systems overflows. Because wastewater treatment plants discharge the treated wastewater in aquatic [[ecosystem]]s, the target [[Nutrient loading|nutrient load]] of these ecosystems affects the level of treatment that a wastewater treatment plant has to perform on the wastewater before being allowed to discharge it.&lt;ref&gt;Van DijK, A. (2015). "Water resources, climate change and energy". ''Climate, Energy and Water''. C. U. Press''':''' 6-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher native levels of nutrients in the receiving water bodies force wastewater treatment plants to perform more stringent nutrients removal from the wastewater before dispose of it. In addition to stricter discharge limits, future standards for currently unregulated contaminants are most likely to be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell A. S., Hoppock D. C., Webber M. E. (2010). "Energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants in the United States: A case study of the energy-water nexus." ''Sustainability'' '''2'''(4): 945-962.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of more stringent limits and new treatment requirements might further increase the already significant energy demand of these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Venkatesh G., Brattebø H. (2011). "Analysis of chemicals and energy consumption in water and wastewater treatment, as cost components: Case study of Oslo, Norway." ''Urban Water Journal'' '''8'''(3): 189-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population growth and climate change are increasing the energy needs of wastewater facilities. Because [[fossil fuel]]s are still the most diffused source of energy, providing more than half of the global energy needs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3.|title=What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wastewater sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuel-based energy sources. Electricity, for example, is sourced from the electricity [[Grid energy storage|grid]] while gas and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] are generally used on-site for heating and to run backup [[Engine-generator|generators]]. High consumption of [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy makes the wastewater sector an indirect contributor to greenhouse gas emissions since fossil fuels are one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, contributing for 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions globally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resource recovery ===
The pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and the increasing demand for natural resources is compelling the wastewater sector to develop innovative and more efficient practices to operate. Wastewater contains energy, nutrients and other organic and inorganic resources that can be successfully recovered and used in a broad range of applications. Energy can be recovered as [[biogas]]&lt;ref&gt;Askari, Mohammad Bagher, Fatemeh, Golestanian, Saman, Motraz, Motamedi Mirhosseiny, Leili (2015). "Advantages and Disadvantages of Biogas Energy."

"Renewable energy from wastewater – Practical aspects of integrating a wastewater treatment plant into local energy supply concepts." ''Journal of Cleaner Production''&lt;/ref&gt; Biogas is an energy source with a wide range of uses, whereas heat has proven valuable for heating and cooling applications of buildings. Among the nutrients, [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] can be recovered as [[struvite]] for fertilisers, a very important application since phosphate resources are limited and depletable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/lets-talk-phosphorus-depletion/.|title=Let's talk about phosphorus depletion|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composted sewage sludge finds applications in agricultural setting and urban gardens as soil amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Hefa, Xu, Weipu, Liu, Junliang, Zhao, Qingjian, He, Yanqing, Chen, Gang (2007). "Application of composted sewage sludge (CSS) as a soil amendment for turfgrass growth." ''Ecological Engineering'' '''29'''(1): 96-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides energy and nutrients, the effluent from the wastewater treatment plants can be reused as quality irrigation water both in agricultural and landscape applications. The reuse of treated water is especially valuable in countries with limited rainfall events or long periods of [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlosoroff, Saul. (2007).

Dordrecht, Springer Netherlands''':''' 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt; All these possibilities are changing the vision of wastewater management and the role of wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater treatment plants have the potential not only to treat the wastewater but also to become resource recovery facilities&lt;ref&gt;Römgens Ben,  Kruizinga Eelco (2013).

== Energy ==
Effective strategies adopted by wastewater utilities to reduce energy consumption and dependence from fossil fuel-based energy sources include increasing energy efficiency and generating renewable energy on site.

=== Energy efficiency ===
Since the recognition of anthropogenic causes of climate change in the late 1980s and the identification of the energy sector as one of the main contributors, there has been a global effort to investigate the energy consumption of human activities and their indirect contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe the energy analysis of the wastewater sector was conducted adopting mainly two strategies. Germany (MURL, 1999) and Switzerland (BUWAL, 1994), for example, developed energy management manuals for wastewater treatment plants and reduced their energy consumption by 38% and 50%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wett B., Buchauer K., Fimml C. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuals provided wastewater utilities with energy targets to achieve. On the other hand, in 1999 Austria promoted benchmarking that allowed annual comparison of wastewater treatment plants energy performances. This comparison stimulated a competition among the wastewater treatment plants and the aspiration to improve their efficiency, which led Austria to be one of the first countries in the world to achieve energy neutrality in the wastewater sector. The energy benchmarking process has allowed wastewater treatment plants to identify their most energy-consuming assets and possible inefficiencies, and target them to reduce their energy demand. For example, the inefficiency of the aeration process identified by multiple studies&lt;ref&gt;Belloir C., Stanford C., Soares A. (2015). "Energy benchmarking in wastewater treatment plants: the importance of site operation and layout." ''Environmental Technology'' '''36'''(2): 260-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, O., Keil, S., Fimml, C. (2011). "Examples of energy self-sufficient municipal nutrient removal plants." ''Water Science and Technology'' '''64'''(1): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has allowed the development of more energy efficient oxidation units, with a possible energy saving of about 20% to 50% in some cases according to Frijns&lt;ref&gt;Frijns J., Middleton R., Uijterlinde C., Wheale G. (2012). "Energy efficiency in the European water industry: learning from best practices." ''Journal of Water and Climate Change'' '''3'''(1): 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[EPA Sustainability|EPA]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2013). ''Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater Facilities''. U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
&lt;/ref&gt; study.

=== Renewable energy generation ===
Increased energy efficiency has allowed wastewater treatment plants to comply with discharge limits reducing the energy demand even up to 50%&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; without affecting treatment performances. However, energy efficiency strategies by themselves are not sufficient to achieve independence from the electricity grid and fossil fuel-based energy sources. To achieve energy neutrality, multiple studies have looked at the feasibility of integrating a variety of renewable energy sources into wastewater treatment plants. The wastewater itself is a carrier of energy and a theoretical calculation, based on the characteristic of the sewage, shows that the composition of the embedded energy is 80% thermal energy and 20% chemical energy.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Tarallo (2014). ''UTILITIES OF THE FUTURE ENERGY FINDINGS'', WERF.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal energy can be recovered as heat while the chemical energy is recovered as biogas. 
 
Renewable energy generation on site, in addition to increased energy efficiency, has already allowed at least twelve plants worldwide not only to achieve energy neutrality but also to produce more energy than they need.&lt;ref&gt;Gu Y., Li Y., Li X., Luo P., Wang H., Robinson Z. P., Wang X., Wu J., Li F.(2017). "The feasibility and challenges of energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment plants." ''Applied Energy''&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency programs and renewable energy generation have proven successful in diminishing the dependence of the wastewater sector from the energy grid, reducing treatment costs and the environmental impact associated with the grid connection.

== Advantages of on-site renewable energy generation ==
The production and recovery of energy of site offers numerous advantages contributing to operation and management cost reduction of the treatment processes, source of revenue, contribution to waste management and the cost associated with it and increased resilience in case of power shortage.
 
One of the main advantages of energy generation on site is the less stringent dependence from the electricity grid and the cost mitigation associated with it. Depending on the level of renewable energy generation, wastewater treatment plants can disconnect from the main grid when the electricity is the most expensive, usually during peak hours and simply avoid the more elevated price of these periods. When [[Feed-in tariff|feed in tariffs]] are in place, wastewater treatment plants can sell electricity to the grid and reduce costs through the cost recovery of the sold energy. In some cases, energy utilities offer [https://energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid/demand-response demand response programs], in which a wastewater utility is given a financial incentive if it disconnects when requested by the energy utility. This helps the energy utilities to mitigate energy peak demands reducing the risks of blackout, and it is source of revenue for the wastewater utilities.

In countries where a r[[Mandatory renewable energy target|enewable energy target]] has been introduced, the production of renewable energy allows the wastewater sector to get a certificate for every unit of power they produce. The certificates are then bought by the electricity retailers, that surrender them every year to comply with the renewable energy regulation.

Another advantage of renewable energy production, in specific of [[biogas]] from [[sewage sludge]], is the contribution to waste management. In fact the recovery of the chemical energy involves the reduction of the sewage sludge volume. A smaller volume of sewage sludge is cheaper to transport and dispose of, decreasing operational costs.

Moreover, a diversify portfolio of energy source can contribute to a more resilient response in case of energy shortage and grid problems.

== Barriers to on-site renewable energy generation ==
Despite the numerous advantages offered by on-site renewable energy generation, wastewater utilities are experiencing several difficulties in integrating renewables in their facilities.
 
From a survey conducted by Beca&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BECA|first=|date=November 2015|title=OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE AUSTRALIAN WATER SECTOR|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2016/01/Opportunities-for-renewable-energy-in-the-Australian-water-sector.pdf|journal=Arena|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it emerged that one of the biggest barrier is that energy generation is not core business for wastewater utilities and renewable energy projects come with technical challenges and high initial investment costs. 
Moreover, each plant presents differences and it requires a customised solution for each situation, making it hard to generalise solution for the all sector. There is a lack of guidelines and roadmaps to follow, so each utility has to create specific solutions for their wastewater treatment plants.

The changing price of electricity connected with the fossil fuel price can affect the return time on the investment while the fast changing regulatory panorama increases the uncertainty of the investment and the financial value of it. This can create an unsustainable situation, where  investments in renewables projects can happens only when there are subsidies given by the government.

In the specific situation of biogas production, poor management can increase the fugitive emission of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation.

'''Neology''' is the coining of new words, from the Greek root (Neo-: new, and Logos-: the word). This practice may be compared with other less mentally intensive, although sometimes computationally intensive forms of [[wordplay]] such as [[anagram]]s and [[acrostics]], as well as fully developed theories or practices of language, such as [[aphorisms]], [[poetics]], and literary essays.

Sometimes neology is seen as related to the development of new [[-ism|isms]], since a new word can mean a new idea.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Specific usages==

{{17th Century Scholasticism}}
Neology is the name given to the [[natural theology]] of [[Germany]] or the rationalisation of the [[Christian]] [[religion]]. It was preceded by slightly less radical [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolffism]].

[[Proton]]s are symbolically represented by red spheres, and [[neutron]]s by blue spheres.]]

{{Nuclear physics}}

In [[nuclear physics]] and [[nuclear chemistry]], a '''nuclear reaction''' is semantically considered to be the process in which two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], or else a nucleus of an atom and a [[subatomic particle]] (such as a [[proton]], [[neutron]], or high [[energy]] [[electron]]) from outside the atom, collide to produce one or more [[nuclide]]s that are different from the nuclide(s) that began the process. Thus, a nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another. If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then separate without changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply referred to as a type of nuclear [[scattering]], rather than a nuclear reaction.

In principle, a reaction can involve more than two [[particle]]s [[collision|colliding]], but because the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the same place is much less than for two nuclei, such an event is exceptionally rare (see [[triple alpha process]] for an example very close to a three-body nuclear reaction). "Nuclear reaction" is a term implying an '''induced''' changing in a nuclide, and thus it does not apply to any type of [[radioactive decay]] (which by definition is a spontaneous process).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Natural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between [[cosmic ray]]s and matter, and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear energy, at an adjustable rate, on demand. Perhaps the most notable nuclear reactions are the [[nuclear chain reaction]]s in [[fissionable]] materials that produce induced [[nuclear fission]], and the various [[nuclear fusion]] reactions of light elements that power the energy production of the Sun and stars.

Nuclear reactions may be shown in a form similar to chemical equations, for which [[invariant mass]] must balance for each side of the equation, and in which transformations of particles must follow certain conservation laws, such as conservation of charge and baryon number (total atomic [[mass number]]). An example of this notation follows:

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → He + ?
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||?.
|}
To balance the equation above for mass, charge and mass number, the second nucleus to the right must have atomic number 2 and mass number 4; it is therefore also helium-4. The complete equation therefore reads:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → n + He
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]].
|}
or more simply:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → 2 He
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||2&amp;nbsp;[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]].
|}

Instead of using the full equations in the style above, in many situations a compact notation is used to describe nuclear reactions. This style of the form A(b,c)D is equivalent to A + b producing c + D. Common light particles are often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d for [[deuteron]], α representing an [[alpha particle]] or [[helium-4]], β for [[beta particle]] or electron, γ for [[gamma photon]], etc. The reaction above would be written as [[lithium-6|Li-6]](d,α)α.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/stars/FusionHydrogenRate.html The Astrophysics Spectator: Hydrogen Fusion Rates in Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen at the University of Manchester, using alpha particles directed at nitrogen &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + α → &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + p.&amp;nbsp; This was the first observation of an induced nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus. Eventually, in 1932 at Cambridge University, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford's colleagues [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7, to split the nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as "splitting the atom", although it was not the modern [[nuclear fission]] reaction later discovered in heavy elements, in 1938 by the German scientists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm Cockcroft and Walton split lithium with high energy protons April 1932.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902195556/http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy conservation==
[[Kinetic energy]] may be released during the course of a reaction ([[chemical reaction#Exothermic reactions|exothermic reaction]]) or kinetic energy may have to be supplied for the reaction to take place ([[chemical reaction#Endothermic reactions|endothermic reaction]]). This can be calculated by reference to a table of very accurate particle rest masses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Compositions/index.html a table of atomic masses]&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: according to the reference tables, the {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} nucleus has a [[standard atomic weight]] of 6.015 [[atomic mass unit]]s (abbreviated [[u]]), the deuterium has 2.014 u, and the helium-4 nucleus has 4.0026 u. Thus:
* the sum of the rest mass of the individual nuclei = 6.015 + 2.014 = 8.029 u;
* the total rest mass on the two helium-nuclei = 2 × 4.0026 = 8.0052 u;
* missing rest mass = 8.029 – 8.0052 = 0.0238 atomic mass units.

In a nuclear reaction, the total [[conservation of energy|(relativistic) energy is conserved]]. The "missing" rest mass must therefore reappear as kinetic energy released in the reaction; its source is the nuclear [[binding energy]]. Using Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², the amount of energy released can be determined. We first need the energy equivalent of one [[atomic mass unit]]:
: 1&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;''c²''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1.66054&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(2.99792&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s)²&amp;nbsp;
: =&amp;nbsp;1.49242&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;(m/s)²&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.49242&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J ([[joule]])&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]]&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;1.60218&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J)
: =&amp;nbsp;931.49&amp;nbsp;MeV,
: so 1&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;''c²''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;931.49&amp;nbsp;MeV.

Hence, the energy released is 0.0238 × 931 MeV = 22.2 [[MeV]].

Expressed differently: the mass is reduced by 0.3%, corresponding to 0.3% of 90&amp;nbsp;PJ/kg is 270&amp;nbsp;TJ/kg.

This is a large amount of energy for a nuclear reaction; the amount is so high because the binding energy per [[nucleon]] of the helium-4 nucleus is unusually high, because the He-4 nucleus is "[[magic number (physics)|doubly magic]]". (The He-4 nucleus is unusually stable and tightly bound for the same reason that the helium atom is inert: each pair of protons and neutrons in He-4 occupies a filled '''1s''' [[nuclear orbital]] in the same way that the pair of electrons in the helium atom occupy a filled '''1s''' [[atomic orbital|electron orbital]]). Consequently, alpha particles appear frequently on the right hand side of nuclear reactions.

The energy released in a nuclear reaction can appear mainly in one of three ways:
*kinetic energy of the product particles (fraction of the kinetic energy of the charged nuclear reaction products can be directly converted into electrostatic energy);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|last2=Et.|first2=al.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|date=2013|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*emission of very high energy [[photon]]s, called [[gamma ray]]s;
*some energy may remain in the nucleus, as a [[metastable]] [[energy level]].

When the product nucleus is metastable, this is indicated by placing an [[asterisk]] ("*") next to its atomic number. This energy is eventually released through [[nuclear decay]].

A small amount of energy may also emerge in the form of [[X-ray]]s. Generally, the product nucleus has a different atomic number, and thus the configuration of its [[electron shell]]s is wrong. As the electrons rearrange themselves and drop to lower energy levels, internal transition X-rays (X-rays with precisely defined [[emission line]]s) may be emitted.

==Q-value and energy balance==
In writing down the reaction equation, in a way analogous to a [[chemical equation]], one may in addition give the reaction energy on the right side:
:Target nucleus + projectile → Final nucleus + ejectile + ''Q''.

For the particular case discussed above, the reaction energy has already been calculated as Q = 22.2&amp;nbsp;MeV. Hence:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → 2 He + 22.2 MeV
--&gt;
: {| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||2&amp;nbsp;[[helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||22.2&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]].
|}

The reaction energy (the "Q-value") is positive for exothermal reactions and negative for endothermal reactions, opposite to the similar expression in [[chemistry]]. On the one hand, it is the difference between the sums of kinetic energies on the final side and on the initial side. But on the other hand, it is also the difference between the nuclear rest masses on the initial side and on the final side (in this way, we have calculated the [[Q value (nuclear science)|Q-value]] above).

==Reaction rates==
If the reaction equation is balanced, that does not mean that the reaction really occurs. The rate at which reactions occur depends on the particle energy, the particle [[flux]] and the reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]]. An example of a large repository of reaction rates is the REACLIB database, as maintained by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics]].

==Neutrons vs. ions==
In the initial collision which begins the reaction, the particles must approach closely enough so that the short range [[strong force]] can affect them. As most common nuclear particles are positively charged, this means they must overcome considerable [[electrostatics|electrostatic repulsion]] before the reaction can begin. Even if the target nucleus is part of a neutral [[atom]], the other particle must penetrate well beyond the [[electron cloud]] and closely approach the nucleus, which is positively charged. Thus, such particles must be first accelerated to high energy, for example by:
*[[particle accelerator]]s;
*[[nuclear decay]] (alpha particles are the main type of interest here, since beta and gamma rays are rarely involved in nuclear reactions);
*very high temperatures, on the order of millions of degrees, producing [[thermonuclear]] reactions;
*[[cosmic ray]]s.

Also, since the force of repulsion is proportional to the product of the two charges, reactions between heavy nuclei are rarer, and require higher initiating energy, than those between a heavy and light nucleus; while reactions between two light nuclei are the most common ones.

[[Neutron]]s, on the other hand, have no electric charge to cause repulsion, and are able to initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to [[thermal neutron|thermal equilibrium at room temperature]]), the neutron's [[de Broglie wavelength]] is greatly increased, possibly greatly increasing its capture cross section, at energies close to [[resonance]]s of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons ''may'' be even more reactive than high energy neutrons.

==Notable types==
While the number of possible nuclear reactions is immense, there are several types which are more common, or otherwise notable. Some examples include:
*[[Nuclear fusion|Fusion]] reactions — two light nuclei join to form a heavier one, with additional particles (usually protons or neutrons) emitted subsequently.
*[[Spallation]] — a nucleus is hit by a particle with sufficient energy and momentum to knock out several small fragments or smash it into many fragments.
*[[Induced gamma emission]] belongs to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation.
*[[Alpha decay]] — Though driven by the same underlying forces as spontaneous fission, α decay is usually considered to be separate from the latter. The often-quoted idea that "nuclear reactions" are confined to induced processes is incorrect. "Radioactive decays" are a subgroup of "nuclear reactions" that are spontaneous rather than induced. For example, so-called "hot alpha particles" with unusually high energies may actually be produced in induced [[ternary fission]], which is an induced nuclear reaction (contrasting with spontaneous fission). Such alphas occur from spontaneous ternary fission as well.
*[[Nuclear fission|Fission]] reactions — a very heavy nucleus, after absorbing additional light particles (usually neutrons), splits into two or sometimes three pieces. This is an induced nuclear reaction. [[Spontaneous fission]], which occurs without assistance of a neutron, is usually not considered a nuclear reaction. At most, it is not an ''induced'' nuclear reaction.

===Direct reactions===
An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; second) event. Energy and momentum transfer are relatively small. These are particularly useful in experimental nuclear physics, because the reaction mechanisms are often simple enough to calculate with sufficient accuracy to probe the structure of the target nucleus.

====Inelastic scattering====
{{Main|Inelastic scattering}}

Only energy and momentum are transferred.
*(p,p') tests differences between nuclear states.
*(α,α') measures nuclear surface shapes and sizes. Since α particles that hit the nucleus react more violently, [[elastic scattering|elastic]] and shallow inelastic α scattering are sensitive to the shapes and sizes of the targets, like [[light scattering|light scattered]] from a small black object.
*(e,e') is useful for probing the interior structure. Since electrons interact less strongly than do protons and neutrons, they reach to the centers of the targets and their [[wave function]]s are less distorted by passing through the nucleus.

====Transfer reactions====
Usually at moderately low energy, one or more nucleons are transferred between the projectile and target. These are useful in studying outer [[nuclear shell model|shell]] structure of nuclei.
*(α,n) and (α,p) reactions. Some of the earliest nuclear reactions studied involved an alpha particle produced by [[alpha decay]], knocking a nucleon from a target nucleus.
*(d,n) and (d,p) reactions. A [[deuteron]] [[ion beam|beam]] impinges on a target; the target nuclei absorb either the neutron or proton from the deuteron. The deuteron is so loosely bound that this is almost the same as proton or neutron capture. A compound nucleus may be formed, leading to additional neutrons being emitted more slowly. (d,n) reactions are used to generate energetic neutrons.
*The [[strangeness]] exchange reaction ([[Kaon|K]], [[Pion|π]]) has been used to study [[hypernucleus|hypernuclei]].
*The reaction &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N(α,p)&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O performed by Rutherford in 1917 (reported 1919), is generally regarded as the first [[nuclear transmutation]] experiment.

Reactions with [[neutron]]s are important in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. While the best-known neutron reactions are [[neutron scattering]], [[neutron capture]], and [[nuclear fission]], for some light nuclei (especially [[odd-odd nuclei]]) the most probable reaction with a [[thermal neutron]] is a transfer reaction:

Some reactions are only possible with [[fast neutrons]]:
*(n,2n) reactions produce small amounts of [[protactinium-231]] and [[uranium-232]] in the [[thorium cycle]] which is otherwise relatively free of highly radioactive [[actinide]] products.
*&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be + n → 2α + 2n can contribute some additional neutrons in the [[beryllium]] [[neutron reflector]] of a [[nuclear weapon]].
*&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li + n → [[tritium|T]] + α + n unexpectedly contributed additional yield in [[Castle Bravo]], [[Castle Romeo]], and [[Castle Yankee]], the three highest-yield [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the U.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11151">The traditional '''Polish units of measurement''' included two uniform yet distinct systems of [[weights and measures]], as well as a number of related systems borrowed from neighbouring states. The first attempt at [[standardisation]] came with the introduction of the '''Old Polish measurement [system]''', also dubbed the '''Warsaw system''', introduced by a royal decree of December 6, 1764. The system was later replaced by the '''New Polish measurement [system]''' introduced on January 1, 1819.

The traditional Polish systems of weights and measures were later replaced with those of surrounding nations (due to the [[Partitions of Poland]]), only to be replaced with [[metric system]] by the end of the 19th century (between 1872 and 1876).

== History ==

=== Historic weights and measures ===
The first recorded weights and measures used in Poland were related to dimensions of human body, hence the most basic measures in use were ''sążeń'' ([[fathom]]), ''łokieć'' ([[ell]]), ''piędź'' ([[Span (unit)|span]]), ''stopa'' ([[Foot (unit)|foot]]) and ''skok'' ([[jumping|jump]]). With time trade relations with the neighbouring nations brought to use additional units, with names often borrowed from [[German language|German]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Czech language|Czech]].

From Middle Ages until the 18th century, there was no single system of measurement used in all of Poland. Traditional units like ''stopa'' ([[foot]]) or ''łokieć'' ([[ell]]) were used throughout the country, but their meaning differed from region to region. Most major cities in the area used their own systems of measurement, which were used in the surrounding areas as well. Among the commonly used systems were [[Austrian units of measurement|Austrian]], [[Galician units of measurement|Galician]], [[Danzig units of measurement|Danzig]], [[Kraków units of measurement|Kraków]], [[German units of measurement|Prussian]], [[Russian units of measurement|Russian]] and [[German units of measurement|Breslau]]. The matter was further complicated by the fact that Austrian or German systems were hardly uniform either and differed from town to town.&lt;ref name="Cardarelli"&gt;{{cite book | author =François Cardarelli | coauthors = | title =Encyclopedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures. Their SI Equivalences and Origins | year = | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location =Berlin | isbn=1-85233-682-X  | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the systems tended to evolve over time: in the 13th century the Kraków's [[ell]] was equivalent to 64.66 [[centimetre]]s, a century later it was equivalent to 62.5&amp;nbsp;cm, then in the 16th century it shrunk to 58.6&amp;nbsp;cm and finally was equalled to standard "old Polish ell" of 59.6&amp;nbsp;cm only in 1836.

To add to the confusion, various goods were traditionally measured with different units, often incompatible or difficult to convert. For instance, [[beer]] was sold in units named ''[[achtel]]'' (0.5 of [[barrel]], that is 62 Kraków [[gallon]]s of 2.75 [[litre]]s each). However honey and mead were recorded for tax purposes in units named ''rączka'' (slightly more than 10 Kraków gallons).

As the weights and measures were important in everyday life of merchants, in 1420 the royal decree allowed each [[voivode]] to create and maintain a single system used in his [[voivodeship]]. This law was later confirmed by a [[Sejm]] act of 1565. Steel or copper rods used as local standard of [[ell]] (basic unit of length) were being created in voivode's capital and then dispatched to all nearby towns, where they were further duplicated for everyday use. One bar was to be stored in the [[town hall]] for comparison, while additional rods were stored in the gatehouses or toll points to be borrowed by merchants as needed. Damaging or losing a rod was punishable by law.

=== Measuring time ===

Outside of this set of systems was the measurement of time. As [[clock tower]]s only started to appear in late Middle Ages, and their usability was limited to within a small radius, some basic substitutes for modern minutes and hours were developed, based on Christian prayers. The ''pacierz'' (or ''paternoster'') was a non-standard unit of time comprising some 25 seconds, that is enough time to recite the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Similarly, ''zdrowaśka'' (from ''Zdrowaś Mario'', the first words of the [[Hail Mary]]) was used, as was the [[Rosary]] (''różaniec'') that is the time needed to recite Hail Mary 50 times (roughly 16 minutes). Those units were never strictly defined, but were used in rural areas of Poland as late as the 20th century.

=== Early attempts at standardisation ===

While this system introduced some level of standardisation throughout the country, the systems used in various voivodeships still differed from one another. To counter this problem the [[Kraków]] ell and [[Poznań]] ell were made equal in 1507. The same applied to ells used in Lwów and Lublin, which however were different from those in Kraków and Poznań. In 1532 the [[Płock]] ell was aligned with the Kraków ell, which in 1565 was declared an official ell to be used in all of the [[Crown of Poland]]. The system used by Warsaw was adopted in [[Płock]] and all of [[Masovia]] in 1569. In 1613 additional systems were created for [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]]. The standardisation of other units of measurement also made some progress since the 15th century, but at a different pace. In the end this created even more confusion, as two towns could use the same units of length, but two different units of weight, although using the same terms.

=== 1764 reform - the Old Polish system ===

As until then not only different units varied from town to town but also their relation to one another, in 1764 a major overhaul of the measurement system was prepared. By a royal decree of December 6, 1764 all units of measurement were to be converted to a new system, common to all of Poland and its dependencies. The system relied on previously used units, but introduced a common, unified system of relations between them. It had no official name and it was not until the 19th century when it started to be called the Old Polish system (''miary staropolskie'', or ''Old-Polish measures''), in contrast to the ''new'' system introduced then.

The basic unit of length - the [[ell]] or łokieć in Polish - was set to 0.5955 [[metre]]s. For trade and everyday use it was further subdivided into the [[foot_(unit)|foot]] (''stopa'', ≈29.78 [[Centimetre|centimetres]]); ''[[sztych]]'' (≈19.86cm); quarter (''ćwierć'', ≈14.89cm); [[Palm (length)|palm]] (''dłoń'', ≈7.44cm); and [[inch]] (''cal'', ≈2.48 centimetres), or gathered into the [[fathom]] (''sążeń'', 3 ells or 1.787 metres in length), such that:&lt;blockquote&gt;1 ell  =  2 feet  =  3 sztychs  =  4 quarters  =  8 palms  =  24 inches  ( =  ⅓ of a fathom ).&lt;/blockquote&gt;A different system of units, although complementary and interchangeable, was used in measuring lengths for agrarian purposes. The basic unit was a step (''krok''), equalling 3.75 of standard ell, or 2.2333 metres. Two steps made a [[Rod (unit)|rod]] (''pręt'', 4.4665 metres), 2 rods made a stick (''laska''), and five sticks were equal to a cable (''sznur'' of 44.665 metres). Finally 3 cables made up a [[furlong]] (''staje'') of roughly 134 metres.

In measuring the distance between cities, the basic unit was ''staje'', although it was different from the ''staje'' mentioned before and had the length of roughly 893 metres. Eight ''staje'' made up a [[Polish mile]] of 7144 metres.

The weights were based on the Polish pound (''funt'' of 0.4052 [[kilogram|kg]]) composed of two ''[[Grzywna (unit)|grzywna]]s'', each in turn comprising 16 [[Lot (unit)|lot]]s (''łut'' of 0.0127&amp;nbsp;kg). For heavier goods the basic units were a [[Stone (imperial mass)|stone]] (''kamień'', 32 pounds or 12.976&amp;nbsp;kg) and [[Hundredweight]] (''cetnar'', five stones or 64.80&amp;nbsp;kg).

There were two sets of units of volume: one for fluids and the other for [[dry goods]]. Both used the [[gallon]] (''garniec'') of 3.7689 [[litre]]s as the basic unit. This was subdivided into 4 [[quart]]s (''{{lang|pl|kwarta}}'') of 0.9422 L or 16 ''{{lang|pl|kwarterka}}''. For dry goods four gallons comprised a measure (''{{lang|pl|miarka}}''), 2 measures comprised a [[quarter (unit)|quarter]] (''{{lang|pl|ćwierć}}''), 4 quarters comprised a [[bushel]] (''{{lang|pl|korzec}}'') of 120.6 L, and 30 bushels comprised a [[last (unit)|last]] (''{{lang|pl|łaszt}}'') of 3618 L. For fluids, 5 gallons comprised a ''konew'' of 18.8445 L and 14.4 ''konew'' made up a [[barrel]] of 271.36 L.

=== Current use ===

Though the traditional systems were officially abandoned in the 19th century, traces of their use, especially in rural areas, were found by [[ethnographers]] as late as 1969.&lt;ref name="Kunikowski"&gt;{{cite book | author =Stanisław Kunikowski | coauthors = | title =Miary na ziemiach polskich; wystawa ze zbiorów Muzeum Ziemi Kujawskiej i Dobrzyńskiej we Włocławku | year =1987 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Muzeum Narodowe Rolnictwa i Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego | location =Szreniawa  | isbn= | url = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR itself.

'''Participatory modeling''' is a purposeful learning process for action that engages the implicit and explicit knowledge of stakeholders to create formalized and shared representation(s) of reality. In this process, the participants co-formulate the problem and use modeling practices to aid in the description, solution, and decision-making actions of the group. Participatory modeling is often used in environmental and resource management contexts. It can be described as engaging non-scientists in the scientific process. The participants structure the problem, describe the system, create a [[computer model]] of the system, use the model to test policy interventions, and propose one or more solutions. Participatory modeling is often used in natural resources management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Natalie A.|last2=Perez|first2=Pascal|last3=Measham|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Kelly|first4=Gail J.|last5=d'Aquino|first5=Patrick|last6=Daniell|first6=Katherine A.|last7=Dray|first7=Anne|last8=Ferrand|first8=Nils|title=Evaluating Participatory Modeling: Developing a Framework for Cross-Case Analysis|journal=Environmental Management|date=22 October 2009|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1180–1195|doi=10.1007/s00267-009-9391-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Guillermo A.|last2=Prabhu|first2=Ravi|title=Participatory modeling and analysis for sustainable forest management: Overview of soft system dynamics models and applications|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|date=November 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=179–196|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2005.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robles-Morua|first1=Agustin|last2=Halvorsen|first2=Kathleen E.|last3=Mayer|first3=Alex S.|last4=Vivoni|first4=Enrique R.|title=Exploring the application of participatory modeling approaches in the Sonora River Basin, Mexico|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|date=February 2014|volume=52|pages=273–282|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Eeten|first1=Michel J.

There are numerous benefits from this type of modeling, including a high degree of ownership and motivation towards change for the people involved in the modeling process. There are two approaches which provide highly different goals for the modeling; continuous modeling and conference modeling.

==Continuous modeling==
The focus here is on the [[end-user]] being the active modeler. It can be incorporated into an adaptable, context-sensitive, "intelligent" system, which is suited to the individual.  This combination is often referred to as "model generated workplace" or "model generated user environment".  The basic concept is that the end-user potentially has the greatest [[domain knowledge]] and thus the organization as a whole benefits by obtaining and [[externalization|externalize]] this knowledge.

==Conference modeling==
Conference modeling is an approach where the goal often is of a more social kind, such as motivation, and [[change management]]. The idea is to involve a group of diversified people from the domain in question. Then the modeling process is developed in group participation during a fixed period of time.

[[File:PatientCareProviderSad.jpg|thumb|Visual example of caregiver burnout, a common result of patient initiated violence.]]

'''Patient-initiated violence ''' is a specific form of [[workplace violence]] that affects [[Health professional|healthcare workers]] that is the result of verbal, physical, or emotional abuse from a patient or family members of whom they have assumed care. [[Nursing|Nurses]] represent the highest percentage of affected workers; however, other roles include physicians, therapists, technicians, home care workers, and social workers.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"&gt;National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (2003) Workplace Violence: issues in Response. National Criminal Justice Reference Service. (53-55) Received from https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204462&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] used 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics and reported that healthcare workplace violence requiring days absent from work from patients represented 80% of cases.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2015) Workplace Violence in Healthcare. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Received from https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hospitals/workplace_violence.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a survey by the [[American Nurses Association]] of 3,765 21% of nurses and nursing students reported physical abuse and over 50% reported verbal abuse within a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association. 2014. American Nurses Association Health Risk Appraisal

(2014, December 31). Epidemic of Violence against Health Care Workers Plagues Hospitals. Retrieved August 6, 2016, from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epidemic-of-violence-against-health-care-workers-plagues-hospitals/&lt;/ref&gt; or subject to a long wait time.&lt;ref name="JEN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2013.11.006 |pmid=24439244 |title=Nothing Changes, Nobody Cares: Understanding the Experience of Emergency Nurses Physically or Verbally Assaulted While Providing Care |journal=Journal of Emergency Nursing |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=305–10 |year=2014 |last1=Wolf |first1=Lisa A. |last2=Delao |first2=Altair M. |last3=Perhats |first3=Cydne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain areas are more at risk for this kind of violence including healthcare workers in psychiatric settings, emergency or critical care, or long term care and dementia units.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt;

==Areas of high prevalence==

===Emergency departments===

The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] found that greater than 75% of emergency physicians were the victim of one or more violent incidents in the workplace, noting that the majority was by patients or their families.&lt;ref name="EPM"&gt;Emergency Physicians Monthly. (n.d.). Emergency Department Violence Fact Sheet. Retrieved July 30, 2016, from http://epmonthly.com/article/violence-against-ed-workers-a-growing-problem/&lt;/ref&gt; Causes for the increased presence of violence, especially in urban settings, are related to gang activity, lengthened waiting periods to see a doctor, a failure of community medical resources, and unavailable acute psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name="EPM"/&gt; In 2011 the [[Emergency Nurses Association]] studies the occurrence of physical violence at 54.4% and verbal violence at 42.5% among emergency room nurses.&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;Emergency Nurses Association. (2011). Emergency department violence surveillance study. Des Plaines, IL: Emergency Nurses Association&lt;/ref&gt; Within this study, 55.7% perpetrators of physical violence were under the influence of alcohol. 46.8% were under the influence of illegal or prescription drugs, and 45.2% were being treated for psychiatric reasons. A majority of the violent behavior that occurred was during the [[triage]] process at 40.2%.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

===Psychiatric and dementia units===
Workers in departments that specialize in [[mental health]] are particularly at risk for patient abuse due to the psychiatric disease states, high rates of [[substance abuse]], and previous violent patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12912-015-0079-5 |pmid=25999795 |pmc=4440495 |title=Registered nurses' experiences of patient violence on acute care psychiatric inpatient units: An interpretive descriptive study |journal=BMC Nursing |volume=14 |pages=35 |year=2015 |last1=Stevenson |first1=Kelly N. |last2=Jack |first2=Susan M. |last3=o'Mara |first3=Linda |last4=Legris |first4=Jeannette }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses noted that [[social stigma]] of psychiatric disorders plays a significant role in how nurses perceive violence. Caregivers were uncomfortable with the notion that patient violence is part of the job but also that it is unfair to believe that those with [[mental illness]] should be seen as more violent in nature.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt; Osha reported that violent injuries in psychiatric aids was 10 times higher than any other healthcare worker at 590 injuries per 10,000 full-time employees.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"/&gt;

==Underreporting==
Underreporting of patient initiated violence is common with professionals claiming that assault is a part of the job. A report from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] dedicates underreporting is likely due to a fear of [[retaliation]], or belief that it will not lead to any change. There is also a commonly held belief that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNA"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association, Congress on Health and Safety, Workplace Violence and Abuse Prevention Task Force, Luce, S. (2005). Violence is NOT Part of the Job. Massachusetts Nurses Association. Received from: https://massnurses.org/files/file/MNA%20Survey%20results%20FINAL%20on%20Workplace%20Violence%20Abuse%202016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts Nurses Association followed up on this common belief through a survey of three [[New England]] hospitals, finding that only 39% of participants reported all incidences of violence. The same report found that 70% of those who reported an incident found that management was supportive, however a majority noted that nothing was done to solve the problem.&lt;ref name=MNA/&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses reported that not only was violence a part of the job, but its occurrence no longer warranted a reporting.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; The same report noted that underreporting drastically affects the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to track these occurrences.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt; Many qualitative studies done on nurses suggest that there is frequent discouragement by hospital officials and legal officers to not press charges against abusive patients or their families related to an understanding that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt;

==Lasting effects of violence==
The effects of patient initiated violence has been found correlate to lasting symptoms of [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[acute stress disorder]], and high rates of [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;  Nurses who experience a lack of support from public officials after the event reported feelings of anxiety and frustration.&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt; OSHA sampled one hospital who paid for medical treatment of 30 staff members subject to patient initiated violence over a one-year period costing $94,146.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; It was also estimated that the costs of separation, recruitment, hiring, and training of new staff to be anywhere from 25,000 to 103,000.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

A study in Orebro Reginal Hospital in [[Sweden]] suggested a link between patient initiated violence, [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and decreased care outcomes. It was reported that the highest indicator of care quality outcomes is a positive or negative association with an individuals work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00146-5 |pmid=11330776 |title=Violence towards health care staff and possible effects on the quality of patient care |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=417–27 |year=2001 |last1=Arnetz |first1=Judith E |last2=Arnetz |first2=Bengt B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media==
In November 2014 Charles Logan, a 68-year-old patient at St John's Hospital in Mapplewood Minnesota attacked nurses using a bar from his stretcher.&lt;ref&gt;(WGN) CNN WIRE. (2014, November 7). Surveillance video captures patient attacking nurses in Minnesota hospital. Retrieved August 6, 2016, from http://wgntv.com/2014/11/07/surveillance-video-captures-patient-attacking-nurses-in-minnesota-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Solutions to this issues range dependent on facility and location. A common suggestions from nursing staff is for additional trainings specifically on the de-escalation of high risk situations and health professional legal rights &lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNA"/&gt; 55% of participants of workers in New England Hospitals stated they were aware of their legal rights relating to workplace violence.&lt;ref name="MNA"/&gt; The national institute of occupational safety and health (NOSHA) created a free online [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/violence/training_nurses.html training module] that went live in 2013.  [[The Veterans Health Administration]] has reduced occurrences of assaults by flagging high risk based on previous documentation of attacks on caregivers.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; The American Nurses Association has modeled a state bill for a “Violence Prevention in Health Care Facilities Act” that would call for the creation of violence prevention committees, annual violence prevention training, and sufficient record keeping of violence acts.&lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association.

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|The Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, also briefly called the [[Serbsky Institute]] (the part of its building in [[Moscow]])]]

There was systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry]] in the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvs|txt|author=US GPO|year1=1972|year2=1975|year3=1976|year4=1984|year5=1988}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2002|year2=2010a|year3=2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}; {{harvnb|UPA Herald|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "psychopathological mechanisms" of dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}}

During the leadership of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], psychiatry was used to disable and remove from society political opponents ("dissidents") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted the official dogma.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;See Vladimir Bukovsky, ''Judgment in Moscow'' (forthcoming spring 2016), Chapter 3, Back to the Future: "Deportation or the Madhouse",&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosophical intoxication", for instance, was widely applied to the mental disorders diagnosed when people disagreed with the country's Communist leaders and, by referring to the writings of the Founding Fathers of Marxism–Leninism—[[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]—made them the target of criticism.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15}}

[[Article 58]]-10 of the Stalin-era Criminal Code, "[[Anti-Soviet agitation]]", was to a considerable degree preserved in the new 1958 RSFSR Criminal Code as [[anti-Soviet agitation|Article 70]] "Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda". In 1967, a weaker law, Article 190-1 "Dissemination of fabrications known to be false, which defame the Soviet political and social system", was added to the RSFSR Criminal Code. These laws were frequently applied in conjunction with the system of diagnosis for mental illness, developed by Academician [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]]. Together they established a framework within which non-standard beliefs could easily be defined as a criminal offence and the basis, subsequently, for a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|Kovalyov|2007}}

== Applying the diagnosis ==
The "anti-Soviet" political behavior of some individuals — being outspoken in their opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, and writing critical books — were defined simultaneously as criminal acts (e.g., a violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), symptoms of mental illness (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and susceptible to a ready-made diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report (Russian translation)|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

The psychiatric incarceration of certain individuals was prompted by their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities.{{sfn|Chodoff|1985}} The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, was considered to be a form of mental illness that required treatment.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181}} The [[KGB]] routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds.{{sfn|Murray|1983}} Highly classified government documents which have become available after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009a|year2=2013a}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2013a|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Fedenko|2009}}; see some documents in {{harvnb|Pozharov|1999}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Commentary" to the post-Soviet ''Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care'', individuals forced to undergo treatment in Soviet psychiatric medical institutions were entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with the established procedure and could claim compensation. The [[Russian Federation]] acknowledged that before 1991 psychiatry had been used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of "political psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2002}}; {{harvnb|Pshizov|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]] has continued, nevertheless, since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013a|pp=16–18}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights activists may still face the threat of a psychiatric diagnosis for their legitimate civic and political activities.{{sfn|NPZ|2005}}

Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entails the [[exculpation]] and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009b|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abouelleil|Bingham|2014}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Laqueur|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Munro|2002a|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|loc1=p. 95|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Gluzman|1993}}; {{harvnb|Amnesty International|1991|pp=9, 64}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}};  {{harvnb|Bebtschuk|Smirnova|Khayretdinov|2012}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2001|pp=84, 108}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fedor|2011|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Ghodse|2011|p=422}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Gushansky|2005|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Horvath|2014}}; {{harvnb|Joffe|1984}}; {{harvnb|Kekelidze|2013b}}; {{harvnb|Khvorostianov|Elias|2015}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=7, 47, 60, 67, 77, 259, 291}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Koryagin|year1=1988||year2=1989}}; {{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Leontev|2010}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Schmidt|Shchurko|2014}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2004|year2=2006}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Zile|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Punitive Medicine'' (1979) [[Alexander Podrabinek]] defined the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote in their joint ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters'', "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent... as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}

=== An inherent capacity for abuse ===

Psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive.{{sfn|Malterud|Hunskaar|2002|p=94}} In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}}

In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.{{sfn|Semple|Smyth|2013|p=6}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} In many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.{{sfn|Noll|2007|p=3}}

In the Soviet Union, [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''[[psikhushka]]'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 10, 31 October 1969 — 10.10 "The Kazan Special Psychiatric Hospital".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]] (the secret police and precursor of the [[KGB]]) on the orders of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292}}

=== Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev ===

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} One of those with overall responsibility for the [[Soviet secret police]], pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=495}} Russian psychiatrist [[Pyotr Gannushkin]] also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasilenko|2004|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Chernosvitov|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.{{sfn|Keukens|Voren|2007}}

Punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era, however, according to Alexander Etkind. The [[GULag]], or Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, was an effective instrument of political repression. There was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and more expensive psychiatric substitute.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of the USSR mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, being represented by two distinct systems which co-existed peacefully for the most part, despite periodic conflicts between them:
# system one was that of punitive psychiatry. It directly served the authorities and those in power, and was headed by the [[Serbsky Institute|Moscow Institute for Forensic Psychiatry]] named in honour of [[Vladimir Serbsky]];
# system two was made up of elite, psychotherapeutically oriented clinics. It was headed by the [[Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute|Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute]] named in memory of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]].{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}
The hundreds of hospitals in the provinces combined elements of both systems.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}

If someone was mentally ill then, he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there until his dying day.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} If his mental health was uncertain but he was not constantly unwell, he and his ''kharakteristika'' [testimonial from employers, the Party and other Soviet institutions] were sent to a labour camp or to be shot.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} When allusions to [[socialist legality]] started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} Soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti-Soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for the regime. Such individuals were no longer tried in court. Instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane.{{sfn|Demina|2008}}

== The Joint Session, October 1951 ==
{{main|Pavlovian session}}
In the 1950s, the psychiatrists of the Soviet Union turned themselves into the medical arm of the Gulag State.{{sfn|Lakritz|2009}} A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union, the "Joint Session" of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] and the Board of the All-Union Neurological and Psychiatric Association took place from 10 to 15 October 1951. The event was dedicated, supposedly, to the great Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] and alleged that several of the USSR's leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (among them [[Grunya Sukhareva]], [[Vasily Gilyarovsky]], [[Raisa Golant]], [[Aleksandr Shmaryan]], and [[Mikhail Gurevich (psychiatrist)|Mikhail Gurevich]]) were guilty of practicing "anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic [and] reactionary" science, and this was damaging to Soviet psychiatry.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

During the Joint Session, these eminent psychiatrists, motivated by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to "Pavlovian" doctrines.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the closing speech [[Snezhnevsky]], the lead author of the Session's policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists "have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing "grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice". The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of "diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science".{{sfn|Savenko|2009a}} Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session — among them [[Irina Strelchuk]], [[Vasily Banshchikov]], [[Oleg Kerbikov]], and Snezhnevsky — were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

The Joint Session also had a negative impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as [[Pyotr Anokhin]], [[Aleksey Speransky]], [[Lina Stern]], [[Ivan Beritashvili]], and [[Leon Orbeli]]. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Pseudo-science took control.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

Following a previous joint session of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (28 June–4 July 1950) and the 10-15 October 1951 joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists, Snezhnevky's schoolthe was given the leading role.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=101}} The 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to the Pavlovian school of Snezhnevsky was one of the crucial factors in the rise of political psychiatry.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=494}} The Soviet doctors, under the incentive of Snezhnevsky, devised a "Pavlovian theory of schizophrenia" and increasingly applied this diagnostic category to political dissidents.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=30}}

== "Sluggish schizophrenia" ==
{{main|Sluggish schizophrenia}}
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"The incarceration of free thinking healthy people in madhouses is spiritual murder, it is a variation of the gas chamber, even more cruel; the torture of the people being killed is more malicious and more prolonged. Like the gas chambers, these crimes will never be forgotten and those involved in them will be condemned for all time during their life and after their death."{{sfn|Sagan|Jonsen|1976}} &lt;small&gt;([[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]" in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes.{{sfn|Katona|Robertson|2005|p=77}} It was the diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia" that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} Sluggish schizophrenia as one of the new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system.{{sfn|Tobin|2013}} According to the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] chief executive [[Robert van Voren]], the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the conception that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The diagnosis "sluggish schizophrenia," a longstanding concept further developed by the Moscow School of Psychiatry and particularly by its chief Snezhnevsky, furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

The weight of scholarly opinion holds that the psychiatrists who played the primary role in the development of this diagnostic concept were following directives from the [[Communist Party]] and the Soviet secret service, or [[KGB]], and were well aware of the political uses to which it would be put. Nevertheless, for many Soviet psychiatrists "sluggish schizophrenia" appeared to be a logical explanation to apply to the behavior of critics of the regime who, in their opposition, seemed willing to jeopardize their happiness, family, and career for a reformist conviction or ideal that was so apparently divergent from the prevailing social and political orthodoxy.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel [[classification of mental disorders]] postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of [[psychopathy]], [[hypochondria]], [[depersonalization]] or [[anxiety]] were central to it.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Symptoms referred to as part of the "negative axis" included [[pessimism]], poor [[social adaptation]], and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Along with [[paranoia]], sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as ''the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia'' reported in 1973.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow.{{sfn|Park|Park|Jun|Kim|2014}} In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as "reform delusions," "perseverance," and "struggle for the truth."{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As [[Viktor Styazhkin]] reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind."{{sfn|Styazhkin|1992|p=66}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which contained ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred critique of the political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=19}} Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European countries]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=18}}

On the covert orders of the [[KGB]], thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet "dissidents"—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of "sluggish schizophrenia", a disease fabricated by Snezhnevsky and "Moscow school" of psychiatry.{{sfn|Healey|2011}} American psychiatrist [[Alan A. Stone]] stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry aimed at Snezhnevsky personally, because he was essentially responsible for the Soviet concept of schizophrenia with a "sluggish type" manifestation by "reformerism" including other symptoms.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} One can readily apply this diagnostic scheme to dissenters.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} Snezhnevsky was long attacked in the West as an exemplar of psychiatric abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} The leading critics implied that Snezhnevsky had designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia and this diagnosis to make political dissent into a mental disease.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes, and he himself diagnosed or was involved in a series of famous dissident cases,{{sfn|Reich|1983}} and, in dozens of cases, he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Leonid Plyushch]], [[:uk:Плахотнюк Микола Григорович|Mikola Plakhotnyuk]],{{sfn|Gluzman|2013c}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}}

== Beginning of the trend toward mass abuse ==

=== From Khrushchev to Andropov ===
The campaign to declare political opponents mentally sick and to commit dissenters to mental hospitals began in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] commented on the emergence of the political abuse of psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Boukovsky, ''Jugement a Moscou'', Robert Laffont: Paris, 1996, "Le Goulag psychiatrique", p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reckoned that it was impossible for people in a socialist society to have an anti-socialist consciousness. Whenever manifestations of dissidence could not be justified as a provocation of world imperialism or a legacy of the past, they were self-evidently the product of mental disease.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} In a speech published in the  ''[[Pravda]]'' daily newspaper on 24 May 1959, Khrushchev said:
{{quote|A crime is a deviation from generally recognized standards of behavior frequently caused by mental disorder. Can there be diseases, nervous disorders among certain people in a Communist society? Evidently yes. If that is so, then there will also be offences, which are characteristic of people with abnormal minds. Of those who might start calling for opposition to Communism on this basis, we can say that clearly their mental state is not normal.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}}}}

[[File:RIAN archive 101740 Yury Andropov, Chairman of KGB.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yuri Andropov]] (1914–1984), a [[KGB Chairman]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]]]]
The now available evidence supports the conclusion that the system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by the KGB to rid the USSR of undesirable elements.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=4}} According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=8}}

Andropov was in charge of the wide-ranging deployment of psychiatric repression from the moment he was appointed to head the KGB.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|pp=187–188}} He became [[KGB Chairman]] on 18 May 1967.{{sfn|Rhoer|1983|p=52}} On 3 July 1967, he made a proposal to establish a Fifth Directorate (ideological counterintelligence) within the KGB to deal with internal political opposition to the Soviet regime.{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Albats|1995|p=177}} The Directorate was set up at the end of July and took charge of KGB files on all Soviet dissidents, including [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]].{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}} In 1968, KGB Chairman Andropov issued a departmental order "On the tasks of State security agencies in combating the ideological sabotage by the adversary", calling for the KGB to struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} His aim was "the destruction of dissent in all its forms" and he insisted that the positions of the capitalist countries on human rights, and their criticisms of the Soviet Union and its own politics of human rights from these positions, was just one part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the Soviet state's foundation.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} Similar ideas can be found in the 1983 book ''Speeches and Writings'' by Andropov published when he had become General Secretary of the CPSU:{{sfn|Lambelet|1989}}
{{quote|[w]hen analyzing the main trend in present-day bourgeois criticism of [Soviet] human rights policies one is bound to draw the conclusion that although this criticism is camouflaged with "concern" for freedom, democracy, and human rights, it is directed in fact against the socialist essence of Soviet society...}}

=== Implementation and the legal framework ===
On 29 April 1969, Andropov submitted an elaborate plan to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]  to set up a network of mental hospitals that would defend the "Soviet Government and the socialist order" from dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albats|1995|p=177}}{{harvnb|Luty|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To persuade his fellow Politburo members of the risk posed by the mentally ill, Andropov circulated a report from the Krasnodar Region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-january-1970-pb-151xiii/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 January 1970 (Pb 151/XIII).]&lt;/ref&gt; A secret resolution of the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] was adopted.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=176}} Andropov's proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissenters was adopted and implemented.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=42}}

In 1929, the USSR had 70 psychiatric hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935, this had increased to 102 psychiatric hospitals and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric beds in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tiganov|1999|p=333}} The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974, the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-february-1972-st-3119/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 February 1972 (St 31/19).]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an expansion in the number of psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}} Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}}

On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) was issued "On measures for preventing dangerous behavior (acts) on the part of mentally ill persons."{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals with the help of the police or entrap them into coming to the hospital.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}}

By the end of the 1950s, confinement to a psychiatric institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for "treatment" to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 12, 28 February 1970 — 12.2 "The trial of P.G. Grigorenko", CCE No 13, 28 April 1970 — 13.8 "The trial of Ivan Yakhimovich and other trials", CCE No 15, 31 August 1970 — 15.1 "The trial of Natalya Gorbanevskaya".&lt;/ref&gt; came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of "psychiatric terror" which was flatly denied by those in charge of the [[Serbsky Institute]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=41}} The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Schultz|2011|p=19}}

== Examination and hospitalization ==
Political dissidents were usually charged under Articles 70 (agitation and propaganda against the Soviet state) and 190-1 (dissemination of false fabrications defaming the Soviet state and social system) of the RSFSR Criminal Code.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Forensic psychiatrists were asked to examine offenders whose mental state was considered abnormal by the investigating officers.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

In almost every case, dissidents were examined at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=78}} in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted in court for committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for [[involuntary treatment]] to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}}

The accused had no right of appeal.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The right was given to their relatives or other interested persons but they were not allowed to nominate psychiatrists to take part in the evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before the law.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

According to dissident poet [[Naum Korzhavin]], the atmosphere at the Serbsky Institute in [[Moscow]] altered almost overnight when [[Daniil Lunts]] took over as head of the Fourth Department (otherwise known as the Political Department).{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Previously, psychiatric departments were regarded as a 'refuge' against being dispatched to the [[Gulag]]. Now that policy altered.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} The first reports of dissenters being hospitalized on non-medical grounds date from the early 1960s, not long after Georgy Morozov was appointed director of the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Both Morozov and Lunts were personally involved in numerous well-known cases and were notorious abusers of psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Most prisoners, in [[Viktor Nekipelov]]'s words, characterized Daniil Lunts as "no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in [[Nazi concentration camp]]s."{{sfn|Applebaum|2003|p=549}} Indeed, experimentation took place on patients, including sleep deprivation and exposure to electromagnetic radiation for the inducement of auditory hallucinations.

A well-documented practice was the use of psychiatric hospitals as temporary prisons during the two or three weeks around the 7 November ([[October Revolution]]) Day and [[May Day]] celebrations, to isolate "socially dangerous" persons who otherwise might protest in public or manifest other deviant behavior.{{sfn|Bloch|1978}}

== Struggle against abuse ==
{{main|Struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
In the 1960s, a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.{{sfn|Fernando|2003|p=160}} Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced in the course of the Congresses of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] in [[Mexico City]] (1971), [[Hawaii]] (1977), [[Vienna]] (1983) and [[Athens]] (1989).{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the [[Cold War]], inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Healey|2011}}

== Classification of the victims ==
{{main|Cases of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}

Upon analysis of over 200 well-authenticated cases covering the period 1962–1976, Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway developed a classification of the victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. They were classified as:{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}}
# advocates of human rights or democratization;
# nationalists;
# would-be emigrants;
# religious believers;
# citizens inconvenient to the authorities.
The advocates of human rights and democratization, according to Bloch and Reddaway, made up about half the dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}} Nationalists made up about one-tenth of the dissident population dealt with psychiatrically.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=31}} Would-be emigrants constituted about one-fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} People detained only because of their religious activity made up about fifteen per cent of dissident-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} Citizens inconvenient to the authorities because of their "obdurate" complaints about bureaucratic excesses and abuses accounted for about five per cent of dissidents subject to psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=33}}

== Incomplete figures ==
In 1985, Peter Reddaway and Sidney Bloch provided documented data on some five hundred cases in their book ''Soviet Psychiatric Abuse''.{{sfn|Finlayson|1987}}

=== True scale of repression ===

On basis of the available data and materials accumulated in the archives of the [[International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry]], one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} From 1994 to 1995, an investigative commission of Moscow psychiatrists explored the records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in Russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} In 2004, [[Anatoly Prokopenko]] said he was surprised at the facts obtained by him from the official classified top secret documents by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]], by the KGB, and MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} According to his calculations based on what he found in the documents, about 15,000 people were confined for political crimes in the psychiatric prison hospitals under the control of the MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} In 2005, referring to the Archives of the CPSU Central Committee and the records of the three Special Psychiatrial Hospitals&amp;nbsp;— Sychyovskaya, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk hospitals&amp;nbsp;— to which human rights activists gained access in 1991, Prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as punitive measure against about 20,000 people for purely political reasons.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} This was only a small part of the total picture, Prokopenko said. The data on the total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in the 1,500 "open" psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of the archives of the prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} The figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was first put forward by Prokopenko in the 1997 book ''Mad Psychiatry'' ("Безумная психиатрия"),{{sfn|Prokopenko|1997|p=154}} which was republished in 2005.{{sfn|Prokopenko|2005|p=187}}

An indication of the extent of the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR is provided by [[Semyon Gluzman]]'s calculation that the percentage of "the mentally ill" among those accused of so-called anti-Soviet activities proved many times higher than among criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; The attention paid to political prisoners by Soviet psychiatrists was more than 40 times greater than their attention to ordinary criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}} This derives from the following comparison: 1–2 % of all the forensic psychiatric examinations carried out by the Serbsky Institute targeted those accused of anti-Soviet activities;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; convicted dissidents in penal institutions made up 0.05% of the total number of convicts;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; 1–2 % is 40 times greater than 0.05%.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;

According to Viktor Luneyev, the struggle against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We do not know how many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=373}} No objective assessment of the total number of repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} They are scattered between the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]], the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs ([[MVD (Russia)|MVD of Russia]]), the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB of Russia]], the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former [[Soviet Republics]], now the 11 independent countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] or the three Baltic States ([[Baltics]]).{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}}

=== Concealment of the data ===

According to Russian psychiatrist [[Emmanuil Gushansky]], the scale of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed.&lt;ref name=Gushansky&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gushansky|year1=1999|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs ([[MVD]]) and Health ([[USSR Health Ministry]]), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Dan Healey]] shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: the contents of the main archives are still classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Healey|2014}} Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} where Gluzman saw them in 1989.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}} All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}}

[[Anatoly Sobchak]], the former [[Mayor of Saint Petersburg]], wrote:
{{quote|The scale of the application of methods of repressive psychiatry in the USSR is testified by inexorable figures and facts. A commission of the top Party leadership headed by [[Alexei Kosygin]] reached a decision in 1978 to build 80 psychiatric hospitals and 8 special psychiatric institutions in addition to those already in existence. Their construction was to be completed by 1990. They were to be built in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Kemerovo]], [[Samara, Russia|Kuibyshev]], [[Novosibirsk]], and other parts of the Soviet Union. In the course of the changes that the country underwent in 1988, five prison hospitals were transferred from the MVD to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, while another five were closed down. There was a hurried covering of tracks through the mass rehabilitation of patients, some of whom were mentally disabled (in one and the same year no less than 800,000 patients were removed from the psychiatric registry). In Leningrad alone 60,000 people with a diagnosis of mental illness were released and rehabilitated in 1991 and 1992. In 1978, 4.5 million people throughout the USSR were registered as psychiatric patients. This was equivalent to the population of many civilized countries.{{sfn|Sobchak|2005|pp=6–7}}}}

In Ukraine, a study of the origins of the political abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years on the basis of the State archives.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} A total of 60 people were again examined.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine. Not one of them, it turned out, was in need of any psychiatric treatment.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}}

From 1993 to 1995, a presidential decree on measures to prevent future abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, at the request of Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]], to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control).{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]].{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}}

The report on political abuse of psychiatry prepared at the request of the Commission by Gushansky with the aid of Prokopenko lay unclaimed and even the ''Independent Psychiatric Journal'' ([[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]])&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; would not publish it. The [[Moscow Research Center for Human Rights]] headed by [[Boris Altshuler]] and [[Alexei Yuryevich Smirnov|Alexei Smirnov]] and the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia whose president is [[Yuri Savenko]] were asked by Gushansky to publish the materials and archival documents on punitive psychiatry but showed no interest in doing so.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} Publishing such documents is dictated by present-day needs and by how far it is feared that psychiatry could again be abused for non-medical purposes.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=33}}

In its 2000 report, the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression included only the following four phrases about the political abuse of psychiatry:{{sfn|Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims|2000}}
{{quote|The Commission has also considered such a complex, socially relevant issue, as the use of psychiatry for political purposes. The collected documents and materials allow us to say that the extrajudicial procedure of admission to psychiatric hospitals was used for compulsory hospitalization of persons whose behavior was viewed by the authorities as "suspicious" from the political point of view. According to the incomplete data, hundreds of thousands of people have been illegally placed to psychiatric institutions of the country over the years of Soviet power. The rehabilitation of these people was limited, at best, to their removal from the registry of psychiatric patients and usually remains so today, due to gaps in the legislation.}}

In the 1988 and 1989, about two million people were removed from the psychiatric registry at the request of Western psychiatrists.

== Theoretical analysis ==
In 1990, ''Psychiatric Bulletin of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]'' published the article "Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?" by Russian psychiatrist [[Anatoly Koryagin]]. It contains analysis of the abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which the existence of a system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR can easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but have been one of the major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers' objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state's material means without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists' will. Practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.{{sfn|Koryagin|1990}}

According to American psychiatrist Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did not have any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the [[USSR Ministry of Health]]. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered not. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.{{sfn|Lapshin|2003}}

According to Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia (the IPA), punitive psychiatry arises on the basis of the interference of three main factors:&lt;ref name=Savenko&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ideologizing of science, its breakaway from the achievements of world psychiatry, the party orientation of Soviet forensic psychiatry.
# The lack of legal basis.
# The total nationalization of mental health service.
Their interaction system is principally sociological: the presence of the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}}

According to [[Larry Gostin]], the root cause of the problem was the State itself.{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} The definition of danger was radically extended by the Soviet criminal system to cover "political" as well as customary physical types of "danger".{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} As Bloch and Reddaway note, there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether the person's behavior will be dangerous, and approaches to the definition of dangerousness greatly differ among psychiatrists.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=29}}

[[Richard Bonnie]], a professor of law and medicine at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state as one of the most substantial lessons from the period.{{sfn|Moran|2010}}

According to [[Norman Sartorius]], a former president of the [[World Psychiatric Association]], political abuse of psychiatry in the former Soviet Union was facilitated by the fact that the national classification included categories that could be employed to label dissenters, who could then be forcibly incarcerated and kept in psychiatric hospitals for "treatment".{{sfn|Sartorius|2010}} Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the [[DSM-5]] task force, has a similar opinion that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was sustained by the existence of a classification developed in the Soviet Union and used to organize psychiatric treatment and care.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}} In this classification, there were categories with diagnoses that could be given to political dissenters and led to the harmful involuntary medication.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}}

According to Moscow psychiatrist [[Alexander Danilin]], the so-called "nosological" approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Snezhnevsky boiles down to the ability to make the only diagnosis, schizophrenia; psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by the thousands are falling victims to these opinions—millions of lives were crippled by virtue of the concept "sluggish schizophrenia" introduced some time once by an academician Snezhnevsky, whom Danilin called a state criminal.{{sfn|Danilin|2008}}

[[St Petersburg]] academic psychiatrist professor [[Yuri Nuller]] notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} However, Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}}

According to American psychiatrist Walter Reich, the misdiagnoses of dissidents resulted from some characteristics of Soviet psychiatry that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic, theory, and practice.{{sfn|Reich|1983}}

According to [[Semyon Gluzman]], abuse of psychiatry to suppress dissent is based on condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent, on the other hand.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; In the conditions of the totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Gluzman specifies the following six premises for the unintentional participation of doctors in abuses:&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;
# The specificity, in the totalitarian state, of the psychiatric paradigm tightly sealed from foreign influences.
# The lack of legal conscience in most citizens including doctors.
# Disregard for fundamental human rights on the part of the lawmaker and law enforcement agencies.
# Declaratory nature or the absence of legislative acts that regulate providing psychiatric care in the country. The USSR, for example, adopted such an act only in 1988.
# The absolute state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally gives rise to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).
# The fact, in psychiatric hospitals, of frustratingly bad conditions, which refer primarily to the poverty of health care and inevitably lead to the dehumanization of the personnel including doctors.
Gluzman says that there, of course, may be a different approach to the issue expressed by [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Gluzman|2012|p=xxvii}}
According to [[Michael L. Perlin|Michael Perlin]], Foucault in his book ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' documented the history of using institutional psychiatry as a political tool, researched the expanded use of the public hospitals in the 17th century in France and came to the conclusion that "confinement [was an] answer to an economic crisis... reduction of wages, unemployment, scarcity of coin" and, by the 18th century, the psychiatric hospitals satisfied "the indissociably economic and moral demand for confinement."{{sfn|Perlin|2006}}

In 1977, British psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] asked Foucault the same question which [[Claude Bourdet]] had formerly asked [[Viktor Fainberg]] during a press conference given by Fainberg and [[Leonid Plyushch]]: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered it was not a question of a ''distortion'' of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project.{{sfn|Foucault|Kritzman|1990|p=182}} In the discussion ''Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison'', Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and "condensation" of psychiatry's "inheritance", an "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=129}} Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system.{{sfn|Fernando|Ndegwa|Wilson|1998|p=37}} In the discussion with [[Jean Laplanche]] and [[Robert Badinter]], Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset".&lt;ref name=Foucault1&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 168|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the twofold conclusions.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; First, "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Second, "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him."&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies.&lt;ref name=Foucault2&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 169|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union became one of the most common but by no means exceptional cases.&lt;ref name=Foucault2/&gt;

According to American psychiatrist Jonas Robitscher, psychiatry has been playing a part in controlling deviant behavior for three hundred years.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Vagrants, "originals," eccentrics, and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were vexatious to the society they lived in were, and sometimes still are, confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Some critics of psychiatry consider the practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting timeserving.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}}

As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is difficult for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}} This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}}

An example of the low threshold is a point of [[Donetsk]] psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being as public one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding "public well-being" as personal one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} After reading the book ''Institute of Fools'' by [[Viktor Nekipelov]], Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}}

According to the response by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense "on holiday" in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the "gates of hell" from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Kazan]], [[Blagoveshchensk]], and that is not all.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the "treatment" (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin).{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the [[action T4|Nazi euthanasia programs]].&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"&gt;{{harvnb|Trehub|2013}}; {{harvnb|Zakal|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The issue remains highly relevant.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt;

According to Fedor Kondratev, an expert of the Serbsky Center and supporter of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s,{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=46}} those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} It was they who began to be searched for "psychopathological mechanisms" and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization as a result of the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the "exclusively scientific" concept of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave "in a different way than others do" not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for "psychopathological mechanisms" of his dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment "for it" in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=180}} Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=182}}

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, with regard to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not to take into account an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric [[nomenklatura]] retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}}

As Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko notes, the use of punitive psychiatry allowed of avoiding the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=77}} Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can be based on a preconception.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}}

German psychiattist Hanfried Helmchen says the uncertainty of diagnosis is prone to other than medical influence, e.g., political influence, as was the case with Soviet dissenters who were stifled by a psychiatric diagnosis, especially that of "sluggish schizophrenia," in order to take them away from society in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Helmchen|2013}}

According to Russian psychologist Dmitry Leontev, punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union was based on the assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice.{{sfn|Leontev|2010}}

K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: "An important vulnerability factor, therefore, for the abuse of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends."{{sfn|Fulford|Smirnov|Snow|1993}} The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adshead|2003}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=1965|year2=1971|year3=1977|year4=1978a|year5=1978b|year6=1987|year7=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there ''cannot'' be any political abuse of plastic surgery.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians ''diagnosing'' the person's condition a "illness," ''declaring'' the intervention they impose on the victim a "treatment," and legislators and judges ''legitimating'' these categorizations as "illnesses" and "treatments."{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} In the same way, physician-[[eugenicists]] advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|2001|p=220}}; {{harvnb|Szasz|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"/&gt; Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been "dissidents."{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} Before the [[American Civil War]], dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to "reform" [[Marxism]] or emigrate to escape from it.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} As Szasz put it, "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the "abuse" of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use."{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the "[[Therapeutic State]]", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}} Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}}

As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, psychiatric power in practically all societies expands on the grounds of public safety, which, in the view of the leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence.{{sfn|Robertson|Walter|2013|p=86}} According to [[Gwen Adshead]], a British forensic psychotherapist at the [[Broadmoor Hospital]], the question is what is meant by the word "abnormal."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as "socially inappropriate."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.{{sfn|Adshead|2003}}

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is the only medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence for the benefit of the patient.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; In Russia, all that goes by opposites.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

[[Vladimir Bukovsky]], well known for his [[struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]], explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization did not have an end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years.{{sfn|Davidoff|2013}} "Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you", he said and added, "I saw people who basically were asleep for years."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007}}

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] attributed the view that the "brutal treatment of Soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia."{{sfn|Altshuler|2005|p=61}}

== Residual problems ==
In the opinion of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] chairwoman [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]], the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}} The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} When psychiatric profession is discredited in one part of the world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world.{{sfn|Voren|Bloch|1989|p=13}} Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Bloch|1997}} There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}}

As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today subjective position of a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence is related to the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

The psychiatrist became a scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into confidence in the secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Psychiatric labels, or [[social stigma|stigmas]], have spread so widely that there is no such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person ''[[schizo]]'' and does not generalize [[psychiatric assessment]]s to phenomena of public life.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The word ''[[psikhushka]]'' entered everyday vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Vilnius]] psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} In 2007, [[Alexander Dugin]], a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and adviser to [[Chairman of the State Duma|State Duma speaker]] [[Sergei Naryshkin]], presented opponents of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s policy as mentally ill by saying, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokolov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Pasko|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper'' of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of [[medical privacy]] and ethics publicized the diagnosis of [[histrionic personality disorder]], which she in absentia gave [[Kseniya Sobchak]], a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.{{sfn|Savenko|2012}}

Robert van Voren noted that after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], it became apparent that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).{{sfn|Ivanova|1992}}

According to Robert van Voren, although for several years, especially after the implosion of the USSR and during the first years of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} Even the reform efforts made in such places as [[St. Petersburg]], [[Tomsk]], and [[Kaliningrad]] have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}}

Throughout the post-communist period, the pharmaceutical industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}} Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}}

At the turn of the century, the [[psychiatric reform in Italy|psychiatric reform]] that had been implemented by [[Franco Basaglia]] in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} But when it became clear that even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} Despite the 1992 [[Russian Mental Health Law]], coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period.{{sfn|Bonnie|2002}} In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.{{sfn|Mundt|Frančišković|Gurovich|2012}}

In 2005, the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013.{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|NPZ|2008}} Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}} Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}}
[[File:Kiev - hospital2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|One of the buildings of the Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in [[Kiev]]]]
At his press conference in 2008, [[Semyon Gluzman]] said that the surplus in [[Ukraine]] of hospitals for inpatient treatment of the mentally ill was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children's unit alone were more than in the whole of [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Gluzman press conference|2008}} In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] with red flags, portraits of [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]] and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!"{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless "chronic patients" unable to live on their own.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A similar pattern is in internats.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, "halfway houses".{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} Ukraine does not have anything like that.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}}

In the Soviet times, mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Sofia Dorinskaya, a human rights activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home.{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=37}} [[Deinstitutionalization]] has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of [[xenophobia]].{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

Traditional values have endured the attempt by western institutions to impose a positive image of deviant behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} For instance, in spite of the removal of [[homosexuality]] from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the [[Rostov Region]] view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The psychiatrists sustain the ban on [[Pride parade|gay parade]]s and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to [[Dozhd]] says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the [[World Health Organization]] removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true.{{sfn|Kekelidze|2013a}} Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to [[antipsychiatry|antipsychiatric actions]], and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one.{{sfn|Savenko|Vinogradova|2005}} In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

In 1994, there was organized a conference concerned with the theme of political abuse of psychiatry and attended by representatives from different former [[Soviet Republics]]&amp;nbsp;— from Russia, [[Belarus]], [[the Baltics]], [[the Caucasus]], and some of the [[Central Asian Republics]].{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Dainius Puras]] made a report on the situation within the [[Lithuanian Psychiatric Association]], where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Yuri Nuller]] talked over how in Russia the wind direction was gradually changing and the systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of "hyperdiagnosis" or "scientific disagreement."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} It was particularly noteworthy that [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]], the then Director of the [[Serbsky Institute]], was a proponent of such belittlement.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} This was not so queer, because she was a close friend of the key architects of "political psychiatry."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}}

In the early 1990s, she spoke the required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry{{sfn|Svetova|2007}} which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and suppression of the human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper ''[[Chas Pik]]'' within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}; {{harvnb|Svetova|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her 2001 book ''Aliyans Prava i Milosediya'' (''The Alliance of Law and Mercy''), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor [[Vladimir Serbsky]] and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the [[police department]] in preventing [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]] and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorelik|2003}}; {{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of "punitive psychiatry" had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}} After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared "patient" [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly "psychopathic".{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}}

While speaking of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past." Attorney [[Karen Nersisyan]] agrees: "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power."{{sfn|Glasser|2002}} According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} She says we have a situation like after the defeat of [[fascism]] in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}}

In his article of 2002, [[Alan A. Stone]], who as a member of team had examined [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] and found him mentally healthy in 1979,{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR.{{sfn|Munro|2002b}} He asserted that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} In Stone's words, he believes that [[Snezhnevsky]] was wrongly condemned by critics.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Stone|year1=1984|year2=1985|loc2=p. 72|year3=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed the [[crime against humanity]] were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of [[psychopharmacologic]] drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the [[CPSU]] [[nomenklatura]], which they remained so far.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg.&lt;ref&gt;abbreviation expansion: organizer of a party group&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his [[dissertation]].{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}}

Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years.{{sfn|Voren|2012}} Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.{{sfn|Voren|2012}}

Many of the current leaders of Russian psychiatry, especially those who were related to the establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes.{{sfn|Dudley|Silove|Gale|2012|p=237}} Among such leaders who did so is [[Aleksandr Tiganov]], a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the [[Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation]]. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, "These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry."{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty.{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.{{sfn|Smulevich|Morozov|2014}}

In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center, strongly degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In his opinion, "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people."{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}} In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it "has never been used for political persecution." Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, "are not very mentally healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RSN|2012}}; {{harvnb|NG|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian psychiatrist Fedor Kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception of the existence of Soviet-era "punitive psychiatry" was nothing more than: "the fantasy [vymysel] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [previously] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends."{{sfn|Fedor|2011|p=177}} He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} As [[Alexander Podrabinek]] writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion.{{sfn|Podrabinek|2014}} In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under [[Russian Civil Code]] Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation.{{sfn|Kondratev|2014}} According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, after the fall of the communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.{{sfn|Chernyavsky|2005|p=9–10}}

In 2004, Savenko stated that the passed law on the state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the only one in the country and is located in her Center.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} No one had ever had such a monopoly.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}}

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the Main expert institution of the country.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center to get in touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have turned out to be a considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.{{sfn|Clark|2014}}

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the then [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}}

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]] a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed "without regard for the scope of the case" and that one must appeal against the expert report "only together with the sentence."{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" by [[Elena Shchukina]] and [[Sergei Shishkov]]{{sfn|Shchukina|Shishkov|2009|p=24–28}} focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} While talking about appealing against "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer [[Dmitry Bartenev]], mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the "parallel" examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

According to the warning made in 2010 by Yuri Savenko at the same Congress, prof. [[Anatoly Smulevich]], author of the monographs ''Problema Paranoyi'' (''The Problem of Paranoia'') (1972) and ''Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya'' (''Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia'') (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia", again began to play the same role he played before.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Recently, under his influence therapists began to widely use [[antidepressants]] and [[antipsychotics]] but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010|pp=13–17}} This situation has opened up a huge new market for [[pharmaceutical firms]], with their unlimited capabilities, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle.{{sfn|Smulevich|2009}}

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in ''Psychiatry. National Manual'' edited by Tatyana Dmitrieva, Valery Krasnov, Nikolai Neznanov, Valentin Semke, and Alexander Tiganov.{{sfn|Dmitrieva|Krasnov|Neznanov|2012|p=322}} In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform.{{sfn|Pashkovsky|2012}} As Russian sociologist [[Alexander Tarasov]] notes, you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as [[Anatoly Chubais]] or [[German Gref]] can be occupied with reforming in our country; and you are suffering from "syndrome of litigiousness" if in addition you wrote to the capital city complaints, which can be written only by a reviewing authority or lawyer.{{sfn|Tarasov|2006|p=159}}

According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}}

In April 1995, the State Duma considered the first draft of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions.{{sfn|Bonnie|Polubinskaya|1999}} In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections?{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], author of the book ''Punitive Medicine'',{{sfn|Luty|2014}} a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Scarnati|1980}} He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior.{{sfn|Gorelik|2003}} Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the [[Russian Mental Health Law]] should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}}; {{harvnb|NPZ|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.{{sfn|Mishina|2011}}

== Documents and memoirs ==
The evidence for the misuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the Soviet Union was documented in a number of articles and books.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}} Several national psychiatric associations examined and acted upon this documentation.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}}

The widely known sources including published and written memoirs by victims of psychiatric arbitrariness convey moral and physical sufferings experienced by the victims in special psychiatric hospitals of the USSR.{{sfn|Gluzman|1991}}

=== Samizdat documentation ===
In August 1969, [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] completed ''Noon'' ("Полдень"), her book about the case of the 25 August 1968 Demonstration on Red Square{{sfn|Gorbanevskaya|1970a}} and began circulating it in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 9, 31 August 1969 — 9.1 "First Anniversary of the invasion of Czechoslovakia".&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English and published under the title ''Red Square at Noon''.{{sfn|Gorbanevskaya|1970b}} Parts of the book describe Special Psychiatric Hospitals and psychiatric examinations of dissidents.

In 1971, twin brothers [[Zhores Medvedev]] and [[Roy Medvedev]] published in London their joint account of Zhores' incarceration in a psychiatric hospital and the Soviet practice of diagnosing political oppositionists as the mentally ill in London, in both English ''A Question of Madness: Repression by Psychiatry in the Soviet Union'' and Russian (''Who is Mad?'' "Кто сумасшедший") editions.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1971}}

Yury Maltsev's ''Report from a Madhouse'', his memoirs in Russian ("Репортаж и сумасшедшего дома"), were issued by the New York-based ''Novy zhurnal'' publishing house in 1974.{{sfn|Maltsev|1974}}

1975 saw the article "My Five Years in Mental Hospitals" by [[Viktor Fainberg]], who had emigrated to France the previous year after four years in the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital.{{sfn|Fainberg|1975}}

In 1976, [[Viktor Nekipelov]] published in [[samizdat]] his book ''Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute''{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p = 147}} documenting his personal experiences during two months' examination at the Serbsky Institute in Moscow.{{sfn|Jena|2008|p = 86}} In 1980, the book was translated and published in English.{{sfn|Nekipelov|1980}} The book was first published in Russia in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2005b}}; {{harvnb|Nekipelov|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Polyvagal theory''' (gr. '[[polus]]', “‘many’” + '[[Vagus nerve|vagal]]', "'vagus nerve'") specifies two functionally distinct branches of the [[vagus]], or tenth [[cranial nerve]]. It serves to identify the relationship between visceral experiences and the vagus nerve's [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] control of the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. The theory was introduced in 1994 by Dr. [[Stephen Porges]], director of the Brain-Body Center at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. According to the theory and its subsequent proof,&lt;ref name="CCJM"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Porges |first= Stephen W |author-link= Stephen Porges |date= April 2009 |title= The polyvagal theory: New insights into adaptive reactions of the autonomic nervous system |journal= [[Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 76 |issue= Supplement 2 |pages= S86–S90 |doi= 10.3949/ccjm.76.s2.17 |issn= 1939-2869 |pmc= 3108032 |pmid= 19376991}}&lt;/ref&gt; the automatic nervous system is interconnected with and sensitive to influences that flow from the body toward the brain, called [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] influences. This effect has been observed and demonstrated by adaptive reactivity dependent on the [[neural circuit]]s' phylogenical development. It builds on the study of what [[Charles Darwin]] referred to as the “pneumogastric nerve." The polyvagal theory claims that humans have physical reactions,&lt;ref name="CCJM" /&gt; such as cardiac and digestive changes, associated with their facial expressions. Porges argues this theory with observations from both [[evolutionary biology]] and neurology.

The branches of the vagal nerve serve different evolutionary [[stress (physiology)|stress]] responses in mammals: the more primitive branch elicits immobilization behaviors (e.g., feigning death), whereas the more evolved branch is linked to social communication and self-soothing behaviors. These functions follow a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] hierarchy, where the most primitive systems are activated only when the more evolved functions fail. These neural pathways regulate autonomic state and the expression of emotional and social behavior. Thus, according to this theory, physiological state dictates the range of behavior and psychological experience. 
Polyvagal theory has many implications for the study of stress, emotion, and social behavior, which has traditionally utilized more peripheral indices of arousal, such as heart rate and [[cortisol]] level. The measurement of [[vagal tone]] in humans has become a novel index of stress vulnerability and reactivity in many studies of populations with [[Mood disorder|affective disorders]], such as children with behavioral problems and those suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]].

==Phylogenetic subsystems/stages==
The vagus nerve is a primary component of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Polyvagal theory outlines the structure and function of the two distinct branches of the vagus, both of which originate in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]].&lt;ref name="Porges"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Porges |first= Stephen W |date= October 2001 |title= The polyvagal theory: phylogenetic substrates of a social nervous system |journal= [[International Journal of Psychophysiology]] |publisher= Elsevier |volume= 42 |issue= 2 |pages= 123–146 |doi= 10.1016/S0167-8760(01)00162-3 |issn= 0167-8760 |pmid= 11587772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, each branch is associated with a different adaptive behavioral strategy, both of which are inhibitory in nature via the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. The vagal system is in opposition to the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic-adrenal system]], which is involved in mobilization behaviors. According to polyvagal theory, these opposing systems are phylogenetically arranged.&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt;

===The dorsal vagal complex===
The dorsal branch of the vagus originates in the [[dorsal motor nucleus]] and is considered the phylogenetically older branch.&lt;ref name="Beauchaine et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last= Beauchaine |first= Theodore P |last2= Gatzke-Kopp |first2= Lisa |last3= Mead |first3= Hilary K |date= February 2007 |title= Polyvagal Theory and developmental psychopathology: Emotion dysregulation and conduct problems from preschool to adolescence |journal= [[Biological Psychology (journal)|Biological Psychology]] |publisher= Elsevier |volume= 7 |issue=  2 |page= 176 |doi= 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.08.008 |issn= 0301-0511 |pmc= 1801075 |pmid= 17045726}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch is [[myelin|unmyelinated]] and exists in most vertebrates. This branch is also known as the “vegetative vagus” because it is associated with primal survival strategies of primitive vertebrates, reptiles, and amphibians.&lt;ref name="Beauchaine et al."/&gt; Under great stress, these animals freeze when threatened, conserving their metabolic resources.

The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) provides primary control of subdiaphragmatic visceral organs, such as the digestive tract. Under normal conditions, the DVC maintains regulation of these digestive processes. However, prolonged disinhibition can be lethal for mammals, as it results in [[apnea]] and [[bradycardia]].&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt;

===The ventral vagal complex ===
With increased neural complexity seen in mammals (due to phylogenetic development) evolved a more sophisticated system to enrich behavioral and affective responses to an increasingly complex environment.&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt; The ventral branch of the vagus originates in the [[nucleus ambiguus]] and is myelinated to provide more control and speed in responding.&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt; This branch is also known as the “smart vagus” because it is associated with the regulation of sympathetic “fight or flight” behaviors in the service of social affiliative behaviors.&lt;ref name="Beauchaine et al."/&gt; These behaviors include social communication and self-soothing and calming.&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt;  In other words, this branch of the vagus can inhibit or disinhibit defensive [[limbic system|limbic circuits]], depending on the situation.
The VVC provides primary control of supradiaphragmatic visceral organs, such as the esophagus, bronchi, pharynx, and larynx. The VVC also exerts important influence on the heart. When vagal tone to the heart’s [[sinoatrial node|pacemaker]] is high, a baseline or resting heart rate is produced. In other words, the vagus acts as a restraint, or brake, limiting heart rate. However, when vagal tone is removed, there is little inhibition to the pacemaker, and so rapid mobilization (“fight/flight”) can be activated in times of stress, but without having to engage the sympathetic-adrenal system, as activation comes at a severe biological cost.&lt;ref name="Porges"/&gt;

==Vagal tone: a physiological marker of stress==
In order to maintain [[homeostasis]], the [[central nervous system]] responds constantly, via neural feedback, to environmental cues. Stressful events disrupt the rhythmic structure of autonomic states, and subsequently, behaviors. Since the vagus plays such an integral role in the [[peripheral nervous system]] via regulation of heart rate, it follows that the amplitude of [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]] (RSA) is a good index of parasympathetic nervous system activity via the cardiac vagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Porges |first= Stephen W |date= 2011 |title= The Polyvagal Theory: Neurophysiological Foundations of Emotions, Attachment, Communication, and Self-regulation |publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn= 978-0-3937-0700-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, RSA is a measurable, noninvasive way to see how the vagus modulates heart rate activity in response to stress. This method is useful to measure individual differences in stress reactivity.

RSA is the widely used measure of the amplitude of heart rate rhythm associated with rate of spontaneous breathing.&lt;ref name="Porges2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Porges |first= Stephen W |date= 2011 |title= The Polyvagal Theory: Neurophysiological Foundations of Emotions, Attachment, Communication, and Self-regulation |publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company |page= 69 |isbn= 978-0-3937-0700-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that amplitude of RSA is an accurate indicator of the [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] influence of the vagus on the heart.&lt;ref name="Porges2"/&gt; Since inhibitory effects of the VVC branch of the vagus allow for a wide range of adaptive, prosocial behaviors, it has been theorized that individuals with greater vagal tone are able to exhibit a greater range of such behaviors. On the other hand, decreased vagal tone is associated with illnesses and medical complications that compromise the CNS.&lt;ref name="Porges2"/&gt; These complications may reduce one's capacity to respond to stress appropriately.

===Clinical applications of polyvagal theory and vagal tone===

Vagal tone has been used in medical and psychological research to better understand the physiological underpinnings of various disorders.

====Clinical applications in the human fetus====
Healthy human fetuses have a high variability in heart rate, which is mediated by the vagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Reed |first= Shawn F |last2= Ohel |first2= Gonen |last3= David  |first3= Rahav  |last4= Porges |first4= Stephen W |date= September 1999 |title= A neural explanation of fetal heart rate patterns: A test of the polyvagal theory |journal= [[Developmental Psychobiology (journal)|Developmental Psychobiology]] |publisher= [[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |volume= 35 |issue= 2 |page= 109 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2302(199909)35:2&lt;108::AID-DEV4&gt;3.0.CO;2-N |issn= 1098-2302 |pmid= 10461125}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, heart rate decelerations, which are also mediated by the vagus, are a sign of [[fetal distress]]. More specifically, prolonged withdrawal of vagal influence on the heart creates a physiological vulnerability to the influence of the Dorsal Vagal Control, which in turn produces [[bradycardia]] (very low heart rate). However, the onset of this deceleration is commonly preceded by transitory [[tachycardia]], which is reflective of the immediate effects of Ventral Vagal Control withdrawal.

==Results of Porges' Theory==
As described by [[Bessel van der Kolk]], professor of psychiatry at the [[Boston University School of Medicine]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk |first1=Bessel |author-link= Bessel van der Kolk |title= The body keeps the score: brain, mind, and body in the healing of trauma |date=2014 |publisher=Viking Penguin |location=New York |isbn=9780670785933 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Q3UAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text=The Polyvagal Theory provided us with a more sophisticated understanding of the biology of safety and danger, one based on the subtle interplay between the visceral experiences of our own bodies and the voices and faces of the people around us. It explained why a kind face or a soothing tone of voice can dramatically alter the way we feel. It clarified why knowing that we are seen and heard by the important people in our lives can make us feel calm and safe, and why being ignored or dismissed can precipitate rage reactions or mental collapse. It helped us understand why focused attunement with another person can shift us out of disorganized and fearful states. In short, Porges’s theory made us look beyond the effects of fight or flight and put social relationships front and center in our understanding of trauma. It also suggested new approaches to healing that focus on strengthening the body’s system for regulating arousal.}}

In [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law legal systems]], '''precedent''' is a principle or rule established in a previous [[legal case]] that is either binding on or persuasive for a [[court]] or other [[tribunal]] when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Precedent | url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/precedent?s=t | publisher= Dictionary.com | accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1059 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D|date=2015-03-01|title=The Human Rights Act and the doctrine of precedent|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lest.12049/abstract|journal=Legal Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=142–164|doi=10.1111/lest.12049|issn=1748-121X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common-law]] legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules, so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as '''''stare decisis'''''.  [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|Common-law precedent]] is a third kind of law, on equal footing with [[statutory law]] (that is, statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies) and [[delegated legislation]] (in U.K. parlance) or [[regulatory law]] (in U.S. parlance) (that is, regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).

[[Case law]], in common-law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent. In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law, which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency.

Essential to the development of case law is the publication and indexing of decisions for use by lawyers, courts, and the general public, in the form of [[law reports]]. While all decisions are precedent (though at varying levels of authority as discussed throughout this article), some become [[Lists of landmark court decisions|"leading cases" or "landmark decisions"]] that are cited especially often.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, past decisions may [[precedent#Precedent_in_civil_law|influence]] future decisions, even if they do not have the precedential, binding effect that they have in common law decision-making.

{{TOC limit|4}}

==Principle==
''Stare decisis'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|r|i|_|d|ᵻ|ˈ|s|aɪ|s|ᵻ|s|,_|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|r|eɪ}}) is a legal principle by which judges are obligated to respect the precedent established by prior decisions. The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the [[Latin]] maxim ''Stare decisis et non quieta movere'': "to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed".&lt;ref name=Adeleye&gt;Adeleye, Gabriel et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;pg=PA371 World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: a Resource for Readers and Writers]'', page 371 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In a legal context, this means that courts should abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters.&lt;ref name=Adeleye /&gt;  The principle can be divided into two components:&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

# A decision made by a superior court, or by the same court in an earlier decision, is binding precedent that the court itself and all its inferior courts must follow.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;
# A court may overturn its own precedent, but should do so only if a strong reason exists to do so, and even in that case, should be guided by principles from superior, lateral, and inferior courts.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

The second principle, regarding [[persuasive precedent]], reflects the broad precedent guidance a court may draw upon in reaching all of its decisions.&lt;ref name=kmiec&gt;Kmiec, Keenan. The Origin and Current Meanings of "Judicial Activism", ''California Law Review'' (2004):

{{quote|Some instances of disregarding precedent are almost universally considered inappropriate. For example, in a rare showing of unity in a Supreme Court opinion discussing judicial activism, Justice Stevens wrote that a circuit court "engaged in an indefensible brand of judicial activism" when it "refused to follow" a "controlling precedent" of the Supreme Court. The rule that lower courts should abide by controlling precedent, sometimes called "'''''vertical precedent'''''," can safely be called settled law. It appears to be equally well accepted that the act of disregarding vertical precedent qualifies as one kind of judicial activism. "'''''Horizontal precedent'''''," the doctrine requiring a court "to follow its own prior decisions in similar cases," is a more complicated and debatable matter....[A]cademics argue that it is sometimes proper to disregard horizontal precedent. Professor Gary Lawson, for example, has argued that ''stare decisis'' itself may be unconstitutional if it requires the Court to adhere to an erroneous reading of the Constitution. "If the Constitution says X and a prior judicial decision says Y, a court has not merely the power, but the obligation, to prefer the Constitution." In the same vein, Professors Ahkil Amar and Vikram Amar have stated, "Our general view is that the Rehnquist Court's articulated theory of ''stare decisis'' tends to improperly elevate judicial doctrine over the Constitution itself." It does so, they argue, "by requiring excessive deference to past decisions that themselves may have been misinterpretations of the law of the land.

For Lawson, Akhil Amar, and Vikram Amar, dismissing erroneous horizontal precedent would not be judicial activism; instead, it would be appropriate constitutional decisionmaking.|Walton Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law in common-law systems===
In the [[common-law]] tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedent, which record how and why prior [[Legal case|cases]] have been decided. Unlike most civil-law systems, [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common-law]] systems follow the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501215549/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in England, the [[High Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal]] are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.

Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over day-to-day proceedings in lower [[court of record|courts]], in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to reverse or overrule decisions of the lower courts. Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent and the case is not [[appeal]]ed, the decision will stand.

A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if the lower court feels that the precedent is unjust; the lower court may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, the court may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that the precedent should be "distinguished: by some material difference between the facts of the cases.  If that decision goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. [[Lord Denning]], first of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], later of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of [[estoppel]] starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130.

Judges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to reach a decision in a case. Widely cited nonbinding sources include legal [[encyclopedia]]s such as ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]'' and ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'', or the published work of the [[Law Commission]] or the [[American Law Institute]]. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the [[Highway Code]].

In federal or multijurisdictional law systems,  conflicts may exist between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and  distinguishing how the law is applied in one [[district]], province, division or [[appellate court|appellate department]] may be necessary. Usually, only an appeal accepted by the [[court of last resort]] will resolve such differences, and for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.

Any court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal. An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish the decisions based on significant differences in the facts applicable to each case.  Or, a court may view the matter before it as one of "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|first impression]]", not governed by any controlling precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Dyrek, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/First-Impressions.pdf "First Impressions"], ''Appellate Advocate'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

When various members of a multi-judge court write separate opinions, the reasoning may differ; only the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' of the majority becomes binding precedent.  For example, if a 12-member court splits 5-2-3-2 in four different opinions on several different issues, whatever reasoning commands seven votes on each specific issue, and the seven-judge majorities may differ issue-to-issue.  All may be cited as persuasive (though of course opinions that concur in the majority result are more persuasive than dissents).

Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported opinion may depend on the reputation of both the court and the judges with respect to the specific issue.  For example, in the United States, the Second Circuit (New York and surrounding states) is especially respected in commercial and securities law, the Seventh Circuit (in Chicago), especially Judge Posner, is highly regarded on antitrust, and the District of Columbia  Circuit is highly regarded on administrative law,

==Categories and classifications of precedent, and effect of classification==

===Verticality===
Generally, a [[common law]] court system has [[trial court]]s, intermediate [[appellate court]]s and a [[supreme court]]. The inferior courts conduct almost all trial proceedings. The inferior courts are bound to obey precedent established by the appellate court for their jurisdiction, and all supreme court precedent.

The [[Supreme Court of California]]'s explanation of this principle is that

{{quote|[u]nder the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. Otherwise, the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' makes no sense. The decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state courts of California. Decisions of every division of the [[California Courts of Appeal|District Courts of Appeal]] are binding upon all the justice and municipal courts and upon all the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts of this state]], and this is so whether or not the superior court is acting as a trial or appellate court. Courts exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law declared by courts of superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to attempt to overrule decisions of a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/57C2d450.htm 57 Cal. 2d 450] (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An Intermediate state appellate court is generally bound to follow the decisions of the highest court of that state.

The application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' from a superior court to an inferior court is sometimes called ''vertical stare decisis''.

===Horizontality===

The idea that a judge is bound by (or at least should respect) decisions of earlier judges of similar or coordinate level is called horizontal ''stare decisis''.

In the [[United States federal court system]], the intermediate appellate courts are divided into thirteen "circuits," each covering some range of territory ranging in size from the District of Columbia alone up to seven states. Each panel of judges on the [[United States court of appeals|court of appeals]] for a circuit is bound to obey the prior appellate decisions of the same circuit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Precedent of a United States court of appeals may be overruled only by the court ''[[en banc#United States Courts of Appeals|en banc]],'' that is, a session of all the active appellate judges of the circuit, or by the [[United States Supreme Court]], not simply by a different three-judge panel.

When a court binds itself, this application of the doctrine of precedent is sometimes called ''horizontal stare decisis''. The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has a similar appellate structure as it is divided into four [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate departments]] supervised by the final [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Decisions of one appellate department are not binding upon another, and in some cases the departments differ considerably on interpretations of law.

===Federalism and parallel state and federal courts===

In federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions.  In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.

*  When a federal court rules on an issue of state law, the federal court must follow the precedent of the state courts, under the [[Erie doctrine]]. If an issue of state law arises during a case in federal court, and there is no decision on point from the highest court of the state, the federal court must either attempt to predict how the state courts would resolve the issue by looking at decisions from state appellate courts, or, if allowed by the constitution of the relevant state, [[certified question|submit]] the question to the state's courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/toddbruno/mandatory_v__persuasive.htm |title=Mandatory v. Persuasive |publisher=Faculty.law.lsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025142246/http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/toddbruno/mandatory_v__persuasive.htm |archive-date=2012-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the other hand, when a state court rules on an issue of federal law, the state court is bound only by rulings of the Supreme Court, but not by decisions of federal district or circuit courts of appeals&lt;ref name="40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416"&gt;''People v. Leonard'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/40C4t1370.htm 40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416] (2007) (Ninth Circuit decisions do not bind Supreme Court of California).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/tlr51&amp;div=41&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=51 Texas Law Review 1972-1973 Binding Effect of Federal Declaratory Judgments on State Courts Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States federal courts]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However some states have adopted a practice of considering themselves bound by rulings of the court of appeals embracing their states, as a matter of comity rather than constitutional obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Colin E. |last=Wrabley|title=Applying Federal Court of Appeals’ Precedent: Contrasting Approaches to Applying Court of Appeals’ Federal Law Holdings and Erie State Law Predictions, 3 Seton Hall Circuit Rev. 1 (2006)|url=http://m.reedsmith.com/files/Publication/f2d6419f-4ea8-4b31-a1f2-e2c5752ac77d/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/84ab3eeb-9a19-419c-9776-009a4e40288a/Wrabley.pdf|format=PDf|website=m.reedsmith.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize [[forum shopping]].

===Binding precedent===

Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as ''binding precedent'' (alternately ''metaphorically precedent'', ''mandatory'' or ''binding authority'', etc.). Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', a [[lower court]] must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court. All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a "supreme court"). By definition, decisions of lower courts are not binding on courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see [[Law of the case]] re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).

In [[law]], a binding precedent (also known as a mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all [[lower court]]s under [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]]. In [[English law]] it is usually created by the decision of a higher court, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], which took over the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] in 2009. In [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

Binding precedent relies on the [[legal principle]] of ''stare decisis''. ''Stare decisis'' means to stand by things decided. It ensures certainty and consistency in the application of law. Existing binding precedent from past cases are applied in principle to new situations by analogy.

One law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:

:Given a determination as to the governing jurisdiction, a court is "bound" to follow a precedent of that jurisdiction only if it is directly in point. In the strongest sense, "directly in point" means that: (1) the question resolved in the precedent case is the same as the question to be resolved in the pending case, (2) resolution of that question was necessary to the disposition of the precedent case; (3) the significant facts of the precedent case are also presented in the pending case, and (4) no additional facts appear in the pending case that might be treated as significant.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie D. Rombauer, ''Legal Problem Solving: Analysis, Research and Writing'', pp. 22-23 (West Publishing Co., 3d ed. 1978). (Rombauer was a professor of law at the University of Washington.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to [[distinguish]] the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent.

Under the U.S. legal system, courts are set up in a hierarchy. At the top of the federal or national system is the Supreme Court, and underneath are lower federal courts. The state court systems have hierarchy structures similar to that of the federal system.

The U.S. Supreme Court has final authority on questions about the meaning of federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. For example, when the Supreme Court says that the First Amendment applies in a specific way to suits for slander, then every court is bound by that precedent in its interpretation of the First Amendment as it applies to suits for slander. If a lower court judge disagrees with a higher court precedent on what the First Amendment should mean, the lower court judge must rule according to the binding precedent. Until the higher court changes the ruling (or the law itself is changed), the binding precedent is authoritative on the meaning of the law.

Lower courts are bound by the precedent set by higher courts within their region. Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (the mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of the Third Circuit Court, but not by rulings in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography. The Circuit Courts of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, so long as there is no binding Supreme Court precedent. One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants [[certiorari]] (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of a federal law.

There are three elements needed for a precedent to work. Firstly, the hierarchy of the courts needs to be accepted, and an efficient system of law reporting. 'A balance must be struck between the need on one side for the [[legal certainty]] resulting from the binding effect of previous decisions, and on the other side the avoidance of undue restriction on the proper development of the law (1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) by Lord Gardiner L.C.)'.

====Binding precedent in English law====
Judges are bound by the law of binding precedent in [[England and Wales]] and other [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions. This is a distinctive feature of the English legal system. In Scotland and many countries throughout the world, particularly in mainland Europe, civil law means that judges take case law into account in a similar way, but are not obliged to do so and are required to consider the precedent in terms of principle. Their fellow judges' decisions may be persuasive but are not binding. Under the English legal system, judges are not necessarily entitled to make their own decisions about the development or interpretations of the law. They may be bound by a decision reached in a previous case. Two facts are crucial to determining whether a precedent is binding:
# The position in the court hierarchy of the court which decided the precedent, relative to the position in the court trying the current case.
# Whether the facts of the current case come within the scope of the principle of law in previous decisions.

In a [[conflict of laws]] situation, [[jus cogens]] [[erga omnes]] norms and principles of the common law such as in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], to a varying degree in different jurisdictions, are deemed overriding which means they are used to "read down" legislation, that is giving them a particular [[purposive interpretation]], for example applying [[European Court of Human Rights]] [[jurisprudence]] of courts ([[case law]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===="Super ''stare decisis''"====

"Super ''stare decisis''" is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Michael. [http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf "Precedent, Super-Precedent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704095246/http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf |date=2007-07-04 }}, ''George Mason Law Review'' (14 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 363) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.

In 1976, [[Richard Posner]] and William Landes coined the term "super-precedent" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, William &amp; Posner, Richard. "Legal Precedent: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis", 19 ''Journal of Law and Economics'' 249, 251 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term "super-precedent" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Allison. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/scr/2006/hayward.pdf The Per Curiam Opinion of Steel: Buckley v. Valeo as Superprecedent?], ''Cato Supreme Court Review'' 195, 202, (2005-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''), that side can protect its position from being reversed "by a kind of super-stare decisis".&lt;ref&gt;Maltz, Earl. "Abortion, Precedent, and the Constitution: A Comment on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey", 68 ''Notre Dame L. Rev.'' 11 (1992), quoted by Rosen, Jeffrey.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/weekinreview/30rosen.html? So, Do You Believe in 'Superprecedent'?], ''New York Times'' (2005-10-30).&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial idea that some decisions are virtually immune from being overturned, regardless of whether they were decided correctly in the first place, is the idea to which the term "super-''stare decisis''" now usually refers.

The concept of super-''stare decisis'' (or "super-precedent") was mentioned during the interrogations of Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and Justice [[Samuel Alito]] before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Prior to the commencement of the Roberts hearings, the chair of that committee, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referring to ''Roe'' as a "super-precedent". He revisited this concept during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Benac, Nancy |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0913-09.htm |title=Roberts Repeatedly Dodges Roe v.

===Persuasive precedent===

'''Persuasive precedent''' (also '''persuasive authority''') is precedent or other legal writing that is not [[binding precedent]] but that is useful or relevant and that may guide the judge in making the decision in a current case. Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, state courts versus federal courts in the United States), statements made in [[dicta]], [[treatises]] or academic [[law reviews]], and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.

In a "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|case of first impression]]", courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other [[jurisdiction]]s that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through its adoption by a higher court.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems, as under [[Scots law]], precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

====Lower courts====

A lower court's opinion may be considered as persuasive authority if the judge believes they have applied the correct legal principle and reasoning.

====Higher courts in other circuits====
A court may consider the ruling of a higher court that is not binding. For example, a [[United States district court|district court]] in the United States First Circuit could consider a ruling made by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] as persuasive authority.

====Horizontal courts====
Courts may consider rulings made in other courts that are of equivalent authority in the legal system. For example, an [[appellate court]] for one district could consider a ruling issued by an appeals court in another district.

====Statements made in ''obiter dicta''====

Courts may consider ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in opinions of higher courts. Dicta of a higher court, though not binding, will often be persuasive to lower courts.  The phrase ''obiter dicta'' is usually translated as "other things said", but due to the high number of judges and individual concurring opinions, it is often hard to distinguish from the ''ratio decidendi'' (reason for the decision).  For these reasons, the obiter dicta may often be taken into consideration by a court.  A litigant may also consider ''obiter dicta'' if a court has previously signaled&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Couture, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Loud-Rules.pdf Loud Rules], 34 Pepperdine L. Rev. 3 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; that a particular legal argument is weak and may even warrant sanctions if repeated.

====Dissenting opinions====
A case decided by a multijudge panel could result in a split decision. While only the majority opinion is considered precedential, an outvoted judge can still publish a dissenting opinion.  Common patterns for dissenting opinions include:
* an explanation of how the outcome of the case might be different on slightly different facts, in an attempt to limit the holding of the majority
* planting seeds for a future overruling of the majority opinion
A judge in a subsequent case, particularly in a different jurisdiction, could find the dissenting judge's reasoning persuasive. In the jurisdiction of the original decision, however, a judge should only overturn the holding of a court lower or equivalent in the hierarchy. A district court, for example, could not rely on a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] dissent as a basis to depart from the reasoning of the majority opinion.  However, lower courts occasionally cite dissents, either for a limiting principle on the majority, or for propositions that are not stated in the majority opinion and not inconsistent with that majority, or to explain a disagreement with the majority and to urge reform (while following the majority in the outcome).

====Treatises, restatements, law review articles====
Courts may consider the writings of eminent legal scholars in treatises, restatements of the law, and law reviews. The extent to which judges find these types of writings persuasive will vary widely with elements such as the reputation of the author and the relevance of the argument.

====Persuasive effect of decisions from other jurisdictions====
The courts of England and Wales are free to consider decisions of other jurisdictions, and give them whatever persuasive weight the English court sees fit, even though these other decisions are not binding precedent.  Jurisdictions that are closer to modern English [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] are more likely to be given persuasive weight (for example Commonwealth states such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand).  Persuasive weight might be given to other common law courts, such as from the United States, most often where the American courts have been particularly innovative, e.g. in [[product liability]] and certain areas of [[contract]] law.

In the United States, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the concept of a U.S. court considering foreign law or precedent has been considered controversial by some parties. The Supreme Court splits on this issue. This critique is recent, as in the early history of the United States, citation of English authority was ubiquitous. One of the first acts of many of the new state legislatures was to adopt the body of English common law into the law of the state.  See [[Common law#CL Reception Statutes|here]].  Citation to English cases was common through the 19th and well into the 20th centuries.  Even in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it is relatively uncontroversial for American state courts to rely on English decisions for matters of pure common (i.e. judge-made) law. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Within the federal legal systems of several common-law countries, and most especially the United States, it is relatively common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g. state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent. Particularly in the United States, the adoption of a legal doctrine by a large number of other state judiciaries is regarded as highly persuasive evidence that such doctrine is preferred. A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of [[comparative negligence]] (replacing [[contributory negligence]] as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] decision ''[[McIntyre v. Balentine]]'' (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted comparative negligence schemes). Moreover, in American law, the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]] requires federal courts sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity actions]] to apply state substantive law, but in a manner consistent with how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case. Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.

===Nonprecedential decisions: unpublished decisions, non-publication and depublication, noncitation rules===
{{main|Non-publication of legal opinions in the United States}}

Nonpublication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the cases as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in [[law reports|a reporter]]. "Unpublished" federal appellate decisions are published in the [[Federal Appendix]]. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.

[[Litigation]] that is settled out of court generates no written decision, thus has no precedential effect.  As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.

===''Res judicata'', claim preclusion, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, law of the case===

Several rules may cause a decision to apply as narrow "precedent" to preclude future legal positions of the specific parties to a case, even if a decision is non-precedential with respect to all other parties.

====''Res judicata'', claim preclusion====

{{main|res judicata}}

Once a case is decided, the same plaintiff cannot sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts.  The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case, not split the case.  For example, in a case of an auto accident, the plaintiff cannot sue first for property damage, and then personal injury in a separate case.  This is called ''[[res judicata]]'' or [[claim preclusion]] ("'Res judicata'" is the traditional name going back centuries; the name shifted to "claim preclusion" in the United States over the late 20th century).  Claim preclusion applies regardless of the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case, even if the later case raises a different legal theory, even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case.  Exceptions are extremely limited, for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts (for example, one claim might be exclusively federal, and the other exclusively state).

====Collateral estoppel, issue preclusion====

{{main|Collateral estoppel}}

Once a case is finally decided, any issues decided in the previous case may be binding against the party who lost the issue in later cases, even in cases involving other parties.  For example, if a first case decides that a party was negligent, then other plaintiffs may rely on that earlier determination in later cases, and need not reprove the issue of negligence.  For another example, if a patent is shown to be invalid in a case against one accused infringer, that same patent is invalid against all other accused infringers—invalidity need not be reproven.  Again,  limits and exceptions on this principle exist.  The principle is called [[collateral estoppel]] or [[issue preclusion]].

====law of the case====

{{main|law of the case}}

Within a single case, once there's been a first appeal, both the lower court and the appellate court itself will not further review the same issue, and will not re-review an issue that could have been appealed in the first appeal.  Exceptions are limited to three "exceptional circumstances:" (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when the law changes after the first appeal, for example by a decision of a higher court, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.  This principle is called "[[law of the case]]".

===Splits, tensions===

On many questions, reasonable people may differ.  When two of those people are judges, the tension among two lines of precedent may be resolved as follows.

====Jurisdictional splits: disagreements among different geographical regions or levels of federalism====

If the two courts are in separate, parallel jurisdictions, there is no conflict, and two lines of precedent may persist.  Courts in one jurisdiction are influenced by decisions in others, and notably better rules may be adopted over time.

====Splits among different areas of law====

Courts try to formulate the common law as a "seamless web" so that principles in one area of the law apply to other areas.  However, this principle does not apply uniformly.  Thus, a word may have different definitions in different areas of the law, or different rules may apply so that a question has different answers in different legal contexts.  Judges try to minimize these conflicts, but they arise from time to time, and under principles of 'stare decisis', may persist for some time.

====Conflicts====

===Matter of first impression===
A matter of first impression (also known as an "issue of first impression," "case of first impression," or, in [[Latin language|Latin]], as ''primae impressionis'') is an issue where the parties disagree on what the applicable law is, and there is no prior [[binding authority]], so that the matter has to be decided for the first time.  A first impression case may be a first impression in only a particular [[jurisdiction]].

By definition, a case of first impression cannot be decided by precedent.  Since there is no precedent for the court to follow, the court uses the plain language and [[legislative history]] of any statute that must be interpreted, [[judicial holding|holdings]] of other jurisdictions, [[persuasive authority]] and analogies from prior rulings by other courts (which may be higher, peers, or lower courts in the hierarchy, or from other jurisdictions), commentaries and articles by legal scholars, and the court's own logic and sense of justice.

==Contrasting role of case law in common law, civil law, and mixed systems {{Anchor|Precedent_in_civil_law}} ==

The different roles of case law in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles. These are called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' and constitute a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''[[obiter dicta]]'', which have [[persuasive authority]] but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally very short, referring only to [[statute]]s. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions apply legislative positivism — a form of extreme [[legal positivism]] — which holds that legislation is the only valid source of law because it has been voted on democratically; thus, it is not the judiciary's role to create law, but rather to interpret and apply statute, and therefore their decisions must reflect that.

===Civil law systems===

''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'', according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same [[Holding (law)|holdings]] using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to ''stare decisis'' insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cassation Court]] and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], is recognized as being ''de facto'' binding on lower courts.

The doctrine of ''jurisprudence constante'' also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of [[common law]] jurisdictions give a sufficient ''ratio decidendi'' as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently [[France]]) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the ''ratio decidendi'' in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, ''ratio decidendi'' is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in [[common law]] jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.

In other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, ''ratio decidendi'' tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as [[Germany|German]] courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than [[common law]] courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.

The mixed systems of the [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In [[Sweden]], for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] (''Högsta domstolen'') and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen''), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial (''hovrätter'') or administrative (''kammarrätter''), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.

===Mixed or bijuridical systems===

Some [[legal pluralism|mixed]] systems, such as [[Scots law]] in [[Scotland]], [[Law of South Africa|South-African law]], and the law of [[Quebec]] and [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the [[common law]] tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as "mixed" systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both ''stare decisis'' and ''jurisprudence constante''. In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is ''prima facie'' or presumptively binding between courts.

===Role of academics in civil law jurisdictions===

Law [[professor]]s in [[common law]] traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called [[doctrine]] and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'' in France. Historically, [[common law]] courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as [[Edward Coke|Coke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as [[persuasive authority]]; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.

==Critical analysis==

===Court formulations===

Justice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to ''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', {{law report|285|U.S.|393}}, 405–411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):

:''Stare decisis'' is not ... a universal, inexorable command. "The rule of ''stare decisis'', though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided."  ''Stare decisis'' is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function. ... In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of this Court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of ''stare decisis'' was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases. Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.

:The reasons why this Court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution. In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognized constitutional limitation. This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct. ...

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] has stated:

:A judicial precedent attaches a specific legal consequence to a detailed set of facts in an adjudged case or judicial decision, which is then considered as furnishing the rule for the determination of a subsequent case involving identical or similar material facts and arising in the same court or a lower court in the judicial hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965, 969-970 (3rd Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted), as quoted in ''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] has stated:

:Stare decisis is the policy of the court to stand by precedent; the term is but an abbreviation of ''stare decisis et non quieta movere'' — "to stand by and adhere to decisions and not disturb what is settled". Consider the word "decisis". The word means, literally and legally, the decision. Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' a case is important only for what it decides — for the "what", not for the "why", and not for the "how". Insofar as precedent is concerned, ''stare decisis'' is important only for the decision, for the detailed legal consequence following a detailed set of facts.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael McHugh (judge)|Justice McHugh]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] in relation to precedents remarked in ''Perre v Apand'':
:[T]hat is the way of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the judges preferring to go 'from case to case, like the ancient Mediterranean mariners, hugging the coast from point to point, and avoiding the dangers of the open sea of system or science.

===Academic study===
Precedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.  The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2203392## Elizabeth Y. McCuskey, Clarity and Clarification: Grable Federal Questions in the Eyes of Their Beholders, 91 NEB. L. REV. 387, 427-430 (2012)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have recently attempted to apply [[network theory]] to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James H. Fowler]] and Sangick Jeon, "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent," Social Networks (2007), {{doi|10.1016/j.socnet.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Development===
Early English [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] did not have or require the ''stare decisis'' doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:
*During the formative period of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the royal courts constituted only one among many fora in which in the English could settle their disputes. The royal courts operated alongside and in competition with ecclesiastic, manorial, urban, mercantile, and local courts.
*Royal courts were not organised into a hierarchy, instead different royal courts (exchequer, common pleas, king's bench, and chancery) were in competition with each other.
*Substantial law on almost all matters was neither legislated nor codified, eliminating the need for courts to interpret legislation.
*Common law's main distinctive features and focus were not substantial law, which was customary law, but procedural.
*The practice of citing previous cases was not to find binding legal rules but as evidence of custom.
*Customary law was not a rational and consistent body of rules and does not require a system of binding precedent.
*Before the printing press, the state of the written records of cases rendered the ''stare decisis'' doctrine utterly impracticable.

These features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'':
{{quote| By the end of the eighteenth century, the [[common law]] courts had absorbed most of the business of their nonroyal competitors, although there was still internal competition among the different [[common law]] courts themselves. During the nineteenth century, legal reform movements in both England and the United States brought this to an end as well by merging the various [[common law]] courts into a unified system of courts with a formal hierarchical structure. This and the advent of reliable private case reporters made adherence to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' practical and the practice soon evolved of holding judges to be bound by the decisions of courts of superior or equal status in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HAYEK, THE COMMON LAW, AND FLUID DRIVE|first= John |last=Hasnas|publisher= NYU Journal of Law &amp; Liberty |volume =1| pages= 92–93|url=http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/NYUFinal.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United States legal system===

''Stare decisis'' applies to the [[Holding (law)|holding]] of a case, rather than to [[obiter dicta]] ("things said by the way"). As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has put it: "dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-859.html Central ''Green Co. v. United States''], 531 U.S. 425 (2001), quoting ''Humphrey's Executor v. United States'', 295 U. S. 602, 627 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases:

{{quote|Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. ... But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. ... This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause.|sign=''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406–407, 410 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=285&amp;invol=393 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For example, in the years 1946–1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service,[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html Supreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113032452/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html |date=2012-01-13 }} (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:

{{quote|[W]hen convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment, and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.|sign=''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/321/649.html |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States Supreme Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is "explicitly" labeled by the court as an "independent" ground for the decision is not treated as "simply a dictum".&lt;ref&gt;See ''O'Gilvie v. United States'', 519 U.S. 79, 84 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===English legal system===
The doctrine of binding precedent or ''stare decisis'' is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:

====The Supreme Court's ability to override its own precedent ====
The British [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case ''[[London Street Tramways v London County Council]] [1898] AC 375''. After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' (one not applied, previously, in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).

This situation changed, however, after the issuance of the [[Practice Statement]] of 1966. It enabled the House of Lords to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In ''R v G &amp; R'' 2003, the House of Lords overruled its decision in ''Caldwell'' 1981, which had allowed the Lords to establish [[mens rea]] ("guilty mind") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a "reasonable person," regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.

However, the Practice Statement has been seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. As of 2005, the House of Lords has rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are reluctant to use it because they fear to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was ''[[Anderton v Ryan]]'' (1985), which was overruled by ''[[R v Shivpuri]]'' (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, [[Lord Bridge]] stated he was "undeterred by the consideration that the decision in ''Anderton v Ryan'' was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jacqueline (2005). ''The English Legal System'' (4th ed.), p. 25. London: Hodder Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-89991-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in ''R v Kansal'' (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that ''R v Lambert'' had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.

====Distinguishing precedent on legal (rather than fact) grounds====
A precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original "Per Incuriam". For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court's attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.

==Rules of statutory interpretation==
{{Main|Statutory interpretation}}

One of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations.  The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.

===Statutory interpretation in the U.K.===
A judge's normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.

Judges and barristers in the U.K use three primary rules for interpreting the law.

Under the [[literal rule]], the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is ''R v Maginnis'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word ''supply''. Another example is ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'', where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of "offer for sale" in [[contract law]]. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.

The [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]] is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: a narrow method, and a broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to the wording of a legislative provision, or the wording is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be preferred. Under the broad method, the court modifies the literal meaning in such a way as to avoid the absurd result.&lt;ref name="Lawade"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawade.com/the-english-legal-system/statutory-interpretation/the-golden-rule/ |title=The Golden Rule |website=Lawade.com |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter approach is ''Adler v George'' (1964). Under the Official Secrets Act 1920 it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces "in the vicinity of" a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the ''vicinity'' of such a place but was actually ''in'' it. The court chose not to read the statutory wording in a literal sense to avoid what would otherwise be an absurd result, and Adler was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part E - The rules of statutory interpretation - The golden rule|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=415851|publisher=Labspace|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mischief rule]] is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from ''[[Heydon's Case]]'' (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in ''Corkery v Carpenter'' (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle.

===Statutory Interpretation in the United States===
In the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.
*"[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn to one cardinal canon before all others. ... [C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there." ''Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain'', [[Case citation|112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149]] (1992). Indeed, "[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.' "
*"A fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that every part of a statute be presumed to have some effect, and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary." ''Raven Coal Corp. v. Absher'', [[Case citation|153 Va. 332]], 149 S.E. 541 (1929).
*"In assessing statutory language, unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning, by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction, they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage." ''Muller v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.'', [http://www.leagle.com/decision/19961706923P2d783_11695.xml/MULLER%20v.%20BP%20EXPLORATION%20(ALASKA)%20INC. 923 P.2d 783], 787–88 (Alaska 1996).

However, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity—inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes.  In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity.  The "Canons of statutory construction" are discussed in a [[Statutory interpretation|separate article]].  Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.

==Practical application==
Although inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent.  On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent.  On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.

===Judicial resistance===
Occasionally, a lower court judge explicitly states personal disagreement with the judgment he or she has rendered, but that he or she is required to do so by [[binding precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1195909351234664885 ''State Oil Co. v. Khan''], 93 F.3d 1358 (7th Cir. 1996), in which Judge Richard Posner followed the applicable Supreme Court precedent, while harshly criticizing it, which led the Supreme Court to overrule that precedent in ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', 522 U.S. 3 (1997); see also the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Walker in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1895782534423575000 ''National Abortion Federation v. Gonzalez''], 437 F. 3d 278 (2d Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=502&amp;invol=197 ''Hilton vs. Carolina Pub. Rys. Comm'n.''], 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S. Ct. 560, 565 (1991)("we will not depart from the doctrine of stare decisis without some compelling justification").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural considerations===
In the United States, ''stare decisis'' can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] or [[statutory law]], the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

Courts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called ''[[persuasive authority]]'' — indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.

===Originalism===
[[Originalism]] is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge).  In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and "what works," contemporary standards of justice, and ''stare decisis''.  Both are directed at ''interpreting'' the text, not changing it—interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.

The two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction--''stare decisis'' gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest.  While they don't necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] argue that "''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law."&lt;ref&gt;''A Matter of Interpretation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist's own interpretation of the [[US Constitution|Constitutional]] text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for ''stare decisis''; whenever the [[plain meaning rule|plain meaning]] of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.

Originalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] answered a question from Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:

{{quote|I think overruling a case or reconsidering a case is a very serious matter. Certainly, you would have to be of the view that a case is incorrectly decided, but I think even that is not adequate. There are some cases that you may not agree with that should not be overruled. Stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision-making, I think it is a very important and critical concept. A judge that wants to reconsider a case and certainly one who wants to overrule a case has the burden of demonstrating that not only is the case incorrect, but that it would be appropriate, in view of stare decisis, to make that additional step of overruling that case.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Thomas|Thomas, Clarence]] (1991). ''[U.S.] Senate Confirmation Hearings.'' qtd. by Jan Crawford Greenburg on [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/june03/scotus_forum2.html PBS] (June 2003) Accessed 8 January 2007 UTC.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Possibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit "the additional step" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, "[[Clarence Thomas]] doesn't believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let's get it right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ringel, Jonathan | title= Fulton County Daily Report - The Bombshell in the Clarence Thomas Biography | publisher=www.dailyreportonline.com | year=2004 | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1090180289132 | authorlink=Jonathan Ringel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/Faculty.nsf/FHPbI/C4888338932C96E5852566EF00728D67?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1 Caleb Nelson], a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of ''stare decisis'' in originalist jurisprudence:

{{quote|American courts of last resort recognize a rebuttable presumption against overruling their own past decisions. In earlier eras, people often suggested that this presumption did not apply if the past decision, in the view of the court's current members, was demonstrably erroneous. But when the Supreme Court makes similar noises today, it is roundly criticized. At least within the academy, conventional wisdom now maintains that a purported demonstration of error is not enough to justify overruling a past decision. ...[T]he conventional wisdom is wrong to suggest that any coherent doctrine of stare decisis must include a presumption against overruling precedent that the current court deems demonstrably erroneous. The doctrine of stare decisis would indeed be no doctrine at all if courts were free to overrule a past decision simply because they would have reached a different decision as an original matter. But when a court says that a past decision is demonstrably erroneous, it is saying not only that it would have reached a different decision as an original matter, but also that the prior court went beyond the range of indeterminacy created by the relevant source of law. ... Americans from the Founding on believed that court decisions could help "liquidate" or settle the meaning of ambiguous provisions of written law. Later courts generally were supposed to abide by such "liquidations." ... To the extent that the underlying legal provision was determinate, however, courts were not thought to be similarly bound by precedent that misinterpreted it. ... Of the Court's current members, Justices Scalia and Thomas seem to have the most faith in the determinacy of the legal texts that come before the Court. It should come as no surprise that they also seem the most willing to overrule the Court's past decisions. ... Prominent journalists and other commentators suggest that there is some contradiction between these Justices' mantra of "judicial restraint" and any systematic re-examination of precedent. But if one believes in the determinacy of the underlying legal texts, one need not define "judicial restraint" solely in terms of fidelity to precedent; one can also speak of fidelity to the texts themselves.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nelson, Caleb | title=Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedent | publisher=Virginia Law Review, 84 Va L.

===Advantages and disadvantages===

There are disadvantages and advantages of binding precedent, as noted by scholars and jurists.

===Criticism of precedent===

In a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of [[legal costs]] during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:
:(1) cases where the foreign jurisdiction's law is the subject of the case, or
:(2) instances where a litigant intends to ask the highest court of the jurisdiction to overturn binding precedent, and therefore needs to cite persuasive precedent to demonstrate a trend in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Trotter, ''Profit and the Practice of Law: What's Happened to the Legal Profession'' (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1997), 161-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantages of ''stare decisis'' include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the differences between some cases may be very small and appear illogical, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

An argument often used against the system is that it is [[democracy|undemocratic]] as it allows judges, which may or may not be elected, to make law.&lt;ref&gt;https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/14_01/mcclellan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding constitutional interpretations, there is concern that over-reliance on the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' can be subversive. An erroneous precedent may at first be only slightly inconsistent with the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], and then this error in interpretation can be propagated and increased by further precedent until a result is obtained that is greatly different from the original understanding of the Constitution. ''Stare decisis'' is not mandated by the Constitution, and if it causes unconstitutional results then the historical evidence of original understanding can be re-examined. In this opinion, predictable fidelity to the Constitution is more important than fidelity to unconstitutional precedent. See also the [[living tree doctrine]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Agreement with precedent===

A counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of ''stare decisis'') is that if the [[legislature]] wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by [[statute]], the legislature is empowered to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Berland, David (2011). Note, [http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/2/Berland.pdf "Stopping the Pendulum: Why Stare Decisis Should Constrain the Court from Further Modification of the Search Incident to Arrest Exception"]. University of Illinois Law Review (2011 U. Ill. L. Rev. 695).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=April 2014}} sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

There is much discussion about the virtue of using ''stare decisis''. Supporters of the system, such as [[Minimalism (Judicial)|minimalists]], argue that obeying precedent makes decisions "predictable". For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Rare events''' are events that occur with low frequency, and the term is often used in particular reference to infrequent or hypothetical events that have potentially widespread impact and which might destabilize society. &lt;ref&gt;King, G., &amp; Zeng, L. (2001). Logistic regression in rare events data. ''Political Analysis'', ''9''(2), 137–63. http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/137.short&lt;/ref&gt; Rare events encompass natural phenomena (major earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid impacts, solar flares, etc.), [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] hazards (warfare and related forms of violent conflict, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, financial and commodity market crashes, etc.), as well as phenomena for which natural and anthropogenic factors interact in complex ways (epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, etc.).

==Overview==
Rare events are discrete occurrences that are statistically “improbable” in that they are very infrequently observed. Despite being statistically improbable, such events are plausible insofar as historical instances of the event (or a similar event) have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Morio, J., Balesdent, M. (2015). ''Estimation of Rare Event Probabilities in Complex Aerospace and Other Systems''. Elsevier Science. http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780081000915&amp;pagename=search&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholarly and popular analyses of rare events often focus on those events that could be reasonably expected to have a substantial negative impact on a society—either economically&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, D. (2002). The management of losses arising from extreme events. Paper presented at General Insurance Convention. http://www.actuaries.org.uk/research-and-resources/documents/management-losses-arising-extreme-events&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of human casualties&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., &amp; Woodard, R. (2013). Estimating the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist events. ''Annals of Applied Statistics'',''7''(4),1838–1865. doi:10.1214/12-AOAS614. https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0089&lt;/ref&gt; (typically, both). Examples of such events might include an 8.0+ Richter magnitude earthquake, a nuclear incident that kills thousands of people, or a 10%+ single-day change in the value of a stock market index.&lt;ref&gt;Ghil, M., P.

==Modeling and analysis==
Rare event modeling (REM) refers to efforts to characterize the [[statistical distribution]] parameters, generative processes, or dynamics that govern the occurrence of statistically rare events, including but not limited to high-impact natural or human-made catastrophes. Such “modeling” may include a wide range of approaches, including, most notably, statistical models derived from historical event data and computational software models that attempt to simulate rare event processes and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., &amp; Mikosch, T. (1997). ''Modelling extremal events: For insurance and finance''. (Vol. 33). Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; REM also encompasses efforts to forecast the occurrence of similar events over some future time horizon, which may be of interest for both scholarly and applied purposes (e.g., risk mitigation and planning).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, P., &amp; Wright,G. (2010). The limits of forecasting methods in anticipating rare events. ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', ''77''(3), 355–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant data sets==
In many cases, rare and catastrophic events can be regarded as extreme-magnitude instances of more mundane phenomena. For example, seismic activity, stock market fluctuations, and acts of organized violence all occur along a continuum of extremity, with more extreme-magnitude cases being statistically infrequent.&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C., Newman, M.E.J. (2009). Power-law distributions in empirical data. ''SIAM Review (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications)'', ''51'',(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111. Retrieved August 29, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, rather than viewing rare event data as its own class of information, data concerning “rare” events often exists as a subset of data within a broader parent event class (e.g., a seismic activity data set would include instances of extreme earthquakes, as well as data on much lower-intensity seismic events).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8536">{{Separation axioms}}

In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is called a '''regular space''' if every [[closed subset]] ''C'' of ''X'' and a point ''p'' not contained in ''C'' admit non-overlapping [[open neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''p'' and ''C'' can be [[separated sets|separated]] by neighborhoods. This condition is known as '''Axiom T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The term "'''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space'''" usually means "a regular [[Hausdorff space]]". These conditions are examples of [[separation axiom]]s.

== Definitions ==
[[Image:Regular space.svg|250px|thumb|right|The point ''x'', represented by a dot to the left of the picture, and the closed set ''F'', represented by a closed disk to the right of the picture, are separated by their neighbourhoods ''U'' and ''V'', represented by larger [[open disk]]s. The dot ''x'' has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''U'', and the closed disk F has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''V'', yet ''U'' and ''V'' do not touch each other.]]

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is a '''regular space''' if, given any [[closed set]] ''F'' and any [[Point (geometry)|point]] ''x'' that does not belong to ''F'', there exists a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' and a neighbourhood ''V'' of ''F'' that are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Concisely put, it must be possible to [[separated set|separate]] ''x'' and ''F'' with disjoint neighborhoods.

A '''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space''' or '''regular Hausdorff space''' is a topological space that is both regular and a [[Hausdorff space]]. (A Hausdorff space or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space is a topological space in which any two distinct points are separated by neighbourhoods.) It turns out that a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (A T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or [[Kolmogorov space]] is a topological space in which any two distinct points are [[topologically distinguishable]], i.e., for every pair of distinct points, at least one of them has an [[open neighborhood]] not containing the other.) Indeed, if a space is Hausdorff then it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and each T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; regular space is Hausdorff: given two distinct points, at least one of them misses the closure of the other one, so (by regularity) there exist disjoint neighborhoods separating one point from (the closure of) the other.

Although the definitions presented here for "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" are not uncommon, there is significant variation in the literature: some authors switch the definitions of "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" as they are used here, or use both terms interchangeably. In this article, we will use the term "regular" freely, but we will usually say "regular Hausdorff", which is unambiguous, instead of the less precise "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;". For more on this issue, see [[History of the separation axioms]].

A [[locally regular space]] is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is regular. Every regular space is locally regular, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a locally regular space that is not regular is the [[bug-eyed line]].

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
A regular space is necessarily also [[preregular space|preregular]], i.e., any two [[topologically distinguishable]] points can be separated by neighbourhoods.
Since a Hausdorff space is the same as a preregular [[Kolmogorov space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]], a regular space which is also T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must be Hausdorff (and thus T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
In fact, a regular Hausdorff space satisfies the slightly stronger condition [[Urysohn space|T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;]].
(However, such a space need not be [[Completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]].)
Thus, the definition of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may cite T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], or T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; instead of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Hausdorffness); all are equivalent in the context of regular spaces.

Speaking more theoretically, the conditions of regularity and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ness are related by [[Kolmogorov quotient]]s.
A space is regular if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; and, as mentioned, a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it's both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
Thus a regular space encountered in practice can usually be assumed to be T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by replacing the space with its Kolmogorov quotient.

There are many results for topological spaces that hold for both regular and Hausdorff spaces.
Most of the time, these results hold for all preregular spaces; they were listed for regular and Hausdorff spaces separately because the idea of preregular spaces came later.
On the other hand, those results that are truly about regularity generally don't also apply to nonregular Hausdorff spaces.

There are many situations where another condition of topological spaces (such as [[normal space|normality]], [[Pseudonormal space|pseudonormality]], [[paracompactness]], or [[local compactness]]) will imply regularity if some weaker separation axiom, such as preregularity, is satisfied.
Such conditions often come in two versions: a regular version and a Hausdorff version.
Although Hausdorff spaces aren't generally regular, a Hausdorff space that is also (say) locally compact will be regular, because any Hausdorff space is preregular.
Thus from a certain point of view, regularity is not really the issue here, and we could impose a weaker condition instead to get the same result.
However, definitions are usually still phrased in terms of regularity, since this condition is more well known than any weaker one.

Most topological spaces studied in [[mathematical analysis]] are regular; in fact, they are usually [[completely regular space|completely regular]], which is a stronger condition.
Regular spaces should also be contrasted with [[normal space]]s.

== Examples and nonexamples ==
A [[zero-dimensional space]] with respect to the [[small inductive dimension]] has a [[Base (topology)|base]] consisting of [[clopen set]]s.
Every such space is regular.

As described above, any [[completely regular space]] is regular, and any T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space that is not [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (and hence not preregular) cannot be regular.
Most examples of regular and nonregular spaces studied in mathematics may be found in those two articles.
On the other hand, spaces that are regular but not completely regular, or preregular but not regular, are usually constructed only to provide [[counterexample]]s to conjectures, showing the boundaries of possible [[theorem]]s.
Of course, one can easily find regular spaces that are not T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus not Hausdorff, such as an [[indiscrete space]], but these examples provide more insight on the [[Kolmogorov axiom|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; axiom]] than on regularity.  An example of a regular space that is not completely regular is the [[Tychonoff corkscrew]].

Most interesting spaces in mathematics that are regular also satisfy some stronger condition.
Thus, regular spaces are usually studied to find properties and theorems, such as the ones below, that are actually applied to completely regular spaces, typically in analysis.

There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.  An example is the set '''R''' with the topology generated by sets of the form ''U&amp;nbsp;— C'', where ''U'' is an open set in the usual sense, and ''C'' is any countable subset of ''U''.

== Elementary properties ==
Suppose that ''X'' is a regular space.
Then, given any point ''x'' and neighbourhood ''G'' of ''x'', there is a closed neighbourhood ''E'' of ''x'' that is a [[subset]] of ''G''.
In fancier terms, the closed neighbourhoods of ''x'' form a [[local base]] at ''x''.
In fact, this property characterises regular spaces; if the closed neighbourhoods of each point in a topological space form a local base at that point, then the space must be regular.

Taking the [[interior (topology)|interior]]s of these closed neighbourhoods, we see that the [[regular open set]]s form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the open sets of the regular space ''X''.
This property is actually weaker than regularity; a topological space whose regular open sets form a base is ''[[semiregular space|semiregular]]''.

'''Resistance''', in the context of the field of [[psychoanalysis]], refers to oppositional behavior when an individual's unconscious defenses of the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] are threatened by an external source. [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, developed his concept of resistance as he worked with patients who suddenly developed uncooperative behaviors during sessions of [[talk therapy]]. He reasoned that an individual that is suffering from a psychological affliction, which Sigmund Freud believed to be derived from the presence of suppressed illicit or unwanted thoughts, may inadvertently attempt to impede any attempt to confront a subconsciously perceived threat. This would be for the purpose of inhibiting the revelation of any repressed information from within the [[unconscious mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Having developed the theory of resistance through his direct experiences with patients undergoing therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that patients would avoid subjects and topics that struck too closely to uncomfortable memories or unacceptable emotions and desires. Freud then integrated these findings with his previous theories concerning the functions of the [[id, ego and super-ego]]. As a result, he eventually advanced his concept of resistance by developing it into a multitude of individual forms that included repression, transference, ego-resistance, "working-through", and self-sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/resistance.html|title=Psychoanalysis - Resistances|website=www.freudfile.org|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theory behind many of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic techniques, alluding to the fundamentals of psychoanalysis as a science, was that it is possible that memories that have been lost from consciousness provide hints of their existence by the means of prompting certain thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikonen|first=Pentti|last2=Absetz|first2=Kimmo|date=2002|title=The basic tools of psychoanalysis|url=|journal=The Scandinavian Psychoanalytic Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=12–19|doi=10.1080/01062301.2002.10592721|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the aim of psychoanalysis is to bring what is unconscious or [[preconscious]] into consciousness through verbalization. Afterwards, the act of bringing such thoughts into consciousness prevents them from motivating behavior and thus allowing the individual to exert more personal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=June|title=Consciousness and interpretation in modern psychoanalysis|journal=Modern Psychoanalysis|date=2009|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, resistance has caused significant division between psychologists. It remains a debated issue as there are some who considered it to be merely a description of a patient’s temperament rather than a universal construct of the human mind. Nonetheless, the concept of resistance retains a firm place in the history of psychology and the development of modern [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People for Change, 2nd Edition|last=Miller, William R.|first=Stephen, Rollnick|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572305632|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of resistance ==

=== Repression ===
{{main article|Psychological repression}}

[[Psychological repression|Repression]] is the form of resistance where the ego pushes offensive memories, ideas, and impulses down into the unconscious. Essentially, the patient is unconsciously hiding memories from the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolman|first1=Benjamin|title=The Unconscious Mind: The Meaning of Freudian Psychology|date=1968|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-935767-1|page=182|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transference ===
{{main article|Transference}}

Typically unconscious, [[transference]] is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships. In therapy, this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient, either consciously or unconsciously, of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life. Subsequently, the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner, depending upon the nature of the past influence.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=edited by Glen O. Gabbard, Bonnie E. Litowitz, Paul|title=Textbook of psychoanalysis|date=2012|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781585629794|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ego-resistance ===
This form of resistance is a neurotic regression to a proposed state of childlike safety. Usually, it involves the patient's attempts to gain attention and sympathy by emphasizing minor medical symptoms (i.e. headaches, nausea, and depression).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1926|isbn=978-0393008746|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working-through ===
{{main article|Working through}}
Derived from the id,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this form of resistance reflects the unconscious desire for consistency in a manner that is based upon the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]. Since the id is an innate portion of human instinct, interpretation of the conscious is an insufficient method, thus the psychoanalyst must first be able to surmount resistances by the means of deduction of patients' unconscious defenses that are presented through exploitation of the mechanism of transference.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Self-sabotage ===
The weakest form of resistance that reflects the moralistic sentiments of the superego.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Essentially, it is a manifestation of internal guilt that prompts personal punishment by the means of self-imposed impediment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] is, altogether, considered to be a type of insight-oriented therapeutic program. Despite general initial reservations, these types of programs have since transitioned from being quite marginal to becoming more well-known and mainstream.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Anne|last2=Dunne|first2=John|date=2015|title=When mindfulness is therapy: ethical qualms, historical perspectives|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/25757884/97605608.pdf?sequence=1|journal=American Psychologist|volume=70|issue=7|pages=621–631|doi=10.1037/a0039460|pmid=26436312|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration to the theory of resistance itself, within a clinical setting, the expression of resistance is considered to be a significant stage to recovery because it reveals the presence of [[Psychological repression|repression]]. Additionally, it is indicative of progress in the effort of resolving any underlying issues that may be the cause of personal dysfunction. As resistance is theorized to be a manifestation of  the unconscious mind's attempts to protect the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], it is the task of the psychoanalyst to combat this opposition by directing the patient to confront the unacceptable desires or uncomfortable memories. By this course of action, the patient may reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{See also|Psychoanalysis#Criticism|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Psychologists remain divided with regard to the concept of resistance. Since Freud first developed his theory of resistance, he has been significantly criticized for using personally favorable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable methodology]]. For example, if a patient were to agree with a psychoanalyst's inference about themselves, it is a confirmation that there is something they are repressing. However, if the patient disagrees, it is also a sign they are engaged in repression, which means the psychoanalyst is correct in either scenario.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holowchak|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=The problem of unassailability: analogy and adequacy of constructions in freudian psychoanalysis|url=|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=255–266|doi=10.1037/a0020863|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many psychologists believe that the success of psychoanalysis is not due its various explanatory systems or its reasoning for repression, but rather simply due to the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (Psychopathology of Everyday Life, the Interpretation of Dreams, and Three Contributions To the Theory of Sex)|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Modern Library|year=1938|isbn=978-0679601661|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolph Tomjanovich Jr.''' (born November 24, 1948) is an American retired [[basketball]] player and coach who coached the [[Houston Rockets]] to two consecutive [[NBA Finals|NBA championships]]. He was an All-Star forward for the Rockets during his playing career.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Tomjanovich was born in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], to a family of Croatian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati |title=Mislio sam da sam Poljak dok mi roditelji nisu rekli sa smo Hrvati |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |language=Croatian |trans-title=I thought I was Polish until my parents told me we were Croats |date=16 March 2004 |author=Robert Bajruši |accessdate=4 July 2012 |archivedate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68u03CIWz?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20072182,00.html|title=Severely Injured by a Rival Player's Punch, Rudy Tomjanovich Enjoys An Amazing Comeback|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|language=|trans-title=|date=November 13, 1978|author=Michael Wallis|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended high school in Hamtramck and later the [[University of Michigan]] (from 1967 to 1970). He was a high school teammate of [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] player [[John Brisker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/sep/20/20020920-090308-2387r/|title=Missing, presumed dead|date=September 20, 2002|work=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing career===
[[File:Rudy Tomjanovich (1970).png|thumb|left|165px|Tomjanovich from 1970 with ''Michigan'']]
In college, Tomjanovich set [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball]] career rebounding records that continue to stand.&lt;ref name=MB07-8p166&gt;{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=166|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he earned second team All-Big Ten honors, which he followed with first-team honors in 1969 and 1970.&lt;ref name=MB07-8p147&gt;{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=147|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1970 he was also an All-American.&lt;ref name=MB07-8p145&gt;{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=145|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomjanovich was selected in the [[1970 NBA draft]] as the second overall pick by the [[San Diego Rockets]] (the franchise relocated to [[Houston]] in 1971), for whom he would play the entirety of his [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] career. He was also drafted in both 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&amp;lg=A 1970 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716022604/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&amp;lg=A |date=2014-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&amp;lg=A 1974 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121456/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&amp;lg=A |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Utah Stars]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]. In his eleven years in the NBA, Tomjanovich had a scoring average of 17.4 points and a rebounding average of 8.1, earning five [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] selections in the process (1974–1977, 1979).  He is the third-leading scorer in Rockets history behind [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Calvin Murphy]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. Because his last name was so long, the back of Tomjanovich's jerseys would read "RUDY T.", rather than his 11 character name.

The Rockets retired Tomjanovich's #45 jersey upon the conclusion of his playing career.  His collegiate jersey, also #45, was retired by the University of Michigan in 2003.

===The Kermit Washington Incident===
Despite Tomjanovich's noteworthy career as a player, he is perhaps best remembered for an infamous occurrence at the height of his playing career. In a December 9, 1977 game, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' [[Kermit Washington]] punched  Tomjanovich. The blow shattered Tomjanovich's jaw and face and inflicted life-threatening head injuries, leaving him sidelined for five months. He eventually made a full recovery, and would even make an All-Star team two years later. However, his playing career slowly came to a halt and he was forced to retire in his mid-30s. The story and aftermath are recounted in the [[John Feinstein]] book ''The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever''.

===Coaching career===

====Houston Rockets====
Tomjanovich retired in 1981 and became a scout for two years before being named an assistant coach in 1983.  He served as an assistant under [[Bill Fitch]] and [[Don Chaney]].

Tomjanovich was named the Rockets' interim head coach in February 1992 after Chaney's resignation.  After nearly leading the Rockets to a playoff berth, he was then given the job on a permanent basis.

In his first full season on the job ([[1992–93 NBA season|1992–93]]), Tomjanovich guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title, making him the first head coach to ever take his team from the lottery to a division crown during his first full season.  Building on this success, Rudy T. led the team to back-to-back NBA championships in [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]; additionally, the Rockets were the only team other than the [[Chicago Bulls]] to win multiple championships during the 1990s, with their titles being bookended by the Bulls' two runs of three consecutive titles each. On the playoff run to their second title, the Rockets became the lowest seed (sixth) to win one, and the only team in history to defeat the teams with the four best regular season records in the playoffs. It was on the floor of [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] after they captured their second title that Rudy proclaimed, "Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!" In his 11-plus season tenure as Rockets head coach, he posted a 503–397 (.559) regular-season record and a 51–39 (.567) playoff mark. His career wins and winning percentage are Rockets franchise records. After the 1998-99 season, the Rockets would not make the playoffs for the rest of his coaching tenure, and would consistently finish in the division cellar; Tomjanovich left the team after the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]] when he was diagnosed with [[bladder cancer]] (from which he has since made a full recovery &lt;ref&gt;http://m.sfgate.com/sports/article/Rudy-T-might-quit-Lakers-2702093.php&lt;/ref&gt;), ending a 33-year association with the Rockets franchise—including its first 32 years in Houston—as a player, assistant coach and head coach.

====U.S. national basketball team====
In 1998, Tomjanovich volunteered to coach the U.S. men's senior basketball team at the [[1998 FIBA World Championship|FIBA World Championship]] in Greece. Despite the absence of NBA players due to contract negotiations, Tomjanovich guided the hastily assembled group of [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] players to the bronze medal. In light of his outstanding service in coaching at the 1998 Worlds and his stellar professional resume, Tomjanovich was tabbed to coach the U.S. men's senior team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Games of the XXVII Olympiad]] in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. Team won the gold medal with an 8–0 record. On February 15, 2006, Tomjanovich was named director of scouting for USA Men's Basketball.

====Los Angeles Lakers====
In [[2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004]], Tomjanovich signed a five-year, $30 million contract to replace [[Phil Jackson]] as coach of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA Truth &amp; Rumors: May 12, 2005|date=May 13, 2005|work=SI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/scorecard/05/13/truth.rumors.nba/|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned after 41 games, citing mental and physical exhaustion unrelated to his past bout with bladder cancer.  The Lakers paid him a $10 million settlement, leading to speculation that the Lakers had instead terminated his contract.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The Show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |page=436|year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-07-143034-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiH8z6EmSIsC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;vq=balloons&amp;dq=the%20show%20roland%20lazenby&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |ref=lazenby2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich stayed with the Lakers as a consultant.

====Coaching style====
Tomjanovich was well known for his instinctive managerial style and intensity on the bench.  Always self-deprecating, he nonetheless heaped tremendous pressure on himself and his assistants to be prepared for each game, several times being hospitalized for exhaustion.  After winning back-to-back titles, Tomjanovich deflected much of the praise and eschewed the "genius" label assigned to other champion coaches like [[Chuck Daly]] and [[Phil Jackson]].  His hands-off, easy-going manner with his players gave him a reputation as a "players coach", and as such veteran players were eager to play on his teams.  Among the stars who requested and were granted trades to Houston during his tenure were [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[Scottie Pippen]].

==Personal life==

In 1970, Tomjanovich married Sophie Migas, a former cheerleader. They have three children, two daughters and one son. &lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowe|first1=Jerry|title=Tomjanovich loves the game and the long view|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|website=latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=25 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927094009/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|archivedate=27 September 2015|language=English|date=May 27, 2008|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tomjanovich has participated with the [[Texas Children's Cancer Center]] to help raise funds for cancer research. He has also helped promote a [[deadbolt]] called the "Ultimate Lock" and CieAura health care products.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Feigen.

{{refimprove||date=November 2013}}

A '''story generator''' or '''plot generator''' is a tool that generates basic [[narratives]] or [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] ideas. The generator could be in the form of a computer program, a chart with multiple columns, a book composed of panels that flip independently of one another, or a set of several adjacent reels that spin independently of one another, allowing a user to select elements of a [[narrative]] plot. The tool may allow the user to select elements for the narrative, or it may combine them randomly, a specific variation known as a '''random plot generator'''. Such tools can be created for virtually any [[genre]], although they tend to produce formulaic and hackneyed situations.

== History ==
Plot generators were described as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Rowntree |title=Do You Really Need a Home Computer? |publisher=Scribner |year=1985 |isbn=0-684-18182-7 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, [[Robert J. Hogan (author)|Robert J. Hogan]] described a book-based device called the ''Plot Genie'' which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called ''The 36 Dramatic Situations'' and ''Plotto: The Master Book of All Plots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inside an Author's Brain: The Birth of a Book Length Mystery Novelette |first=Robert J.|last=Hogan |journal=[[Writer's Digest]] |date=October 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pulp Masters |first=James |last=van Hise |year=2002| pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plotto'' by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/plottonewmethodo00cook|title=Plotto|last=Cook|first=William Wallace|date=1928|publisher=Ellis Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=Battle Creek, MI|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Markus, Colin M. Potts, Camille Barot, and R.

Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an [[artificial intelligence]] program developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Selmer |last1=Bringsjord |first2=David A. |last2=Ferrucci |title=Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=2000 |isbn=0-8058-1986-X |pages=122, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=TALE-SPIN |first=James |last=Meehan |editor1-first=Roger C. |editor1-last=Schank |editor2-first=Christopher K. |editor2-last=Riesbeck |title=Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs Plus Miniatures |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1981 |isbn=0-89859-071-X |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the [[Mexica]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rafael |last=Pérez y Pérez |title=Computational Creativity Research: Towards Creative Machines |chapter=From MEXICA to MEXICA-Impro: The Evolution of a Computer Model for Plot Generation |editor1-first=Tarek Richard |editor1-last=Besold |editor2-first=Marco |editor2-last=Schorlemmer |editor3-first=Alan |editor3-last=Smaill |publisher=Atlantis Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-94-6239-084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to [[Russian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=105 |title=Story Generators: Models and Approaches for the Generation of Literary Artefacts |first1=Birte |last1=Lönneker |first2=Jan Christoph |last2=Meister |first3=Pablo |last3=Gervás |first4=Federico |last4=Peinado |first5=Michael |last5=Mateas |conference=Joint Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities/Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing |conference-url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/index.htm |date=June 2005 |location=[[University of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large number of "random plot generators" available on the internet—generic and relating to specific [[fandom]]s, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Plot generators have also been portrayed in fiction, as in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s ''The Silver Egghead''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Story Generator Algorithm ==
The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervás|first1=Pablo|title=Story Generator Algorithms|url=http://wikis.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Story_Generator_Algorithms|website=The living book of narratology|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''subadditivity effect''' is the tendency to judge [[probability]] of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt;

== Example ==
For instance, subjects in one experiment judged the probability of death from cancer in the United States was 18%, the probability from heart attack was 22%, and the probability of death from "other [[natural causes]]" was 33%. Other participants judged the probability of death from a natural cause was 58%. Natural causes are made up of precisely cancer, heart attack, and "other natural causes," however, the sum of the latter three probabilities was 73%, and not 58%. According to [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and Koehler (1994) this kind of result is observed consistently.&lt;ref name="Support Theory" /&gt;

==Explanations==

In a 2012 article in [[Psychological Bulletin]] it is suggested the subadditivity effect can be explained by an [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt; This explanation is different than [[support theory]], proposed as an explanation by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and Koehler,&lt;ref name="Support Theory"/&gt; which requires additional assumptions.  Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and straightforward than any explanation involving heuristics or behavior, [[Occam's razor]] would argue in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypotheses which makes the fewest assumptions).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"/&gt;

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}

A '''suspended sentence''' is a legal term for a judge's delaying of a defendant's serving of a sentence after they have been found guilty, in order to allow the defendant to perform a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant does not break the law during that period, and fulfills the particular conditions of the probation, the judge usually dismisses the sentence.

==Australia==
{{See also|Punishment in Australia}}
In Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence.

As of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/suspended-prison-sentences-now-banned-in-all-victorian-courts|title=Suspended sentences scrapped in all Victorian courts|first=Australian Associated|last=Press|date=1 September 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

==People's Republic of China==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (excluding [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), both suspended sentences and suspended ''sentencing'' ({{zh|缓刑}}, also translated as a sentence "with reprieve") are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of [[probation]].

[[Capital punishment|Death sentences]] can also be suspended (called a "[[death sentence with reprieve]]"), so that an offender who does not intentionally re-offend during the two-year suspension period would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence.

==Finland==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
A suspended sentence is called ''ehdollinen vankeusrangaistus'' in Finnish, which translates to "conditional imprisonment". When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. 

The court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period.

==Ireland==
In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled [[Constitution of Ireland|unconstitutional]] in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an [[Appeal (law)|appeal]] pending for the later conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0419/782865-high-court-suspended/|title=Suspended sentence law deemed 'unconstitutional'|date=19 April 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/suspended-sentences-are-rendered-useless-by-ruling-1.2616639|title=Suspended sentences  are rendered useless by ruling|last=Carolan|first=Mary|date=20 April 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}};  {{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0026.htm#id1152029045.17|title=Criminal Justice Act 2006 [as amended]|date=11 February 2016|work=Revised Acts|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|nopp=Y|page=§99.

==Japan==
{{nihongo|Suspended sentences|執行猶予|shikkō yūyo}} are common practice in [[Japan]] and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to 3 years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.go.jp/saiban/qa_keizi/qa_keizi_28/index.html|title=裁判手続 刑事事件Q&amp;A 執行猶予が付いているとどうなるのですか|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Japan]]|date=2005|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
A suspended sentence can be applied if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements including a curfew, performing [[unpaid work]] and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/suspended-sentences/|title=Suspended sentences|author=Sentencing Council|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Percentage calculated from "all offences" column (immediate/suspended custodial sentences respectively divided by "all sentenced") in the spreadsheet linked here: --&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly|title=MoJ Sentencing Statistics|author=Ministry of Justice|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for [[prosecutor]]s to recommend suspended sentences as part of a [[plea bargain]]. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspended-sentence/ |title=Suspended Sentence Law &amp; Legal Definition |work=Legal Terms, Definitions, and Dictionary |publisher=USLegal.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, the [[criminal record]] of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after [[probation]] is adequately served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/definitions.html |title=Definitions: Understanding Legal Words |date= 23 October 2006 |publisher=Manitoba Courts |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the process of [[deferred adjudication]] prevents the conviction from appearing on a person's criminal record, once probation had been completed.

In the federal system, judges' authority to suspend sentences has been abolished, by the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] of 1984, through the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], and upheld by ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''Tamil units of measurement''' is a system of measurements that was traditionally used in ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking [[South India]]. 

These ancient measurement systems spanned systems of counting, distances, volumes, time, weight as well as tools used to do so. While modern India uses the metric system [[International System of Units]] (Tamil Nadu state included), some of these older day measurement systems, especially those of counting, are still used today.

Other units that have persisted are those of area – the 'ma' (not to be confused with the dollar-cent) and the ‘ground’, both used to measure land and the ‘molam’ which has been relegated to measuring the length of a [[sandanam garland]] sold on streets.

There are several similarities between the measurement system used in [[Tamil Nadu]] and that used by the [[Indus Valley civilisation]]. A shift of Indian mathematicians to South India after the 12th century&lt;ref name="iisc.ernet.in"&gt;[http://www.iisc.ernet.in/prasthu/pages/PP_data/105.pdf Indian Institute Of Science, Landmarks of Science in Early India - Michael Danino]&lt;/ref&gt; could be a driving factor for [[homogeneity|homogenisation]]. However, this remains a [[hypothesis]] because study of ancient science has been neglected in India.&lt;ref name="Neglected History"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-09-04/kolkata/27184974_1_manuscripts-restoration-library|title=Manuscripts narrate a tale of neglect|last=Gupta|first=Jayanta|date=September 4, 2003|work=Times of India|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">In the legal system of England and Wales, the '''victim surcharge''' is a penalty applied to people convicted of offences, in addition to a  [[conditional discharge]], a fine, or a community or custodial sentence, in order to provide compensation for the victims of crime.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/other-orders-made-on-sentencing/what-is-the-victim-surcharge/|title=What is the victim surcharge?|publisher=[[Sentencing Council]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28696150|title=Criminals jailed by magistrates to pay victim surcharge|date=8 August 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surcharge is not paid directly to the criminal's victim, but is pooled and distributed through the [[Victim and Witness General Fund]]. The amount to be paid is specified by law, and courts have no discretion to reduce the amount, nor to waive the surcharge, even for defendants of limited means.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/victim-surcharge-unintended-consequences/71546.fullarticle|title=Victim surcharge: unintended consequences|last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|work=Law Society Gazette|publisher=[[Law Society]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law journalist [[Joshua Rozenberg]] has reported cases where a surcharge levied against a young person became the responsibility of their parents - even when a parent was the victim of the crime in question.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg" /&gt;

The surcharge was first introduced in 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-6431401"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6431401.stm|title='Victim surcharge' on court fines|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 September 2014, the discretion of [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' courts]] to apply additional custody days in lieu of the surcharge was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

== Amounts ==
For offences committed after 8 April 2016, the amount of the surcharge, depending on the penalty awarded, is:&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;

; Conditional discharge : £20
; Fine : 10% of the fine value (£30 minimum, £170 maximum)
; Community sentence : £85
; Custodial sentence of 6 months and below : £115
; Custodial sentence, 6 months to 2 years : £140
; Custodial sentence over 2 years : £170 (only in Crown Court)
; Suspended sentence, 6 months and below : £115
; Suspended sentence, over 6 months : £140 

Other figures apply for [[legal person]]s who are not individuals; and offenders aged under 18.

Official figures show that £51m was raised, between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">In the United States, the '''War on Coal''' is a phrase used by the [[coal industry]] and its supporters to describe what they claim is an effort by the [[Obama administration]] to impose stringent regulations on coal power in the United States and thereby make such power uneconomical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://time.com/2806697/obama-epa-coal-carbon/ | title=New Carbon Rules the Next Step in Obama's War on Coal | website=Time | date=1 June 2014 | accessdate=6 January 2016 | author=Grunwald, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this phrase also often identify the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] as one of the chief entities waging this putative war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_juice/2015/07/coal_vs_fossil_fuels_and_renewable_energy_why_the_dirty_fossil_keeps_losing.html | title=Coal Is Losing the War on Coal | website=Slate | date=17 July 2015 | accessdate=6 January 2016 | author=Gross, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Michael Grunwald]] has claimed that the war on coal, although real, does not primarily happen at the national level but at the state and local level, and that the "boots on the ground" in the war are lawyers from the [[Sierra Club]]'s [[Beyond Coal]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/inside-war-on-coal-000002 | title=Inside the war on coal | website=Politico | date=26 May 2015 | accessdate=6 January 2016 | author=Grunwald, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Obama's tenure, the Obama administration denied that they were waging a war on coal, noting the possibility of upgrading older power plants with more efficient turbines, and also pointing to the possibility of [[carbon sequestration]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-war-on-coal-is-worth-fighting | title=Obama's "War on Coal" Is Worth Fighting | website=New Yorker | date=2 June 2014 | accessdate=6 January 2016 | author=Cassidy, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2017, in announcing an executive order aimed at revoking various rules regarding carbon emissions enacted during the Obama administration, President [[Donald Trump]] stated that "Our [[Presidency of Donald Trump|administration]] is putting an end to the war on coal."&lt;ref name="trumporder"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-moves-decisively-to-wipe-out-obamas-climate-change-record/2017/03/27/411043d4-132c-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html|title=Trump moves decisively to wipe out Obama’s climate-change record|author=Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis|date=March 28, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2017|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2017, Trump's [[Environmental Protection Agency]] chief, [[Scott Pruitt]] reiterated "the war against coal is over" while announcing a move to repeal a rule on [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref name="pruittsays"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/10/09/pruitt-tells-coal-miners-he-will-repeal-power-plan-rule-tuesday-the-war-on-coal-is-over/|title=EPA chief Scott Pruitt tells coal miners he will repeal power-plan rule Tuesday: ‘The war against coal is over’|author=Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
