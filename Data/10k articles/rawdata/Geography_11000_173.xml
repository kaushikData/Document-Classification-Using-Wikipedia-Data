{{Administrative divisions of North Korea}}
{{Politics of North Korea}}

The '''administrative divisions of [[North Korea]]''' are organized into three hierarchical levels.  These divisions were discovered in 2002.  Many of the units have equivalents in the [[Administrative Divisions of South Korea|system]] of [[South Korea]].  At the highest level are nine [[provinces]], two directly governed cities, and three special administrative divisions.  The second-level divisions are cities, counties, wards, and districts.  These are further subdivided into third-level entities: towns, neighborhoods, villages, and ''workers' districts''.

The three-level administrative system used in North Korea was first inaugurated by [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1952, as part of a massive restructuring of local government.  Previously, the country had used a multi-level system similar to that still used in [[South Korea]].

(The English translations are not official, but approximations. Names are romanized according to the [[McCune-Reischauer]] system as officially used in North Korea; the editor was also guided by the spellings used on the 2003 [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] map of Korea).

==First-level divisions==
{{see also|Provinces of North Korea|Special cities of North Korea}}
The nine provinces (''To''; {{lang|ko|[[Hangul|도]]}}, {{lang|ko|[[Hanja|道]]}}) derive from the traditional [[provinces of Korea]], but have been further subdivided since the [[division of Korea]].  They are large areas including cities, rural and mountainous regions.  The two special cities (''T'ŭkpyŏlsi''; {{lang|ko|[[Hangul|특별시 ]]}}, {{lang|ko|[[Hanja|特別市 ]]}}) are large metropolitan cities that have been separated from their former provinces to become first-level units.  Four other cities have been directly governed in the past, but were subsequently reunited with their provinces or otherwise reorganized.

The three special administrative regions were all created in 2002 for the development of collaborative ventures with [[South Korea]] and other countries.  One of them, the [[Sinuiju Special Administrative Region]], was intended to draw [[China|Chinese]] investment and enterprise, but as of 2006 appears never to have been implemented.  The special administrative regions do not have any known second- and third-level subdivisions.

==Second-level divisions==
:''See [[List of second-level administrative divisions of North Korea]] for a complete list.
[[File:NKorea county map 2012.png|thumb|right|300px|A map of North Korea with second-level divisions]]
The most common second-level division is the county (''Kun''; {{lang|ko|[[Hangul|군]]}}, {{lang|ko|[[Hanja|郡]]}}), a less urbanized area within a province or directly governed city.  The more populous districts within provinces are cities (''Si''; {{lang|ko|[[Hangul|시]]}}, {{lang|ko|[[Hanja|市]]}}), and the city of [[Nampho]] is a special city (''T'ŭkkŭpsi''; {{lang|ko|[[Hangul|특급시]]}}, {{lang|ko|[[Hanja|特級市]]}}).  Some provinces also have two types of districts (''Ku'', ''Chigu'').

The city centers of the directly governed cities are organized into wards (''Kuyŏk'', equivalent to [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|South Korea]]n ''Gu'').

==Third-level divisions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Demographics of North Korea]] --&gt;
Rural parts of cities and counties are organized into villages (''Ri'', {{lang|ko|{{linktext|리|, |里|}}}}).  The downtown areas within cities are divided into neighborhoods (''[[Dong (administrative division)|Tong]]'', {{lang|ko|{{linktext|동|, |洞|}}}}), and a populous part of a county forms a town (''Ŭp'', {{lang|ko|{{linktext|읍|, |邑|}}}}).  Some counties also have workers' districts (''Rodongjagu'', {{lang|ko|{{linktext|로동자구|, |勞動者區|}}}}).

'''Albert Bank''' ({{coord|77|10|S|32|45|W}}), also known as '''Prince Albert I Bank''', is a [[submarine bank]] in the [[Weddell Sea]] named for [[Albert I of Monaco]], instrumental in initiating the first [[GEBCO]] charts (1903). The name was proposed by Dr. [[Heinrich Hinze]], [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], [[Bremerhaven, Germany]], and approved in June 1997.

{{Infobox mountain range|name=Alborz|photo=Almighty Damavand دماوند پوشیده ازبرف ازدوراهی معدن کمردشت - panoramio.jpg|photo_caption=[[Mount Damavand]], Iran's highest mountain, located in the Alborz mountain range|map_image=AlborzCentralColoredNumbered.png|map_caption=Location of various peaks in the Alborz range north of [[Tehran]]|other_name=Elburz, Alburz, Elborz|highest=[[Mount Damavand]]|elevation_m=5610.0|coordinates={{Coord|35|57|20|N|52|06|36|E|display=inline,title}}
}}
The '''Alborz''' ({{Audio|Alborz pronounce.ogg|listen}} {{lang-fa|البرز}}), also spelled as '''Alburz''', '''Elburz''' or '''Elborz''',  is a [[mountain range]] in northern [[Iran]] that stretches from the border of [[Azerbaijan]] along the western and entire southern coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and finally runs northeast and merges into the [[Aladagh Mountains]] in the northern parts of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. This mountain range is divided into Western, Central, and Eastern Alborz Mountains. The Western Alborz Range (usually called the [[Talysh Mountains|Talysh]]) runs south-southeastward almost along the western coast of the Caspian Sea. The Central Alborz (the Alborz Mountains in the strictest sense) runs from west to east along the entire southern coast of the Caspian Sea, while the Eastern Alborz runs in a northeasterly direction towards the northern parts of the Khorasan region southeast of the Caspian Sea. [[Mount Damavand]], the highest mountain in Iran, is located in the Central Alborz Mountains.

==Etymology==

The name ''Alborz'' is derived from that of [[Hara Berezaiti|Harā Barazaitī]], a legendary mountain in the [[Avesta]], the main text of [[Zoroastrianism]]. ''Harā Barazaitī'' reflects [[Proto-Iranian language|Proto-Iranian]] *''Harā Bṛzatī''. *''Bṛzatī'' is the feminine form of the adjective *''bṛzant-'' "high", the ancestor of modern Persian ''boland'' (بلند) and ''Barz/Berazandeh'', cognate with Sanskrit ''Brihat'' (बृहत्). ''Harā'' may be interpreted as "watch" or "guard", from an Indo-European root *''ser-'' "protect". In Middle Persian, ''Harā Barazaitī'' became ''Harborz'', Modern Persian ''Alborz'', which is a cognate with [[Mount Elbrus|Elbrus]], the highest peak of the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="alborziranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alborz-massif-iran|title=ALBORZ|author=electricpulp.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] may identify the range with the dwelling place of the [[Peshyotan]], and the Zoroastrian [[Ilm-e-Kshnoom]] sect identify Mount Davamand as the home of the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ('Masters of the Heart'). In his epic [[Shahnameh]], the poet [[Ferdowsi]] speaks of the mountains "as though they lay in India."&lt;ref name="alborziranica"/&gt; This could reflect older usage, for numerous high peaks were given the name and some even reflect it to this day, for example, [[Mount Elbrus]] in the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and Mount Elbariz (Albariz, [[Jebal Barez]]) in the [[Kerman]] area above the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. All these names reflect the same Iranian language compound, and share an identification as the legendary mountain [[Hara Berezaiti|Harā Bərəzaitī]] of the [[Avesta]].

==Geology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The Alborz mountain range forms a barrier between the south Caspian and the [[Iranian plateau]]. It is only 60–130&amp;nbsp;km wide and consists of sedimentary series dating from Upper [[Devonian]] to [[Oligocene]], prevalently [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] over a [[granite]] core. Continental conditions regarding sedimentation are reflected by thick Devonian [[sandstone]]s and by Jurassic [[shale]]s containing coal seams. Marine conditions are reflected by [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] strata that are composed mainly of limestones. In the Eastern Alborz Range, the far eastern section is formed by [[Mesozoic]] (chiefly Triassic and Jurassic) rocks, while the western part of the Eastern Alborz Range is made primarily of [[Paleozoic]] rocks. [[Precambrian]] rocks can be found chiefly south of the city of [[Gorgan]] situated in the southeast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and in much smaller portions in the central and western parts of the Central Alborz Range. The central part of the Central Alborz Range is formed mainly of the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] rocks, while the northwestern section of the range is made mainly of the Jurassic rocks. Very thick beds of the [[Tertiary]] (mostly of the [[Eocene]]) green volcanic [[tuff]]s and [[lava]]s are found mainly in the southwestern and south-central parts of the range. The far northwestern part of the Alborz that constitutes what is called the Western Alborz Range or the [[Talish Mountains]] is made mainly of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] volcano-sedimentary deposits with a strip of Paleozoic rocks and a band of Triassic and Jurassic rocks in the southern parts, both in a northwest-southeast direction. As the [[Tethys Sea]] was closed and the [[Arabian Plate]] collided with the [[Iranian Plate]] and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise movement of the [[Eurasian Plate]] towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed from both sides. The collisions finally caused the folding of the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and [[Paleogene]] rocks, and the [[Cenozoic]] (chiefly the [[Eocene]]) [[volcanism]] to form the Alborz Mountains mainly in the [[Miocene]]. The [[Alpine orogeny]] began, therefore, with Eocene volcanism in southwestern and south-central parts of the Alborz and continued with the uplift and folding of the older sedimentary rocks in the northwestern, central and eastern parts of the range during the orogenic phases of importance that date from the Miocene and the [[Pliocene]] epochs.

==Ecoregions, flora and fauna==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
While the southern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are usually semiarid or arid with irregular and low precipitation, the northern slopes of the range are usually humid especially in the western parts of the Central Alborz. In the southern slopes or the [[Elburz Range forest steppe]] ecoregion, the higher elevations are arid with few trees. [[Juniper]] is the most common tree in the inaccessible areas and high elevations, while shrubs are [[pistachio]], [[maple]], and [[almond]]. But in the northern slopes, the [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]] ecoregion is lush and forested. The natural vegetation of this region grows in distinct zones: the Hyrcanian forests on the lowest levels; [[beech]] forests in the middle zone; and [[oak]] forests in higher regions. The wild cypress is the dominant form of vegetation in some valleys, while olive trees grow in the western valleys of the Central Alborz near the [[Sefidrud]]. The [[bezoar ibex]], [[Blanford's fox]], [[Rüppell's fox]], [[red fox]], [[Persian fallow deer]], [[wild boar]], [[Syrian brown bear]], [[Persian leopard]], [[Indian wolf]], [[buzzard]], [[goose]], [[woodpecker]], [[griffon vulture]], and [[eagle]] are among important animals and birds found in the Alborz Mountains. The extinct [[Caspian tiger]] also lived in the Alborz Mountains.

==Ski resorts==
Due to the great snowy winters of the Alborz Mountains, there are several [[ski resorts]] in different places of the range. Some consider that a few of these are among the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/feb/24/iran.skiing|title=Iran's biggest secret: the skiing's great|author=Dom Joly|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of most important ones are [[Dizin]], [[Shemshak (ski resort)|Shemshak]], [[Tochal]], and [[Darbandsar (Tehran)|Darbandsar]].

==In popular culture==
Mount Damavand is featured twice as an online multiplayer map in the game Battlefield 3. In the game it is featured in Damavand Peak and Alborz Mountains.

[[File:LocationAntarctica.png|250px|right|thumb|The Antarctic biogeographic realm]]
The '''Antarctical realm''' is one of eight terrestrial [[biogeographic realm]]s. The ecosystem includes [[Antarctica]] and several island groups in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. The continent of Antarctica is so cold and dry that it has supported only 2 vascular plants for millions of years, and its flora presently consists of around 250 [[lichen]]s, 100 [[moss]]es, 25-30 [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic [[alga]]l species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'') and Antarctic pearlwort (''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]''), are found on the northern and western parts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. Antarctica is also home to a diversity of animal life, including [[penguin]]s, [[pinniped|seals]], and [[whale]]s.

Several Antarctic island groups are considered part of the Antarctica realm, including [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], [[South Orkney Islands]], the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Bouvet Island]], the [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], [[Heard Island]], the [[Kerguelen Islands]], and the [[McDonald Islands]]. These islands have a somewhat milder climate than Antarctica proper, and support a greater diversity of [[tundra]] plants, although they are all too windy and cold to support trees.

[[Antarctic krill]] is the [[keystone species]] of the ecosystem of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for [[whale]]s, [[seal (mammal)|seals]], [[leopard seal]]s, [[fur seal]]s, [[crabeater seal]]s, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], [[penguin]]s, [[albatross]]es and many other [[bird]]s. The ocean there is so full of [[phytoplankton]] because around the ice continent water rises from the depths to the light flooded surface, bringing [[nutrient]]s from all oceans back to the [[photic zone]].

On August 20, 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of [[microorganism]]s living {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=off}} below the ice of [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="NAT-20140820"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fox |first=Douglas |title=Lakes under the ice: Antarctica’s secret garden |url=http://www.nature.com/news/lakes-under-the-ice-antarctica-s-secret-garden-1.15729 |date=August 20, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=512 |pages=244–246 |doi=10.1038/512244a |accessdate=August 21, 2014 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..244F |pmid=25143097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRB-20140820"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mack |first=Eric |title=Life Confirmed Under Antarctic Ice; Is Space Next? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2014/08/20/life-confirmed-under-antarctic-ice-is-space-next/ |date=August 20, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=August 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Millions of years ago, Antarctica was warmer and wetter, and supported the [[Antarctic flora]], including forests of [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and [[southern beech]]. Antarctica was also part of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwanaland]], which gradually broke up by [[continental drift]] starting 110 million years ago. The separation of [[South America]] from Antarctica 30-35 million years ago allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still an important component of the flora of southern [[Neotropic]] ([[South America]]) and [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]], which were also former parts of Gondwana.

Some botanists recognize an [[Antarctic Floristic Kingdom]] that includes Antarctica, [[New Zealand]], and parts of Temperate South America where the Antarctic Flora is still a major component.

== Ecoregions ==
Four [[tundra]] [[ecoregions]] are recognized:

'''Antonio Snider-Pellegrini''' (1802–1885) was a French [[geographer]] and scientist who theorized about the possibility of [[continental drift]], anticipating [[Alfred Wegener|Wegener's]] theories concerning [[Pangaea]] by several decades.

In 1858, Snider-Pellegrini published his book, ''La Création et ses mystères dévoilés'' ("The Creation and its Mysteries Unveiled").

'''''Californium''''' is an [[Adventure game#exploration games|exploration game]] co-developed by Darjeeling and Nova Productions, and released in February 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. ''Californium'' was developed as a tribute to science-fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] on the 30th anniversary of his death. The player controls Elvin Green, a struggling writer dealing with family matters, as he discovers the means to manipulate reality, and explores several surreal landscapes.

==Gameplay==
As an exploration game, the player can move Green around the current level, but has no direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several [[cathode-ray tube]] monitors that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must be found in the nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing Θ (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt; Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to active a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces.&lt;ref name="rps review"/&gt;

==Plot==
Elvin Green is a struggling writer living in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1967. Following the death of his daughter and the departure of his wife, Green is unable to come up with new material for a book, and his publisher threatens to drop him. Green suddenly hears a voice in his head, telling him to seek out images of the Theta. In finding these, Green is able to alter his reality and slip into new ones - one where he is a successful writer in a society that worship [[Abraham Lincoln]] as a revered figure, and other where Green has helped an alien species take over humanity.

==Development==
''Californium'' was borne out of an idea between the development teams Darjeeling and Nova Productions in 2011 as the 30th anniversary of Dick's death was approaching. Darjeeling digital producer Noam Roubah noted that many of the themes that Dick had written about have since come to pass in the 21st century, such as the Internet and the dehumanization of human communications.&lt;ref name="arstech"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/californium-the-many-surrealities-of-philip-k-dick/ | title = Californium: A game about the many (sur)realities of Philip K. Dick | first = Cassandra | last = Kraw | date = 13 November 2015 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers initially thought of doing a web-based project but within a few months opted to use a video game for this work. The teams brough artist Olivier Bonhomme to create surreal environments to reflect a more psychedelic feel, acknowledging the influence of recreational drugs in Dick's life, rather than the darker tones used in other adoptions of Dick's works.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt; The developers took inspiration from Dick's earlier years in crafting Green; the departure of Green's wife and his dismissive editor are similar concepts Dick had to face early on.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt;

The gameplay's central concept, of discovering the Theta glyph to change reality, was inspired by autobiographic material Dick wrote on coming to an epiphany in 1974 on seeing a woman wearing a [[ichthys]] symbol, which caused him to have a vision of a "pink beam" that would impart wisdom and insight to those it touched.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt; The impact in the game comes from another of Dick's essays, "If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others", in which Dick considers that many alternate realities are occurring simultaneously with the current one, and may come to see those though the subconscious.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt; Journalists from ''[[Ars Technica]]'' and ''[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]'' have noted the game shares many similarities with Dick's 1981 ''[[VALIS]]'', the first of a planned trilogy, which presents a story in which human behavior is controlled by an external intelligence.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motherboard"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/philip-k-dicks-life-is-turning-into-a-video-game | title = Philip K. Dick's Life Is Turning Into a Video Game | first = Daniel  |last = Oberhaus | date = 15 November 2015 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was developed with financial support from the French broadcaster [[Arte]], and was released to coincide with an Arte mini-series on the writer.&lt;ref name="arstech"/&gt; Though the game was meant to be a tribute to Dick, the developers could not get appropriate rights from Dick's estate to use his name in any of the promotional materials for the title.&lt;ref name="motherboard review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/californium-review | title = 'Californium' Isn't a Game for Philip K. Dickheads | first = Daniel | last = Oberhaus | date = 28 February 2016 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'}}s Jake Muncy wrote that while ''California''{{'}}s mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs may become tedious, the game performed well as a "deep dive" in the ideas Philip K. Dick wrote about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2016/02/californium-philip-k-dick-homage/ | title = Always Wanted to Do LSD With Philip K. Dick? You'll Love Playing Californium | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = 18 February 2016 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Oberhaus for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]'' similarly found the gameplay overly repetitive and felt because the developers could not attach Dick's name to the game, the game's connection to the author was weak, using only the more obscure biographical facts about Dick's life to make the association. Oberhaus though praised the game's visuals and attention to era-specific details.&lt;ref name="motherboard review"/&gt; Martin Robinson of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' similarly found the details relating to Dick and his writings to be well done, but the central gameplay mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs become frustrating as there seemed to be no logic into how to reveal some of the glyphs.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-19-californium-review | title = Californium review | date = 19 February 2016 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 | first = Martin | last = Robinson | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]''{{'}}s John Walker commented that the approach of showing the bubbles of alternate realities was "extraordinary as a piece of level design", while some of the attempts at meta-fictional narration had been better accomplished in ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''.&lt;ref name="rps review"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/25/californium-review/ | title = Wot I Think: Californium | first = John | last = Walker | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] | date = 25 February 2016 | accessdate = 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seminole Heights, Tampa, Florida|Seminole Heights]] and [[Hyde Park, Tampa, Florida|Hyde Park]] neighborhoods are two of the largest [[historic preservation]] districts in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].

[[File:Tampaskylineinday.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Downtown Tampa from Curtis Hixon Park]]

==Business Districts==
[[File:Tampa architectural photos 243.jpg|thumb|left|BB&amp;T bank building is one of the financial businesses downtown]]
The [[Downtown Tampa|downtown business district]] of Tampa is located immediately [[east]] of the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]], and [[Ordinal directions|southwest]] of the [[Ybor City, Tampa, Florida|Ybor City]] [[historic preservation|Historic District]]. Downtown includes the [[Tampa Theatre]], [[Rivergate Tower]], [[Tampa Museum of Art]], Glazer Children's Museum, [[Florida Museum of Photographic Arts]], [[S. H. Kress &amp; Co.|Kress]] building, [[Straz Performing Arts Center]], [[SunTrust]] building.
[[File:Tampa Florida November 2013-2b.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Downtown Tampa|Skyline of Tampa]]
[[Tampa International Airport]] is located approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of the downtown area, and easily connected to most parts of the city by three [[Interstate Highway]]s, maximizing its accessibility. The largest [[industry|industrial]] sections of town are located to the north of the airport and east of the city limits, while most of the [[residential]] areas of the city are located to the [[Ordinal directions|southwest]], northwest, northeast and [[west]] of downtown.

Another major [[Central business district|business district]] is the [[Westshore, Tampa|Westshore Business District]], located east of [[Tampa Bay]] and south of Tampa International Airport. Currently, Westshore has more than {{convert|11000000|sqft|m2}} of commercial office space, 4,000 businesses with nearly 100,000 employees, 32 hotels, 2 major shopping malls ([[International Plaza and Bay Street]] and [[WestShore Plaza]]). The city of Tampa has 165 parks with {{convert|2286|acre|km2|0}} within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampagov.net/dept_parks_and_recreation/about_us/ Tampa Parks and Recreation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012111209/http://tampagov.net/dept_parks_and_recreation/about_us/ |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Hyde Park Hist Dist07.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Colonial house in [[Hyde Park, Tampa, Florida|Hyde Park]]]]
The city's [[architecture]] contains a blend of old and new. The neighborhoods of [[Seminole Heights, Tampa, Florida|Seminole Heights]], [[Tampa Heights (Tampa), Florida|Tampa Heights]], and [[Hyde Park, Tampa, Florida|Hyde Park]] neighborhoods are [[historic preservation]] districts featuring mostly [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] homes and buildings.

===Tampa Bay Hotel===
In 1891, [[Henry B. Plant]] built a lavish 500+ room, {{convert|1/4|mi|m|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-long}}, [[US$]]2.5 million eclectic/[[Moorish Revival]]-style luxury resort hotel called the [[Henry B. Plant Museum|Tampa Bay Hotel]] among {{convert|150|acre|ha|sigfig=1}} of manicured gardens along the banks of the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]]. Plant's resort featured a race track, a heated indoor pool, a golf course, a 2,000-seat auditorium, tennis courts, stables, hunting and fishing tours, and electric lights and telephones in every room, plus the first elevator in town and exotic art collectibles which Plant had shipped in from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmuseum.com|title=Henry B. Plant Museum, University of Tampa|publisher=Henry B. Plant Museum|accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tampa Bay Hotel was relatively prosperous for about a decade. The resort hosted thousands of guests and many celebrities of the era, but was only filled to capacity during the [[Spanish–American War]] (see below). Henry Plant died in 1899, and his heirs sold the facilities to the city of Tampa in 1904. The city operated the hotel and used the grounds as a community gathering place until 1932, when the resort was closed, remodeled, and reopened as the [[University of Tampa]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/dec/19/me-a-shining-beacon/|title=A Shining Beacon|last=Emerson|first=Adam|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2008-08-10|work=[[Tampa Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighborhoods and Districts==
{{Main|Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida}}

The city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities that were annexed by the growing city. Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: [[Downtown Tampa]], [[New Tampa, Florida|New Tampa]], [[West Tampa, Florida|West Tampa]], [[East Tampa, Tampa, Florida|East Tampa]], [[North Tampa, Tampa, Florida|North Tampa]], and [[South Tampa]].

==Transportation Infrastructure==
[[File:Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway Tampa.jpg|thumb|right|The Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway entering downtown]]
Along the city's western shore, three [[bridge]]s span Old [[Tampa Bay]] carrying vehicular traffic to and from [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]]: the [[Howard Frankland Bridge]] ([[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]]), the [[Courtney Campbell Causeway]] ([[Florida State Road 60|SR 60]]), and the [[Gandy Bridge]] ([[US 92]]).

Tampa is served by two major limited access [[toll road]] expressways.  From its suburban eastern terminus of [[Brandon, Florida|Brandon]], the [[Lee Roy Selmon Expressway]] (SR 618) enters Tampa by way of a bridge crossing the [[Tampa Bypass Canal]].  It is a major commuter artery into downtown and continues down the South Tampa peninsula, ultimately reaching its western terminus at Gandy Boulevard ([[U.S. Route 92]]) near [[MacDill Air Force Base]].

The [[Florida State Road 589|Veterans Expressway]] (SR 589) begins at the city's western edge near the [[Tampa International Airport]], connecting to [[Florida State Road 60|SR 60]]'s westbound [[Courtney Campbell Causeway]] and eastbound Memorial Highway.  The Veterans Expressway leaves the city limits heading north to the suburbs of [[Carrollwood, Florida|Carrollwood]], [[Northdale, Florida|Northdale]], [[Westchase, Florida|Westchase]], [[Citrus Park, Florida|Citrus Park]], [[Cheval, Florida|Cheval]], and [[Lutz, Florida|Lutz]].  Before leaving [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], [[Florida State Road 589|SR 589]] becomes the Suncoast Parkway, which continues northward into [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco]] and [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando]] Counties.

Three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] pass within the city limits. [[Interstate 4]] originates from Tampa's [[Interstate 4|Malfunction Junction]], where it intersects [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|Interstate 275]].  I-275 is a main artery into the city from [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]], and continues into downtown and northward through neighborhoods like [[Seminole Heights, Tampa, Florida|Seminole Heights]] and [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida|Sulphur Springs]] before leaving Tampa to reunite with [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] at the Pasco county line.  Immediately south of this junction, I-75 crosses through the city neighborhood of [[New Tampa, Florida|New Tampa]].

Other main arteries within the city include major surface roads like [[Hillsborough Avenue]], [[Dale Mabry Highway]], [[Bruce B. Downs Boulevard]], Busch Boulevard, [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|Nebraska Avenue]], [[U.S. Route 41 Business (Tampa, Florida)|Florida Avenue]], [[Florida State Road 582|Fowler Avenue]], [[Florida State Road 60|Kennedy Boulevard]], [[Florida State Road 60|Adamo Drive]], and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

[[File:Port of Tampa ships early morning.jpg|right|thumb|Early morning at the [[Port of Tampa]]]]

===Seaports===
Since Tampa Bay was first spotted by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, sailors have admired its wide, sheltered beauty. But it had a problem; it's naturally very shallow - less than {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} deep almost everywhere and well less than that in many places near the coast, including the approach to the small town of Tampa.&lt;ref&gt;http://dl.nwrc.gov/net_prod_download/public/gom_net_pub_products/MAP/1879chart_tampa.jpg{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, typical cargo ships had grown large enough that they were not able to navigate upper Tampa Bay and reach the ports of Tampa at all.

In 1899, however, the US Congress authorized the dredging of a 27' deep channel to Port Tampa, Henry Plant's rail-to-ship facility just west of Tampa. In 1917, another channel was dredged out to the [[Port of Tampa]] proper, instantly making Tampa an important shipping location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baysoundings.com/wint06/channel.html Corps, Port Consider Channel Widening Options&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215747/http://www.baysoundings.com/wint06/channel.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bay bottom is very sandy and the ship channels need constant dredging to keep them navigable to the largest modern cargo ships. Every year, the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] dredge up enough sediment from the bay to fill [[Raymond James Stadium]] 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbep.org/baystate/dredging.html Tampa Bay Estuary Program - State of the Bay - Dredging &amp; Dredged Material Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013200836/http://tbep.org/baystate/dredging.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Port of Tampa is the largest port in Florida in throughput tonnage, making it one of the busiest commercial ports in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampaport.com/subpage.asp?navid=0&amp;id=2 Tampa Port Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008071153/http://www.tampaport.com/subpage.asp?navid=0&amp;id=2 |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum and phosphate are the lead commodities, accounting for two-thirds of the 37 million tons of total bulk and general cargo handled by the port in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampaport.com/content/download/10824/46091/file/FY09_Total%20Port.pdf "Total Port, Port of Tampa, Florida: FY09 vs FY08", November 16, 2009.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419090902/http://www.tampaport.com/content/download/10824/46091/file/FY09_Total%20Port.pdf |date=April 19, 2012 }} [http://www.tampaport.com ''Tampa Port Authority''.] Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Firewatch''''' is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Campo Santo (company)|Campo Santo]] and published by Campo Santo in partnership with [[Panic (company)|Panic]]. The game was released in February 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[PlayStation 4]], for [[Xbox One]] in September 2016, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2018.

The story follows a [[fire lookout]] named Henry in the [[Shoshone National Forest]], a year after the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]]. A month after his first day at work, strange things begin happening to him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a [[walkie-talkie]], with the player choosing from [[dialog tree|dialog options]] to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform the process by which their relationship is developed. The game was directed by [[Olly Moss]] and [[Sean Vanaman]], written by [[Chris Remo]], [[Jake Rodkin]], Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist [[Jane Ng]]. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from [[New Deal]] advertisements by the [[National Park Service]] and field research conducted in [[Yosemite National Park]].

The game received generally positive reviews, earning praise for its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style. However, the presence of technical issues and the game's ending were both subjects of criticism. ''Firewatch'' won the award for Best 3D Visual Experience at the [[Unity Technologies|Unity Awards 2016]], Best Indie Game at the 2016 [[Golden Joystick Awards]], Best Narrative at the 2017 [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] and Debut Game at the 2017 [[British Academy Games Awards]]. By the end of 2016, the game had sold over a million copies. Campo Santo partnered with [[Good Universe]] to make it into a film.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Firewatch gameplay.png|thumb|left|250px|Henry interacts with Delilah using his walkie-talkie]]
''Firewatch'' is an [[adventure game]] played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] view that takes place in the American state of [[Wyoming]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="in 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon, 2014-03-12" /&gt; Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in [[Shoshone National Forest]].&lt;ref name="shoshone" /&gt; Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar.&lt;ref name="from afar" /&gt;

Henry's only means of communication is a [[walkie-talkie]] connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah.&lt;ref name="announce" /&gt; Players may choose from a number of [[dialog tree|dialog options]] to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a [[Circadian rhythm|day-night cycle]].&lt;ref name="lip" /&gt; Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.&lt;ref name="inventory" /&gt;

==Plot==
Following the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], Henry ([[Rich Sommer]]) takes a job as a [[fire lookout]] in [[Wyoming]] after his wife develops advanced early-onset [[dementia]]. On his first day, Delilah ([[Cissy Jones]]), a lookout in another watchtower, contacts him via [[walkie-talkie]] and asks him to investigate illegal [[fireworks]] by the lake. Henry discovers a pair of drunken teenage girls, who accuse him of leering. On his way home he comes across a locked cave and spots a shadowy figure watching him. He returns to his watchtower to find it ransacked. The next day, Delilah asks Henry to investigate a downed communication line. He finds it cut, with a note apparently signed by the teens. He and Delilah plot to scare the girls off, but when he finds the girls' campsite ransacked and abandoned, they begin to worry. A note left at the site blames Henry for wrecking their camp and stealing their belongings.

Later, Henry finds an old backpack and a [[disposable camera]] belonging to a boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains was a lookout with his father Ned. Ned was an [[outdoorsman]] who [[alcoholism|drank heavily]] due to his traumatic experiences in the [[Vietnam War]], while his son, Brian, enjoyed [[fantasy|fantasy novels]] and [[role-playing game]]s. Though it is against the rules for employees to bring their children to the towers, Delilah was fond of Brian and lied about his presence. He and Ned apparently left abruptly and never returned. The teenage girls are reported missing. Fearing an inquiry, Delilah falsifies reports to say that neither she nor Henry encountered the girls. By the lake the next day, Henry discovers a radio and a clipboard with notes including transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is then knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant. He wakes to find the clipboard and radio gone. In a meadow referred to on the clipboard letterhead he finds a fenced-off government research area. He breaks in and discovers [[surveillance]] equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's conversations and private lives. He also discovers a tracking device which he takes with him.

Henry and Delilah discuss destroying the government camp, but decide against it. As Henry hikes home, someone sets fire to the camp. The next day he uses the tracking device to find a backpack with a key to the cave. Delilah reports a figure in Henry’s tower; when Henry arrives, he finds a [[Walkman]] taped to the door with an incriminating recording of Henry and Delilah's discussion about destroying the government camp. When Henry enters the cave, someone locks the gate behind him. He escapes through another exit and discovers Brian's old hiding spot, where he went to escape his father when he tried to teach him how to climb. He goes deeper into the cave using climbing equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's decomposed body at the bottom of a cavern. Delilah is upset by the news, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, the fire at the government camp has grown out of control and an [[emergency evacuation|evacuation order]] is given for all the lookouts.

As Henry prepares to leave, the tracking device begins beeping. He follows the signal and discovers a tape with a recording from Ned. Ned claims in the tape that Brian's death was accidental, and that the boy fell due to climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society after Brian's death, Ned admits he has been living in secret in the area ever since and has chosen to venture deeper into the wilderness. Henry finds Ned’s makeshift bunker, along with items stolen from the government camp, the lookout towers, and the teenage girls, who Delilah confirms have been found safe. The government camp was simply studying wildlife; Ned had been using its radio equipment to ensure no one was looking for him and to create transcripts to scare Henry away. Delilah blames Ned for Brian's death and leaves on the helicopter. Henry goes to her tower, and he and Delilah say their goodbyes via radio. Finally, the helicopter arrives and he is evacuated.

== Development and release ==
[[File:Chrisremo outside reversed.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chris Remo designed, wrote, and scored the game]]
''Firewatch'' is the first video game from [[Campo Santo (company)|Campo Santo]], and was created by [[Jake Rodkin]] and [[Sean Vanaman]], who were the creative leads on ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]''; Nels Anderson, the lead designer of ''[[Mark of the Ninja]]''; and artist [[Olly Moss]].&lt;ref name="founding" /&gt; [[Chris Remo]] was involved in many aspects of the design, and also composed the score.&lt;ref name="remo" /&gt;

Development for ''Firewatch'' began with a single painting by Moss.&lt;ref name="Polygon, 2014-03-12" /&gt; [[Jane Ng]], lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision.&lt;ref name="Polygon, 2014-03-12" /&gt; Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working on the periphery of game development.&lt;ref name="olly" /&gt; In creating the painting, Moss emulated [[National Park Service]] posters from the [[New Deal]] era in both color palette and iconography.&lt;ref name="iconography" /&gt; The development team went on a camping trip to [[Yosemite National Park]] for inspiration for the game,&lt;ref name="yosemite" /&gt; where they visited a [[Fire lookout tower|lookout tower]] built with the same design as its video game counterpart.&lt;ref name="tower" /&gt; Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.&lt;ref name="tower" /&gt;

''Firewatch'' runs on the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine.&lt;ref name="unity" /&gt; Ng disapproved of the tools for creating trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom [[shader]] was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage.&lt;ref name="foliage" /&gt; The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="lumber" /&gt;

The [[walkie-talkie]] interaction in ''Firewatch'' is inspired by the relationship in ''[[BioShock]]'' between the player character and [[list of characters in the BioShock series#Frank Fontaine/Atlas|Atlas]], as well as the dialog system from ''The Walking Dead''.&lt;ref name="olly" /&gt; At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as [[Hiking|hikers]], but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working.&lt;ref name="tower" /&gt; The team hoped to avoid [[lip sync]]ing and minimize the amount of [[Game art design|animation]] needed due to the limited team size and resources.&lt;ref name="lip" /&gt; The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in ''The Walking Dead'', as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast [[Rich Sommer]]. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.&lt;ref name="Ella-Feb2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farokhmanesh-Feb2016" /&gt;

The game's opening chapter features the song "Push Play" from Joy Chun and Nate Bosley's 2014 [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] album ''Let's Get Electric'', which depicts a fictitious 1980s synthpop act known as Cheap Talk. [[Taylor Dayne]]'s "[[Tell It to My Heart]]" was used as a placeholder in the scene, but Vanaman conceded that the song was too overwhelming, and would cost too much to license. Upon the realization that it would also be too costly to commission a song, Remo sought a song in the style of the 1980s by an unsigned, independent artist, leading to the use of "Push Play".&lt;ref name="polygon-pushplay" /&gt; The score features a combination of [[Electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[electric piano]], with samples of [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes]] as a substitute for the actual piano. Remo played all of the instruments himself.&lt;ref name="remo" /&gt;

The game was announced in March 2014 with a tentative release date of 2015.&lt;ref name="announce" /&gt; At [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]], Campo Santo housed a public playtest, and Ng hosted a panel on the design and aesthetic of the game entitled "The Art of Firewatch".&lt;ref name="aesthetic" /&gt; In June 2015, the team visited [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]. There, they confirmed that they would be bringing the game to [[PlayStation 4]], but that this would be the only [[video games console|console]] version.&lt;ref name="console" /&gt; However, an [[Xbox One]] version was later released in North America on September 21, 2016, featuring an [[audio tour]] and a [[Nonlinear gameplay|free roam]] mode.&lt;ref name="NA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mode" /&gt; Due to [[Video game rating system|ratings issues]], the version was delayed in Europe until September 30&lt;ref name="EUAUS" /&gt; and in Australia and New Zealand until October 14.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;

Users of the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[virtual reality headset]]s can [[3D interaction|tour]] Henry's lookout tower using the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] application Destinations. For this purpose, the scene was rebuilt on the [[Source (game engine)|Source]] game engine.&lt;ref name="oculus vive" /&gt; ''Firewatch'' was made compatible with PlayStation 4 Pro on its November 10 launch, with enhanced performance through [[4K resolution]] and [[high-dynamic-range imaging]].&lt;ref name="4k pro" /&gt; The free roam mode was enabled for PlayStation 4 Pro and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="pro tour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PC tour" /&gt; Partnering with [[Limited Run Games]], Campo Santo distributed under ten thousand physical copies of the game on PlayStation 4.&lt;ref name="under ten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="run sometime" /&gt; 4,800 copies were made available for order on the Limited Run Games website on December 16, 2016, while 2,500 were sold through the Campo Santo online store starting January 16, 2017.&lt;ref name="seven thousand three hundred" /&gt; In April 2018, Campo Santo announced the game will be released for [[Nintendo Switch]] later in the year. It was later clarified the Nintendo Switch port is a heavily optimised version of the game, and the update will also be available for other platforms. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version features some exclusive elements.&lt;ref name="IGN cites Switch release" /&gt; Campo Santo later confirmed, via [[Twitter]], the worldwide release date for the Nintendo Switch port as December 17, 2018.&lt;ref name="NintendSoup cites Switch release date" /&gt;

''Firewatch'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE" /&gt; The game sold more than five hundred thousand copies within a month of its release and over one million copies by the end of its first year.&lt;ref name="five hundred thousand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="end of" /&gt; As of 2018, ''Firewatch'' has sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.&lt;ref name="Walker-May2018" /&gt;

Steven Hansen at [[Destructoid]] welcomed the choice-based [[dialog tree]] gameplay, going on to praise the dialog itself, as well as the voice performances. The game's most impressive achievement, as stated by Hansen, was the "thematic cohesion", which was said to revolve around self-imposed isolation. The sound design was lauded to have evoked a [[Hitchcockian]] sense of fear.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; Reviewing ''Firewatch'', [[Game Informer]]'s Jeff Cork wrote, "I was immediately drawn into the game's world, partly because of the power of its simple text intro, and also because of the novelty of taking part in something so mundane". Cork observed that its interactive dialog, though simple, "breathes life into the game" and called the conversations "natural" and "engaging". He enjoyed exploring the forest environment, yet felt the ending was unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

Scott Butterworth of [[GameSpot]] thought that the analog navigation tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were "immersive" but "occasionally frustrating". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging the development of the characters through dialog to be "bold" and "admirable", he opined that it served as "a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; [[GamesRadar]]'s Justin Towell described ''Firewatch'' as "one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned.&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt;

Ryan McCaffrey at [[IGN]] hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, "It's tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be "elegant" and "satisfying". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Poly" /&gt;

The '''Florence Falls''' ([[Indigenous languages of Australia|Aboriginal]]: '''''Karrimurra''''') is a [[Waterfall#Types|segmented waterfall]] on the Florence Creek located within the [[Litchfield National Park]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]. 

==Location and features==
[[Image:Florence Falls, "a spiritual place", sign post.jpg|thumb|left|A sign post near the falls.]]
The waterfall descends from an elevation of {{convert|64|m}} [[Australian Height Datum|above sea level]] via a series of segmented tiers that range in height between {{convert|9.8|-|15|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&amp;p=253148&amp;cmd=sp|title=Map of Florence Falls, NT|work=Bonzle Digital Atlas of Australia|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessed by sealed road, the falls are found near the northern boundary of the national park, approximately {{convert|80|km}} south of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. 

A sign post at Florence Falls mentions two walks for hiking. The 'Shady Creek Walk' is graded easy with a distance of {{convert|1.2|km}} return. The 'Florence Creek Walk' is also graded easy with a distance of {{convert|3.2|km}} return. The Florence Falls plunge pool is listed as "great for a refreshing swim" besides the usual safety warnings.

The isle of '''Gatighan''' was a [[waypoint|way station]] of the [[Armada de Molucca]] under Captain-General [[Ferdinand Magellan]] on their way to [[Cebu]] in Central [[Philippines]]. The location of Gatighan has not been conclusively determined.

==Etymology==
The word Gatighan comes from the Visayan ''katigan'' meaning a boat with outrigger or, as verb, to outfit a boat with outrigger.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Documentation in Armada de Molucca's logbook==
The logbook states{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} that the fleet left the west port of [[Mazaua]] early morning of Thursday, April 4, 1521. According to Pigafetta, they took a northwest track, however Albo claims they took at northern track. The ships sailed {{convert|80|nmi|km|-1}} to reach Gatighan at 10° N in 11–13 hours.

During the brief stop on the island, Pigafetta documented the island's fauna: "''In this island of Gatighan are a kind of birds called Barbastigly ([[flying fox]]), who are as large as eagles. Of which we killed a single one, because it was late, which we ate, and it had the taste of a fowl. There are also in that island pigeons, doves, turtledoves, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl, with a long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose, which they bury a good cubit deep under the sand in the sun, and so they are hatched by the great heat made by the warm sand. And when those birds are hatched they emerge. And those eggs are good to eat.''"&lt;ref name=skelton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=R.A.|title=Magellan's Voyage, Vol. II|date=1969|publisher=Nancy-Libri-Phillipps-Beinecke-Yale codex|location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}}

On Pigafetta's map,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Gatighan is the only island mass that straddles between two huge islands, [[Bohol]] and [[Ceylon/Seilani]] (Panaon Island, the south most end of Leyte). It is almost exactly at the 10° N latitude, reference point of Albo for Gatighan.

==Attempts to locate the island==
Despite many attempts to determine which island was referred to as Gatighan, opinions still vary on the issue. Theories include:
* F.H.H. Guillemard stated in 1890 that it is perhaps [[Jimuquitan]] or [[Apit Island]]"{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.{{rp|235}} [[R.A. Skelton]], Andrea da Mosto,{{rp|74}} Jean Denuce,{{rp|312}} Leonce Peillard{{rp|314}} and Theodore J. Cachey Jr.{{rp|155}} (who spelled the name "Himuguetan" support this theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] states that Gatighan is one of the Camotes Islands{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.{{rp|423}} However, these islands are too small to sustain the varied fauna described in the logbook.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Amoretti switches Gatighan with Mazaua==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
[[Carlo Amoretti]], the Augustinian encyclopedist, was director of a library in [[Milan]]. In 1797 he discovered the lost handwritten [[Ambrosiana]] manuscript of Pigafetta, one of four remaining manuscripts and the only one in Italian (the rest being French). Amoretti transcribed it and published his edition, complete with notes, in 1800. In one of his notes he said Pigafetta's Mazaua may be Bellin's Limasawa, unaware that Limasawa/Dimasawa was in fact a complete negation of what Amoretti is asserting.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Amoretti states that Limasawa and Mazaua are in the same latitude. It has been since determined that Limasawa is in 9° 56' N{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, whereas three different latitudes (Pigafetta's 9° 40' N, Albo's 9° 20' N, and the Genoese Pilot's 9° N) have been claimed for the location of Mazaua.

'''Geo-wiki''' is a platform for engaging citizens in [[environmental monitoring]].  It aids in both the validation of existing [[geography|geographical information]] and the collection of new geographical information through [[crowdsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/1/3/345 |title=Remote Sensing &amp;#124; Free Full-Text &amp;#124; Geo-Wiki.Org: The Use of Crowdsourcing to Improve Global Land Cover |doi=10.3390/rs1030345 |publisher=Mdpi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, L., Mooney, P., Foody, G., Bastin, L., Comber, A., Estima, J., Fritz, S., Kerle, N., Jiang, B., Laakso, M., Liu, H.-Y., Milcinski, G., Niksic, M., Painho, M., Podör, A., Olteanu-Raimond, A.-M. and Rutzinger, M. (2016) Crowdsourcing, Citizen Science or Volunteered Geographic Information? The Current State of Crowdsourced Geographic Information. ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 5 (5). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using tools such as [[Google Earth]], [[Bing Maps]], [[Geotagged photograph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and the [[internet]], individual volunteers are able to contribute valuable information.  It provides feedback on existing information overlaid on [[satellite imagery]] or by contributing entirely new data.  Data can be input via the traditional desktop platform or [[mobile device]]s, with campaigns and games used to incentivize input. Resulting data are available without restriction.

== Land cover validation ==
[[Image:Geowiki disagreement africa.png|thumb|alt=Land cover disagreement|Land cover disagreement over Africa in croplands and forests available for analysis in Geo-wiki]]
Global [[land cover]] validation exercises are feasible as images less than 2.5 meter resolution provide very detailed information on land cover with global coverage of at least 20%&lt;ref&gt;Potere, D. Horizontal positional accuracy of google earth's high-resolution imagery archive.Sensors 2008, 8, 7973-7981&lt;/ref&gt; with more high-resolution, up to date images continuously being added. Internet tools such as Google Earth offer enormous potential for land cover validation.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, D. The web-wide world. Nature 2006, 439, 776-778&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Volunteer Geographic Information for land cover validation studies seems even more relevant as Google Earth has been used for the recent validation of [[remote sensing]] derived products e.g., the European forest cover map&lt;ref&gt;Pekkarinen, A.; Reithmaier, L.; Strobl, P. Pan-European forest/non-forest mapping with Landsat ETM+ and CORINE Land Cover 2000 data. ISPRS J. Photogramm. 2009, 64, 171-183&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the latest global land cover map GlobCover.&lt;ref&gt;Defourny, P.P.; Schouten, L.; Bartalev, S.; Bontemps, S.P.; Caccetta, P. et al., Accuracy Assessment of a 300 m Global Land Cover Map: The GlobCover Experience, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Google Earth allows wider audience to be involved in a validation exercise.   

Applications of Geo-wiki go beyond simply improving land cover.  An application helps to predict future [[deforestation]] in [[Central Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anjali Nayar |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091120/full/news.2009.1100.html |title=Model predicts future deforestation : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining five existing cropland data sets from sub-Saharan Africa to create a new map which has higher accuracy than existing maps.  This should reduce uncertainty and improve predictions in land use, vegetation, [[climate change]], and earth systems modeling. Scientists from several research institutions describe development of the map in Geophysical Research Letters, along with the application of Geo-Wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2010GL046213.shtml |title=Cropland for sub-Saharan Africa: A synergistic approach using five land cover data sets |publisher=Agu.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[San Marino]] is located in Southern [[Europe]], an enclave (landlocked) in central [[Italy]], which it borders for 39&amp;nbsp;km.  The third smallest independent state by area in Europe after the [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]], San Marino is dominated by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Located at {{coord|43.94|12.46|type:country_region:SM}}, it covers an area of {{Convert|61.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It has a Mediterranean climate with mild to cool winters and warm, sunny summers. Completely mountainous, only 17% of its territory is arable. Several rivers flow through the country, the largest being the [[Ausa River|Ausa]], the [[Marano River|Marano]], and the [[San Marino River]].

==Political geography==
{{Main|List of cities in San Marino}}
San Marino is divided into 9 castelli, or municipalities. They are:

*[[Acquaviva (San Marino)|Acquaviva]]
*[[Borgo Maggiore]]
*[[Chiesanuova]]
*[[Domagnano]]
*[[Faetano]]
*[[Fiorentino]]
*[[Montegiardino]]

[[File:AT1403 map.png|thumb|right|Guinean mangroves]]
The '''Guinean mangroves''' are a coastal [[ecoregion]] of [[mangrove]] swamps in rivers and estuaries near the ocean of West Africa from [[Senegal]] to [[Sierra Leone]].

==Location and description==
{{see also|List of rivers of Guinea-Bissau}}
Guinean mangroves can be found: in the [[Saloum River]] and [[Casamance]] deltas in Senegal; in the lower [[Gambia]] River basin; much of the coast of [[Guinea-Bissau]], including the [[Cacheu River|Cacheu]] and [[Mansoa River]]s; across the border in northern [[Guinea]]; and much of the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] including the [[Sherbro River]]. Mangroves thrive on flat coastal inlets and [[estuary|estuaries]] where the ocean tides wash warm salt water high upriver, in this ecoregion as far as 100&amp;nbsp;km, for example in the [[Farim River|Cacheu River]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Guinean mangroves|id=at1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/j1533e/J1533E33.htm |title=Sierra Leone  |work=Status And Trends In Mangrove Area Extent Worldwide |publisher=FAO |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The mangroves have a varied composition with ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]'' and ''[[Conocarpus erectus]]'' growing up to 10m tall among larger areas of ''Rhizophora'' and ''[[Avicennia]]''. The tallest trees may be {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and form the equivalent of gallery forests along the creeks, the [[mudflat]]s between the creeks having much shorter trees. The inland fringes of the forest are clad in grasses, ferns and salt-loving plants.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; However, the flora in the ecoregion is not as biodiverse as that of East African mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==
Mangrove swamps are important feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the [[African manatee]]. Birds in these wet habitats include  [[Goliath heron]], [[purple heron]], [[cattle egret]], [[striated heron]], [[western reef heron]], [[greater flamingo]], [[lesser flamingo]], [[African spoonbill]], and [[African sacred ibis]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
Mangrove habitats are under threat as trees are cut down for timber and firewood or to clear land for agriculture including rice farming. This habitat is also under threat from the lower amounts of precipitation in the region over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; In southern Senegal, efforts are being made to replant the mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80906 |title=Senegal: Protecting livelihoods through mangroves |date=14 October 2008 |publisher=IRIN Africa |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas near the mangroves include the Gambian capital, [[Banjul]] and the Guinea-Bissau capital [[Bissau]]. National parks in the region include [[Saloum Delta National Park]] and [[Basse Casamance National Park]] in Senegal, [[Niumi National Park]] in Gambia, and Tarafes de [[Cacheu]] Natural Park in Guinea-Bissau. The Saloum [[river delta]] can also be accessed from the village of [[Foundiougne Department|Foundiougne]] in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier196/en/en_069_ni.pdf |title=Senegal's mangrove forests |author= |date= |work=Country report |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:GM''' is the entry for [[the Gambia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the Gambia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[divisions of the Gambia|1 city and 5 divisions]]. The city [[Banjul]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the divisions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GM}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Gambia. The second part is a letter. The code for Central River is from its former name, MacCarthy Island.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''India's tribal belt''' refers to contiguous areas of settlement of [[tribal people]] of [[India]], that is, groups or tribes that remained genetically homogenous as opposed to other population groups that mixed widely within the Indian subcontinent. The tribal population in India, although a small minority, represents an enormous diversity of groups. They vary in language and linguistic traits, ecological settings in which they live, physical features, size of the population, the extent of [[acculturation]], dominant modes of making a [[livelihood]], level of development and [[social stratification]]. They are also spread over the length and breadth of the country though their geographical distribution is far from uniform. A majority of the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribe]] population is concentrated in the eastern, central and western belt covering the nine States of [[Odisha]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. About 12 percent inhabit the North-eastern region, about five percent in the Southern region and about three percent in the Northern States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RM8qCr_uvVN0DFefn0FciaLeICQtvirU/view|title=Report on Situational Analysis of Ashram Schools in the context of Child Protection.pdf|work=Vidhayak Bharti|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northwest India==
The Tribal Belt of Northwest India includes the states of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]]. The tribal people of this region have origins which precede the arrival of the [[Ancestral North Indians]] and are linked to the [[Ancestral South Indians]]. these people are thought to stem back to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan civilization]] of the [[Indus Valley]], the oldest traceable civilization of the Indian subcontinent which flourished between 3500BC and 2500BC. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The tribes of north-west India were once strongly matrilineal societies. The changing fates and fortunes of these people has caused a gradual evolution to a more patriarchal code of living. These days the tribal societies generally follow the rule of [[patriliny]], but there remain many examples of organised [[matriarchy]] in existence in the tribal zones to this day. It is the women who organise matters such as relationships and marriages, the inheritance of land, and the distribution of wealth.

== South Gujarat Tribal Belt ==

[[File:Rupagad fort1.JPG|thumb|Rupugad Fort]]

The Southern Tribal Belt, popularly known as 'Dang', a forbidden territory covered with thick forests in the region of the South Gujarat. Located on the foothills of the [[Sahyadri]] range of mountains, it has green pastures, narrow roads, deep valleys, and wild animals. During the monsoon one can see water springs and a green carpet of diverse flora/fauna.

Spread across the lush green region of South Gujarat Tribal Belt said to be Kashmir of Gujarat. live the tribes of [[Bhil]], Kholcha, Bhel, Nayaka, Koknas, Vedch, Gamits, Warlis, and Chaudaris.

[[File:Dakshin Gujarat Adivasi Nanivahial Ashram.jpg|thumb|Dakshin Gujarat Adivasi Sevamandal - Ashram NaniVahial]]

[[Dakshin Gujarat Adivasi Sevamandal]] is an NGO founded by the Gandhian philosopher Premshankar Bhatt and his daughter Urmillaben Bhatt in 1948 to spread education in the deep forest of the South Gujarat Tribal Belt. It is registered as a trust under the [[Bombay Trust Act]]. It provides education to South Gujarat Tribals through a resident school (Ashramshalla) which offers free education, lodging and boarding. The Tribal Belt of Gujarat today has the highest literate tribal population in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dakshinseva.in "Dakshin Sevamandal Tribal Ashram"]. Accessed 8 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central &amp; Eastern Tribal Belt India==
The Central India Tribal Belt stretches from Gujarat in the west up to [[Assam]] in the east across the states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Jharkhand]]. It is among the poorest regions of the country. Over 90% of the Belt's tribal population is rural, with primitive [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srtt.org/institutional_grants/rural_livelihoods_communities/central_india_initiative.htm# "Central India Initiative"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Keith Fraser''' (born February 18, 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Elizabeth|title=The Canadian Who's who|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802088651|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[physical geography|physical geographer]]. He served as president of the [[Canadian Association of Geographers]], as well as the executive secretary, publisher and general manager of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]].

==Biography==
Fraser is a veteran of [[World War II]], serving in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]/[[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Veterans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cag-acg.ca/en/war_veterans.html|title=World War II Veterans and Geography in Canada|publisher=cag-acg.ca|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, he received a M.A. degree from the [[University of Toronto]]. He received his Ph.D. in 1964 from [[Clark University]]; his dissertation was entitled ''The physiography of Boothia Peninsula, Northwest territories a study in terrain analysis and air photo interpretation of an Arctic area''.

==Career==
After the war, Fraser had a career as a Canadian government employee with the Geographical Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, [[Ottawa]], publishing articles after many of his field assignments.

One of his first assignments, in the late 1940s, was as an observer on [[tugboat|tugs]] in the [[Mackenzie River]], and on [[Hudson's Bay Company]] vessels in the western [[Arctic Ocean]].

In 1951, he assisted [[geomorphology|geomorphologist]] J. Ross Mackay in investigating [[Amundsen Gulf]]'s [[Darnley Bay]] area. After reviewing recent [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]] and old maps, Fraser determined that the Rivière La Roncière-le Noury, charted by French [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Missionary Oblate]] [[Émile Petitot]] in 1875 but considered nonexistent decades later by explorer [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], did exist.  Though there were errors in the placement of the Roncière's mouth at [[Franklin Bay]], the Roncière was the same river as the partially mapped [[Hornaday River]] by Andrew J. Stone in 1899.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard Clarke |title=Lobsticks and Stone Cairns: Human Landmarks in the Arctic|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=1996|pages=153–154|isbn=1-895176-88-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKisKFb0YKYC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=riviere+la+ronciere-le+noury+%09++Hornaday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Activities"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=J.

The following year, he participated in the Canadian Ice Distribution Survey.  In 1953, Fraser studied the central Arctic coast around the Boothia Isthmus. In 1954, he was the department's representative to the [[Aklavik, Northwest Territories#History|Aklavik Relocation]] Survey team in the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]], and in 1955, he studied the southeastern coastline of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. 1956 found him studying the south coast of [[King William Island]] and Sherman Inlet.&lt;ref name="Activities"/&gt;

==Affiliations==
Fraser became a Fellow and director of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] in 1959. In 1982, he was appointed executive secretary, publisher and general manager.  A new publisher arrived in 1988, but Fraser continued in his other two roles until 1990.&lt;ref name="Collin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/awards/camsell_medal/winner_camsell2004.asp|title=Alexander T. Davidson|last=Collin|first=Arthur E. |date=November 4, 2004|publisher=rcgs.org|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the Society established the Fraser Lectureship in Northern Studies program in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|title=Introducing GIS to students in Nunavut|journal=ArcNorth News|publisher=esricanada.com|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.esricanada.com/documents/ann-vol6-3-introducing-gis-to-students.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a Fellow of the [[Arctic Institute of North America]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic.ucalgary.ca/index.php?page=canadian_fellows|title=Canadian Fellows|publisher=ucalgary.ca|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Fraser received the Award for Service to the Profession of Geography from the Canadian Association of Geographers.&lt;ref name="regionalscience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalscience.org/index.php/CRSA/ |title=CAG Awards Recipients |publisher=regionalscience.org |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120003605/http://www.regionalscience.org/index.php/CRSA |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six years later, he served as president of the Association.&lt;ref name="cag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cag-acg.ca/en/origins_of_cag.html|title=THE ORIGINS OF THE CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS|date=2007|publisher=cag-acg.ca|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Fraser was award the [[Camsell Medal]] by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in honour of his service to the Society.&lt;ref name="camsell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/awards/camsell_medal/previous_winners.asp|title=Camsell Award|publisher=rcgs.org|accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Poyrazlar Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Poyrazlar Gölü Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[List of nature parks of Turkey|nature park]] declared lake in [[Sakarya Province]], northwestern Turkey.

Lake Poyrazlar, also known as Lake Teke,&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; is located in Poyrazlar village, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Adapazarı]], north of the highway {{TUR-D|650}} in Sakarya Province. The lake covers an area of {{convert|67|ha|abbr=on}} and its banks are {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The depth of the water varies between {{convert|3|-|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="osib"/&gt;

The lake ant its environment was declared a first-grade natural protected area in 1993 by the Council for the Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage. In 1995, a development plan for the area was worked out, and it was officially registered. The area was leased for a lease term of five years in 2009. The area on the west bank of  Lake Poyrazlar was declared a [[nature park]] in 2011 by the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]].&lt;ref name="osib"/&gt;

The lake is habitat for 153 bird species, of which 64 are resident, 36 live in winter and 47 in summer, and six stop by as [[bird migration|migrating bird]]s.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; A wide variety of butterflies can be observed during early May. [[Freshwater fish]] as food is also popular at the site.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

Among other outdoor sport activities, [[pedalo|paddling]] and [[all-terrain vehicle]] riding are offered in the nature park.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

These satellites will be launched into [[Sun synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous orbits]] varying in altitude between 625 km and 475 km. Both satellites are designed to [[CubeSat]] standards: 6U XL for Landmapper-BC, and 16U for Landmapper-HD. They will be contained in deployers designed by [[Innovative Solutions in Launch]] of the Netherlands and [[ECM Launch Services]] of Germany. These deployers are to be included onboard a variety of launch vehicles, including the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]], [[Rocket Lab]] [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]], [[Glavkosmos]] [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Antrix]] [[PSLV]], and [[European Space Agency]] [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]].

Each Landmapper-BC spacecraft carries three separate cameras to gather 22 meter resolution imagery in the red, green, and [[near-infrared]] spectral bands. The Landmapper-HD satellite design includes a larger telescope to gather 2.5 meter resolution imagery in blue, green, red, [[red edge]], and near-infrared spectral bands. This imagery is processed on-board and then downlinked over a miniaturized high-speed [[Ka-band]] transmitter. The common satellite bus uses [[reaction wheels]], [[Magnetorquer|magnetic torque coils]], [[star tracker|star trackers]], [[magnetometers]], [[sun sensor|sun sensors]], and [[gyroscopes]] to enable precision 3-axis pointing without the use of propellant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">'''Ledshire''' was a fictional [[county]] in the north of England in two novels by [[Susan Pleydell]], ''Summer Term'' (1959) and ''A Young Man's Fancy'' (1962). It was also the name of a county in the [[Miss Silver]] novels (1928-61) of [[Patricia Wentworth]].

==The county in the Pleydell novels==
The Ledshire of Susan Pleydell was a small, almost entirely agricultural county.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Pleydell (1962) ''A Young Man's Fancy'', chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Its main (presumably, county) town, on the River Ledd, was '''Ledenham''',&lt;ref&gt;There is no connection with [[Leadenham]] ''(sic)'', a village in Lincolnshire.&lt;/ref&gt; the location of a 400-year-old boys' public school that was the focus of the novels. Ledenham contained "two or three unexpectedly good hotels and shops", as well as a [[Regal Cinemas|Regal cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;Pleydell (1959) ''Summer Term'', chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; A major landmark was Leyburn Castle, seat of the Earls of Leyburn, which served as a sort of "county headquarters", containing, among other things, a library, art gallery and museum.&lt;ref&gt;''A Young Man's Fancy'', chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

The industrial town of Snaydon, just outside the county, some 15 miles from Ledenham, via the village of Thaxley, maintained "steady growth" and caused Ledshire to maintain "a particularly nervous eye".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.,'' chapters 5 &amp; 9&lt;/ref&gt; The spearhead of Snaydon's advance was Sir Arthur Hinton-Brigg, chairman of Hinton-Brigg Ltd, who, just after the Second World War, had married into a Ledshire landowning family and bought Thaxley Manor, his wife's childhood home.&lt;ref&gt;''A Young Man's Fancy'', chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Grampian Mountains|Grampians]] are close by and Snaydon is described as being "over the border". It is therefore a reasonable conclusion that Ledshire abuts the [[Scottish Borders|Scottish borders]] and that Snaydon is just inside Scotland).

A small county like Ledshire would probably have been affected significantly by the reorganisation of local government in the 1970s. Under the new arrangements some counties, notably [[Rutland]], disappeared, while others, such as [[Hereford and Worcester]], were merged.&lt;ref&gt;John Campbell (1993) ''Edward Heath: a biography'', p.380&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Double placenames''' prominently feature the [[placename]]s of two or more constituent geopolitical entities.

Such placenames are often created when two cities, provinces or other territories are [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] or merged, and a decision is taken to preserve the old names in [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]] form rather than invent a new name. This is often out of consideration for local sensitivities, since the smaller entity may resent its takeover, and may demand its symbolic perpetuation within an amalgamated name so as to propagate the impression of a merger between equals.

==Styles==
In their English forms, the conjoined names may have the following patterns:
* concatenation, e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]]
* [[grammatical conjunction]], e.g. [[Trinidad and Tobago]]

The punctuation and capitalization practices in written English vary:
* merging into one word without an intermediate space, e.g. [[Budapest]]
* standing apart, e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]]
* conjunction by [[hyphen]]ation. While English-speakers are relaxed about using a hyphen or not, this punctuation once caused [[Hyphen War|controversy]] between Czechs and Slovaks
* conjunction with an [[en dash]], typically when the usage is associative, attributive or is a juxtaposition of two independent entities.
* [[CamelCase]] may sometimes be attempted, but many style guides recommend against this in formal English-language use.

{{or-section|Is this just about how ''Nordrhein-Westfalen'' is translated misleadingly as "North Rhine-Westphalia" [hyphen] instead of "North Rhine–Westphalia" [endash]? Or is it making broader claims about English- and/or German-language practices?|date=May 2017}}
Three-word names for two-part entities are often ambiguous. For example, it may not be clear whether North Rhine-Westphalia is an amalgamation between the north part of the [[Rhine Province]] on the one hand and [[Westphalia]] on the other (true) or the northern division of some pre-existing place called Rhine-Westphalia (false). While this problem does not arise in German, no entirely satisfactory punctuation of such names has been established in English. In the above case, the hyphen is often omitted because it is misleading. It has been proposed that this state's name be punctuated "North-Rhine/Westphalia" in English, but the solidus or forward slash is also ambiguous.

===Neologisms===
Some names have been merged and modified as an alternative to using [[hyphen]]ation or [[grammatical conjunction]]:
*[[BosWash]]: the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] extending from [[Boston]] to Washington, D.C., [[CamelCase]] example (extended in fiction into a [[Boston–Atlanta Metropolitan Axis]] or BAMA covering most of the US East Coast)
*[[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]]: another example of CamelCase ([[Seattle]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]])
*[[Czechoslovakia]]: the [[Czech lands]] and [[Slovakia]]
*[[Senegambia]]: [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]]
*[[Tanzania]]: [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]]

===False double placenames===
[[Binomial nomenclature|Binomial]] placenames are not true double placenames, but elements in a [[hierarchical]] naming system.  They are a means of distinguishing two entities which share a parent geographic feature. Examples:
* [[Guinea-Bissau]] (official name of the country with capital [[Bissau]], as distinct from [[Guinea]], with capital [[Conakry]])
* Congo-[[Brazzaville]] and Congo-[[Kinshasa]] (from the respective capitals of what are officially [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]])

They are often used for railway stations and airports:
* [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] This is the [[London Underground]] station serving two separate London train terminals, [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] train stations.
* [[Paris - Orly Airport]] (one of two Paris airports)
* [[Trenton–Mercer Airport]] (actually located in [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]], outside [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], both in [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]])
Trenton–Mercer is an example of a marketing decision in which a small airport tries to associate itself with a larger city. [[Ryanair]] has been criticized for promoting names for airports unusually far from the city from which they are named, such as [[Paris Beauvais Tillé Airport]] (a triple name) and [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]].

Binomial names may be seen in German-language texts to denominate parts of towns:
* [[Belsen (Bergen)|Bergen-Belsen]] (the Belsen section within the municipality of Bergen: this form is now fixed in English when referring to the Nazi concentration camp and the present memorial there)
* ''Berlin-Charlottenburg'': the district of [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin

The word "and" in its name does not always signify the union of two distinct territories:
*[[Sala y Gómez]]: one island named for two people
*[[Lewis and Clark County, Montana]]: named for [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]

In [[dual naming]], words in two different languages have been joined by a hyphen or a slash to become the community's (or geographic feature's) official name, often because of [[language politics]]:
*[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]: the combination of this city's Spanish name of ''Vitoria'' and [[Basque language|Basque]] name of ''Gasteiz''
*[[Dingle/Daingean Uí Chúis]]: proposed official name (combining English and Irish-language names) of a town in the [[County Kerry]] [[Gaeltacht]].
*[[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]: mountain in New Zealand with [[Māori language|Māori]] and English names combined. Many geographic features of New Zealand are officially designated in a similar way (and the country as a whole is sometimes unofficially referred to as "[[Aotearoa]] New Zealand").

Similarly, places may simply have an official name which consists of two names, such as the Australian territory of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], which consists of the North Keeling Island and the South Keeling Islands.

===Transitional names===
Sometimes names will be concatenated during a name change.  [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] was the name of the former Rhodesia and future Zimbabwe from June 1 to December 12, 1979.

*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">'''Location as a service''' ('''LaaS''') is a location data delivery model where privacy protected physical location data acquired through multiple sources including carriers, [[Wi-Fi]], [[IP address]]es and landlines is available to enterprise customers through a simple [[Application programming interface|API]]. The vast amount of location data provided in a LaaS model can be accessed by organizations to realize greater operational efficiencies, increase security, reduce costs and optimize [[customer engagement]] while achieving higher return on investment. Location data is critical to many businesses as well as government organizations to drive real insight from data tied to a specific location where activities take place. The spatial patterns that location data can provide is one of its most useful aspect where location is a common denominator in all of these activities and can be leveraged to better understand patterns and relationships.  

The location data hosted in a LaaS model is used to support [[location-based service]]s, including [[geofencing]], [[proximity marketing]], [[location-based advertising]], fraud management and [[asset tracking]].

LaaS services are used by multiple industries including [[mobile marketing]], retail, financial services, mobile gaming, M2M and healthcare.

'''Mount Erebus''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|ɛr|ᵻ|b|ə|s}}) is the second-highest [[volcano]] in [[Antarctica]] (after [[Mount Sidley]]) and the southernmost active volcano on Earth. It is the [[List of islands by highest point|sixth-highest]] [[ultra mountain]] on the continent.&lt;ref name="gvp"&gt;
  {{cite gvp

  | accessdate = 2008-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a summit elevation of {{Convert|3794|m|ft|0}}, it is located in the [[Ross Dependency]] on [[Ross Island]], which is also home to three inactive volcanoes: [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]], [[Mount Bird]], and [[Mount Terra Nova]]. Several craters are located at the summit, including Side Crater, a nearly circular crater named for its location on the side of the main summit cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|type=antarid|id=17915|name=Side Crater|accessdate=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and volcanology==
[[File:Anorthoclase-219058.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anorthoclase]] crystal from Mt. Erebus]]

Mount Erebus is currently the most active [[volcano]] in Antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the [[Erebus hotspot]]. The summit contains a persistent convecting [[Phonolite|phonolitic]] lava lake, one of five long-lasting [[lava lake]]s on Earth. Characteristic eruptive activity consists of [[Strombolian eruption]]s from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents, all within the volcano's inner crater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Kyle |editor-first=P. R. |title=Volcanological and Environmental Studies of Mount Erebus, Antarctica |series=Antarctic Research Series |publisher=American Geophysical Union |location=Washington DC |year=1994 |isbn=0-87590-875-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aster |first=R. |last2=Mah |first2=S. |last3=Kyle |first3=P. |last4=McIntosh |first4=W. |last5=Dunbar |first5=N. |first6=J. |last6=Johnson |title=Very long period oscillations of Mount Erebus volcano |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research|J. Geophys. Res.]] |volume=108 |issue= |pages=2522 |doi=10.1029/2002JB002101 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a Strombolian eruptive system very close (hundreds of metres) to the active vents, a characteristic shared with only a few volcanoes on Earth, such as [[Stromboli]] in Italy. Scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by its proximity to [[McMurdo Station]] (U.S.) and [[Scott Base]] (New Zealand), both sited on [[Ross Island]] around 35 km away.

Mount Erebus is classified as a [[Polygenetic volcanic field|polygenetic]] [[stratovolcano]]. The bottom half of the volcano is a shield and the top half is a stratocone. The composition of the current eruptive products of Erebus is [[anorthoclase]]-[[porphyritic]] [[tephrite|tephritic]] phonolite and [[phonolite]], which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano. The oldest eruptive products consist of relatively [[igneous differentiation|undifferentiated]] and [[Viscosity|nonviscous]] [[basanite]] lavas that form the low broad platform shield of Erebus. Slightly younger basanite and [[phonotephrite]] lavas crop out on [[Fang Ridge]]—an eroded remnant of an early Erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of Erebus. Erebus is the world's only presently erupting phonolite volcano.&lt;ref name="Burg2012"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GC004243.shtml | title=Backward Tracking of gas chemistry measurements at Erebus volcano |author1=Burgisser, Alain |author2=Oppenheimer, Clive, Alletti, Marina |author3=Kyle, Phillip R. |author4=Scaillet, Bruno |author5=Carroll, Michael R. | journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems |date=November 2012 | volume=13 | issue=11 | pages=24 | doi=10.1029/2012GC004243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lava flows of more viscous phonotephrite and [[trachyte]] erupted after the basanite. The upper slopes of Mount Erebus are dominated by steeply [[Strike and dip|dipping]] (about 30°) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees. A conspicuous break in slope around 3,200 m ASL calls attention to a summit plateau representing a [[caldera]]. The summit caldera was created by an explosive [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]]-6 eruption that occurred 18,000 ± 7,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgs.ac.uk/vogripa/searchVOGRIPA.cfc?method=detail&amp;id=2421&lt;/ref&gt; It is filled with small volume tephritic phonolite and phonolite lava flows. In the center of the summit caldera is a small, steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed [[lava bomb]]s and a large deposit of [[anorthoclase]] crystals known as [[Erebus crystal]]s. The active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing.

Researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an unusually dense array of [[seismometer]]s around Mount Erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small, controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter, and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes. By studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves, the scientists produced an image of the uppermost (top few km) of the  volcano to understand the geometry of its "plumbing" and how the [[magma]] rises to the lava lake.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plumbing Erebus: Scientists use seismic technique to map interior of Antarctic volcano |work= |url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=1355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zandomeneghi |first=D. |last2=Aster |first2=R. |last3=Kyle |first3=P. |last4=Barclay |first4=A. |last5=Chaput |first5=J. |last6=Knox |first6=H. |title=Internal structure of Erebus volcano, Antarctica imaged by high-resolution active-source seismic tomography and coda interferometry |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=118 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=1067–1078 |doi=10.1002/jgrb.50073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results demonstrated a complex upper-volcano conduit system with appreciable upper-volcano magma storage to the northwest of the lava lake at depths hundreds of meters below the surface.

==Ice fumaroles==

Mt. Erebus is notable for its numerous ice [[fumaroles]] – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface.&lt;ref&gt;For photographs of ice fumaroles, see [http://erebus.nmt.edu/index.php/icetowers Ice Towers] Mount Everest Volcano Observatory&lt;/ref&gt; The ice caves associated with the fumaroles are dark, in polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock. The life is sparse, mainly bacteria and fungi. This makes it of special interest for studying [[oligotroph]]s – organisms that can survive on minimal amounts of resources.

The caves on Erebus are of special interest for astrobiology, as most surface caves are influenced by human activities, or by organics from the surface brought in by animals (e.g. bats) or ground water. The caves at Erebus are at high altitude, yet accessible for study. Almost no chance exists  of photosynthetic-based organics, or of animals in a food chain based on photosynthetic life, and no overlying soil to wash down into them.

They are dynamic systems that collapse and rebuild, but persist over decades. The air inside the caves has 80 to 100% humidity, and up to 3% [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and some [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but almost no [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Many of them are completely dark, so cannot support photosynthesis. Organics can only come from the atmosphere, or from ice algae that grow on the surface in summer, which may eventually find their way into the caves through burial and melting. As a result, most micro-organisms there are chemolithoautotrophic i.e. microbes that get all of their energy from chemical reactions with the rocks, and that do not depend on any other lifeforms to survive.  The organisms survive using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and some may use CO oxidization for the metabolism. The main types of microbe found there are [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] and [[Acidobacteria]].&lt;ref name="TeboDavis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00179/full|last1=Tebo|first1=Bradley M.|last2=Davis|first2=Richard E.|last3=Anitori|first3=Roberto P.|last4=Connell|first4=Laurie B.|last5=Schiffman|first5=Peter|last6=Staudigel|first6=Hubert|title=Microbial communities in dark oligotrophic volcanic ice cave ecosystems of Mt.

==History==

===Discovery and naming===
Mount Erebus was discovered on January 27, 1841 (and observed to be in eruption),&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Voyage to the Southern Seas'', vol. i, pp. 216–8.&lt;/ref&gt; by polar explorer Sir [[James Clark Ross]], who named it and its companion, [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]], after his ships, ''[[HMS Erebus (1826)|Erebus]]'' and ''[[HMS Terror (1813)|Terror]]'' (which were later used by Sir [[John Franklin]] on his disastrous [[Arctic]] [[Franklin's lost expedition|expedition]]). Present with Ross on the Erebus was the young [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], future president of the Royal Society and close friend of Charles Darwin. [[Erebus]] is a dark region in [[Hades]] in [[Greek mythology]], personified as the [[Greek primordial deities|Ancient Greek primordial deity]] of darkness, the son of [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+116 116–124].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic sites===
The mountain was surveyed in December 1912 by a science party from [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' expedition]], who also collected geological samples. Two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance:
* Upper “Summit Camp” site (HSM 89) consists of part of a circle of rocks, which were probably used to weight the tent valances.
* Lower “Camp E” site (HSM 90) consists of a slightly elevated area of gravel, as well as some aligned rocks, which may have been used to weight the tent valances.

They have been designated [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|historic sites or monuments]] following a proposal by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=atcm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM36/WW/atcm36_ww004_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2013)|accessdate=2014-01-09 |work= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing===
Mount Erebus' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s party; [[Edgeworth David|Professor Edgeworth David]], [[Douglas Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], [[Alistair Mackay|Dr Alister Mackay]], [[Jameson Adams]], [[Eric Marshall|Dr Eric Marshall]] and Phillip Brocklehurst (who did not reach the summit),  in 1908. Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer [[Roger Mear]] on 7 June 1985, a member of the "In the Footsteps of Scott" expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Mear, Roger and Robert Swan, ''In the Footsteps of Scott'', pp. 95–104.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2017}}  On January 19–20, 1991, Charles J. Blackmer, an iron-worker for many years at [[McMurdo Station]] and the [[South Pole]], accomplished a solo ascent in about 17 hours completely unassisted, by snow mobile and on foot.&lt;ref name = "Wheeler Terra"&gt;{{cite book | title = Terra Incognita | first = Sara | last = Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnson Place"&gt;{{cite book | title = Big Dead Place | first = Nicholas | last = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robotic exploration===
In 1992, the inside of the volcano was explored by ''Dante I'', an eight legged tethered robotic explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wettergreen|first=David |author2=Chuck Thorpe |author3=William Whittaker|title=Exploring Mount Erebus by Walking Robot|journal=International Conference of Intelligent Autonomous Systems|year=1993|pages=72–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dante'' was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of Mount Erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas [[chromatograph]], as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes. ''Dante'' successfully scaled a significant portion of the crater before technical difficulties emerged with the fibre-optic cable used for communications between the walker and base station. Unfortunately, ''Dante I'' had not yet reached the bottom of the crater, so no data of volcanic significance was
recorded. However, the expedition proved to be highly successful in terms of robotic and computer science, and was possibly the first expedition by a robotic platform to Antarctica.

===Air New Zealand Flight 901===
{{main|Air New Zealand Flight 901}}

[[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] was a scheduled sightseeing service from [[Auckland Airport]] in [[New Zealand]] to [[Antarctica]] and return with a scheduled stop at [[Christchurch Airport]] to refuel before returning to Auckland.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes P., Daughters of Erebus, Hachette New Zealand Ltd (2011), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Air New Zealand]] flyover service, for the purposes of Antarctic sightseeing, was operated with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] aircraft and began in February 1977. The flight crashed into Mount Erebus on November 28, 1979, killing all 257  people on board. Passenger photographs taken seconds before the collision removed all doubt of [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions or the "flying in a cloud" theory, showing perfectly clear visibility well beneath the cloud base, with landmarks {{convert|13|miles}} to the left and {{convert|10|miles}} to the right of the aircraft visible.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Commission Report, para 28&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation of the crash showed an Air New Zealand navigational error and a cover-up that resulted in about $100 million in lawsuits. Air New Zealand discontinued its flyovers of Antarctica. Its final flight was on February 17, 1980. During the Antarctic summer, snow melt on the flanks of Mount Erebus continually reveals debris from the crash; it is visible from the air.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">'''New Exploration Licensing Policy''' (NELP) was conceptualised by the Government of India, during 1997-98 to provide an equal platform to both Public and Private sector companies in exploration and production of hydrocarbons with [[Directorate General of Hydrocarbons]] (DGH) as a nodal agency for its implementation. It was introduced to boost the production of oil and natural gas and providing level  playing field for both public and private players.

==Introduction==
New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP)&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2001/fsep2001/f110920011.html&lt;/ref&gt; was conceptualised by Amit B Singh after request by the Government of India, during 1997-98 to provide an equal platform to both Public and Private sector companies in exploration and production of hydrocarbons with Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) as a nodal agency for its implementation. 
India has an estimated sedimentary area of 3.14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. consisting of 26 sedimentary basins, of which, 57% (1.79 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) area is in deepwater and remaining 43% (1.35 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) area is in onland and shallow offshore. At present 1.06 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area is held under Petroleum Exploration Licenses in 18 basins by national oil companies viz. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ([[ONGC]]), OIL India Limited ([[Oil India|OIL]]) and Private/Joint Venture companies. Before implementation of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999, a mere 11% of Indian sedimentary basins were under exploration, which has now increased extensively over the years.

Recently, bidding process was completed in NELP-IX. Till 2010, 8 rounds of NELP have been completed. 400 PSC’s have been signed, out of which 168 are in operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://profit.ndtv.com/news/show/govt-signed-production-sharing-contracts-for-235-blocks-under-nelp-124474&lt;/ref&gt; The private / JV companies contribute about 46% of gas and 16% oil to the national Oil &amp; Gas production. [[Cairn India|The Mangala fields in Rajasthan]] and [[Krishna Godavari Basin|Krishna-Godavari Basins]] have been the major source for oil and gas fields.

==History==
New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) was formulated by the Government of India, during 1997-98 to provide level playing field for all the investors and providing several concessions and incentives to both Public and Private sector companies in exploration and production of hydrocarbons with [http://www.dghindia.org/ Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH]) acting as a nodal agency for its implementation.

==Need for NELP==
India is the fifth largest consumer of primary energy and the third largest consumer of oil in the Asia–Pacific region after China and Japan. Due to high economic growth, there is a huge need for enhancing supply of energy resources. Also, dependence on imported petroleum continues to grow and is ultimately impacting the country’s long term growth. Of the 26 sedimentary basins identified in India, so far, only 20% of the total area has been well explored. The remaining areas need to be extensively explored with the best of technologies, with special emphasis on the frontier basins. 
With the introduction of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the introduction of much-needed capital and state-of-the-art technology to explore the sector could be made possible. With the policies and regulations being some of the most transparent in the world, the NELP has revived a healthy spirit of competition between National Oil Companies and private and multinational companies. 
The development of the exploration sector has been significantly boosted through this policy, which brought major liberalization in the sector and created pathways for private and foreign investment, where 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed. Under NELP, which became effective in February 1999, the process of competitive bidding is followed wherein acreages are offered to the participating companies. 
By mid-2012, the ninth round of bidding has been concluded along with fourth round for Coal Bed Methane (CBM) blocks. The Government of India offered the highest ever number of 70 oil &amp; gas exploration blocks covering an area of about 1,63,535&amp;nbsp;km². and also making a parallel offer of 10 blocks under the fourth round of Coal Bed Methane Policy (CBM-IV) for exploration and production of Coal Bed Methane. The Government of India launched the Ninth round of offers for exploration acreages, NELP IX on 15 October 2010.

==NELP-I==
Under the First round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India on 8 January 1999 for 48 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas. Of these, 12 blocks were deepwater (beyond 400m isobath), 26 shallow offshore and 10 were onshore blocks. 
The PSC’s were signed for 24 exploration blocks comprising 7 deepwater, 16 shallow offshore and 1 onshore. At present, 11 exploration blocks are under operation and 13 blocks have been relinquished.

==NELP-II==
Under the second round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India 15 December 2000 for 25 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas. Of these, 8 blocks were deepwater (beyond 400m isobath), 8 shallow offshore and 9 were onland blocks.

==Chronology OF Exploration and Production Activities in India==
India began its journey into Oil Exploration and Production just seven years after the famous ‘[[Drake Well]]’, which heralded the beginning of the Petroleum era, which was drilled in Titus Ville, Pennsylvania, USA (1859). The oil reserves were located in the dense jungles, swamps, damp and undulated terrain of Brahmaputra Valley, Assam in the mid-19th century. The first well was drilled by Mr.Goodenough of Mckillop, Stewart and Co.; in Upper Assam in 1866 following a hint of oil show detected by the fleet of elephants carrying logs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">'''Non-representational theory''' is a [[theory]] developed in [[human geography]], largely through the work of [[Nigel Thrift]] ([[Warwick University]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2000. "Non-representational theory" in RJ Johnston, D Gregory, G Pratt and M Watts (eds) The Dictionary of Human Geography (Blackwell, Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2007. ''Non-representational theory: Space, Politics, Affect'' (Routledge, London)&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues such as J.D. Dewsbury ([[University of Bristol]]) and Derek McCormack ([[University of Oxford]]), and later by their respective graduate students. It challenges those using [[social theory]] and conducting [[geography|geographical]] research to "go beyond [[knowledge representation|representation]]"&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1996; ''Spatial Formations''; Sage&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on embodied experience.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. {{doi|10.1111/area.12339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, D.P., 2017. The circumstances of post‐phenomenological life worlds. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 42(1), pp.2-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Dewsbury describes practices of "witnessing" that produce "knowledge without contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;Dewsbury, J.D., 2003; "Witnessing space: 'knowledge without contemplation'" Environment and Planning A", volume 35, pp. 1907–1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emphasis on practice==
Instead of studying and representing social relationships, non-representational theory focuses upon practices&amp;nbsp;– how human and nonhuman formations are enacted or performed&amp;nbsp;– not simply on what is produced.&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1997; 'The still point: expressive embodiment and dance', in Pile, S and Keith, M (eds.), ''Geographies of Resistance''; (Routledge) pp 124–151&lt;/ref&gt; "First, it valorizes those processes  that operate before … conscious, reflective thought … [and] second, it insists on the  necessity of not prioritizing representations  as the primary epistemological vehicles through which knowledge is extracted from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCormack|first1=Derek|date=2005|title=Diagramming Practice and Performance|url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=d51j|journal=Society and Planning|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have examined a wide range of activities including dance,&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek, McCormack; 2003; 'Geographies for Moving Bodies: Thinking, Dancing, Spaces'; (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt; musical performance,&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Frances; 2005; 'Performing ethnography: Irish traditional music sessions and new methodological spaces' (Taylor and Frances)&lt;/ref&gt; walking,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, John; 2005' A single day's walking: narrating self and landscape on the South West Coast Path' (Transactions of the British Geographers)&lt;/ref&gt; gardening,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, David; 2003; 'Performances and constitutions of natures: a consideration of the performance of lay geographies'&lt;/ref&gt; rave,&lt;ref&gt;Saldanha; 2005; 'Trance and visibility at dawn: racial dynamics in Goa's rave scene' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; listening to music&lt;ref&gt;Anderson; 2004; 'A Principle of Hope: Recorded Music, Listening Practices and the Immanence of Utopia'&lt;/ref&gt; and children's play.&lt;ref&gt;Harker; 'Playing and affective time-spaces'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-structuralist origins==
This is a [[post-structuralist]] theory inspired in part by the ideas of thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Michel Serres]], and by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenonologists]] such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"&gt;Smith, Richard G., 2003; "Baudrillard's nonrepresentational theory: burn the signs and journey without maps" in ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'' 21; pp 67–84&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it considers views from political science (including ideas about [[radical democracy]]) and anthropological discussions of the material dimensions of human life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It parallels the conception of "hybrid geographies" developed by [[Sarah Whatmore (geographer)|Sarah Whatmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, S. 2002. ''Hybrid Geographies'' (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have suggested that Thrift's use of the term "non-representational theory" is problematic, and that other non-representational theories could be developed. [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]] said that [[Baudrillard]]'s work could be considered a "non-representational theory", for example,&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"/&gt; which has fostered some debate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 2005, Hayden Lorimer (Glasgow University) said that the term "more-than-representational" as preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, H., 2005; "Cultural geography: the busyness of being 'more-than-representational'", ''Progress in Human Geography'' 29, 1 (2005) pp. 83–94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mapa de la región norte de México.jpg|thumb|Northern Mexico location (light green).]]

'''Northern Mexico''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''el Norte de México''), commonly referred as '''El Norte''', is an informal term for the northern cultural and geographical area in [[Mexico]]. Depending on the source, it contains some or all of the states of [[Baja California]], [[Baja California Sur]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Durango]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Sonora]] and [[Tamaulipas]].

In fact there is not a border that separates the northern states from the southern states in Mexico. For some authors, only states that have a border with the [[United States|US]] are considered as northern Mexico, i.e. [[Baja California]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]],  [[Sonora]] and [[Tamaulipas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=_DDre5B1lLcC&amp;pg=PA175|title=Consuming Mexican Labor: From the Bracero Program to NAFTA|last=Mize|first=Ronald L.|last2=Swords|first2=Alicia C. S.|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=|isbn=9781442601581|location=|pages=175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others also include [[Durango]], [[Sinaloa]] and [[Baja California Sur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=IkfoCQAAQBAJ|title=The Architecture and Cities of Northern Mexico from Independence to the Present|last=Burian|first=Edward|date=2015-08-15|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292771901|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people consider that the north starts above the [[Tropic of Cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=yAgGHnENHjoC&amp;pg=PA560|title=World Regional Geography|last=Hobbs|first=Joseph J.|date=2008-03-13|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0495389501|location=|pages=506|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this description would include some parts of [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]] that are usually not considered northern states.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== History ==

=== Before colonization ===

It is not known exactly when the first settlers came to Northern Mexico.  The bad weather in the region limited the practice of agriculture, so ancient cultures developed a [[Nomad|nomadic lifestyle]] dedicated to hunting and gathering.&lt;ref&gt;http://portalacademico.cch.unam.mx/materiales/prof/matdidac/sitpro/hist/mex/mex1/HMI/Aridoamerica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important native cultures at northern Mexico are the [[Tepehuán people|Tepehuanes]] in [[Durango]], who  are actually named the ''Odamis'', meaning "people from the mountains".&lt;ref&gt;http://pueblosoriginarios.com/norte/suroeste/odami/odami.html&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar has happened with the [[Tarahumara people|Raramuris]] in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]; ''Raramuri'' means "people who run", but they are known as Tarahumaras. Other important cultures are [[Mayos]] and [[Yaquis]] in [[Sonora]], and [[Laguneros]] in [[Coahuila]]. In [[Nuevo Leon]], many nomads were exterminated for resisting the construction of [[Monterrey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elclima.com.mx/historia_y_fundacion_de_monterrey.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial era ===
The first city of the region was [[Durango City|Durango]], founded by [[Francisco de Ibarra]], a [[Basques|Basque]] explorer. During the colonial era, Durango, Chihuahua and some parts of Sinaloa and Coahuila were a Basque colony named the ''[[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]]''. Now, most Duranguenses are Basque descendants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/595895.siglos-de-historia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities like Monterrey were founded almost 50 years later.

== Culture ==
Northern Mexican culture is very different from the culture in south and central [[Mexico]]. Northern Mexican opinion tends to be more conservative on average on cultural topics like [[abortion]], [[LGBT rights in Mexico|gay marriage]] and legalization of [[marijuana]],&lt;ref&gt;https://distintaslatitudes.net/durango-en-busqueda-del-matrimonio-igualitario&lt;/ref&gt; but more liberal on topics like business or technology.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20121219231343/elojodemexico.blogspot.mx/2009/07/la-cultura-del-norte-de-mexico-mexicali.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another important difference between the North and the rest of Mexico is that Northern Mexicans tend to be more identified with their Spanish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://chihuahuasi.blogspot.com/2012/06/caracteristicas-de-los-chihuahuenses.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the Strategic Communication Cabinet, a statistical consulting services company, published a report called "Social Intolerance In Mexico",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica | title=Intolerancia Social en México | date=2014 | url=http://gabinete.mx/wp-content/uploads/encuesta_nacional/2014_dossier/dossier_intolerancia_social_mexico_2014.pdf | accessdate=12 August 2018 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which polls that covered several social issues were conducted in the 45 largest cities and municipalities of the country. Aside from liberal [[Mexico City]], the federal capital, the study found the strongest support for [[same-sex marriage]] in northern cities such as [[Tijuana]] and [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]; whereas it was the weakest in [[Durango, Durango|Durango]], [[Ciudad Victoria]], [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]] and [[Monterrey Metropolitan area|Monterrey]]. As for [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]], it was more widely accepted in the border cities of Tijuana and [[Ciudad Juárez]], while the least support was found in Chihuahua and Durango. Support for abortion upon request, cannabis legalisation and [[euthanasia]] was the weakest in Northern Mexico. Nonetheless, Coahuila became the first state to [[Same-sex marriage in Coahuila|legalise same-sex marriage]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-29028305 | title=Mexican state of Coahuila approves same-sex marriage | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2 September 2014 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Festivities ===
For a long time, November 20; the anniversary of the [[Mexican Revolution]]; was considered the National Day in northern states. This has been changed by some politics implanted by the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública|SEP]] making obligatory the celebrations of the September 16 ([[Independence of Mexico|The Independence Day of Mexico]]) and the [[Día de los Muertos]], which are days that originally weren't celebrated in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://es.quora.com/Se-celebra-el-D%C3%ADa-de-Muertos-en-el-norte-de-M%C3%A9xico&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important days in the north are July 8, the foundation of [[Durango City]] (the first city founded in the North) and the carnaval of Mazatlán, celebrated 6 days before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Because of the American influence in the region, northern Mexicans also celebrate some American traditions like [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]] and [[Saint Patrick's Day]].

As well as the Spanish and the indigenous people, Northern Mexico has received [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Jewish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[German people|German]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants. All this mixture of cultures have strongly influenced the gastronomy from the north. Northern Mexican gastronomy is based in beef, goat and pig meat and flour tortillas&lt;ref&gt;http://foodandtravel.mx/platillos-tipicos-de-torreon/&lt;/ref&gt; which are remnants of Jewish and Lebanese heritage. Because of the German influence cheese and dairy products are also important in the gastronomy of the region. [[Quesadilla]]s and [[burrito]]s are probably the two most famous dishes from the north. One of the most famous customs from northern Mexico is to reunite family and friends on weekends to prepare [[barbecue]], named ''Carne Asada'' by the Mexicans. A variation of this tradition is to prepare [[discada]], a mixture of grilled meats cooked on an agricultural plow disk harrow.

[[Association football]], or soccer, is one of the region's most popular sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://startribune.com/index.php/soccer-insider-liga-mx-teams-make-inroads-into-u-s-markets/489360231/ | title=Soccer Insider: Liga MX teams make inroads into U.S. television markets | last=Mathaler | first=Jon | publisher=[[Star Tribune]] | date=28 July 2018 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it hosts four out of the eighteen teams that currently play in the [[Liga MX]], the country's top division of the [[Mexican football league system|domestic football league system]]. Major cities are home to these teams such as [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Tigres UANL]], both based in Monterrey, [[Santos Laguna]] in Torreón and [[Club Tijuana|Tijuana]] in the border city of the same name. Notably, Northern teams have dominated the Liga MX in the 2010s, winning a combined total of [[List of Mexican football champions|nine titles]] and reaching more than half of the decade's finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=https://mexico.as.com/mexico/2017/12/03/futbol/1512325597_563899.html | title=El norte manda: Sus equipos han llegado a 7 de las 10 últimas finales | last=Juárez | first=César | publisher=[[Diario AS]] | date=3 December 2017 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2018/05/14/con-santos-en-la-final-por-octava-vez-al-hilo-un-equipo-norteno-va-por-titulo | title=¡El Norte manda!

[[Baseball]] is another popular sport in Northern Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mlb.com/news/baseball-revival-happening-in-mexico/c-265851562 | title=Baseball revival happening in Mexico | last=Sánchez | first=Jorge | publisher=MLB | date=2 February 2018 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in states such as Sinaloa and Sonora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=https://www.debate.com.mx/guasave/Sinaloa-es-quien-mas-nutre-al-beisbol-mexicano-20151202-0170.html | title=Sinaloa es quien más nutre al beisbol mexicano | last=Cervantes | first=Héctor | publisher=[[El Debate (Mexico)|El Debate]] | date=2 December 2018 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=https://www.debate.com.mx/mexico/Sonora-pasion-por-el-beisbol-en-las-venas-20171129-0329.html | title=Sonora, pasión por el beisbol en las venas | last=López | first=Tess | publisher=[[El Debate (Mexico)|El Debate]] | date=29 November 2017 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the twelve teams of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Mexican League]] are based in the North. The independent [[Mexican Pacific League]] (''Liga Mexicana del Pacífico'' or LMP) is based in the North, with most of its eight teams playing in Northwestern Mexico. The LMP is a winter league, its season coinciding with the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) off-season; MLB players can therefore participate, making MPL more competitive. Since the 1970s, the winner of the Mexican Pacific League has competed in the prestigious [[Caribbean Series]], won nine times by Mexican teams, primarily in the 21st century, such as [[Yaquis de Obregón]] and [[Naranjeros de Hermosillo]], based in the state of Sonora, [[Venados de Mazatlán]] and [[Tomateros de Culiacán]], both based in the state of Sinaloa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=http://www.milenio.com/deportes/los-campeones-mexicanos-en-la-serie-del-caribe | title=Los campeones mexicanos en la Serie del Caribe | last=Padilla Márquez | first=Josué | publisher=[[Milenio]] | date=1 February 2018 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the [[Mexican Baseball League]], the country's oldest running professional league, which runs in the summer season, several Northern teams participate such as [[Sultanes de Monterrey]], [[Saraperos de Saltillo]], [[Acereros de Monclova]], [[Algodoneros de Unión Laguna]], [[Generales de Durango]], [[Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos]] and [[Toros de Tijuana]]. By far, Sultanes de Monterrey has been the most successful Northern team in the Mexican League, winning nine titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=http://www.milenio.com/deportes/los-nueve-titulos-de-los-sultanes-de-monterrey | title=Los nueve títulos de los Sultanes de Monterrey | author=La Afición| publisher=[[Milenio]] | date=20 February 2017 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Spanish | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/beisbol/noticias/2007/12/15/despues-de-11-anos-sultanes-vuelve-a-ser-rey | title=Después de 11 años, Sultanes vuelve a ser el rey en LMB | publisher=Medio Tiempo | date=15 December 2017 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there are several minor state-wide baseball leagues in the region such as ''[[:es:Liga Estatal de Béisbol de Chihuahua|Liga Estatal de Béisbol de Chihuahua]]'', ''[[:es:Liga Mayor de Béisbol de La Laguna|Liga Mayor de Béisbol de La Laguna]]'' and ''[[Liga Norte de México]]''.

Another popular sport is [[basketball]], played at the professional level throughout the entire year between the [[Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional|National Basketball League]], founded in 2000, and the [[Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico|Pacific Coast Circuit]], which exclusively involves teams based in Northwestern Mexico. The ''[[:es:Liga de Básquetbol Estatal de Chihuahua|Liga de Básquetbol Estatal de Chihuahua]]'' is a minor league played primarily by local teams in the border state of Chihuahua. Remarkably, Chihuahua-born [[Eduardo Nájera]] became the second Mexican to play in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), after Sinaloa-born [[Horacio Llamas]]. As for [[American football]], [[National Football League]] (NFL) following is popular in several northern cities, particularly amongst the middle and upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/17/nfl-mexico-upper-class-elite-soccer | title='An upper-class picnic': the Mexican elite's curious love affair with NFL | last=Tucker | first=Duncan | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=17 November 2016 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17853442/american-football-taken-root-mexico-all-levels-youth-pro | title=From youth to pro, American football has taken root in Mexico | last=Weinfuss | first=Josh | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=17 November 2016 | accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Torreón-born kicker [[Raúl Allegre]] played for several NFL teams throughout his career in the 1980s. [[Boxing]] is one of the most popular sports in the country and Northern Mexico has long been a source of world famous players such as [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Oscar de la Hoya]] and [[Misael Rodríguez]].

At its northern [[Yalu River|Amnok River]] border are [[People's Republic of China|China]] and, separated by the [[Tumen River]] in the extreme north-east, [[Russia]].  The capital of North Korea is the city of [[Pyongyang]].

 |quote       = Kim Jong-il's regime needs economic concessions to avoid collapse, and just as crucially needs an end to the strategic siege imposed by the US since the end of the Korean war (1950-53). Pyongyang's nuclear brinkmanship, though potentially dangerous, is driven by fear rather than by militaristic ambition. The rotten Stalinist dictatorship faces the prospect of an implosion. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which deprived North Korea of vital economic support, the regime has consistently attempted to secure from the US a non-aggression pact, recognition of its sovereignty, and economic assistance. The US's equally consistent refusal to enter into direct negotiations with North Korea, effectively ruling out a peace treaty to formally close the 1950-53 Korean war, has encouraged the regime to resort to nuclear blackmail.

|quote = In this context, the constant attempts by the Western press to paint Kim Jong Il as simply a raving lunatic look, well, mad. There is no denying that the regime he presides over is a nasty Stalinist dictatorship that brutally oppresses its own population. But in the face of constant threats from the US, Pyongyang's actions have a definite rationality from the regime's point of view.

|quote = North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is one of the world's most oppressive, closed, and vicious dictatorships. It is perhaps the last living example of pure totalitarianism&amp;nbsp;— control of the state over every aspect of human life. Is such a place the right venue for a western orchestra? Can one imagine the New York Philharmonic, which performed to great acclaim in Pyongyang, entertaining Stalin or Hitler?
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's government styles itself as following the ''[[Juche]]'' ideology of self-reliance, developed by [[Kim Il-sung]], the country's former leader. The current leader is [[Kim Jong-un]], the late president [[Kim Il-sung]]'s grandson and son of recently deceased leader [[Kim Jong-il]] . Relations are strongest with other officially [[socialist]] states: [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[China]], as well as with [[Russia]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Myanmar]]. Following a [[North Korean famine|major famine]] in the early 1990s, due partly to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] (previously a major economic partner), leader Kim Jong-il instigated the [[Songun|"Military-First" policy]] in 1995, increasing economic concentration and support for the military.

North Korea's culture is officially promoted and heavily controlled by the government. The [[Arirang Festival]]s or "Mass Games" are government-organized events glorifying the regime, involving over 100,000 performers.

'''Robert Alfred Cloyne Godwin-Austen''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (17 March 1808 – 25 November 1884) was an English [[geologist]].

Godwin-Austen was the eldest son of Sir Henry E. Austen. He was educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], of which he became a fellow in 1830. He afterwards entered [[Lincoln's Inn]]. In 1833 he married the only daughter and heiress of [[Henry Godwin (army officer)|Major General Sir Henry Godwin KCB]], and in 1854 he took the additional name of Godwin by Royal licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletins and other state intelligence, Part 2'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=wuU1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1488#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1488], quoting ''[[London Gazette]]'' of October 24, 1854: "The Queen has been pleased to give and grant unto Robert Alfred Cloyne Austen, of Chilworth, in the county of Surrey, Esquire, and unto Maria Elizabeth his wife, only daughter and heir of Henry Thomas Godwin, Esquire, Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, late a Major-General in Her Majesty's Army, deceased, Her royal licence and authority that they and their issue may henceforward assume and use the surname of Godwin in addition to, and before that of, Austen."&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford as a pupil of [[William Buckland]] he became deeply interested in geology. Soon afterwards he met and was inspired by [[Henry De la Beche]] and assisted him by making a geological map of the neighbourhood of [[Newton Abbot]] in [[Devon]], which was embodied in the [[Geological Survey]] map. He also published an elaborate memoir ''On the Geology of the South-East of Devonshire'' (Trans. Geol. Soc. ser. 2, vol. viii.).

His attention was next directed to the [[Cretaceous]] rocks of [[Surrey]], his home county - his estates being situated at [[Chilworth, Surrey|Chilworth]] and [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]] near [[Guildford]]. Later he dealt with the superficial deposits bordering the [[English Channel]], and with the erratic boulders of [[Selsey]]. In 1855 he brought before the [[Geological Society of London]] his paper ''On the possible Extension of the Coal-Measures beneath the South-Eastern part of England'', in which he pointed out on well-considered theoretical grounds the likelihood of coal measures being some day reached in that area. In this article he also advocated the freshwater origin of the [[Old Red Sandstone]], and discussed the relations of that formation, and of the [[Devonian]], to the [[Silurian]] and [[Carboniferous]].

Godwin Austen was entrusted with the completion of a work intended by the naturalist [[Edward Forbes]], F.R.S. which was entitled Natural History of the European Seas published in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;"In addition to this, he [Forbes] found leisure in his evening hours to begin another little volume (which, however, he never lived to complete), entitled &lt;u&gt;The Natural History of the European Seas&lt;/u&gt;. (Completed after his death by Mr. Godwin Austen whom he left his literary executor) and published in 1859. London, Van Voorst" c.f. ''Memoir of Edward Forbes'' By George Wilson, M.D.,Sir Archibald Geikie, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected [[Royal Society|F.R.S.]] in 1849, and in 1862 he was awarded the [[Wollaston Medal]] by the Geological Society of London, on which occasion he was styled by [[Roderick Murchison]] pre-eminently the physical geographer of bygone periods. He died at [[Shalford, Surrey#History|Shalford House]] near [[Guildford]]. His son, [[Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen]] was also a geologist.

In [[Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', '''Ruach''' is the Isle of Winds. The people of Ruach eat and drink nothing but wind, and live inside [[weathercock]]s. The island is an [[allegory]] of the insubstantial promises and flatteries that people must subsist on to survive in this world.

The word "Ruach" comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning "spirit", "wind", "breath", or "air".  The Greek equivalent is "pneuma" and the Latin is "spiritus".

The modern '''names of Scottish islands''' stem from two main influences. There are a large number of names that derive from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language in the [[Hebrides]] and [[Firth of Clyde]]. In the [[Northern Isles]] most place names have a [[Old Norse|Norse]] origin. There are also some island place names that originate from three other influences, including a limited number that are essentially [[English language]] names, a few that are of [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] origin and some of an unknown origin that may represent a pre-Celtic language. These islands have all been occupied by the speakers of  at least three and in many cases four or more languages since the [[Iron Age]], and many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning as a result.{{#tag:ref|Writing in the 1880s, Rev. Thomas McLauchlan urged caution, noting that it "is necessary to ensure a historical, and hence an accurate instead of a fanciful, account of our topographical terms. Any one acquainted with Highland etymologies, knows to what an extent our imaginative countrymen have gone in attaching meanings altogether fanciful to such terms; but nothing is more likely to mislead the inquirer than elevating our ancient and irregular orthography to a position which it is altogether unfit to occupy".&lt;ref&gt;M'Lauchlan, Rev. Thomas (Jan 1866) "On the Kymric Element in the Celtic Topography of Scotland". ''[[Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]]''. Edinburgh, '''VI''' Part 2, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

Scotland has over 790 offshore islands, most of which are to be found in four main groups: [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], and the [[Hebrides]], sub-divided into the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are also clusters of islands in the [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Firth of Forth]], and [[Solway Firth]], and numerous small islands within the many bodies of [[freshwater|fresh water]] in Scotland including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Maree]].

==Main languages==

===Early languages===
[[File:Rodney's Stone 20080430.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rodney's stone]]]]
&lt;!-- [[Image:Proposed area of Vasconic languages.png|thumb|Proposed area of [[Vasconic substratum theory|Vasconic substratum]]]] --&gt;
As humans have lived on the islands of Scotland since at least [[Mesolithic]] times, it is clear that pre-modern languages must have been used, and by extension names for the islands, that have been lost to history. [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] is the presumed ancestor language of all the known [[Celtic languages]]. Proponents of the controversial [[Vasconic substratum theory]] suggest that many western European languages contain remnants of an even older [[language family]] of [[Vasconic languages]], of which [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only surviving member. This proposal was originally made by the German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]], but has been rejected by other linguists.

A small number of island names may contain elements of such an early Celtic or pre-Celtic language, but no certain knowledge of any pre-[[Picts|Pictish]] language exists anywhere in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson (2008) pp. 30-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic languages===
British or Brythonic was an ancient [[P-Celtic]] language spoken in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. It  is a form of [[Insular Celtic]], which is descended from Proto-Celtic, the hypothetical parent language that many linguistics belief had already begun to diverge into separate dialects or languages in the first half of the first millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson |first=Jon C. |title=The Atlantic Iron Age: Settlement and Identity in the First Millennium BC |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=292–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims-Williams |first=Patrick |title=Studies on Celtic Languages before the Year 1000 |publisher=CMCS |year=2007 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch |first=John |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |page=1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eska |first=Joseph |chapter=Continental Celtic |editor=Roger Woodard |title=The Ancient Languages of Europe |publisher=Cambridge |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the sixth century AD, scholars of early Insular history often begin to talk about four geographically separate forms of British: [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and the now [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Cumbric language]]. These are collectively known as the [[Brythonic languages]].  It is clear that whenever place names are recorded at an early date as having been transposed from a form of P-Celtic into Gaelic that this occurred prior to the transformation from "Old British" into modern Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous Scottish place names with Brythonic roots although the number of island names involved is relatively small.

[[File:Scots lang-en.svg|thumb|right|Linguistic division in early twelfth century Scotland.{{legend|#0fe3e3|[[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] speaking}}{{legend|#eb82df|[[Norse–Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] zone, use of either or both languages}}{{legend|#eed4e0|English-speaking zone}}{{legend|#0ff183|[[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] speaking zone}}]]
The [[Pictish language]] offers considerable difficulties. It is a term used for the language(s) thought to have been spoken by the Picts, the people of northern and central Scotland in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. It may have been a fifth branch of Brythonic; [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] thought that the evidence is weak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth H. Jackson |year=1955 |chapter=The Pictish Language |editor=F.&amp;nbsp;T. Wainwright |title=The Problem of the Picts |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Nelson |pages=129–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Katherine Forsyth]] disagreed with his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsyth|first1=Katherine|title=Language in Pictland: the case against 'non-Indo-European Pictish'|date=1997|publisher=Stichting Uitgeverij de Keltische Draak|location=Utrecht|isbn=90-802785-5-6|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/2081/1/languagepictland.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea that a distinct Pictish language was perceived at some point is  attested clearly in [[Bede]]'s early 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', which names it as distinct from both [[Old Welsh]] and [[Old Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede (731) ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is virtually no direct attestation of Pictish short of the names of people found on monuments  in the lands controlled by the Picts - the area north of the Forth-Clyde line in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=C31&gt;Clarkson (2008) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these monuments include elaborate carved symbols, but an understanding of their significance has so far proved as elusive as interpretation of the few written fragments, which have been described as resembling an "odd sort of gibberish".&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson (2008) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, there is significant indirect place-name evidence for the Picts use of Brythonic or [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic|P-Celtic]].&lt;ref name=C31/&gt; The term "Pritennic" is sometimes used to refer to the proto-Pictish language spoken in this area during the [[Iron Age]].

Given the paucity of knowledge about the Pictish language it may be assumed that islands names with P-Celtic affiliations in the southern Hebrides, and Firths of Clyde and Forth are Brythonic and those to the north and west are of Pictish origin.

This [[Goidelic language]] arrived via [[Ireland]] due to the growing influence of the kingdom of [[Dál Riata|Dalriada]] from the 6th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Armit, Ian "The Iron Age" in Omand (2006) p. 57 - but see Campbell critique&lt;/ref&gt; It is still spoken in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Hebrides]], and in Scottish cities by some communities. It was formerly spoken over a far wider area than today, even in the recent past. [[Scottish Gaelic]], along with modern [[Manx language|Manx]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], are descended from [[Middle Irish]], a derivative of [[Old Irish]], which is descended in turn from [[Primitive Irish]]. This the oldest known form of the Goidelic languages, which is known only from fragments, mostly personal names, inscribed on stone in the [[Ogham]] alphabet in [[Ireland]] and western Britain up to about the 6th century. The [[Beurla-reagaird]] is a Gaelic-based [[Cant (language)|cant]] of the [[Scottish Travellers|Scottish travelling community]].&lt;ref&gt;Neat, Timothy (2002) ''The Summer Walkers''. Edinburgh. Birlinn. pp. 225-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse and Norn===
[[Old Norse]] is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] that was spoken by inhabitants of [[Scandinavia]] and of their overseas settlements during the [[Viking Age]], until about 1300. Its influence on Scots island names is considerable due to the development of both the [[Earldom of Orkney]] and the [[Kingdom of the Isles]] which resulted in almost all of the inhabitable islands of Scotland (except those in the Firth of Forth) coming under Norse control from the 9th to 13th centuries.

[[Image:ScotsLanguageMap.png|thumb|Areas where the [[Scots language]] was spoken in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William  (1931) [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/INTRO/map.php?num=2 Scottish National Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121173629/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/INTRO/map.php?num=2 |date=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregg R.J.

[[Norn language|Norn]] is an extinct North Germanic language that developed from Old Norse and was spoken in Shetland,  Orkney and possibly [[Caithness]]. Together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] it belongs to the West Scandinavian group. Very little written evidence of the language has survived and as a result it is not possible to distinguish any island names that may be Norn rather than Old Norse. After the Northern Isles were [[pledge (law)|pledged]] to Scotland by Norway in the 15th century,  the early Scottish Earls spoke Gaelic when the majority of their subjects spoke Norn and both of these languages were then replaced by [[Insular Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Gregor "The Orkney Tongue" in Omand (2003) pp. 248-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English and Scots===
[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]], the [[Modern English|modern variant]] of which is generally dated from about 1550. 
The related [[Scots language]], sometimes regarded as a variety of English, has regional and historic importance in Scotland. It is officially recognised as [[autochthonous language]] under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/ArtsCulture/gaelic/gaelic-english/17910/europeancharter "European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages"] Scottish Government. Retrieved 27 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Natural language|language]] [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]  historically spoken in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Scotland]] and parts of [[Ulster]].

Although they are the dominant languages in modern Scotland the presence of both Scots and English in island names is limited.

==Pre-Celtic remnants==
[[Image:Northisles.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Shetland with [[Fetlar]], [[Unst]], and [[Yell, Shetland|Yell]] highlighted in red]]
There are three island names in [[Shetland]] of unknown and possibly pre-Celtic origin: [[Fetlar]], [[Unst]] and [[Yell, Shetland|Yell]]. The earliest recorded forms of these three names do carry Norse meanings: ''Fetlar'' is the plural of ''fetill'' and means "shoulder-straps" ''Omstr'' is "corn-stack" and ''í Ála''  is from ''ál '' meaning "deep furrow". However these descriptions are hardly obvious ones as island names and are
probably adaptations of a pre-Norse language.&lt;ref&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G19&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;  This may have been [[Pict]]ish but there is no clear evidence for this.&lt;ref name=G9&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shetlopedia.com/Norn "Norn"] Shetlopedia. Retrieved 23 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of several of the Hebrides may also have a pre-Celtic origin. Indeed, the name comes from ''Ebudae'' recorded by Ptolemy, via the mis-reading "Hebudes" and may itself have a pre-Celtic root.&lt;ref name=W38&gt;Watson (1994) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Isle of Mull|Mull]] was recorded by Ptolemy as ''Malaios''&lt;ref name=W37&gt;Watson (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; possibly meaning "lofty isle"&lt;ref name=W38/&gt; although it is pre-Gaelic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Mac an Tàilleir (2003) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In Norse times it became ''Mýl''.&lt;ref name=G2487/&gt;
* The 7th century abbot of Iona [[Adomnán]] records [[Coll]] as ''Colosus'' and [[Tiree]] as ''Ethica'', which may be pre-Celtic names.&lt;ref name=W85&gt;Watson (1994) pp. 84-86&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islay]] is Ptolemy's ''Epidion'',&lt;ref name=W37/&gt; the use of the "p" hinting at a Brythonic or Pictish tribal name.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Adomnán refers to the island as ''Ilea''&lt;ref name=W85/&gt; and occurs in early Irish records as ''Ile'' and as ''Il'' in Old Norse. The root is not Gaelic and of unknown origin.&lt;ref name=G2487&gt;Gammeltoft, Peder  "Scandinavian Naming-Systems in the Hebrides—A Way of Understanding how the Scandinavians were in Contact with Gaels and Picts?" in Ballin Smith ''et al'' (2007) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[etymology of Skye]] is complex and may also include a pre-Celtic root.&lt;ref name=G2487/&gt;
*[[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] is ''Ljoðhús'' in Old Norse and although various suggestions have been made as to a Norse meaning (such as "song house") the name is not of Gaelic origin and the Norse credentials are questionable.&lt;ref name=G2487/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;Mac an Tàilleir (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The origin of [[Uist]] (OldNorse: ''Ívist'') is similarly unclear.&lt;ref name=G2487/&gt;
*[[Rùm]] may be from the Old Norse ''rõm-øy'' for "wide island" or Gaelic ''ì-dhruim'' meaning "isle of the ridge"&lt;ref&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; although  Mac an Tàilleir (2003) is unequivocal that it is a "pre-Gaelic name and unclear".&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Seil]] is probably a pre-Gaelic name,&lt;ref&gt;Mac an Tàilleir (2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; although a case has been made for a Norse derivation.&lt;ref&gt;Rae (2011) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*The etymology of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] is also obscure. Haswell-Smith (2004) offers a Brythonic derivation and a meaning of "high place".&lt;ref name=H11&gt;Haswell-Smith 2004 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]''  describes Arran as being "between Alba and Cruithen-land" although there is possible confusion in the annals between the meaning of ''Cruithen'' to refer to the Picts, the ''Cruithnigh'' of Ireland and the Welsh equivalent of ''Prydain'' to refer to Britain as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the Vasconic substratum hypothesis, Vennemann notes the recurrence of the element ''aran'', (Unified Basque ''haran'') meaning "valley", in names like [[Val d'Aran]], [[Arundel]], or [[Arendal]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldi &amp; Page (December 2006) Review of "Europa Vasconica - Europa Semitica", ''Lingua'', '''116''' Issue 12  pp. 2183-2220&lt;/ref&gt; In early Irish literature Arran is "Aru"&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and Watson (1926) notes there are similar names in Wales but suggests it may be pre-Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brythonic &amp; Pictish names==
Several of the islands of the Clyde have possible Brythonic roots. In addition to Arran (see above) [[Isle of Bute|Bute]] may have a British root and [[Great Cumbrae|Great]] and [[Little Cumbrae]] both certainly have (see below).

[[Inchkeith]] in the [[Firth of Forth]] is recorded as "Insula Keth" in the 12th century ''Life of Saint Serf''. The name may derive from  ''Innis Cheith'' or ''Innis Coit'' and both Mac an Tàilleir (2003) and Watson (1926) suggest that the root is the Brthyonic ''coed''. The derivation would appear to be assumed rather than attested and the modern form is ''Innis Cheith''.&lt;ref name=W381&gt;Watson (1994) pp. 381-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberscotia.com/ancient-lothian/leaves/stories/the-life-of-saint-serf-anonymous.html "The Life of Saint Serf"] cyberscotia.com. Retrieved 27 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caer'' in Welsh means a "stone-girt fort" and was especially applied to Roman camp sites. This is the root of [[Cramond Island]] in the Forth, with ''Caramond'' meaning "the fort on the Almond river".&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) pp. 365, 369&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Threave Castle|Threave]] on the [[River Dee, Galloway|River Dee]] in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] takes its name from P-Celtic ''tref'', meaning "homestead".&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Islands of the Clyde.png|thumb|left|The [[islands of the Clyde]]. The largest are [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], and [[Great Cumbrae|Great]] and [[Little Cumbrae]], all of which names may have a [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] root.]]
It is assumed that Pictish names must once have predominated in the northern Inner Hebrides, Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland although the historical record is sparse. For example, Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King [[Bridei I of the Picts]] in the sixth century: "As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.”&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; However, the place names that existed prior to the 9th century have been all but obliterated by the incoming [[Old Norse|Norse-speaking]] [[Norse-Gaels|Gall-Ghaeils]].&lt;ref name=W95&gt;Woolf, Alex "The Age of the Sea-Kings: 900-1300" in Omand (2006) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orkney]] is pre-Norse in origin and Pictish, as may be the uninhabited Orkney island name [[Damsay]], meaning "lady's isle".&lt;ref name=G21&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably few Pictish placenames of any kind can be identified in Orkney and Shetland, although some apparently Norse names may be adaptations of earlier Pictish ones.&lt;ref name=G8&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandnes (2010) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; There are various  [[ogham]] inscriptions such as on the [[Lunnasting stone]] found in Shetland that have been claimed as representing Pictish, or perhaps even a precursor language.

In the 14th century [[John of Fordun]] also records the name of [[Inchcolm]] as "Eumonia" (referring to the ''monasterium Sancti Columbe in insula Euomonia'') a name of likely Brythonic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norse names==
From some point before 900 until the 14th century both Shetland and Orkney became Norse societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sandnes (2003) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse also dominated the Hebrides  and the islands of the Clyde for much of the same period, although their influence was much weaker there from the 13th century onwards.  According to Ó Corráin (1998) "when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable"&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. "All the islands of Britain" were devastated in 794&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (2008) p. 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (2007) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, most of the island names in Orkney and Shetland have Norse names and many in the Hebrides are Gaelic transformations of the original Norse, with the Norse ending ''-øy'' or ''-ey'' for "island" becoming ''-aigh'' in Gaelic and then ''-ay'' in modern Scots/English.

==Gaelic influence==
[[Image:Scots Gaelic speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|right|Geographic Distribution of Gaelic speakers in Scotland (2011)]]
Perhaps surprisingly Shetland may have a Gaelic root—the name ''Innse Chat'' is referred to in [[Old Irish|early Irish]] literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the later Norn name ''Hjaltland''&lt;ref name=G21/&gt;&lt;ref name=S9/&gt;— but the influence of this language in the [[toponymy]] of the Northern Isles is slight. No Gaelic-derived island names and indeed only two [[Q-Celtic]] words exist in the language of modern Orcadians - "iper" from ''eabhar'', meaning a [[midden]] slurry, and "keero" from ''caora'' - used to describe a small sheep in the North Isles.&lt;ref name="Lamb 2003 p. 250"&gt;Lamb, Gregor "The Orkney Tongue" in Omand (2003) p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrides remain the stronghold of the modern [[Gàidhealtachd]] and unsurprisingly this language has had a significant influence on the islands there. It has been argued that the Norse impact on the onomasticon only applied to the islands north of [[Ardnamurchan]] and that original Gaelic place names predominate to the south.&lt;ref name=W95/&gt; However, recent research suggests that the obliteration of pre-Norse names throughout the Hebrides was almost total and Gaelic derived place names on the southern islands are of post-Norse origin.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kruse (2009) pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King and Cotter  (2012) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also examples of island names that were originally Gaelic but have become completely replaced. For example, Adomnán records ''Sainea'', ''Elena'', ''Ommon'' and ''Oideacha'' in the Inner Hebrides, which are of unknown location and these names must have passed out of usage in the Norse era.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1994) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; One of the complexities is that an island such as [[South Rona|Rona]] may have had a Celtic name, that was replaced by a similar-sounding Norse name, but then reverted to an essentially Gaelic name with a Norse ending.&lt;ref&gt;Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 482, 486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scots and English names==
In the context of the [[Northern Isles]] it should be borne in mind that Old Norse is a dead language and that as a result names of Old Norse origin exist only as loan words in the Scots language.&lt;ref name=S9&gt;Sandnes (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless if we distinguish between names of obviously Norse origin and those with a significant Scots element the great majority are in the former camp. "Muckle", meaning large or big, is one of few Scots words in the island names of the ''Nordreyar'' and appears in [[Muckle Roe]] and [[Muckle Flugga]] in Shetland and [[Muckle Green Holm]] and [[Muckle Skerry]] in Orkney.

Many small islets and skerries have Scots or Insular Scots names such as Da Skerries o da Rokness and Da Buddle Stane  in Shetland, and Kirk Rocks in Orkney.

[[Image:Horseofcopinsay2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Horse of Copinsay]] from the north west]]
Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae are English/Brythonic in derivation and there are other examples of the use of "great" and "little" such as [[Great Bernera]] and [[Rysa Little]] which are English/Gaelic and Norse/English respectively. The informal use of "Isle of" is commonplace, although only the [[Isle of Ewe]], the [[Isle of May]] and [[Isle Martin]] of the larger Scottish islands use this nomenclature in a formal sense.&lt;ref&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; "Island" also occurs, as in [[Island Macaskin]] and [[Eilean Mhealasta|Mealista Island]] although both islands are also known by their Gaelic names of ''Eilean Macaskin'' and ''Eilean Mhealasta''. [[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Island]] off Arran is an entirely English name as is the collective [[Small Isles]]. [[Ailsa Craig]] is also known as "Paddy's Milestone".&lt;ref name=H4&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Scare]] in the Solway Firth is an English/Norse combination, the second word coming from ''sker'', a [[skerry]].

Some smaller islets and skerries have English names such as [[Barrel of Butter]] and the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Orkney and [[Maiden Island]] and [[Bottle Island]] in the Inner Hebrides.

The Norse often gave animal names to islands and these have been transferred into English in for example, the [[Calf of Flotta]] and [[Horse of Copinsay]]. [[Brother Isle]] is an anglicisation of ''breiðare-øy'' meaning "broad beach island". The Norse ''holmr'', meaning  "a small and rounded islet" has become "[[Holm (island)|Holm]]" in English and there are numerous examples of this use including [[Corn Holm]], [[Thieves Holm]] and [[Little Holm, Yell Sound|Little Holm]].

==Summary of inhabited islands==
Etymological details for all inhabited islands and some larger uninhabited ones are provided at [[Hebrides#Language and etymology|Hebrides]], [[Northern Isles#Island names|Northern Isles]], [[Islands of the Clyde#Etymology|Islands of the Clyde]] and [[Islands of the Forth#Islands|Islands of the Forth]].

Based on these tables, for the inhabited off-shore islands of Scotland (and counting [[Lewis and Harris]] as two islands for this purpose) the following results apply, excluding Scots/English qualifiers such as "muckle" "east", "little" etc.

[[File:Ms 744 obs natiabouani 02.jpg|thumb|Sudanian savanna with bunchgrass tufts of ''[[Andropogon]] gayanus'', Pama reserve, [[Burkina Faso]].]]
The '''Sudanian Savanna''' is a broad belt of [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]] that runs east and west across the [[Africa|African continent]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Gambela Region|western lowlands]] in the east. The [[Sahel]], a belt of drier grasslands and acacia savannas, lies to the north, between the Sudanian Savanna and the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. To the south the [[forest-savanna mosaic]] is a transition zone between the Sudanian Savanna and the [[Guinean moist forests]] and [[Congolian forests]] that lie nearer the equator.

== Ecoregion ==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides the Sudanian Savanna into two [[ecoregion|ecoregions]], separated by the [[Cameroon Highlands]]. The [[West Sudanian Savanna]] runs from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0722 |title=West Sudanian savanna |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[East Sudanian Savanna]] runs from the Cameroon Highlands east to the [[Gambela Region|western lowlands]] of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=WWFeast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0705 |title=East Sudanian savanna |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiographic province ==
The Sudanian Savanna is one of the three distinct physiographic provinces of the larger African Massive division. Physiography divides this province into three distinct physiographic sections, the [[Niger River|Niger Basin]], the [[Lake Chad Basin]], and the [[Middle Nile Basin]].&lt;ref name=WWFeast/&gt;

== Vegetation ==
The Sudanian Savanna is characterized by the coexistence of trees and grasses. Dominant tree species are often belonging to the [[Combretaceae]] and [[Caesalpinioideae]], some ''[[Acacia]]'' species are also important. The dominant grass species are usually [[Andropogoneae]], especially the genera ''[[Andropogon]]'' and ''[[Hyparrhenia]]'', on shallow soils also ''[[Loudetia]]'' and ''[[Aristida]]''. Much of the Sudanian Savanna region is used in the form of parklands, where useful trees, such as [[shea tree|shea]], [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]], [[Parkia biglobosa|locust-bean tree]] and others are spared from cutting, while [[sorghum]], [[maize]], [[millet]] or other crops are cultivated beneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alain Atangana|author2=Damase Khasa|author3=Scott Chang|author4=Ann Degrande |title=Tropical Agroforestry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lvFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-94-007-7723-1 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land use==
The Sudanian savanna is used by both pastoralists and farmers. Cattle are predominantly the livestock kept, but in some areas, sheep and goats are also kept. The main crops grown are [[sorghum]] and [[millet]] which are suited to the low levels of rainfall. With increasing levels of drought since the 1970s, pastoralists have needed to move southwards to search for grazing areas and have come into conflict with more settled agriculturalists.&lt;ref name=Jayalaxshmi&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jayalaxshmi Mistry |author2=Andrea Beradi|title=World Savannas: Ecology and Human Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-88013-4 |pages=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1623">'''Tajzara''', pronounced ''Taxara'' in English, is a small region and lake on the arid Altiplano of [[Bolivia]], located between [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]] and [[Villazón]], near the town of [[Iscayachi]].&lt;ref name="(Organization)1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=ACLO (Organization)|title=Estudio de factibilidad para una cadena de silos intercomunales de papa: Chuquisaca-Potosí-Tarija|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22lFAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=30 May 2012|year=1982|publisher=ACLO|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the surrounding land might appear rather nondescript, is one of the most biologically unique locations in the world. The name Taxara is also synonymous with the shallow lake that marks the center of the region. At about 14,000 feet above sea level, it is an extremely high lake. Another unusual characteristic is that it is a [[salt lake]]. Throughout the year, it bustles with many species of aquatic fowl, including three types of flamingo--the [[Chilean flamingo]], the [[Andean flamingo]], and the [[James's flamingo]]--which are drawn to the lake by its wide expanse of shallow plateaus abounding with algae that constitute the birds' primary food source. Because it is the only sizable body of water within many miles, it often attracts species of bird that would usually not be found in such a region. Most species thrive off the seed that is provided by the arid grassland that characterizes the region.

}}'''Thomas Corwin Mendenhall''' (October 4, 1841 – March 23, 1924) was an American [[autodidact]] [[physicist]] and [[meteorologist]]. He was the first professor hired at [[The Ohio State University]] in 1873 and the superintendent of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] from 1889 to 1894. Alongside his work, he was also an advocate for the [[Metrication in the United States|adoption of the metric system by the United States]].

==Biography==
[[File:PSM V37 D594 Thomas Corwin Mendenhall.jpg|left|thumb|Mendenhall in 1890]]
Mendenhall was born in [[Hanoverton, Ohio]], to Stephen Mendenhall, a [[farmer]] and carriage-maker, and Mary Thomas. In 1852 the family moved to [[Marlboro, Ohio|Marlboro]], a [[Quaker]] community outside of [[Akron, Ohio]]. His parents were strong [[abolitionist]]s and frequently opened their home to escaped slaves heading north along the [[Underground Railroad]]. Mendenhall became principal of the local [[primary school]] in 1858. He formalized his teaching qualifications at [[National Normal University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ohwarren/Places/nnu1893a.htm|title=National Normal University, 1893 Alumnal Roster, Lebanon, Warren County, Ohio|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861 with an ''[[Instructor Normalis]]'' degree.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;Carey (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[Columbus, Ohio]] he married Susan Allan Marple in 1870. The couple had one child, Charles Elwood Mendenhall (1872-1935), teacher and chairman of the Physics Department at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/mendenhall-charles.pdf|title=National Academy of Sciences - Biographical Memoir - Obituary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at a number of schools in [[Ohio]] including [[Central High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Central High School]] in Columbus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/blogs/archives/2014/10/31/dead-body-electricity-spooky-experiment-conducted-by-first-faculty/|title=Dead body + electricity = spooky experiment conducted by first faculty|date=2014-10-31|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining an impressive reputation as a teacher and educator. In 1873, although he lacked conventional academic credentials, he was appointed professor of [[physics]] and mechanics at the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The college ultimately became [[The Ohio State University]],&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt; Mendenhall being the first member of the original faculty.&lt;ref name="wosu1"&gt;[http://www.wosu.org/archive/horseshoe/men.htm] The Birth of Ohio Stadium&lt;/ref&gt; He was later awarded the first ever honorary Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in 1878.&lt;ref name="wosu1" /&gt;

[[File:ThomasCMendenhallwithStudentsJapan1880.jpg|left|thumb|Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, the first Physics teacher in Tokyo, Japan with his interpreter Kikuchi (right) and grad students {{circa|1880}}.]]
In 1878,&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt; on the recommendation of [[Edward S. Morse]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Self Styled Genius: The Life of Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|last=Drew|first=Sybil|date=2016-11-15|publisher=Jan &amp; Brooklyn|isbn=9780692790571|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was recruited to help the modernization of [[Meiji Era]] [[Japan]] as one of the ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' (hired foreigners), serving as visiting professor of physics at [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. In connection with this appointment, he founded a [[meteorology|meteorological]] observatory to make systematic observations during his residence in Japan. From measurements using a [[Kater's pendulum]] of the force of [[gravity]] at the sea level and at the summit of [[Mount Fuji]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2011/06/o-yatoi-who-weighed-earth.html|title=One Hundred Mountains: The o-yatoi who weighed the earth|last=Hyakumeizan|first=Project|date=2011-06-26|website=One Hundred Mountains|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendenhall deduced a value for the mass of the Earth that agreed closely with estimates that [[Francis Baily]] had made in [[England]] by another method. He also made a series of elaborate measurements of the wavelengths of the solar spectrum by means of a large [[spectrometer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also became interested in [[earthquake]]s while in Japan, and was one of the founders of the [[Seismological Society of Japan]] (SSJ).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During his time in Japan, he also gave public lectures on various scientific topics to general audiences in temples and in theaters.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

Returning to Ohio in 1881, Mendenhall was instrumental in developing the Ohio State Meteorological Service. He devised a system of weather signals for display on railroad trains. This method became general throughout the United States and Canada.

[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|Mendenhall Gravimeter Pendulums]]
He became professor at the [[U.S. Signal Corps]] in 1884, introducing of systematic observations of [[lightning]], and investigating methods for determining ground temperatures. He was the first to establish stations in the United States for the systematic observation of earthquake phenomena. Resigning in 1886, Mendenhall took up the presidency of the [[Rose Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] before becoming superintendent of the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1889. During his time as superintendent, he issued the [[Mendenhall Order]] and oversaw the consequent transition of the United States's [[weights and measures]] from the customary system, based on that of [[Imperial unit|England]], to the [[metric system]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mendenhall remained a strong proponent for the official adoption of the metric system all his life. Also, as superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he was also responsible for defining the exact national boundary between [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]]. The [[Mendenhall Valley]] and [[Mendenhall Glacier|Glacier]] in [[Juneau, Alaska]] was named for him in 1892.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mendenhall invented the portable Mendenhall [[Gravimeter]] in 1890 while he was superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and at that time it provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local [[gravitational field]] of the Earth. The gravimeters were used at over 340 survey stations across the US and around the world including [[Germany]], [[Holland]], [[Java]], [[Philippines]], [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Bahamas]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Panama]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. The swing of the [[pendulum]] was more regular than the most accurate clocks of the era, and as the "world's best clock" it was used by [[Albert A. Michelson]] to measure the [[speed of light]], for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/michelson-bio.html|title=Albert A. Michelson - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early model of the original 1890s Mendenhall Gravimeter is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1029662|title=Mendenhall Gravity Pendulums|website=National Museum of American History|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendenhall was appointed president of the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] from 1894 until 1901, when he emigrated to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt; He returned to the United States in 1912. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The Ohio State University in 1919 and is remembered for his successful efforts to close the College of Homeopathic Medicine and his unsuccessful effort to limit the capacity of [[Ohio Stadium]] to 45,000 seats, contending that it would never be able to fill to its design capacity of 63,000 seats.&lt;ref name="wosu1"/&gt; He continued to serve as a trustee until his death at [[Ravenna, Ohio]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

His portrait is currently part of the Smithsonian Institution [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npgportraits.si.edu/eMuseumNPG/code/emuseum.asp?rawsearch=ObjectID/,/is/,/35167/,/false/,/false&amp;newprofile=CAP&amp;newstyle=single|title=National Portrait Gallery - Mendenhall Portrait|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted by his former pupil Annie Ware Sabine Siebert, who was the first recipient of a [[Master of Arts]] degree from The Ohio State University in 1886, and one of the first women to earn an [[architecture]] degree from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1888.[https://library.osu.edu/buckeye-stroll/locations/siebert-hall] A portrait by famous artist and Columbus, Ohio native [[George Bellows]] was commissioned by The Ohio State University in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvallison.com/WorkDetail.aspx?w=238&amp;b=http://hvallison.com/Era.aspx%3Fs%3D1913%26e%3D1913%26si%3D0|title=DR.

== Work on stylometry==
In 1887 Mendenhall published one of the earliest attempts at [[stylometry]], the quantitative analysis of writing style.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall (1887)&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by a suggestion made by the English mathematician [[Augustus de Morgan]] in 1851, Mendenhall attempted to characterize the style of different authors through the [[frequency distribution]] of words of various lengths. In this article Mendenhall mentioned the possible relevance of this technique to the [[Shakespeare authorship question]], and several years later the idea was picked up by a supporter of the [[Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship|theory]] that [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was the true author of the works usually attributed to Shakespeare. He paid for a team of two people to undertake the counting required, but the results did not appear to support the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall (1901) p.104&lt;/ref&gt; It has however since been shown by Williams that Mendenhall failed to take into account genre differences that could invalidate that particular conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, in 1901 Mendenhall also had works by [[Christopher Marlowe]] analysed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Ornes, Science Writer |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/25/7619.full |title=www.pnas.org |publisher=www.pnas.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of the [[Marlovian theory of Shakespearean authorship]] eagerly upon his finding that "in the characteristic curve of his plays Christopher Marlowe agrees with Shakespeare about as well as Shakespeare agrees with himself."&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall (1901) p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Uchinoura Space Center'''|内之浦宇宙空間観測所|Uchinoura Uchū Kūkan Kansokusho}} is a space launch facility close to the [[Japan]]ese town of [[Kimotsuki, Kagoshima|Kimotsuki]], in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. Before the establishment of the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] space agency in 2003, it was simply called the {{nihongo|'''Kagoshima Space Center'''|鹿児島宇宙空間観測所}}. All Japan's scientific satellites were launched from Uchinoura prior to the [[M-V]] launch vehicles being decommissioned in 2006. It continues to be used for suborbital launches, and has also been used for the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] orbital launch vehicle. Additionally, the center has antennas for communication with interplanetary space probes.

==History==
Established in February 1962, the Kagoshima Space Center (KSC) was constructed on the Pacific coast of [[Kagoshima]] Prefecture at [[Uchinoura, Kagoshima|Uchinoura]] for the purpose of launching large rockets with probe payloads. Prior to establishment of KSC, test launches of the [[Pencil Rocket]], [[Baby Rocket]] and [[Kappa Rocket]] had been performed at the pioneering Akita rocket test facility ([[Michikawa]]) from the mid-1950s to the 1960s. However, progress in rocket development and larger launch vehicles required a site with more expansive down range than the narrow [[Sea of Japan]]. After consideration of various candidate sites, Uchinoura in Kagoshima Prefecture, fronting the Pacific Ocean, was selected. At 31° 15' north latitude and 131° 05' east longitude, and situated in hilly terrain, the site at first glance does not appear to be exceptional; however, landscape engineering resulted in a launch facility which maximizes the unique terrain features of the site.

Subsequent to the so-called [[Baby Rocket]], launch vehicles developed by Japan have been given names from the [[Greek alphabet]], i.e. Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Omega, Lambda, and Mu. Although some Greek letters have been skipped due to project termination, the progression to Mu has been one of larger and more sophisticated rockets.

Launch test efforts at KSC with regard to the [[Kappa (rocket)|Kappa]], [[Lambda (rocket family)|Lambda]] and Lambda-4 rockets set the stage for small satellite missions. At the same time, the [[Mu (rocket family)|Mu]] program of large rockets was pursued. After four launch failures, an engineering test satellite was successfully put into orbit aboard a Lambda 4S-5 rocket. The satellite [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]] (named after a peninsula in Kagoshima Prefecture) marked Japan's first successful satellite launch. Subsequent improvements in the Mu class rocket enabled scientific satellite launches at a rate of one per year. Development of the new generation [[M-V]] rocket resulted in successful launch of the scientific satellite MUSES-B ([[HALCA]]) in February 1997.

The first launch of the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] rocket, of a small scientific satellite [[SPRINT-A]], was performed at 14:00 JST, 14 September 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7216">The '''wedge prism''' is a [[prism (optics)|prism]] with a shallow [[angle]] between its input and output surfaces. This angle is usually 3 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or less. [[Refraction]] at the surfaces causes the prism to deflect light by a fixed angle. When viewing a scene through such a prism, objects will appear to be offset by an amount that varies with their distance from the prism.

==Deflection angle==
{{details|Prism (optics)}}
For a wedge prism in air, [[ray (optics)|rays]] of light passing through the prism are deflected by the angle &amp;delta;, which is approximately given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \approx (n - 1) \alpha\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the [[index of refraction]] of the prism material, and &amp;alpha; is the angle between the prism's surfaces.

==Applications==
The term "optical wedge" refers to any shallow angle between two plane surfaces of a window. This wedge may range from a few millionths of a degree of perfect parallelism to as much as three degrees of angle. Even though high-precision optics, such as [[optical flats]], may be lapped and polished to extremely high levels of parallelism, nearly all optics with parallel faces have some slight wedge. This margin of error is usually listed in [[Minute of arc|minutes]] or [[Second of arc|seconds of arc]]. Windows manufactured with an intentional wedge are often referred to as wedge prisms, and typically come with wedge angles of one, two, or three degrees. Many applications exist for wedge prisms, including laser-beam steering, rangefinding and variable focusing.

===Beam steering===
A pair of wedge prisms, called a [[Risley prism]] pair, can be used for [[beam steering]]. In this case, rotating one wedge in relation to the other will change the direction of the beam. When the wedges angle in the same direction, the angle of the refracted beam becomes greater. When the wedges are rotated  to angle in opposite directions, they cancel each other out, and the beam is allowed to pass straight through.

Moving a wedge either closer or farther away from the laser can also be used to steer the beam. When the wedge is moved closer to the target (farther away from the laser), the refracted beam will move across the target. When two wedges in opposite directions slide relative to each other they can be used to provide variable focusing for cameras, allowing objects at vastly different distances to be photographed, in focus, at the same focal plane. This method is common in aerial or  space launch-vehicle photography, when the distance to the object is changing very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;''Mounting Optics in Optical Instruments'' By Paul R. Yoder -- SaPIE 2008 Page 246--249&lt;/ref&gt; Wedges were sometimes used in [[rangefinding]], by combining the image formed by one telescope with the image formed by another.&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Optics and Optical Instruments'' By Fred A. Carson -- dover Publications 1969 Page AJ-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedge prism is primarily used in a similar manner as an [[angle gauge]] in variable-radius plot sampling. In this type of sampling, the wedge prism is used to estimate basal area of a group of trees by counting trees which are "in" or "out" of a plot centered on a single point. Because the wedge prism refracts light to offset the object of interest (e.g. a tree), it can be used to determine whether or not the tree should be counted from a given point, based on the [[diameter at breast height]] of the tree and its distance from that point.

In this type of sampling, the prism is held a comfortable distance away from the eye with the bottom edge parallel to the ground, and trees are sighted through the prism approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;ft. above the ground. A tree is an "in" tree if the offset section of the tree overlaps the bole as viewed without the prism (Figure 1). A tree where the offset section of the trunk is perfectly aligned with the original bole is a [[borderline tree]] (Figure 2) and DBH must be measured to determine if it should be counted (or, more commonly in practice, every other borderline tree is counted). A tree where the offset section of the tree does not overlap or touch the original bole is an "out" tree (Figure 3) and is not counted.

Basal area is estimated by multiplying the count of "in" trees at a given point by the 'factor' of the prism. Prism factor is based on the angle of the prism, and prisms are available in different factors, expressed in both square feet/acre (5, 10, 20 BAF are most common) and square meters/hectare (1-5 BAF are common). Prism size is chosen to yield a statistically valid estimate of basal area - 6-10 "in" trees per plot are required, which requires a prism of the proper factor depending on the size of the trees being cruised. Larger trees will be "in" from further away, and a larger factor prism (20 or 30&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ac, 5–8 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ha) can be used. Smaller trees will be "out" in a larger factor prism unless they are very close, and consequently a smaller factor prism must be used.

Importantly, the bottom edge of the prism must be roughly parallel to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in [[forestry]] today because the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center,&lt;ref&gt;Avery, Eugene Thomas; Burkhart, E. Harold. 2002. ''Forest Measurements'' 5th Edition. McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking [[forest inventory]] are [[clinometer]]s, [[Biltmore stick]]s, [[relascope]]s, and [[Diameter Tape]]s.

A wedge prism can also be used with a target placed at plot center, to establish fixed radius plots. In this function, the size of the target is carefully calibrated to the desired plot size, and the plot is defined as all the area in which the target is "in" as viewed through the prism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/24888 Comparison of combinations of sighting devices and target objects for establishing circular plots in the field&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
