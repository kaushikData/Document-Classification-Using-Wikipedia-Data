'''''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''''', also known as '''''A.I.''''', is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], co-written by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], and based on the 1969 short story "[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. It was co-produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Bonnie Curtis]], and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.

Development of ''A.I.'' originally began with producer-director [[Stanley Kubrick]], after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in protracted [[development (film)|development]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay.

''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' divided critics, with the overall balance being positive, and grossed approximately $235 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (by [[John Williams]]). In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, the film was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=31 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In the late 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]], and [[New York City|New York]] and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thought and emotion, have been created.

David, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin, after contracting a rare disease, has been placed in [[suspended animation]] and not expected to recover. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that belonged to Martin.

Martin is cured of his disease and brought home. As he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He tricks David into entering the parents's bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of Monica's hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears David intended to injure them.

At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating David's self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. Instead, she abandons David and Teddy in the forest. She warns David to avoid all humans, and tells him to find other unregistered Mecha who can protect him.

David is captured for an anti-Mecha "Flesh Fair", where obsolete, unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is placed on a platform with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. Before the pair can be destroyed with acid, the crowd, thinking David is a real boy, begins booing and throwing things at the show's emcee. In the chaos, David and Joe escape. They set out to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]], whom David remembers from ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and who David believes can turn him into a real boy, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.

Joe and David make their way to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]]. There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. He then meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David. David finds more copies of him, as well as female versions called Darlene, that have been made there.

Disheartened, David lets himself fall from a ledge of the building. He is rescued by Joe, flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater, and wants to go down to meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities, who snare him with an [[electromagnet]]. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to dive down to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue at the now-sunken [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. David repeatedly asks the Fairy to turn him into a real boy. Eventually the ocean freezes and David's power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humans are extinct, and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced silicon-based form called Specialists. They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans, making them special.

The Specialists revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David's memories to reconstruct the Swinton home. David asks the Specialists if they can make him human, but they cannot. However, he insists they recreate Monica from [[DNA]] from the lock of her hair, which Teddy has kept. The Mecha warn David that the clone can live for only a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.

==Production==

===Development===
Kubrick began development on an adaptation of "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a [[film treatment]]. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Scott Brake |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |title=Spielberg Talks About the Genesis of ''A.I.'' |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N3Xvgw8?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to co-finance ''A.I.'' and cover distribution duties.&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]], and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.&lt;ref name=connect&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steven Gaydos |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |title=The Kubrick Connection |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N47xlcn?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Shaw]] briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' for inspiration, calling ''A.I.'' "a [[picaresque]] robot version of ''[[Pinocchio]]''".&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Dana Haris |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |title=Spielberg lines up ''A.I.'', ''Report'' |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N4NHRKf?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on ''A.I.'' in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the [[toyetic|kiddie market]]."&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped ''A.I.'' to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', feeling [[computer animation]] was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of ''A.I.'' would begin in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Christian Moerk |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |title=''A.I.'' next for Kubrick at Warners |date=November 2, 1993 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N6Bv8HO?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Muren]] and Ned Gorman, who worked on ''Jurassic Park'', became [[visual effects supervisor]]s,&lt;ref name=connect/&gt; but Kubrick was displeased with their [[previsualization]], and with the expense of hiring [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in [[pre-production]] with [[Christopher "Fangorn" Baker]] as [[concept art]]ist, and [[Sara Maitland]] assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus".&lt;ref name=Ian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-03 |title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-18 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cunningham]] became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for ''A.I.'' can be seen on the DVD, ''[[The Work of Director Chris Cunningham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature by Matt Bailey |url=http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719222500/http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=notcoming.com &amp;#124; The Work of Director Chris Cunningham |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had [[Joseph Mazzello]] do a [[screen test]] for the lead role.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Cunningham helped assemble a series of "little robot-type humans" for the David character. "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," producer Jan Harlan reflected. "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [[Hans Moravec]] was brought in as a technical consultant.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;
Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought ''A.I.'' would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117799373 |title=A.I.

The film's [[soundtrack]] was released by [[Warner Sunset Records]] in 2001. The original [[Film score|score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and featured singers [[Lara Fabian]] on two songs and [[Josh Groban]] on one.

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. used an [[alternate reality game]] titled ''[[The Beast (game)|The Beast]]'' to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] that followed the storyline of ''The Beast'', but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking ''A.I.'' for a [[family film]], no action figures were created, although [[Hasbro]] released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.&lt;ref name=find/&gt;

''A.I.'' had its [[premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=David|title='Dust' in the wind for Venice fest|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|website=Variety|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2017-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030032135/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|archivedate=October 30, 2008|date=April 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on March 5, 2002 in both a standard full-screen release with no bonus features, and as a 2-Disc Special Edition featuring the film in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format as well as an eight-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]], two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s original storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/a-i-artificial-intelligence|title=A.I.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on April 5, 2011 by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] for the U.S. and by [[Warner Home Video]] for international markets.

===Critical response===
Based on 192 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 73% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism.

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE &amp;#124; The mind behind AI |work=BBC News |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,130942,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072644/http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0%2C8599%2C130942%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=''A.I.''&amp;nbsp;– Spielberg's Strange Love&amp;nbsp;– ''TIME'' |date=June 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars, saying that it was "wonderful and maddening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/ai-artificial-intelligence-2001 |title=A.I.

[[Mick LaSalle]] gave a largely negative review. "''A.I.'' exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless" [[Jar Jar Binks]], yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/29/DD239232.DTL |title=Artificial foolishness |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67p5z3LQ2?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F29%2FDD239232.DTL |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Peter Travers]] gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future."

In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/ai.html |title=Review: A.I |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] has speculated, "Worldwide, ''A.I.'' was very successful (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the [[alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]-style beings in the final 20 minutes were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |title=Author Talk: Ian Watson |publisher=Moon Milk Review |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67nCJehg6?url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic [[Joe Leydon]] that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film&amp;nbsp;– all the stuff in the house&amp;nbsp;– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of ''A.I.'', not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Leydon |url=http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |title='Minority Report' looks at the day after tomorrow&amp;nbsp;-- and is relevant to today &lt;!-- Apparently accidental typos in quoted refs should be "silently" repaired. --&gt; |work=Moving Picture Show |date=June 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815010940/http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P. ''After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989–2007''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salih|first1=Sara|title=Judth Butler|date=2002|page=63|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">Wageningen UR (University &amp; Research centre) has constructed '''AlgaePARC''' (Algae Production And Research Centre) at the Wageningen Campus{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The goal of AlgaePARC is to fill the gap between fundamental research on [[algae]] and full-scale algae production facilities. This will be done by setting up flexible pilot scale facilities to perform applied research and obtain direct practical experience. It is a joined initiative of [http://www.bpe.wur.nl BioProcess Engineering] and [http://www.fbr.wur.nl Food &amp; Biobased Research] of the [http://www.wur.nl Wageningen University].

'''AlgaePARC facility'''
AlgaePARC uses four different [[photobioreactors]] comprising 24 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ground surface: an open pond, two types of tubular reactors and a plastic film bioreactor, and a number of smaller systems for the testing of new technologies. This facility is unique, because it is the first facility in which the productivity of four different production systems can be compared during the year under identical conditions. At the same time, knowledge is gained for the development of new photobioreactors and the design of systems on a production scale.
For the construction of the facility 2.25 M€  has been made available by the [http://www.minlnv.nl/ Ministry of Agriculture], Nature and Food Quality (1.5 M€) and the [http://www.gelderland.nl/ Provincie Gelderland] (0.75 M€).

'''Microalgae'''
[[Microalgae]] are currently seen by some persons as a promising source of [[biodiesel]] and chemical building blocks, which can be used in paint and plastics.&lt;ref&gt;René H. Wijffels, Maria J. Barbosa. An Outlook on Microalgal Biofuels. ''Science'', 2010; 329 (5993): 796 {{doi|10.1126/science.1189003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] from algae offers a sustainable alternative to products and fuels from the [[petrochemical industry]]. When fully developed this contributes to a biobased economy as algae help to reduce the emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and make the economy less dependent on [[fossil fuels]].

'''AlgaePARC research'''
The costs of biomass produced from algae for biofuels are still ten times too high to be able to compete with today’s other fuels. Within the business community, the question being asked is how it could be produced more cheaply, making it economically viable. Companies within the energy, food, oil and chemical sectors, the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature &amp; Food Quality, the Provincial Government of Gelderland, Oost NV and Wageningen UR are all working together in or contributing to the algae research centre AlgaePARC in order to answer that question.

Virtual NanoLab is developed and sold commercially by QuantumWise A/S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumwise.com/ QuantumWise acquired the products from Atomistix]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
With its graphical interface, Virtual NanoLab provides a user-friendly approach to atomic-scale modeling. The software contains a set of interactive instruments that allows the user to design [[Nanotechnology|nanosystems]], to set up and execute numerical calculations, and to visualize the results.
Samples such as [[molecules]], [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[crystal|crystalline systems]], and two-probe systems (i.e. a nanostructure coupled to two electrodes) are built with a few mouse clicks. 

Virtual NanoLab contains a 3D visualization tool, the Nanoscope, where atomic geometries and computed results can be viewed and analyzed. One can for example plot [[Bloch wave|Bloch functions]] of nanotubes and [[crystal]]s, [[molecular orbital]]s, [[electron density|electron densities]], and effective potentials. 
The numerical engine that carries out the actual simulations is [[Atomistix ToolKit]], which combines [[density functional theory]] and non-equilibrium [[Green's functions]] to [[ab initio]] electronic-structure and transport calculations. Atomistix ToolKit is developed from the academic codes TranSIESTA&lt;ref&gt;Brandbyge, Mozos, Ordejón, Taylor, and Stokbro, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.165401 "Density-functional method for non-equilibrium electron transport"], Physical Review B 65, 165401 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and McDCal.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Guo, and Wang, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.63.245407 "Ab initio modeling of quantum transport properties of molecular electronic devices"], Physical Review B 63, 245407 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 161 feet long and weighing at 1,450 tons, the Aurora Simulator was the first gamma radiation simulator of its size in the world at the time. It was also one of only four large machines in the United States that were built specifically to test complete nuclear weapons packages, with the other three being the Hermes I to III simulators at [[Sandia Base]], New Mexico. Situated at the [[Harry Diamond Laboratories]] (which later became a part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]]) in Adelphi, Maryland, it was used to test complete weapons electronics packages from the warheads of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]] to satellites. After more than 20 years of use during the Cold War, the Aurora Simulator was officially decommissioned and disassembled in 1996.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1986, the Aurora facility set the world record for the largest amount of high-power microwave power generated from a virtual cathode oscillator. As a result, HDL was recognized by the [[American Defense Preparedness Association|American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA)]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=history+of+army+research+lab+aurora&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimr4371OfbAhWRtlkKHSmZA8AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
Following the use of the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]] in World War II, studies on flash radiography found that field emission flash x-rays, which were previously used to analyze explosions, could simulate radiation from a nuclear bomb. Given this realization, the U.S. military began to prioritize the development of flash x-ray machines to test parts of missile packages during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

After the Soviet Union demonstrated the use of the world’s first [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic missiles (ABM)]] in 1964, DASA launched a series of projects in response that aimed to hasten the advancement of nuclear effects laboratories in the United States. The U.S. military was concerned that the introduction and subsequent nuclear explosion of Soviet AMBs into the airspace would increase the likelihood of the resulting radiation interfering with the electronics systems of inbound U.S. ICBMs. In order to [[Radiation hardening|thoroughly harden]] U.S. missiles, DASA initiated the construction of the Aurora Simulator as well as a full-threat level facility that engaged in gamma radiation testing and missile refinement in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When selecting the site for the Aurora facility, DASA wanted the gamma radiation simulator to be situated at an existing military laboratory. After much deliberation between the [[Air Force Weapons Laboratory|Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL)]] in New Mexico and the Army and Navy laboratories in the Washington, D.C. area, DASA chose the latter and granted the Harry Diamond Laboratory (HDL) the responsibility of operating the facility. In order to house the Aurora Simulator, HDL moved from its downtown Washington, D.C. site to an area of land in White Oak, Maryland, which would eventually become the now-present Adelphi.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The cooperation between DASA and HDL on the Aurora project led to many HDL researchers becoming involved in the simulator’s development, including assistant to DASA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Peter Haas and former participant in the Manhattan Project Paul Caldwell, who later was placed in charge of the Aurora Simulator. In turn, Caldwell hired physicist Alexander Stewart from Ion Physics (IP) and HDL’s Robert Lamb and Dennis Whittaker, the four of whom (including Caldwell) made up the bulk of the research and development team for the Aurora project. The construction of the Aurora Simulator was completed on January 1971, costing about $16 million, and the first test was conducted on the Spartan ABM flight control set in April 1972. Throughout its entire run at HDL, which ended in 1995, the Aurora Simulator conducted 287 numbered tests, resulting in more than 9,100 test shots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Operation ==
The Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator consisted of four 14 MV [[Marx generator|Marx generators]], each of which contained four parallel 1.25 MJ units connected together to drive four parallel oil-dielectric [[Blumlein generator|Blumlein pulse-forming lines (PFLs)]]. Each PFL was coupled with an [[Electron-beam processing|E-beam]] diode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Aurora Simulator emitted four short pulses of high energy bremsstrahlung radiation that overlapped to deliver a single 120 ns wide pulse of 20 to 50 krads (Si) into a 1m cube. It could also deliver 25 krads (Si) throughout a 1m diameter and 1m long cylindrical volume or 50 krads (Si) throughout a 25cm sphere. What made the Aurora Simulator unique was its ability to provide an extremely high volumetric dose output. Due to this large irradiation volume, dose measurements ranged up to 200 locations within a single electronics system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in order to obtain the desired radiation levels, all four 8-MeV, 230-kA bremsstrahlung pulses had to overlay within 10 ns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=George|last2=Scharf|first2=William|last3=Spohn|first3=Daniel|date=October 1982|title=Use of the AURORA Flash X-Ray Machine as a Source-Region EMP Simulator and Antenna Coupling Analysis Facility|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA122024|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synchronization was made possible by the symmetrization of the four Blumleins.

There were two main limitations to the operation of the Aurora Simulator. First, the long discharge time of the Blumeins often hindered the extraction of the bremsstrahlung pulses. Second, the high internal impedance of the Blumeins made them rather inefficient for energy transfer to low impedance loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander|last2=Huttlin|first2=George|date=February 1979|title=Design Study for an AURORA Modification Leading to a 100-Terawatt Nuclear Weapon Radiation Simulator|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA071339|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was first described by [[William Bateson]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=William|title=Heredity and variation in modern lights|journal=Darwin and Modern Science|year=1909|pages=85–101|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511693953.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; then independently described by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |title=Studies on Hybrid Sterility.

The model states that genetic incompatibility is most likely evolved by alternative fixation of two or more loci instead of just one, so that when hybridization occurs, it is the first time for some of the alleles to co-occur in the same individual. For example, imagine two populations that only recently separated geographically. Both sides are starting with the same genotype ''AABB''. One population can then evolve to ''aaBB'', through the transition state ''AaBB'', while the other evolves to ''AAbb'', through the transition state ''AABb''. During these processes, ''a'' allele will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, and ''b'' will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, without fitness consequences. When hybridization occurs, it is the first time ''a'' and ''b'' alleles co-occur, and they are the alleles that are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution|author=[[Douglas J.

The '''Bennett House''' is a recording studio located on 4th Avenue North in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. 

Built in 1875, the two-story building has served as a residence, a clothing store and, starting in 1980, a recording studio used by many popular music artists when recording in Tennessee. Artists that have frequently recorded at the studio include 1970's [[rock and roll]] producer [[Norbert Putnam]] ([[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Dusty Springfield]]), [[country music]] producer [[Bob Montgomery (musician)|Bob Montgomery]] ([[Joe Diffie]], [[Waylon Jennings]]), producer [[Keith Thomas (producer)|Keith Thomas]] ([[Amy Grant]], [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], [[Selena]], [[98 Degrees]]). Thomas would even have one of the two studios in the building named after him when "Studio A" became known as "The Thomas Room." Other artists to use the studio include [[Phil Keaggy]], [[Randy Stonehill]] and [[Chagall Guevara]]. In the early 1990s, Montgomery produced acts such as Joe Diffie, Doug Stone, Jo-El Sonnier, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Willie Nelson, Vince Gill and many, many others.

Gene Eichelberger, Audio Engineer probably most known for recording Dobie Gray's "Drift Away", engineered many of these sessions on a Studer A800 24 track analog machine with Bob Montgomery.

The Bennett House Recording Studios ceased all tracking and mixing operations on July 1, 2008.

==History==
The house is named after [[Walter James Bennett]], a soldier serving in the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. For a time, Bennett served on the staff of Major General [[William H. C. Whiting|William Whiting]] until he was captured in Virginia in 1864. Bennett spent the remainder of the Civil War in prison at [[Fort Donelson]], [[Tennessee]] until his release in 1865. In 1872, Bennett purchased the lot on Indigo Street, which was later renamed 4th Avenue North, where the Bennett House is located. The Home remained in the Bennett family until 1967 when its ownership passed onto someone outside of the family for the first time in ninety-two years.

It still stands at 134 4th Avenue North in Franklin, TN as a stately Victorian Mansion some believe to be haunted by the ghosts of Walter James Bennett and his second wife Elizabeth.  This Historic home was twice home to "Porch Jam", a summer music festival for musicians of varying genre who came from throughout the country to participate.  This festival was presented by Signpost Records (Randall G. Hayward &amp; Cory Hayward) and sponsored primarily by Our House Crafts (Lisa Hayward, Glass Painter).

'''Causation in Sciences Project''' ('''CauSci''') is a 4-year interdisciplinary research project on the field of [[Causality|causation]] in the [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]], funded by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] (NFR) and hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073703/http://www.umb.no/ior-en School of Economics and Business] at the [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (NMBU).

[[Causality]] is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is [[Philosophy|philosophers]] who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.

[http://www.umb.no/causci/article/about-causci CauSci] is based on a [[Disposition (philosophy)|dispositional]] theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as [[Event (philosophy)|event]] that disposes towards an [[result|effect or outcome]]. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely [[Reductionism]] versus [[holism]] in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of [[Subatomic particle|subatomic particles.]] But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers’ fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new [[causality|causal powers]] emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified.

The project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/people Norwegian and international] researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.

== Methodology ==
The methodological basis of the project is that [[philosophy]] should not dictate to [[science]] and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and [[empirically]] satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete.

Four central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/causal-dispositionalism causal dispositionalist] hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.

== History ==

Consed was originally developed as a contig editing and finishing tool for large-scale cosmid shotgun sequencing in the [[Human Genome Project]]. At genome sequencing centers, Consed was used to check assemblies generated by [[phrap]], solve assembly problems like those caused by highly identical repeats, and finishing tasks like primer picking and gap closure. 
Development of Consed has continued after the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]]. Current Consed versions support very large projects with millions of reads, enabling the use with newer sequencing methods like [[454 Life Sciences|454 sequencing]] and [[Solexa]] sequencing. Consed also has advanced tools for finishing tasks like automated primer picking &lt;ref name="Gordon2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon D,  Desmarais C, Green P  |title=Automated Finishing with Autofinish |journal= Genome Research |volume=11 |pages=614–625 |year=2001 |pmid=11282977 |issue=4 |doi=10.1101/gr.171401 |pmc=311035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2569">The '''dead mother complex''' is a clinical condition described by [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|Andre Green]] involving an early and destructive identification with the figure of a 'dead' – or rather depressed and emotionally unavailable – mother.

==Complex/syndrome==
Green introduced the concept in an essay written in 1980, published in 1983, and translated into English in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. 'The dead mother', in ''On Private Madness'', London: Hogarth Press, 1986, pp. 142-173. Translated by Katherine Aubertin from 'La mère morte', ''Narcissisme de vie, narcissisme de mort'', Éditions de Minuit, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the dead mother complex as involving a mother who was initially emotionally engaged with her child, but who then "switched off" from emotional resonance to emotional detachment, perhaps under the influence of loss and mourning in her own family of origin.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mariotti, ''The Maternal Lineage'' (2012) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact on the child, when it finds itself unable to restore a feeling contact, is the internalisation of a hard unresponsive emotional core, which fosters a destructive form of [[narcissism]],&lt;ref&gt;J. White, ''Generation'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to [[attachment disorder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;P. Shaver, ''Attachment in Adulthood'' (2010) p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals itself as a major resistance to progress in the [[transference]].

Later, writers have argued for differentiating a range of responses within the dead mother complex, reserving the name dead mother syndrome for the most acute form.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bennett ed., ''Montreal 2010'' (2012) p. 1633&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
*The dead mother complex has been seen as underlying both [[Gradiva (novel)|Gradiva]] and Freud's own psychology as seen in ''[[Delusion and Dream in Jensen's Gradiva]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill ''Freud and the Passions'' (2010) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sylvia Plath]] in her writing has been linked to the dead mother complex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3721066/Dead_Mother_Effect_on_a_Daughter Dead Mother Effect on a Daughter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">{{jargon|date=March 2017}}'''Digital morphogenesis''' is a type of generative art in which complex shape development, or [[morphogenesis]], is enabled by computation. This concept is applicable in many areas of design, art, architecture, and modeling.  The concept was originally developed in the field of [[biology]], later in [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[architecture]].  

In [[architecture]], it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko (2000). 'Digital Morphogenesis and Computational Architectures', in ''Proceedings of the 4th Conference of Congreso Iberoamericano de Grafica Digital, SIGRADI 2000 - Construindo (n)o Espaço Digital (Constructing the Digital Space)'', Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 25–28 September 2000, ed. by José Ripper Kós, Andréa Pessoa Borde and Diana Rodriguez Barros, pp. 98-103 [http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/4077.content.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko and [[Ali Malkawi]], eds (2005). ''Performative Architecture: Beyond Instrumentality'' (New York; London: Spon Press), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Neil (2009). 'Digital Morphogenesis', ''Architectural Design'', 79, 1, pp. 32-37
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roudavski"&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009). 'Towards Morphogenesis in Architecture', ''International Journal of Architectural Computing'', 7, 3, pp. 345-374, p. 348 [https://www.academia.edu/208933/Towards_Morphogenesis_in_Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanislav Roudavski describes it as similar to biological morphogenesis: developing gradually, without an explicit definition of the methods of growth or adaptation.  Parallels can be seen in [[emergence|emergent properties]] and [[self-organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

'''Dipole anisotropy''' is a form of [[anisotropy]] and the progressive difference in the [[frequency]] of [[radiation]] from opposite directions due to the motion of the observer relative to the source. As a result of that motion, one end of the 360-degree spectrum is [[doppler effect|redshifted]], whereas the other end is [[doppler effect|blueshifted]]. That effect is notable in measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], due to the motion of [[earth]].

'''Elocution''' is the study of formal speaking in [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], style, and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

==History==
In Western classical [[rhetoric]], elocution was one of the five core disciplines of [[pronunciation]], which was the art of delivering speeches. Orators were trained not only on proper [[diction]], but on the proper use of gestures, stance, and dress. (Another area of rhetoric, [[elocutio]], was unrelated to ''elocution'' and, instead, concerned the style of writing proper to discourse.)

Elocution emerged as a formal discipline during the eighteenth century. One of its important figures was [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], actor and father of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].  Thomas Sheridan's lectures on elocution, collected in ''Lectures on Elocution'' (1762) and his ''Lectures on Reading'' (1775), provided directions for marking and reading aloud passages from literature. Another actor, John Walker, published his two-volume ''Elements of Elocution'' in 1781, which provided detailed instruction on voice control, gestures, pronunciation, and emphasis.

With the publication of these works and similar ones, elocution gained wider public interest. While training on proper speaking had been an important part of private education for many centuries, the rise in the nineteenth century of a middle class in Western countries (and the corresponding rise of public education) led to great interest in the teaching of elocution, and it became a staple of the school curriculum. American students of elocution drew selections from what were popularly deemed "Speakers." By the end of the century, several Speaker texts circulated throughout the United States, including McGuffey's ''New Juvenile Speaker'', the ''Manual of Elocution and Reading'', the ''Star Speaker'', and the popular ''Delsarte Speaker''. Some of these texts even included pictorial depictions of body movements and gestures to augment written descriptions.

The era of the elocution movement, defined by the likes of Sheridan and Walker, evolved in the early and mid-1800's into what is called the scientific movement of elocution, defined in the early period by James Rush's ''The Philosophy of the Human Voice'' (1827) and [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Rhetoric'' (1828), and in the later period by [[Alexander Melville Bell]]'s ''A New Elucidation of Principles of Elocution'' (1849) and ''Visible Speech'' (1867).

In her recent book ''The Elocutionists: Women, Music, and the Spoken Word'' (University of Illinois Press, 2017), [[Marian Wilson Kimber]] addresses the oft-forgotten, female-dominated genre of elocution set to musical accompaniment in the United States.

==Sample curriculum==

An example of this can be seen in the Table of Contents of [[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's ''New Sixth Eclectic Reader'']] of 1857:

:Principles of Elocution
::I. Articulation
::II. Inflections
::III. Accent and Emphasis
::IV. Instructions for Reading Verse
::V. The Voice
::VI. Gesture

[[File:Precisionrecall.svg|thumb|350px|Precision and recall]]
In [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of [[binary classification]], the '''F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score''' (also '''F-score''' or '''F-measure''') is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] ''p'' and the [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]] ''r'' of the test to compute the score: ''p'' is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and ''r'' is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score is the [[harmonic mean|harmonic average]] of the [[precision and recall]], where an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.
== Etymology ==
The name F-measure is believed to be named after a different F function in Van Rijsbergen's book, when introduced to MUC-4. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | last = Sasaki| first = Y. | url=https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/yutaka.sasaki/F-measure-YS-26Oct07.pdf|year = 2007 | title = The truth of the F-measure  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Definition ==
The traditional F-measure or balanced F-score ('''F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score''') is the [[Harmonic mean#Harmonic mean of two numbers|harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:

:&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \left(\frac{\mathrm{recall}^{-1} + \mathrm{precision}^{-1}}{2}\right)^{-1} = 2 \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{\mathrm{precision} + \mathrm{recall}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The general formula for positive real β is:
:&lt;math&gt;F_\beta = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{(\beta^2 \cdot \mathrm{precision}) + \mathrm{recall}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula in terms of [[Type I and type II errors]]:

:&lt;math&gt;F_\beta = \frac {(1 + \beta^2) \cdot \mathrm{true\ positive} }{(1 + \beta^2) \cdot \mathrm{true\ positive} + \beta^2 \cdot \mathrm{false\ negative} + \mathrm{false\ positive}}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Two other commonly used F measures are the &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; measure, which weighs recall higher than precision (by placing more emphasis on false negatives), and the &lt;math&gt;F_{0.5}&lt;/math&gt; measure, which weighs recall lower than precision (by attenuating the influence of false negatives).

The F-measure was derived so that &lt;math&gt;F_\beta&lt;/math&gt; "measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches β times as much importance to recall as precision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Rijsbergen | first = C. J. | url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/Keith/Preface.html|year = 1979 | title = Information Retrieval | edition= 2nd | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[C. J. van Rijsbergen|Van Rijsbergen]]'s effectiveness measure

:&lt;math&gt;E = 1 - \left(\frac{\alpha}{p} + \frac{1-\alpha}{r}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Their relationship is &lt;math&gt;F_\beta = 1 - E&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{1}{1 + \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score is also known as the [[Sørensen–Dice coefficient]] or Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).

== Diagnostic testing ==

This is related to the field of [[binary classification]] where recall is often termed as Sensitivity. There are several reasons that the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score can be criticized in particular circumstances.&lt;ref name=Powers2011 /&gt;

== Applications ==

The F-score is often used in the field of [[information retrieval]] for measuring [[web search|search]], [[document classification]], and [[query classification]] performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | first=Steven M. |last=Beitzel. |citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.634 | title=On Understanding and Classifying Web Queries | degree=Ph.D.  | publisher=IIT | year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier works focused primarily on the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score, but with the proliferation of large scale search engines, performance goals changed to place more emphasis on either precision or recall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=X.

The F-score is also used in [[machine learning]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the evaluation of the [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1119195].&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that the F-measures do not take the true negatives into account, and that measures such as the [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], [[Informedness]] or  [[Cohen's kappa]] may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.&lt;ref name="Powers2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Measure  to ROC, Informedness, Markedness &amp; Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37–63 |url=http://www.bioinfopublication.org/files/articles/2_1_1_JMLT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-score has been widely used in the natural language processing literature, such as the evaluation of [[named entity recognition]] and [[word segmentation]].

[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Molecular diffusion]] from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. Initially, there are [[Solution|solute]] molecules on the left side of a barrier (purple line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container. '''Top''': A single molecule moves around randomly. '''Middle''': With more molecules, there is a clear trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly. '''Bottom''': With an enormous number of solute molecules, randomness becomes undetectable: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. This smooth flow is described by Fick's laws.]]
'''Fick's laws of diffusion''' describe [[diffusion]] and were derived by [[Adolf Fick]] in 1855. They can be used to solve for the [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]], {{mvar|D}}. Fick's first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the [[diffusion equation]].

== Fick's first law ==
'''Fick's first law''' relates the diffusive [[flux]] to the concentration under the assumption of [[steady state]]. It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient. In one (spatial) dimension, the law is:

:&lt;math&gt;J = -D \frac{d \varphi}{d x} &lt;/math&gt;
where
* {{mvar|J}} is the '''diffusion flux''', of which the [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] is [[amount of substance]] per unit area per unit time, so it is expressed in such units as mol&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. {{mvar|J}} measures the amount of substance that will flow through a unit area during a unit time interval.
* {{mvar|D}} is the '''diffusion coefficient''' or '''[[mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]'''. Its dimension is area per unit time, so typical units for expressing it would be m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
* {{mvar|φ}} (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration, of which the dimension is amount of substance per unit volume. It might be expressed in units of mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* {{mvar|x}} is position, the dimension of which is length. It might thus be expressed in the unit m.

{{mvar|D}} is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles, which depends on the temperature, [[viscosity]] of the fluid and the size of the particles according to the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)#Stokes-Einstein equation|Stokes–Einstein relation]]. In dilute aqueous solutions the diffusion coefficients of most ions are similar and have values that at room temperature are in the range of {{val|0.6|-|2|e=-9|u=m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s}}. For biological molecules the diffusion coefficients normally range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.

In two or more dimensions we must use {{math|∇}}, the [[del]] or [[gradient]] operator, which generalises the first derivative, obtaining

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}=- D\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''J'''}} denotes the diffusion flux vector.

The driving force for the one-dimensional diffusion is the quantity {{math|−{{sfrac|∂''φ''|∂''x''}}}}, which for ideal mixtures is the concentration gradient. In chemical systems other than ideal solutions or mixtures, the driving force for diffusion of each species is the gradient of [[chemical potential]] of this species. Then Fick's first law (one-dimensional case) can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = - \frac{D c_i}{RT} \frac{\partial \mu_i}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

where the index {{mvar|i}} denotes the {{mvar|i}}th species, {{mvar|c}} is the concentration (mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), {{mvar|R}} is the [[universal gas constant]] (J/K/mol), {{mvar|T}} is the absolute temperature (K), and {{mvar|μ}} is the chemical potential (J/mol).

If the primary variable is mass fraction ({{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, given, for example, in kg/kg), then the equation changes to:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i=- \rho D\nabla y_i &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the fluid [[density]] (for example, in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Note that the density is outside the [[gradient]] operator.

== Fick's second law ==
'''Fick's second law''' predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with time. It is a [[partial differential equation]] which in one dimension reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = D\,\frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{mvar| &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;}} is the concentration in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;], example mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; {{math|&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; {{=}} &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;(''x'',''t'')}} is a function that depends on location {{mvar|x}} and time {{mvar|t}}
* {{mvar|t}} is time, example s
* {{mvar|D}} is the diffusion coefficient in dimensions of [length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], example m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s
* {{mvar|x}} is the position [length], example m

In two or more dimensions we must use the [[Laplacian]] {{math|Δ {{=}} ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which generalises the second derivative, obtaining the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = D\Delta \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation of Fick's laws==

===Fick's first law===
In one dimension, the following derivation is based on a similar argument made in Berg 1977 (see [[#References|references]]).

Consider a collection of particles performing a random walk in one dimension with length scale {{math|Δ''x''}} and time scale {{math|Δ''t''}}. Let {{math|''N''(''x'',''t'')}} be the number of particles at position {{mvar|x}} at time {{mvar|t}}.

At a given time step, half of the particles would move left and half would move right. Since half of the particles at point {{mvar|x}} move right and half of the particles at point {{math|''x'' + Δ''x''}} move left, the net movement to the right is:

:&lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{1}{2}\bigl[N(x + \Delta x, t) - N(x, t)\bigr]&lt;/math&gt;

The flux, {{mvar|J}}, is this net movement of particles across some area element of area {{mvar|a}}, normal to the random walk during a time interval {{math|Δ''t''}}. Hence we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;J = - \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{ N(x + \Delta x, t)}{a \Delta t} - \frac{ N(x, t)}{a \Delta t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by {{math|(Δ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and rewriting, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt; J = -\frac{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}{2 \Delta t}\left[\frac{N(x + \Delta x, t)}{a \left(\Delta x\right)^2} - \frac{N(x, t)}{a \left(\Delta x\right)^2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Concentration is defined as particles per unit volume, and hence
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (x, t) = \frac{N(x, t)}{a \Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, {{math|{{sfrac|(Δ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2Δ''t''}}}} is the definition of the one-dimensional diffusion constant, {{mvar|D}}. Thus our expression simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt; J = -D \left[\frac{\varphi (x + \Delta x, t)}{\Delta x} - \frac{\varphi (x , t)}{\Delta x}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit where {{math|Δ''x''}} is infinitesimal, the right-hand side becomes a space derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; J = - D \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Fick's second law===
Fick's second law can be derived from Fick's first law and the [[mass conservation]] in absence of any chemical reactions:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}J = 0\Rightarrow\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(D\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\varphi\right)\,=0&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the diffusion coefficient {{mvar|D}} to be a constant, one can exchange the orders of the differentiation and multiply by the constant:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(D\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \varphi\right) = D\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \varphi = D\frac{\partial^2\varphi}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and, thus, receive the form of the Fick's equations as was stated above.

For the case of diffusion in two or more dimensions Fick's second law becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

which is analogous to the [[heat equation]].

If the diffusion coefficient is not a constant, but depends upon the coordinate or concentration, Fick's second law yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} =  \nabla \cdot (D\nabla\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

An important example is the case where {{math|'''φ'''}} is at a steady state, i.e. the concentration does not change by time, so that the left part of the above equation is identically zero. In one dimension with constant {{mvar|D}}, the solution for the concentration will be a linear change of concentrations along {{mvar|x}}. In two or more dimensions we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2\varphi =0&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Laplace's equation]], the solutions to which are referred to by mathematicians as [[harmonic functions]].

==Derivation==
Fick's second law is a special case of the [[convection–diffusion equation]] in which there is no [[advection|advective flux]] and no net volumetric source. It can be derived from the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{j} = R, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''j'''}} is the total [[flux]] and {{mvar|R}} is a net volumetric source for {{math|'''φ'''}}. The only source of flux in this situation is assumed to be '''diffusive flux''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_{\text{diffusion}} = -D \nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging the definition of diffusive flux to the continuity equation and assuming there is no source ({{math|''R'' {{=}} 0}}), we arrive at Fick's second law:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If flux were the result of both '''diffusive flux''' and [[advection|advective flux]], the [[convection–diffusion equation]] is the result.

===Example solution in one dimension: diffusion length===

A simple case of diffusion with time {{mvar|t}} in one dimension (taken as the {{mvar|x}}-axis) from a boundary located at position {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, where the concentration is maintained at a value {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is

:&lt;math&gt;n \left(x,t \right)=n_0 \mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

where {{math|erfc}} is the complementary [[error function]]. This is the case when corrosive gases diffuse through the oxidative layer towards the metal surface (if we assume that concentration of gases in the environment is constant and the diffusion space – that is, the corrosion product layer – is ''semi-infinite'', starting at 0 at the surface and spreading infinitely deep in the material). If, in its turn, the diffusion space is ''infinite'' (lasting both through the layer with {{math|''n''(''x'',0) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}} and that with {{math|''n''(''x'',0) {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x'' ≤ 0}}), then the solution is amended only with coefficient {{sfrac|2}} in front of {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (as the diffusion now occurs in both directions). This case is valid when some solution with concentration {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is put in contact with a layer of pure solvent. (Bokstein, 2005) The length {{math|2{{sqrt|''Dt''}}}} is called the ''diffusion length'' and provides a measure of how far the concentration has propagated in the {{mvar|x}}-direction by diffusion in time {{mvar|t}} (Bird, 1976).

As a quick approximation of the error function, the first 2 terms of the Taylor series can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;n \left(x,t \right)=n_0 \left[ 1 - 2 \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt\pi}}\right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|D}} is time-dependent, the diffusion length becomes
:&lt;math&gt; 2\sqrt{\int_0^{t}D\tau \,d\tau}. &lt;/math&gt;.
This idea is useful for estimating a diffusion length over a heating and cooling cycle, where {{mvar|D}} varies with temperature.

===Generalizations===

* In ''non-homogeneous media'', the diffusion coefficient varies in space, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''D''(''x'')}}. This dependence does not affect Fick's first law but the second law changes:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi(x,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot \bigl(D(x) \nabla \varphi(x,t)\bigr)=D(x) \Delta \varphi(x,t)+\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial D(x)}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial \varphi(x,t)}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

* In ''[[anisotropic]] media'', the diffusion coefficient depends on the direction. It is a symmetric [[tensor]] {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Fick's first law changes to
::&lt;math&gt;J=-D \nabla \varphi &lt;/math&gt;,
:it is the product of a tensor and a vector:
::&lt;math&gt; J_i=-\sum_{j=1}^3 D_{ij} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;
:For the diffusion equation this formula gives
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi(x,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot \bigl(D \nabla \varphi(x,t)\bigr)=\sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3D_{ij} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi(x,t)}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}. &lt;/math&gt;
:The symmetric matrix of diffusion coefficients {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} should be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. It is needed to make the right hand side operator [[Elliptic operator|elliptic]].

* For ''inhomogeneous anisotropic media'' these two forms of the diffusion equation should be combined in
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi(x,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot \bigl(D(x) \nabla \varphi(x,t)\bigr)=\sum_{i,j=1}^3\left(D_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial^2 \varphi(x,t)}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}+ \frac{\partial D_{ij}(x)}{\partial x_i }  \frac{\partial \varphi(x,t)}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

* The approach based on [[Diffusion#Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula|Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula]] gives the following generalization of Fick's equation for the ''multicomponent diffusion'' of the perfect components:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial t}  =\sum_j \nabla\cdot\left(D_{ij} \frac{\varphi_i}{\varphi_j} \nabla \, \varphi_j\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are concentrations of the components and {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the matrix of coefficients. Here, indices {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} are related to the various components and not to the space coordinates.

The [[Diffusion#The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation|Chapman–Enskog formulae for diffusion in gases]] include exactly the same terms. These physical models of diffusion are different from the test models {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ∑&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''D&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' Δ''φ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} which are valid for very small deviations from the uniform equilibrium. Earlier, such terms were introduced in the [[Maxwell–Stefan diffusion]] equation.

For anisotropic multicomponent diffusion coefficients one needs a rank-four tensor, for example {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;''ij'',''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''i'', ''j''}} refer to the components and {{math|''α'', ''β'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}} correspond to the space coordinates.

== Applications ==
Equations based on Fick's law have been commonly used to model [[Passive transport|transport processes]] in foods, [[neuron]]s, [[biopolymer]]s, [[Pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]], [[porous]] [[soil]]s, [[population dynamics]], nuclear materials, [[plasma physics]], and [[Doping (semiconductor)|semiconductor doping]] processes. Theory of all [[Voltammetry|voltammetric]] methods is based on solutions of Fick's equation. Much experimental research in [[polymer]] science and food science has shown that a more general approach is required to describe transport of components in materials undergoing [[glass transition]].  In the vicinity of glass transition the flow behavior becomes "non-Fickian". It can be shown that the Fick's law can be obtained from the [[Maxwell–Stefan]] equations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last= Taylor
|first=Ross
|first2=R. |last2=Krishna
|title = Multicomponent mass transfer
|publisher = Wiley
|year=1993
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of [[multi-component]] [[mass transfer]]. The Fick's law is limiting case of the Maxwell–Stefan equations, when the mixture is extremely dilute and every chemical species is interacting only with the bulk mixture and not with other species. To account for the presence of multiple species in a non-dilute mixture, several variations of the Maxwell–Stefan equations are used. See also non-diagonal coupled transport processes ([[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager]] relationship). &lt;!-- Onsager = important point to be still developed --&gt;

=== Biological perspective ===
The first law gives rise to the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch9/s3ch9_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{flux} = {-P \left(c_2 - c_1\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

in which,
* {{mvar|P}} is the permeability, an experimentally determined membrane "[[Electrical conductance|conductance]]" for a given gas at a given temperature.
* {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the difference in [[concentration]] of the gas across the [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] for the direction of flow (from {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}).

Fick's first law is also important in radiation transfer equations.  However, in this context it becomes inaccurate when the diffusion constant is low and the radiation becomes limited by the speed of light rather than by the resistance of the material the radiation is flowing through.  In this situation, one can use a [[flux limiter]].

The exchange rate of a gas across a fluid membrane can be determined by using this law together with [[Graham's law]].

=== Fick's flow in liquids ===
When two [[miscibility|miscible]] liquids are brought into contact, and diffusion takes place, the macroscopic (or average) concentration evolves following Fick's law. On a mesoscopic scale, that is, between the macroscopic scale described by Fick's law and molecular scale, where molecular [[random walk]]s take place, fluctuations cannot be neglected. Such situations can be successfully modeled with Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this theoretical framework, diffusion is due to fluctuations whose dimensions range from the molecular scale to the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D. |last1=Brogioli |first2=A. |last2=Vailati |title=Diffusive mass transfer by nonequilibrium fluctuations: Fick's law revisited |journal=Phys. Rev. E |volume=63 |page=012105 |issue=1–4 |date=2001 |arxiv = cond-mat/0006163 |bibcode = 2001PhRvE..63a2105B |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.63.012105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, fluctuating hydrodynamic equations include a Fick's flow term, with a given diffusion coefficient, along with hydrodynamics equations and stochastic terms describing fluctuations. When calculating the fluctuations with a perturbative approach, the zero order approximation is Fick's law. The first order gives the fluctuations, and it comes out that fluctuations contribute to diffusion. This represents somehow a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], since the phenomena described by a lower order approximation is the result of a higher approximation: this problem is solved only by [[renormalization|renormalizing]] the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations.

=== Semiconductor fabrication applications ===
[[Integrated circuit]] fabrication technologies, model processes like CVD, thermal oxidation, wet oxidation, doping, etc. use diffusion equations obtained from Fick's law.

In certain cases, the solutions are obtained for boundary conditions such as constant source concentration diffusion, limited source concentration, or moving boundary diffusion (where junction depth keeps moving into the substrate).

== History ==
In 1855, physiologist Adolf Fick first reported&lt;ref&gt;
*{{cite journal|first=A. |last=Fick |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=1855 |volume=94 |pages=59–86 |DOI=10.1002/andp.18551700105|language=German |title=Ueber Diffusion}}
*{{cite journal|first=A. |last=Fick |journal=Phil. Mag. |date=1855 |volume=10 |page=30 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; his now well-known laws governing the transport of mass through diffusive means.  Fick's work was inspired by the earlier experiments of [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], which fell short of proposing the fundamental laws for which Fick would become famous.  The Fick's law is analogous to the  relationships discovered at the same epoch by other eminent scientists: [[Darcy's law]] (hydraulic flow), [[Ohm's law]] (charge transport), and [[Fourier's Law]] (heat transport).

Fick's experiments (modeled on Graham's) dealt with measuring the concentrations and fluxes of salt, diffusing between two reservoirs through tubes of water. It is notable that Fick's work primarily concerned diffusion in fluids, because at the time, diffusion in solids was not considered generally possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/journal/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |first=Jean |last=Philibert |title=One and a Half Centuries of Diffusion: Fick, Einstein, before and beyond |journal=Diffusion Fundamentals |volume=2 |date=2005 |page=1.1–1.10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205030323/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/journal/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Fick's Laws form the core of our understanding of diffusion in solids, liquids, and gases (in the absence of bulk fluid motion in the latter two cases).  When a diffusion process does ''not'' follow Fick's laws (which happens in cases of diffusion through porous media and diffusion of swelling penetrants, among others),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''fuzzy finite element''' method combines the well-established [[finite element method]] with the concept of [[fuzzy number]]s, the latter being a special case of a [[fuzzy set]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of using [[fuzzy number]]s instead of [[real numbers]] lies in the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] (on material properties, parameters, geometry, initial conditions, etc.) in the finite element analysis. 

One way to establish a fuzzy finite element (FE) analysis is to use existing FE software (in-house or commercial) as an inner-level module to compute a [[deterministic]] result, and to add an outer-level loop to handle the fuzziness (uncertainty). This outer-level loop comes down to solving an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem. If the inner-level deterministic module produces [[monotonic]] behavior with respect to the input variables, then the outer-level optimization problem is greatly simplified, since in this case the [[Maxima and minima|extrema]] will be located at the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]].

Parabolic Equation

Traditional finite element method is a well-established method to solve various problems of science and engineering. Different authors have used various methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction problem. In this study, heat conduction in a circular rod has been considered which is made up of two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In earlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as fixed numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in general by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are actually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and in that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be considered in the analysis.Hence interval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the finite element method to solve a steady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element method in the said problem gives fuzzy system of linear equations in general. Here we have also proposed new methods to handle such type of fuzzy system of linear equations. Corresponding results are computed and has been reported here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarangam Majumdar]], 2012. ''Fuzzy Finite Element Method for One-dimensional Steady State Heat Conduction Problem''. Thesis, &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5860">'''Genetic matchmaking''' is the idea of matching couples for romantic relationships based on their biological compatibility.  The initial idea was conceptualized by Claus Wedekind through his famous "sweaty t-shirt" experiment.&lt;ref name="wedekind_1995"&gt;Wedekind, C., et al. "MHC-Dependent Mate Preferences in Humans." Proceedings.Biological sciences / The Royal Society 260.1359 (1995): 245-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Males were asked to wear T-shirts for two consecutive nights, and then females were asked to smell the T-shirts and rate the body odors for attractiveness.  Human body odor has been associated with the [[Human leukocyte antigens| human leukocyte antigens (HLA)]] genomic region.  They discovered that females were attracted to men who had dissimilar HLA alleles from them.  Furthermore, these females reported that the body odors of HLA-dissimilar males reminded them of their current partners or ex-partners providing further evidence of biological compatibility.

==Evidence of biological compatibility==
Following the seminal research done by Dr. Wedekind,&lt;ref name="wedekind_1995" /&gt; several studies found corroborating evidence for biological compatibility.  Garver-Apgar ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Garver-Apgar, C. E., et al. "Major Histocompatibility Complex Alleles, Sexual Responsivity, and Unfaithfulness in Romantic Couples." Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS 17.10 (2006): 830-5.&lt;/ref&gt; presented evidence for HLA-dissimilar alleles playing a factor in the healthiness of romantic relationships.  They discovered that as the proportion of HLA-similar alleles increased between couples, females reported being less sexually responsive to their partners, less satisfaction from being aroused by their partners, and having additional sexual partners (while with their current partner).  Additionally, Ober ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Ober, C., et al. "HLA and Mate Choice in Humans." American Journal of Human Genetics 61.3 (1997): 497-504.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an independent study on a population of American [[Hutterites]] by comparing the HLA alleles of married couples.  They discovered that married couples were less likely to share HLA alleles than expected from random chance; thus their results were consistent with tendencies for same-HLA alleled partners to avoid mating. Further evidence of the importance of genetic compatibility can be found in the finding that couples sharing a higher proportion of HLA alleles tend to have recurring spontaneous abortions,&lt;ref name="reznikoff_1991"&gt;Reznikoff-Etievant, M. F., et al. "HLA Antigen-Sharing in Couples with Repeated Spontaneous Abortions and the Birthweight of Babies in Successful Pregnancies." American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y.: 1989) 25.1 (1991): 25-7.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced body mass in babies,&lt;ref name="reznikoff_1991" /&gt; and longer intervals between successive births.&lt;ref&gt;Ober, C., et al. "HLA Sharing and Fertility in Hutterite Couples: Evidence for Prenatal Selection Against Compatible Fetuses." American Journal of Reproductive Immunology and Microbiology : AJRIM 18.4 (1988): 111-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for biological compatibility==
There are several biological reasons why women would be attracted to and mate with men with dissimilar HLA alleles:&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D.J ., and Potts, W.K. “The evolution of mating preferences and major histocompatibility complex genes.”  The American Naturalists, 153 (1999): 145-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Their offspring would have a greater assortment of HLA alleles theoretically giving them a wider diversity of antigens present on the surface of cells compared to HLA-homozygous offsprings.  The wider variety of antigens allows the immune system to target a greater number of pathogens making the offspring more immunocompetent.
* Any HLA allele which becomes a more resistant allele would not simply become an inherent allele in all individuals.  Through [[evolution]], there will always be some pathogens that can become resistant to this allele, and spread to create a selection against the allele.  HLA-dissortative mating can be considered a method to cause the adaptations that pathogens have to their host to become obsolete in their offspring;  In other words, allow us to keep up in the [[Red Queen's Hypothesis|"Red Queen's race"]].
* HLA genes are highly polymorphic between individuals.  Any two individuals with similar HLA genes could be possibly related.  Mating of two related individuals would result in inbreeding which can be harmful to the offspring since it would result in a greater amount of genetic homozygosity thus increasing the chances of recessive mutations.

==Criticism==
There has been skepticism throughout the science community claiming the idea to be ridiculous.  "They are just trying to make a buck," Dr. Rocio Moran, medical director of the General Genetics Clinic at the Cleveland Clinic.  "If it's genetic, it must be real science."&lt;ref&gt;Genetic love match? Dating sites try DNA tests." Associated Press. Nov 12th, 2009 2009. msnbc.com. &lt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33893470/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many skeptics state that the science of love cannot be simplified to just a few genes.

==Companies==
Several companies have sprung up offering genetic matchmaking services: [https://www.dnaromance.com DNA Romance], GenePartner, [https://www.pheramor.com Pheramor], Instant Chemistry,  [[SingldOut]] ...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dubious-science-genetics-based-dating-180968151/ The Dubious Science of Genetics-Based Dating]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MI with contraction bands very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Micrograph]] showing [[contraction band necrosis]], a histopathologic finding of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).]]
'''Histopathology''' (compound of three [[Greek language|Greek]] words: {{lang|grc|ἱστός}} ''histos'' "tissue", πάθος ''pathos'' "suffering", and -λογία ''[[-logy|-logia]]'' "study of") refers to the [[light microscope|microscopic]] examination of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in order to study the manifestations of [[disease]]. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a [[biopsy]] or surgical [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] by a [[pathology|pathologist]], after the specimen has been processed and [[histological section]]s have been placed onto glass slides. In contrast, [[cytopathology]] examines (1) free cells or (2) tissue micro-fragments (as "cell blocks").

== Collection of tissues ==
Histopathological examination of tissues starts with [[surgery]], [[biopsy]], or [[autopsy]]. The tissue is removed from the [[Human body|body]] or [[plant]], and then...often following expert dissection in the fresh state...placed in a [[fixation (histology)|fixative]] which stabilizes the tissues to prevent [[Decomposition|decay]]. The most common fixative is [[formalin]] (10% neutral buffered [[formaldehyde]] in water).

== Preparation for histology ==
{{Main article|Histology}}
The tissue is then prepared for viewing under a [[microscope]] using either chemical fixation or frozen section.

If a large sample is provided e.g. from a surgical procedure then a pathologist looks at the tissue sample and selects the part most likely to yield a useful and accurate diagnosis - this part is removed for examination in a process commonly known as grossing or cut up. Larger samples are cut to correctly situate their anatomical structures in the cassette. Certain specimens (especially biopsies) can undergo [[agar]] pre-embedding to assure correct tissue orientation in cassette &amp; then in the block &amp; then on the diagnostic microscopy slide. This is then placed into a plastic cassette for most of the rest of the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Chemical fixation===
In addition to formalin, other chemical fixatives have been used. But, with the advent of [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) staining and diagnostic [[molecular pathology]] testing on these specimen samples, formalin has become the standard chemical fixative in human diagnostic histopathology. Fixation times for very small specimens are shorter, and standards exist in human diagnostic histopathology.

===Processing===
Water is removed from the sample in successive stages by the use of increasing concentrations of [[alcohol]].&lt;ref name=mwap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwap.co.uk/path_staining.html|title=Welcome mwap.co.uk - Justhost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xylene is used in the last dehydration phase instead of alcohol - this is because the wax used in the next stage is soluble in [[xylene]] where it is not in alcohol allowing wax to permeate (infiltrate) the specimen.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt; This process is generally automated and done overnight. The wax infiltrated specimen is then transferred to an individual specimen embedding (usually metal) container. Finally, molten wax is introduced around the specimen in the container and cooled to solidification so as to embed it in the wax block.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt;  This process is needed to provide a properly oriented sample sturdy enough for obtaining a thin [[microtome]] section(s) for the slide.

Once the wax embedded block is finished, sections will be cut from it and usually placed to float on a waterbath surface which spreads the section out. This is usually done by hand and is a skilled job (histotechnologist) with the lab personnel making choices about which parts of the specimen microtome wax ribbon to place on slides. A number of slides will usually be prepared from different levels throughout the block. After this the thin section mounted slide is stained and a protective cover slip is mounted on it. For common stains, an automatic process is normally used; but rarely used stains are often done by hand.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt;

=== Frozen section processing ===
The second method of histology processing is called [[frozen section]] processing. This is a highly technical scientific method performed by a trained histoscientist (a Medical Laboratory scientist specialist in Histopathology. 5–6 years degree training) In this method, the tissue is frozen and sliced thinly using a [[microtome]] mounted in a below-freezing refrigeration device called the [[cryostat]].  The thin frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide, fixed immediately &amp; briefly in liquid fixative, and stained using the similar staining techniques as traditional wax embedded sections.  The advantages of this method is rapid processing time, less equipment requirement, and less need for ventilation in the laboratory.  The disadvantage is the poor quality of the final slide.  It is used in intra-operative pathology for determinations that might help in choosing the next step in surgery during that surgical session (for example, to preliminarily determine clearness of the [[resection margin]] of a tumor during surgery).

== Staining of processed histology slides ==

This can be done to slides processed by the chemical fixation or frozen section slides.  To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more [[pigments]]. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast.

The most commonly used stain in histopathology is a combination of [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (often abbreviated H&amp;E). Hematoxylin is used to stain [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] '''blue''', while eosin stains [[cytoplasm]] and the extracellular connective tissue matrix '''pink'''. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include [[safranin]], [[Oil Red O]], [[congo red]], [[Silver compounds|silver salts]] and artificial dyes. '''Histochemistry''' refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the [[Perls' Prussian blue]] reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like [[Hemochromatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4448747/Perl|title=Perl - Red Blood Cell - Staining|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[antibody|antibodies]] have been used to stain particular [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s. Called [[immunohistochemistry]], this technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques include '''in situ hybridization''' to identify specific [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] molecules.  These antibody staining methods often require the use of frozen section histology. These procedures above are also carried out in the laboratory under scrutiny and precision by a trained specialist Medical laboratory scientist (Histoscientist)
Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.

== Interpretation ==
The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a [[pathology|pathologist]], a medically qualified specialist who has completed a recognised training program. This [[medical diagnosis]] is formulated as a '''pathology report''' describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of [[cancer]], this represents the '''tissue diagnosis''' required for most treatment protocols.  In the removal of [[cancer]], the pathologist will indicate whether the [[surgical margin]] is cleared, or is involved (residual cancer is left behind).  This is done using either the [[bread loafing]] or [[CCPDMA]] method of processing.

== In myocardial infarction ==
{{Further|Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology}}
After a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a [[coagulation necrosis]] is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, there can be seen [[karyopyknosis]] and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 – 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until the end of the first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of dead muscle fibres, necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the [[myocardial scarring]] is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.&lt;ref name=Kumar11&gt;Chapter 11 in: {{cite book |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a quantity grows towards a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] under a finite variation (a "[[finite-time singularity]]") it is said to undergo '''hyperbolic growth'''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

P. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the [[reciprocal function]] &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; has a [[hyperbola]] as a graph, and has a singularity at 0, meaning that the [[limit of a function|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;x \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is infinite: any similar graph is said to exhibit hyperbolic growth.

==Description==
If the output of a function is [[inversely proportional]] to its input, or inversely proportional to the difference from a given value &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, the function will exhibit hyperbolic growth, with a singularity at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In the real world hyperbolic growth is created by certain non-linear [[positive feedback]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Alexander V. Markov]],  and [[Andrey Korotayev|Andrey V. Korotayev]] (2007). [https://www.academia.edu/24472865/Phanerozoic_marine_biodiversity_follows_a_hyperbolic_trend "Phanerozoic marine biodiversity follows a hyperbolic trend". Palaeoworld. Volume 16. Issue 4. Pages 311-318].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with other growth===
Like [[exponential growth]] and [[logistic growth]], hyperbolic growth is highly [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], but differs in important respects.
These functions can be confused, as exponential growth, hyperbolic growth, and the first half of logistic growth are [[convex function]]s; however their [[asymptotic behavior]] (behavior as input gets large) differs dramatically:
* logistic growth is constrained (has a finite limit, even as time goes to infinity),
* exponential growth grows to infinity as time goes to infinity (but is always finite for finite time),
* hyperbolic growth has a singularity in finite time (grows to infinity at a finite time).

==Applications==

===Population===
Certain mathematical models suggest that until the early 1970s the [[world population]] underwent hyperbolic growth (see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''] by [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.''). It was also shown that until the 1970s the hyperbolic growth of the world population was accompanied by quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world [[GDP]], and developed a number of [[mathematical model]]s describing both this phenomenon, and the [[World-system theory|World System]] withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades. The hyperbolic growth of the [[world population]] and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world [[GDP]] observed till the 1970s have been correlated by [[Andrey Korotayev]]  and his colleagues to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between the demographic growth and technological development, described by a chain of causation: technological growth leads to more [[carrying capacity]] of land for people, which leads to more people, which leads to more inventors, which in turn leads to yet more technological growth, and on and on.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006; Korotayev A. V. [http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf A Compact Macromodel of World System Evolution // Journal of World-Systems Research 11/1 (2005): 79–93.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706205516/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf |date=July 6, 2009 }}; for a detailed mathematical analysis of this issue see [https://www.academia.edu/25994385/A_compact_mathematical_model_of_the_World_System_economic_and_demographic_growth_1_CE_1973_CE A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE - 1973 CE. "International Journal of Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences". 2016. Vol. 10, pp. 200-209 ].&lt;/ref&gt; Other models suggest [[exponential growth]], logistic growth, or other functions.

===Queuing theory===
Another example of hyperbolic growth can be found in [[queueing theory]]: the average waiting time of randomly arriving customers grows hyperbolically as a function of the average load ratio of the server. The singularity in this case occurs when the average amount of work arriving to the server equals the server's processing capacity. If the processing needs exceed the server's capacity, then there is no well-defined average waiting time, as the queue can grow without bound. A practical implication of this particular example is that for highly loaded queuing systems the average waiting time can be extremely sensitive to the processing capacity.

===Enzyme kinetics===
A further practical example of hyperbolic growth can be found in [[enzyme kinetics]]. When the rate of reaction (termed velocity) between an [[enzyme]] and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] is plotted against various concentrations of the substrate, a hyperbolic plot is obtained for many simpler systems. When this happens, the enzyme is said to follow [[Enzyme kinetics#Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]]  kinetics.

==Mathematical example==
The function
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{1}{t_c-t}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits hyperbolic growth with a singularity at time &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt;: in the [[limit of a function|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;t \to t_c&lt;/math&gt;, the function goes to infinity.

More generally, the function
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{K}{t_c-t}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits hyperbolic growth, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scale factor]].

Note that this algebraic function can be regarded as analytical solution for the function's differential:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. P. 118-123.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}=\frac{x^2}{K}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that with hyperbolic growth the absolute growth rate of the variable x in the moment t is proportional to the square of the value of x in the moment t.

Respectively, the quadratic-hyperbolic function looks as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Instinct''' or '''innate behavior''' is the inherent inclination of a [[life|living]] [[organism]] towards a particular complex [[behavior]]. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a [[fixed action pattern]] (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus. 
[[File:Instinct dog shake.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An instinctive behavior of shaking water from wet fur.]]

[[File:BabyLoggerheadTlalcoyunque3.jpg|thumb|220px|A baby [[leatherback turtle]] makes its way to the open ocean]]
Any behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of [[learning]]), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors.  [[Sea turtle]]s, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean.  A [[marsupial]] climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. [[Honeybee]]s communicate by dancing in the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal [[courtship]] behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of [[nest]]s.

Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from [[reflex]]es, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge |year=1977 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |isbn=0-15-111699-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Greifreflex.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Primitive reflex]]es]]

===In biology===
[[Jean Henri Fabre]] (1823-1915), an [[entomologist]], considered instinct to be any behavior which did not require [[cognition]] or [[consciousness]] to perform. Fabre's inspiration was his intense study of insects, some of whose behaviors he wrongly considered fixed and not subject to environmental influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Insectopedia |first=Hugh |last=Raffles |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-375-42386-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instinct as a concept fell out of favor in the 1920s with the rise of [[behaviorism]] and such thinkers as [[B. F. Skinner]], which held that most significant behavior is learned.

An interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviors.  Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes much to their work.  For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. The identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards the boots was instinctive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===In psychology===
The term "instinct" in [[psychology]] was first used in the 1870s by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual.  In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher chronicled 4,000 human "instincts," having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behavior became less common.  In a conference in 1960, chaired by [[Frank Beach]], a pioneer in [[comparative psychology]], and attended by luminaries in the field, the term was restricted in its application.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of instincts in reference to human behavior.  By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s referral to the "[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]]" instincts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. In this sense, instincts appeared to have become regarded as increasingly superfluous in trying to understand human psychological behavior.

Psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong ''drives''. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham H. |last=Maslow |title=Motivation and Personality |chapter=Instinct Theory Reexamined |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1954 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Instinct'' (1961) established a number of criteria which distinguish instinctual from other kinds of behavior.  To be considered instinctual, a behavior must follow these criteria:  a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandal |first=F. B. |year=2010 |title=Textbook of Animal Behaviour |publisher=PHI Learning |page=47 |isbn=978-81-203-4035-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a classic paper published in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nature as Nurture: Behaviorism and the Instinct Doctrine |first=R. J. |last=Harrnstein |journal=Behaviorism |year=1972 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=23–52 |jstor=27758791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the psychologist [[Richard Herrnstein]] decries Fabre's opinions on instinct (see: In biology section).

===In behavioral sciences===

In ''Information behavior: An Evolutionary Instinct'' (2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–42), Amanda Spink notes that "currently in the behavioral sciences instinct is generally understood as the innate part of behavior that emerges without any training or education in humans." She claims that the viewpoint that information behavior has an instinctive basis is grounded in the latest thinking on human behavior. Furthermore, she notes that "behaviors such as cooperation, sexual behavior, child rearing and aesthetics are [also] seen as 'evolved psychological mechanisms' with an instinctive basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=D.   |title=Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind |location=Boston |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |edition=3rd |year=2008   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickens |first=W. T.  |last2=Cohen |first2=J. L.. |title=Instinct and choice: A framework for analysis. In C. Garcia Coll (Ed.), Nature and nurture: The complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences on human behavior and development. |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum   |year=2003   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geary |first=D. C. |title=The origin of mind: Evolution of brain, cognition, and general intelligence. |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association   |year=2004   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spink adds that [[Steven Pinker]] similarly asserts that language acquisition is instinctive in humans in his book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994).

==Reflexes==
{{main|Reflex}}
Examples of behaviors that do not require conscious will include many reflexes. The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the [[reflex arc]]. Reflexes are similar to [[fixed action pattern]]s in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP.  However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male [[stickleback]]'s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example.  Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the [[primitive reflexes]], such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present in [[mammal]]s. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie (2012). "Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry". Frontiers in molecular neuroscience (1662-5099), 5, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maturational==

Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds "learning" to fly. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |title=Biology |location=San Francisco |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=6th |year=2002 |isbn=0-201-75054-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In evolution==

Imprinting provides one example of instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumberg|first=Mark S.|date=2017|title=Development evolving:The origins and meanings of instinct|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=8|issue=1-2|pages=|doi=10.1002/wcs.1371|issn=1939-5078|pmc=5182125|pmid=27906515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  complex response may involve visual, auditory, and olfactory cues in the environment surrounding an organism.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In some cases, imprinting attaches an offspring to its parent, which is a reproductive benefit to offspring survival.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, Julian. 1957. Imprinting: The interaction of learned and innate behavior: II. The critical period. Journal of comparative &amp; physiological psychology  0021-50 (1), p. 6. Kim, Young-Joon. 2006. A Command Chemical Triggers an Innate Behavior by Sequential Activation of Multiple Peptidergic Ensembles. Current biology 096016 (14), p. 1395.&lt;/ref&gt; If an offspring has attachment to a parent, it is more likely to stay nearby under parental protection. Attached offspring are also more likely to learn from a parental figure when interacting  closely. (Reproductive benefits are a driving force behind [[natural selection]].)

Environment is an important factor in how innate behavior has evolved.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} A hypothesis of Michael McCollough, a positive psychologist, explains that environment plays a key role in human behaviors such as forgiveness and revenge. This hypothesis theorizes that various social environments cause either forgiveness or revenge to prevail. McCollough relates his theory to [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Michael. 2010. Beyond revenge: the evolution of the forgiveness instinct. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', p. 97-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperation and retaliation are comparable to forgiveness and revenge. The choice between the two can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses. Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a more biological standpoint, the brain's [[limbic system]] operates as the main control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of instinctual behavior. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioral response. Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy.  These behaviors are influenced by sensory input — sight, sound, touch, and smell.

Within the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the [[vomeronasal organ]] that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie 2012. Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry. ''Frontiers in molecular neuroscience'' 1662, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2017}} Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the [[olfactory system]], detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel  to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, Katie 2012. Wired for behaviors: from development to function of innate limbic system circuitry. ''Frontiers in molecular neuroscience'' 1662, p. 	55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process.

Instinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviors without learning them. Innate behavior is an important and interesting aspect of the biological world that people come into contact with every day.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15268">The '''Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA)''' was a research program funded by the [[United States Air Force]]. The goal of the program was to apply concepts from [[artificial intelligence]] to the problem of designing and implementing [[computer software]]. Software would be described by models in very high level languages (essentially equivalent to [[First Order Logic|first order logic]]) and then [[rule of inference|transformation rules]] would transform the specification into efficient code. The air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control [[Weapon systems|weapons systems]] and other [[command and control]] systems using this method. As software was becoming ever more critical to USAF weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military, as well as for [[Information Technology|information technology]] in other major US industries.

==History==
In the early 1980s the United States Air Force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft. The air force commissioned a group of researchers from the [[artificial intelligence]] and [[formal methods]] communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development.

The report described a vision for a new approach to software development. Rather than define specifications with diagrams and manually transform them to code as was the current process, the KBSA vision was to define specifications in very high level languages and then to use transformation rules to gradually refine the specification into efficient code on heterogeneous platforms.

Each step in the design and refinement of the system would be recorded as part of an integrated repository. In addition to the artifacts of software development the processes, the various definitions and transformations, would also be recorded in a way that they could be analyzed and also replayed later as needed. The idea was that each step would be a transformation that took into account various non-functional requirements for the implemented system. For example, requirements to use specific programming languages such as Ada or to harden code for real time mission critical fault tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Cordell |author2=D. Luckham |author3=R. Balzer |author4=T. Cheatham |author5=C. Rich|title=Report on a Knowledge-Based Software Assistant|journal=Kestrel Institute|date=Aug 1983|volume=A996431|pages=78|url=ftp://ftp.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/green/KBSA.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air force decided to fund further research on this vision through their [[Rome Air Development Center]] laboratory at [[Griffiss Air Force Base|Griffiss air force base]] in New York. The majority of the early research was conducted at the Kestrel Institute in Northern California (with [[Stanford University]]) and the [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) in Southern California (with [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[UCLA]]). The Kestrel Institute focused primarily on the provably correct transformation of logical models to efficient code. ISI focused primarily on the front end of the process on defining specifications that could map to logical formalisms but were in formats that were intuitive and familiar to systems analysts. In addition, Raytheon did a project to investigate informal requirements gathering and Honeywell and Harvard University did work on underlying frameworks, integration, and activity coordination.

Although not primarily funded by the KBSA program the [[MIT]] Programmer's Apprentice project also had many of the same goals and used the same techniques as KBSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rich|first=Charles|author2=Richard C. Waters |title=The Programmer's Apprentice Project: A Research Overview|journal=IEE Expert Special Issue on the Interactions between Expert Systems and Software Engineering|date=November 1987|url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1004.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later stages of the KBSA program (starting in 1991) researchers developed prototypes that were used on medium to large scale software development problems. Also, in these later stages the emphasis shifted from  a pure KBSA approach to more general questions of how to use knowledge-based technology to supplement and augment existing and future [[Computer Aided Software Engineering|computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) tools. In these later stages there was significant interaction between the KBSA community and the object-oriented and software engineering communities. For example, KBSA concepts and researchers played an important role in the mega-programming and user centered software engineering programs sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Christine Haapala |title=User-Centric Software Engineering|journal=IEEE Expert|date= February 1995|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these later stages the program changed its name to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (KBSE). The name change reflected the different research goal, no longer to create a totally new all encompassing tool that would cover the complete software life cycle but to gradually work knowledge-based technology into existing tools. Companies such as [[Andersen Consulting]] (one of the largest system integrators and at the time vendor of their own CASE tool) played a major role in the program in these later stages.

==Key concepts==

=== Transformation rules ===
The transformation rules that KBSA used were different than traditional rules for expert systems. Transformation rules matched against specification and implementation languages rather than against facts in the world. It was possible to specify transformations using patterns, wildcards, and recursion on both the right and left hand sides of a rule. The left hand expression would specify patterns in the existing knowledge base to search for. The right hand expression could specify a new pattern to transform the left hand side into. For example, transform a set theoretic data type into code using an Ada set library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Doug|title=Automating Software Design|year=1991|publisher=AAAI/MIT Press|isbn=978-0262620802|pages=483–514|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.6955&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=ps|editor=Michael Lowry, Robert McCartney|chapter=KIDS - A Knowledge-Based Software Development System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial purpose for transformation rules was to refine a high level logical specification into well designed code for a specific hardware and software platform. This was inspired by early work on theorem proving and automatic programming. However, researchers at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) developed the concept of ''evolution transformations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=M.S. Feather |title=Using Evolution Transformations to Construct Specifications|journal=Automating Software Design|year=1991|pages=65–92|publisher=AAAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than transforming a specification into  code an evolution transformation was meant to automate various stereotypical changes at the specification level, for example developing a new superclass by extracting various capabilities from an existing class that can be shared more generally. Evolution transformations were developed at approximately the same time as the emergence of the software patterns community and the two groups shared concepts and technology. Evolution transformations were essentially what is known as [[refactoring]] in the object-oriented software patterns community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=0201485672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge-based repository ===
A key concept of KBSA was that all artifacts: requirements, specifications, transformations, designs, code, process models, etc. were represented as objects in a [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]]. The original KBSA report describes what was called a Wide Spectrum Language. The requirement was for a [[knowledge representation]] framework that could support the entire life cycle: requirements, specification, and code as well as the software process itself. The core representation for the knowledge base was meant to utilize the same framework although various layers could be added to support specific presentations and implementations.

These early knowledge-base frameworks were developed primarily by ISI and Kestrel building on top of Lisp and Lisp machine environments. The Kestrel environment was eventually turned into a commercial product called Refine which was developed and supported by a spin-off company from Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated.

The Refine language and environment also proved to be applicable to the problem of software reverse engineering: taking legacy code that is critical to the business but that lacks proper documentation and using tools to analyze it and transform it to a more maintainable form. With the growing concern of the [[Y2K problem]] reverse engineering was a major business concern for many large US corporations and it was a focus area for KBSA research in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Barry|author2=Prasanta Bose |title=KBSA Life Cycle Evaluation: Final Technical Report|journal=Contract No: F30602-96-C-0274|date=1998-08-15|volume=I|url=http://csse.usc.edu/csse/event/1999/ARR/volumeI.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014|publisher=USC Center for Software Engineering|quote=As the program has proceeded toward its ultimate objectives, it has spawned a number of productivity-enhancing spinoffs such as the Refine-based software reengineering and testing tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welty|first=Chris|title=Summary of KBSE-93: The Eighth Annual Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference|url=http://ase-conferences.org/ase/past/kbse-8.txt|work=ase-conferences.org|accessdate=4 January 2014|quote=REFINE/COBOL Object Modeling Workbench provides a set of reengineering tools, Refine is the language of the KBSA concept demo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was significant interaction between the KBSA communities and the [[Frame language]] and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] communities. The early KBSA knowledge-bases were implemented in [[object-based]] languages rather than [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]. Objects were represented as classes and sub-classes but it was not possible to define methods on the objects. In later versions of KBSA such as the Andersen Consulting Concept Demo the specification language was expanded to support message passing as well.

=== Intelligent Assistant ===
KBSA took a different approach than traditional expert systems when it came to how to solve problems and work with users. In the traditional expert system approach the user answers a series of interactive questions and the system provides a solution. The KBSA approach left the user in control. Where as an expert system tried to, to some extent replace and remove the need for the expert the intelligent assistant approach in KBSA sought to re-invent the process with technology. This led to a number of innovations at the user interface level.

An example of the collaboration between the object-oriented community and KBSA was the architecture used for KBSA user interfaces. KBSA systems utilized a model-view-controller (MVC) user interface. This was an idea incorporated from Smalltalk environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Dave|author2=A. Czuchry |title=The Knowledge-Based Requirements Assistant|journal=IEEE Expert|year=1988|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MVC architecture was especially well suited to the KBSA user interface.  KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views of the knowledge-base. It might be useful to look at an emerging model from the standpoint of entities and relations, object interactions, class hierarchies, dataflow, and many other possible views. The MVC architecture facilitated this. With the MVC architecture the underlying model was always the knowledge base which was a [[Metaobject|meta-model]] description of the specification and implementation languages. When an analyst made some change via a particular diagram (e.g. added a class to the class hierarchy) that change was made at the underlying model level and the various views of the model were all automatically updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=David R. Harris |author3=Kevin M. Benner |author4=Martin S. Feather |title=Aries: The Requirements/Specification Facet for KBSA|journal=Rome Laboratory Final Technical Report|date=October 1992|volume=RL-TR-92-248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the benefits of using a transformation was that many aspects of the specification and implementation could be modified at once. For small scale prototypes the resulting diagrams were simple enough that basic layout algorithms combined with reliance on users to clean up diagrams was sufficient. However, when a transformation can radically redraw models with tens or even hundreds of nodes and links the constant updating of the various views becomes a task in itself. Researchers at Andersen Consulting incorporated work from the University of Illinois on graph theory to automatically update the various views associated with the knowledge base and to generate graphs that have minimal intersection of links and also take into account domain and user specific layout constraints.

Another concept used to provide intelligent assistance was automatic text generation. Early research at ISI investigated the feasibility of extracting formal specifications from informal natural language text documents. They determined that the approach was not viable. Natural language is by nature simply too ambiguous to serve as a good format for defining a system.  However, natural language generation was seen to be feasible as a way to generate textual descriptions that could be read by managers and non-technical personnel. This was especially appealing to the air force since by law they required all contractors to generate various reports that describe the system from different points of view. Researchers at ISI and later Cogentext and Andersen Consulting demonstrated the viability of the approach by using their own technology to generate the documentation required by their air force contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Kanth Miriyala |author3=Sudin Bhat |author4=William C. Sasso |author5=Owen Rambo |title=KBSA Concept Demo: Final Technical Report|journal=USAF Rome Laboratory Technical Report|date=April 1993|volume=RL-TR-93-38|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA267054|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Looney House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dogtrot house]]s are designed to maximise natural ventilation.]]
'''Natural ventilation''' is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using [[HVAC|mechanical systems]]. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of [[pressure]] differences arising from natural forces. There are two types of natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] occurring in buildings: ''wind driven ventilation'' and ''buoyancy-driven ventilation''. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.&lt;ref name=Linden&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = P. F. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.fluid.31.1.201 | title = The Fluid Mechanics of Natural Ventilation | journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume = 31 | pages = 201–238 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = |bibcode = 1999AnRFM..31..201L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called "breathing buildings".

==Process==
The static [[pressure]] of air is the pressure in a free-flowing air stream and is depicted by [[Contour line|isobars]] in [[weather map]]s. Differences in static pressure arise from global and [[microclimate]] thermal phenomena and create the air flow we call [[wind]]. [[Dynamic pressure]] is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q = \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^{2},&lt;/math&gt;

where (using [[International System of Units|SI]] units):

:{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = dynamic [[pressure]] in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]],
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\rho\;&lt;/math&gt; || = fluid [[density]] in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. [[density of air]]),
|-
| &lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = fluid [[velocity]] in m/s.
|}

The impact of wind on a building affects the ventilation and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates through it and the associated heat losses or heat gains. Wind speed increases with height and is lower towards the ground due to frictional drag.

The impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive pressure on the [[windward]] side of a building and negative pressure on the [[leeward]] and sides of the building. Thus, the building shape and local wind patterns are crucial in creating the wind pressures that will drive air flow through its apertures. In practical terms wind pressure will vary considerably creating complex air flows and turbulence by its interaction with elements of the natural environment (trees, hills) and urban context (buildings, structures). Vernacular and traditional buildings in different climatic regions rely heavily upon natural ventilation for maintaining [[thermal comfort]] conditions in the enclosed spaces. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Design==
Design guidelines are offered in [[Building code|building regulations]] and other related literature and include a variety of recommendations on many specific areas such as:
* Building location and orientation
* Building form and dimensions
* Indoor partitions and layout
* [[Window]] typologies, operation, location, and shapes
* Other aperture types ([[door]]s, [[chimney]]s)
* Construction methods and detailing (infiltration)
* External elements (walls, screens)
* [[Urban planning]] conditions

The following design guidelines are selected from the [[Whole Building Design Guide]], a program of the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]]:&lt;ref name=WBDG&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Natural Ventilation|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maximize wind-induced ventilation by siting the ridge of a building perpendicular to the summer winds
* Widths of naturally ventilated zone should be narrow (max 13.7 m [45 feet])
* Each room should have two separate supply and exhaust openings.  Locate exhaust high above inlet to maximize stack effect.  Orient windows across the room and offset from each other to maximize mixing within the room while minimizing the obstructions to airflow within the room.
* Window openings should be operable by the occupants
* Consider the use of clerestories or vented skylights.

==Wind driven ventilation==
Wind driven ventilation can be classified as cross ventilation and single-sided ventilation. Wind driven ventilation depends on wind behavior, on the interactions with the building envelope and on openings or other air exchange devices such as inlets or chimneys. For a simple volume with two openings, the cross wind flow rate can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q = U_{\textrm{wind}}\sqrt{\frac{C_{\textrm{p1}}-C_{\textrm{p2}}}{1/\left(A_{\textrm{1}}^2C_{\textrm{1}}^2\right)+1/\left(A_{\textrm{2}}^2C_{\textrm{2}}^2\right)}}\qquad{}\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm{wind}}&lt;/math&gt; is the far-field wind speed; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the upstream opening; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the downstream opening.

For rooms with single opening, the calculation of ventilation rate is more complicated than cross-ventilation due to the bi-directional flow and strong turbulent effect. The ventilation rate for single-sided ventilation can be accurately predicted by combining different models for mean flow, pulsating flow and eddy penetration.&lt;ref name="H. Wang &amp; Q. Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haojie |author2=Qingyan Chen|title=A New Empirical Model for Predicting Single-Sided, Wind-Driven Natural Ventilation in Buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2012|volume=54|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.07.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean flow rate for single-sided ventilation is determined by

&lt;math&gt; \bar{Q} = \frac{C_{d}\; l\; \sqrt {Cp}\;\int\limits_{z_{0}}^h \sqrt{-\frac{2\;\Delta\;P(z)}{\rho}}\, \mathrm{d}z}{z_{ref}^ {1/7}} \; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where

''l'' = width of the window;

''h'' = elevation of the top edge of the window;

''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = elevation of neural level (where inside and outside pressure balance);

''z''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; = reference elevation where the wind velocity is measured (at 10 m) and

&lt;math&gt; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt; = mean wind velocity at the reference elevation.

The knowledge of the urban climatology i.e. the wind around the buildings is crucial when evaluating the air quality and thermal comfort inside buildings as air and heat exchange depends on the wind pressure on facades. As we can see in the equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD ([[Computational Fluid Dynamics]]) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. [[Windcatcher]]s are able to aid wind driven ventilation by directing air in and out of buildings.

Some of the important limitations of wind driven ventilation:
* Unpredictability and difficulties in harnessing due to speed and direction variations
* The [[Indoor air quality|quality of air]] it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area
* May create a strong draught, discomfort.

==Buoyancy-driven ventilation==
::''(For more details on displacement buoyancy-driven ventilation (rather than mixing type buoyancy-driven ventilation), see [[Stack effect]])''

Buoyancy driven ventilation arise due to differences in density of interior and exterior air, which in large part arises from differences in temperature. When there is a temperature difference between two adjoining volumes of air the warmer air will have lower density and be more buoyant thus will rise above the cold air creating an upward air stream. Forced upflow buoyancy driven ventilation in a building takes place in a traditional fireplace. Passive stack ventilators are common in most bathrooms and other type of spaces without direct access to the outdoors.

In order for a building to be ventilated adequately via buoyancy driven ventilation, the inside and outside temperatures must be different. When the interior is warmer than the exterior, indoor air rises and escapes the building at higher apertures. If there are lower apertures then colder, denser air from the exterior enters the building through them, thereby creating upflow displacement ventilation. However, if there are no lower apertures present, then both in- and out-flow will occur through the high level opening. This is called mixing ventilation. This latter strategy still results in fresh air reaching to low level, since although the incoming cold air will mix with the interior air, it will always be more dense than the bulk interior air and hence fall to the floor. Buoyancy-driven ventilation increases with greater temperature difference, and increased height between the higher and lower apertures in the case of displacement ventilation. When both high and low level openings are present, the neutral plane in a building occurs at the location between the high and low openings at which the internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure (in the absence of wind). Above the neutral plane, the internal air pressure will be positive and air will flow out of any intermediate level apertures created. Below the neutral plane the internal air pressure will be negative and external air will be drawn into the space through any intermediate level apertues. Buoyancy-driven ventilation has several significant benefits: {See Linden, P Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 1999}
* Does not rely on wind: can take place on still, hot summer days when it is most needed.
* Stable air flow (compared to wind)
* Greater control in choosing areas of air intake
* Sustainable method

Limitations of buoyancy-driven ventilation:
* Lower magnitude compared to wind ventilation on the windiest days
* Relies on temperature differences (inside/outside)
* Design restrictions (height, location of apertures) and may incur extra costs (ventilator stacks, taller spaces)
* The quality of air it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area (although this can also be a factor in wind-driven ventilation)

Natural ventilation in buildings can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment this type of ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect, it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example, air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the buoyancy effect, but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets. Therefore, prevailing winds must be taken into account when designing for stack effect ventilation.

==Estimating buoyancy-driven ventilation==
The natural ventilation flow rate for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation with vents at two different heights can be estimated with this equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{S} = C_{d}\; A\; \sqrt {2\;g\;H_{d}\;\frac{T_I-T_O}{T_I}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Assessing performance==
One way to measure the performance of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the [[air changes per hour]] in an interior space.  In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air.  A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a [[tracer gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWilliams|first=Jennifer|title=Review of air flow measurement techniques.  LBNL Paper LBNL-49747.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7532b84f?query=Review%20of%20air%20flow%20measurement%20techniques|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ASTM Standard E741-11: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution|year=2006|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space.  To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant.  Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas.  The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time.  For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"/&gt;

While natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]]. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using [[recuperator]]s.

Ventilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta).

Where:

Theta is ventilation heat loss in W

Cp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K))

Rho is air density (~1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m3)

dT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in °K or °C

Eta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used).

The temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as:

dT=SFP/(Cp*Rho*(1-eta))

Where:

SFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s)

Under typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get:

dT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K

In climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where [[district heating]] is available.

To develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved:

# Providing efficient heat recovery at very low driving pressures.
# Physically or thermally connecting supply and exhaust air streams. (Stack ventilation typically relies on supply and exhaust being placed low and high respectively, while wind driven natural ventilation normally relies on openings being placed on opposing sides of a building for efficient cross ventilation.)

Research aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schultz, J. M., 1993. Naturlig ventilation med varmegenvinding, Lyngby: Laboratoriet for Varmeisolering, DTH. (Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct.

The device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure.

With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.&lt;ref&gt;Calautit, J. K., O'Connor, D. &amp; Hughes, B. R., 2015. A natural ventilation wind tower with heat pipe heat recovery for cold climates. Renewable Energy, I(87), pp. 1088-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems often feature finned [[heat pipe]]s although this limits the theoretical maximum heat recovery efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Gan, G. &amp; Riffat, S., 1999. A study of heat-pipe heat recovery for natural ventilation. AIVC, 477(12), pp. 57-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid coupled run around loops have also been tested to achieve indirect thermal connection between exhaust and supply air. While these tests have been somewhat successful, liquid coupling introduces mechanical pumps that consume energy to circulate the working fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, C. A. &amp; Svendsen, S., 2008. Passive ventilation systems with heat recovery and night cooling. Kyoto, Advanced building ventilation and environmental technology for addressing climate change issues.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, C. A. &amp; Svendsen, S., 2012. Wind- and stack-assisted mechanical, Lyngby: DTU Byg.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some commercially available solutions have been available for years,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Autodesk, 2012. Passive Heat Recovering Ventilation System. [Online]  Available at: sustainabilityworkshop.autodesk.com/project-gallery/passive-heat-recovering-ventilationsystem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ventive.co.uk/|title=Ventive|website=ventive.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimed performance by manufacturers has yet to be verified by independent scientific studies. This might explain the apparent lack of market impact of these commercially available products claiming to deliver natural ventilation and high heat recovery efficiencies.

A radically new approach to natural ventilation with heat recovery is currently being developed at Aarhus University, where heat exchange tubes are integrated into structural concrete slabs between building floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stackhr.com/p/how-it-works.html|title=How it works|website=www.stackhr.com|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some commercially available solutions have been available for years,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the claimed performance by manufacturers has yet to be verified by independent scientific studies. This might explain the apparent lack of market impact of these commercially available products claiming to deliver natural ventilation and high heat recovery efficiencies.

==Standards==
For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable [[Indoor Air Quality]].&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "all spaces intended for human occupancy except those within single-family houses, multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, vehicles, and aircraft."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In the revision to the standard in 2010, Section 6.4 was modified to specify that most buildings designed to have systems to naturally condition spaces must also "include a mechanical ventilation system designed to meet the Ventilation Rate or IAQ procedures [in ASHRAE 62.1-2010].  The mechanical system is to be used when windows are closed due to extreme outdoor temperatures noise and security concerns".&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt; The standard states that two exceptions in which naturally conditioned buildings do not require mechanical systems are when:
* Natural ventilation openings that comply with the requirements of Section 6.4 are permanently open or have controls that prevent the openings from being closed during period of expected occupancy, or
* The zone is not served by heating or cooling equipment.

Also, an authority having jurisdiction may allow for the design of conditioning system that does not have a mechanical system but relies only on natural systems.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In reference for how controls of conditioning systems should be designed, the standard states that they must take into consideration measures to "properly coordinate operation of the natural and mechanical ventilation systems."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;

Another reference is ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in [[low-rise]] Residential Buildings.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "single-family houses and multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, including manufactured and modular houses," but is not applicable "to transient housing such as hotels, motels, nursing homes, dormitories, or jails."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"/&gt;

For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its revisions, its scope has been consistent with its currently articulated purpose, “to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space.”&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;  The standard was revised in 2004 after field study results from the ASHRAE research project, RP-884: developing an adaptive model of thermal comfort and preference, indicated that there are differences between naturally and mechanically conditioned spaces with regards to occupant thermal response, change in clothing, availability of control, and shifts in occupant expectations.&lt;ref name="de Dear"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Dear|first=Richard J.|author2=Gail S. Brager|title=Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings: Revisions to ASHRAE Standard 55.|journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2002|volume=34|issue=6|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition to the standard, 5.3: Optional Method For Determining Acceptable Thermal Conditions in Naturally Ventilated Spaces, uses an adaptive [[thermal comfort]] approach for naturally conditioned buildings by specifying acceptable operative temperature ranges for naturally conditioned spaces.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt; As a result, the design of natural ventilation systems became more feasible, which was acknowledged by ASHRAE as a way to further sustainable, energy efficient, and occupant-friendly design.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;

'''Building commissioning (Cx)''' is the process of verifying, in new construction, all (or some, depending on scope) of the subsystems for [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|mechanical (HVAC), plumbing, electrical]], fire/life safety, [[building envelope]]s, interior systems (example laboratory units), co-generation, utility plants, sustainable systems, lighting, wastewater, controls, and building security to achieve the owner's project requirements as intended by the building owner and as designed by the building architects and engineers.  Recommissioning is the methodical process of testing and adjusting the aforementioned systems in existing buildings.

Building commissioning is a quality-focused process necessary for both non-complex and complex modern [[construction]] projects.  Normally the initial commissioning team and a team leader (typically known as the commissioning authority or CxA) is involved from project initiation through one year of occupancy.  In many cases and ideally, there is an ongoing building enhancing and commissioning program and team for the life of the building. While the service method can vary from owner to owner and project to project, the basic formula for a successful building commissioning process involves a synergy team from pre-design to develop the owner's project requirements (OPR), commissioning scope and plan, including benchmarks for success, review of design documents and checklists for achieving the Owner's Project Requirements (OPR), development of checklists and verifying a sample of construction checklists and submittals, developing training needs and evaluating training delivered by the contractors, witnessing and verifying construction phase tests, and periodic site observations during the construction phase, and performing commissioning functional testing as the project nears completion.  While the practice of building commissioning process is still fairly new in the construction industry, it has quickly become common practice as building owners and developers try to get more out of their investment.  The commissioning process main goal is to improve a project from the design phase through post construction and occupancy.

== Commissioning authority/agent (CxA) ==

The commissioning authority or commissioning agent (CxA) is generally (and preferably) contracted directly to the building owner to ensure unbiased performance of the CxA.  The CxA may be a subcontractor (or employee) of the building owner, architect, design engineer, test and balance contractor, or other trade contractor (i.e. [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|HVAC/mechanical, electrical, Plumbing]], fire protection, security, etc.) for specific trade testing.  It is recommended that the CxA be contracted early in the project planning stages, included in design charrettes, and maintained throughout the design, construction, and final acceptance of the project at a minimum.  Having the CxA on the team early provides opportunity to identify possible operation, installation, testing, and performance issues long before they become a construction issue.  The CxA works closely with the owner's representative, building/facility operating engineer, architect, design engineer, general contractor, and all trade subcontractors.  The CxA typically is responsible for leading and managing the project commission process (design and/or construction) and works closely with the design, construction, and operation teams in a co-operative work environment that focuses on teamwork throughout the building's design, construction, and post construction.

A CxA's ability to add value to a project is rooted in their ability to create positive working relationships with all parties involved and not pointing fingers when issues arise.  It is important that the CxA clearly identifies the communication processes/streams, the project goals and expectations (from the OPR), and the team member responsibilities.  A CxA has to be able to give open constructive criticism while also being able to listen attentively.  The CxA's primary goal is to provide a completed and properly operating product to the building owner and occupant/user.

The CxA's work and performance of service is equally or primarily in the background performing design, submittal, O&amp;M Manual reviews and development of testing and commissioning processes for the project, as well as documenting the commissioning efforts.  The CxA attends design and construction meetings, performs site construction observations, observes factory equipment testing, directs and observes functional performance testing of systems and equipment.  The CxA typically does not actually perform the hands-on testing, as these are actually performed by the manufacturer, vendor, or trade contractors, and directed and observed by the CxA utilizing testing procedures and expected performance outcome previously identified by the CxA during the commissioning document development process.

The CxA typically prepares a commissioning specification and commissioning plan during the project design phase.  The design engineer also may develop the commissioning specification (and rarely the commissioning plan) in situations where the CxA has not been so contracted, or brought into the design team during the design process.  The commissioning plan is a live document that outlines the commissioning processes and expectation based on the Owner's OPR, the design engineer's basis of design (BOD) and the project construction document (drawings and specifications).  The commissioning plan is modified as the commissioning process progresses throughout the design, construction, and final acceptance of the facility.  The functional performance test procedures are typically developed by the CxA with assistance of the trade contractors, vendors, and manufacturers based on the design engineer's contract documents.  These same parties and the design engineer, and owner's representative (typically the facility operating engineer) review the functional performance test procedures and expected outcomes prior to testing.  The systems, equipment, items, processes, modes, and sequences of operations to be tested by the CxA (contractors or others) should be detailed and identified in the design engineer's construction documents (drawings and specifications), the construction request for proposal (RFP), the contractors bid submission, the commissioning specifications, the commissioning plan, and the contractors submittals.  Of utmost importance, often neglected by contractors, are the equipment/systems "installation and operations manuals" (IOM or IO&amp;M) "specific to the project" (not generic).  The IOM's along with complete, and very detailed, sequence of operations (SOO) and control drawings/documents submittal "specific to the project" (not generic) are of utmost importance to the CxA to perform the review and develop proper testing procedures.  Timely delivery of these documents to the CxA is important to facilitate the CxA ample time to review, develop test, obtain reviews, and implement changes prior to scheduling of any testing.

== Building management Systems (BMS) or Building Automation Systems (BAS) ==

[[Building management system]]s (BMS) or [[building automation]] systems (BAS) provide control of the building systems.  These typically include heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R), electrical power, lighting, fire suppression and alarm, and security systems, etc.  Building controls also have the ability to monitor and control systems to improve performance, conserve energy, conserve water, and control lighting.  The greater control provides the ability to improve a buildings performance, environmental impact, and the user/occupant's environment.  Direct digital controls (DDC) with real time monitoring and history provide the ability to acquire system data realtime or with trend-logging, or trending, (over a predetermined period of time) to observe performance, issues/troubles, and identify possible improvements to operations and maintenance.

Building systems and equipment (HVAC, electrical, etc.) operate via the control systems (BAS, BMS, and similar) based on a designed sequence of operations (SOO) typically developed by the design engineer (specification) and modified during the submittal process by the trade contractors (and reviewed and approved by the design engineer). This SOO is also reviewed by the CxA who utilizes the SOO to develop the functional performance test procedures. The functional performance test procedures are typically developed by the CxA with assistance of the trade contractors, vendors, and manufacturers, reviewed by same, and the design engineer. The systems, equipment, items, processes, modes, and sequences of operations to be tested by the CxA (contractors or others) should be detailed and identified in the design engineer's construction documents (drawings and specifications), the construction request for proposal (RFP), the contractors bid submission, and the commissioning specifications and commissioning plan. The commissioning specification and commissioning plan are typically developed by the CxA during the design phase of the project.

The CxA works closely with the controls contractor to verify the control programming and identifies corrective issues during reviews and the functional performance testing. By performing the functional performance testing it is often, if not always, found where there are difficiencies in the systems or control and identifies items for improvement. Each and every point and sequence is typically not required to be tested by the CxA. The contractors typically hold the responsibility of testing and verifying each and every point and sequence, and the CxA performs a test of a sample of the items after the contractors have tested, repaired and verified. Re-Testing of the same, or another sampling, by the CxA is often required to re-verify deficiencies identified during the initial testing.

The integrated operations and performance of the many building systems such as HVAC, life/fire safety, domestic water, power, CO2 ventilation, and similar provide a complex and important performance for the facility and its occupants. Functional performance testing to verify proper operation prior to occupancy it extremely important. Testing of existing facilities is performed similarly by recommissioning (commissioning of a building/system/equipment that has been previously commissioned) and retro-commissioning (commissioning of an existing building/system/equipment that has not been previously commissioned). Assurance of performance and operation by the CxA's commissioning verification of the facility typically provides a better operating, performing, and comfortable environment for the owner and occupants.

== System degradation ==

It is estimated by Texas A&amp;M researchers that as much as 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://esl.tamu.edu/continuous-commissioning# |title=Texas A&amp;M System Energy Systems Lab – Continuous Commissioning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026054157/http://esl.tamu.edu/continuous-commissioning# |archive-date=2013-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the energy used in an average commercial building is waste associated with poorly operated systems.

Buildings systems underperform for several reasons:
# They were never properly configured
# The design did not account for all sources of building efficiency
# The building is not properly maintained
# The use of the building has changed over time

== Commissioning authority or commissioning agent (CxA) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}To provide any benefit, the facility, systems, and equipment must be thoroughly designed, submitted to, and approved by a responsible, thorough, professional architectural and engineering design team to function correctly. The design team incorporates the documented owner's program of requirements (OPR) which identifies the owner's systems, equipment, materials, control, and performance expectations. The design team identifies and documents the project basis of design (BOD) which specifically identifies the OPR items, how each was implemented in the design (or modified), and the final design basis for systems, equipment, materials, control, and performance expectations.

The fast-track nature of the design and construction process (experience in 2011) often leads to missed planning, design, and even construction items.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Items missed during the design and construction process can often be identified by the CxA during development of the functional and performance test procedures or during functional and performance tests.

The commissioning team, led by the CxA, has a primary objective of verifying proper installation, operation, and performance based on the project design (BOD) and the OPR. The commissioning of the facility, systems, and/or equipment provides verification, identifies issues and discrepancies, and if designed and constructed properly, ultimately enhances the facility total quality, control, performance, and efficiency which in turn provides increased sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">The '''New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room (NT.VMR)''' is a virtual manuscript reading room, where all New Testament manuscripts are available online.

It is aproject of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in Münster / Westphalia.  Information is offered for manuscripts of the New Testament and is linked to the digitized pictures and transcriptions. This intergenerational project is to make all of the more than 5,800 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament digitally visible for research.

== VMR ==
In the Virtual Manuscript Room manuscripts can be selected and displayed. In order to meet different scientific purposes, there are three different viewer modes to choose from. The main mode is the ''reading mode'', which allows page-scrolling of a manuscript, while at the same time picture and transcript are displayed.

The provision of digital copies is done by its holding institutions (or by organisations that produce digital photos of manuscripts - like e.g. [[CSNTM]]). In this case, either newly built digital copies or scans of black-and-white microfilms from the 1960s to 1980s (from the archives of the INTF) can be chosen.

The '''Office for Budget Responsibility''' ('''OBR''') is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] that the UK government established to provide independent [[economic forecast]]s and independent analysis of the public finances as background to the preparation of the [[United Kingdom budget|UK budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=Osborne to give details of £6bn spending cuts next week |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally created in May 2010 following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] (although it had previously been constituted in shadow form by the Conservative party opposition in December 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8401517.stm |title=Conservatives launch Office for Budget Responsibility |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed on a statutory footing by the [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]].&lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/892/made/data.pdf |title=The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a growing number of official independent fiscal watchdogs around the world.&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/ |title=What we do |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Chote]], formerly a director at the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11246225 | work=BBC News | title=Robert Chote to head Office for Budget Responsibility | date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current head.

==Functions==

The UK government created the OBR in 2010 with the purported goal of offering independent and authoritative analysis of the UK's public finances. To that end it produces two 5-year-ahead forecasts for the economy and the public finances each year, alongside the [[Budget Day|Budget]] and [[Autumn Statement]]s.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

In its role in providing independent analysis the OBR has four main duties:&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Forecasts of the economy and public finances===
The OBR produces five-year forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year. The forecasts accompany the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor’s]] [[Budget Day - United Kingdom|Budget Statement]] and his [[Autumn Statement]] and they incorporate the impact of any tax and spending measures announced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. Details of the forecasts are set out in the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) publications.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2014/ |title=Economic and fiscal outlook - March 2014 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Forecast evaluation report (FER) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/publications/forecast-evaluation-report/ |title=Forecast evaluation report - October 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published each autumn, examines how the EFO forecasts compare to subsequent outturns. The OBR has published briefing papers describing its approach to forecasting the economy &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Forecasting-the-economy.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 3: Forecasting the Economy |publisher=OBR |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public finances,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/briefing-paper-no-1-forecasting-the-public-finances/ |title=Briefing paper No. 1: Forecasting the public finances |publisher=OBR |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the macroeconomic model it uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Final_Model_Documentation.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 5: The macroeconomic model |publisher=OBR |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets===
The OBR uses its public finance forecasts to assess the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets. The Government has set itself two medium-term fiscal targets: first, a fiscal mandate to balance the cyclically-adjusted current budget five years ahead, and second, a supplementary target to have public sector net debt falling in 2015-16.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |title=Budget Forecast: June 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Economic and fiscal outlook, the OBR assesses whether the Government has a greater than 50 per cent probability of hitting these targets under current policy. Given the uncertainty inherent in all fiscal forecasts, the OBR also tests how robust this judgement is by using historical evidence, sensitivity analysis and alternative scenarios.

===Scrutiny of the Government’s policy costings===
The OBR conducts scrutiny and analysis of [[HM Treasury]]’s costing of tax and welfare spending measures. During the run-up to the Budget and the Autumn Statement, the OBR subjects the Government’s draft costings of tax and spending measures to detailed challenge and scrutiny. These are then stated in the EFO and the Treasury’s policy costing documents with the OBR stating whether it endorses the costings that the Government finally publishes as reasonable central estimates. The OBR has published a briefing paper describing its role in policy costings and how they fit into the forecast process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/27814-BriefingPaperNo_6.pdf |title=Briefing Paper No. 6: Policy costings and our forecasts |publisher=OBR |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assess the long-term sustainability of the public finances===
The OBR also assesses the long-term sustainability of the public finances. Its annual [[Fiscal sustainability]] report 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/fiscal-sustainability-report-july-2013/ |title=Fiscal sustainability report - July 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out long-term projections for different categories of spending, revenue and financial transactions and assesses whether they imply a sustainable path for public sector debt. The [[Fiscal sustainability]] report also analyses the health of the public sector’s balance sheet using both conventional National Accounts measures and the Whole of Government Accounts as prepared using commercial accounting principles.

===Other functions===
In addition to these core responsibilities, the Government has asked the OBR to forecast the Scottish receipts for the four taxes that it plans to devolve to the [[Scottish Government]] from 2015 onwards; the Scottish rate of income tax, stamp duty land tax, landfill tax and the aggregates levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/pdfs/ukpga_20120011_en.pdf |title=Scotland Act 2012|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OBR has published these forecasts since March 2012 alongside UK revenue forecasts. From autumn 2014, the OBR will publish similar forecasts for Welsh taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/294470/Wales_Bill_Command_Paper_-_English.pdf |title=Wales Bill: Financial Empowerment and Accountability |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Charter for Budget Responsibility was modified to include a new cap on welfare expenditure alongside the Government’s fiscal mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The welfare cap puts a limit on the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the years 2015/16 to 2018/19. The OBR is charged with assessing the Government’s performance against the cap at each [[Autumn Statement]]. As part of this assessment, the OBR is required to produce a forecast for welfare spending in scope of the cap in its Economic and fiscal outlook. The welfare cap means that if spending exceeds a certain limit, then policy action must be taken, or the cap level must change, and Parliamentary approval must be obtained. The cap features a two per cent forecast margin above the level of the cap that allows for small fluctuations in the forecast without corrective action being required. The OBR is required to assess whether welfare spending above the cap is caused by movements in the forecast or by discretionary policy changes. The OBR has also been tasked with producing an annual report on trends in welfare spending.

The OBR undertakes a variety of research projects through the year. It publishes briefing material &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/publications/briefing-papers/ |title=Briefing Papers |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inform the public about its work, and provides a same-day briefing on the public finances statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/topics/monthly-public-finance-data/ |title=Monthly public finance data |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budget Responsibility Committee &lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; members and OBR staff also give talks and presentations at external events. Robert Chote has discussed the role of the OBR, and the difference that it made after its first three years in existence, in a lecture entitled Britain’s fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel on 9 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Lecture_May-2013.pdf |title=Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel |author=Chote |date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities are summarised each year in its Annual Reports.

==History==
[[George Osborne]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the  [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], announced the body in his first official speech.  He criticised the economic and fiscal forecasts of the [[Premiership of Gordon Brown|previous Labour government]], and announced that the OBR would be responsible for publishing these independently of government in future.&lt;ref name=bbc-cutplan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=George Osborne promises spending cuts plan next week  |date=2010-05-17|work=BBC News|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective underpinning its creation was to provide an independent assessment of national public finances before the coalition Government's emergency budget in June 2010, which outlined the size and pace of the fiscal consolidation plan inherited from the outgoing administration.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The role of the Office is to advise whether the declared policy of the Government is likely to meet its targets &lt;ref name="mixedreactions"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/05/mixed-reaction-to-office-for-budget-responsibility/ | title= Mixed reaction to Office for Budget Responsibility | publisher= ''Public Finance'' | date= 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OBR was initially chaired by [[Sir Alan Budd]] who, along with Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker, formed the Budget Responsibility Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rt-hon-george-osborne-mp-on-the-obr-and-spending-announcements |title=Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on the OBR and spending announcements |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budd had been a founding member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|MPC]]; Dicks was chief economist at Novus Capital and former chief economist of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]; and Parker headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]’s public sector finances team. The remainder of the initial team comprised eight staff seconded from the Treasury.&lt;ref name="mixedreactions"/&gt; The initial team provided recommendations to the Chancellor on the role of the permanent OBR.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"/&gt;

The OBR produced its first forecast for public finances shortly before the June 2010 budget with the second at the June budget incorporating the impact of newly announced measures. [[Colin Talbot]], Chair of Public Policy and Management at [[Manchester Business School]] and Treasury adviser on public spending, questioned the credibility of the new organisation. He said that the body could not be set up in time to judge the forecasts in the [[June 2010 United Kingdom Budget]]. In his opinion, the OBR would not be sufficiently independent of politicians or the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] to remove the politics from economic decision-making.&lt;ref name=mixedreactions/&gt;   The office made adjustments to its forecasts in the week before the June 2010 budget.  These were thought to be politically favourable to the coalition government and so cast doubt on its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3e077ca-8adf-11df-bead-00144feab49a.html |title=Late OBR changes shrank job loss figure |author=Chris Giles |journal=Financial Times |date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 it was announced that Budd would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7873605/Sir-Alan-Budd-to-leave-the-Office-for-Budget-Responsibility.html Sir Alan Budd to leave the Office for Budget Responsibility], ''Daily Telegraph'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/alan-budd-quits-government-spending-watchdog Alan Budd quits as government spending watchdog], ''Guardian'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported "His departure was expected and Sir Alan had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period. His contract spanned the emergency Budget, leaving enough time thereafter to advise on the legislation needed to establish the OBR on a permanent basis."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65ccae4c-88c8-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation on his successor had included [[Rachel Lomax]], [[John Gieve]], [[Andrew Dilnot]], [[Robert Chote]], [[Michael Scholar]] and [[Ruth Lea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100046401/how-about-sir-michael-scholar-for-the-obr/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=How about Sir Michael Scholar for the OBR? | date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/iainmartin/2010/07/06/ruth-lea-in-at-the-obr-pdq/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Ruth Lea in at the OBR PDQ? | first=Iain | last=Martin | date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Chancellor George Osborne announced that [[Robert Chote]] had been appointed as the new Chairman of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). The two other members of the BRC were Stephen Nickell, a former member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee]] and Graham Parker, who formerly  headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury's]] public sector finances team.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; An Oversight Board was also created comprising the three BRC members plus two external members acting as non-Executive Directors.

==Governance==

===Budget Responsibility Committee===

The three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC) who are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer following an appointment hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, lead the OBR. They have executive responsibility for carrying out the core functions of the OBR, including responsibility for the judgements reached in its forecasts. They are: [[Robert Chote]] (Chairman), [[Charlie Bean|Professor Sir Charles Bean]], Graham Parker CBE.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Oversight Board===

The OBR's Oversight Board ensures that effective arrangements are in place to provide assurance on risk management, governance and internal control. It consists of the three members of the BRC plus two non-executive members, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] and [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Sir Christopher Kelly]].&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Advisory Panel===

The OBR’s Advisory Panel of economic and fiscal experts meets regularly to advise the OBR on its work programme and analytical methods. Currently members come from the [[Bank of England]], the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], academia, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=OBR names expert advisory panel |publisher=OBR |date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and related material==
The OBR’s formal rights and responsibilities are outlined in four documents:

•	The [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]] &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt;

•	The Charter for Budget Responsibility &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=HM Treasury |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	The OBR/HM Treasury Framework document &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_framework040411.pdf |title=Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury Framework Document |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	A Memorandum of Understanding between the OBR and government departments with which it interacts most frequently and closely: HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_memorandum040411.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between Office for Budget Responsibility, HM Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp; Customs |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt; sets out the overarching duty of the OBR to examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances.  It also gives complete discretion to the OBR in the performance of its duties, as long as those duties are performed objectively, transparently and independently and takes into account the sitting government’s policies and not alternative policies. 
The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; outlines the OBR’s independence which includes complete discretion to decide:

•	The methodology underpinning the OBR’s forecasts, assessment and analyses;

•	The judgements made by the OBR in producing these outputs;

•	The content of the OBR’s publications; and

•	The OBR’s work programme of research and additional analysis.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; also specifies material that the OBR have to include in its forecasts and gives the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] the right to determine the length of the forecast horizon – subject to a minimum of five years. The Charter states that the Government remains responsible for policy decisions and costings and the OBR “should fnot provide normative commentary on the particular merits of Government policies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter for Budget Responsibility March 2014 update, page 12, para 4.12 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives the OBR right of access to all Government information which it may reasonably require for the performance of its duties. Under the Memorandum of Understanding where it is not possible to reach agreement, issues may be escalated to the Chair of the OBR and the Permanent Secretaries as appropriate.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The Framework document sets out the OBR’s governance and management arrangements.
As a non-departmental body under the aegis of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the OBR is formally accountable to the [[Treasury Select Committee]] of the House of Commons. This accountability to parliament takes a number of elements:

First the four core publications the OBR is required to publish each year have to be laid formally before parliament;

Second, the [[Treasury Select Committee]] can call on the OBR to give evidence on its work at any time;

Third, the Treasury Select Committee has a role in determining the membership of the Budget Responsibility Committee. When a new member has to be appointed, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] names his preferred candidate following a formal application and interview process run by the civil service. The [[Treasury Select Committee]] holds confirmation hearings with the candidate and can veto the Chancellor’s choice.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

== International coordination ==
The OBR is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015.

'''Opower''' was a company that provided a software-as-a-service customer engagement platform for utilities. It existed as an independent corporation until its acquisition by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2016. The Opower product line are now marketed by Oracle under the Oracle Utilities moniker.

== History and growth ==
Founded in 2007 by long-time friends Dan Yates and [[Alex Laskey]], Opower is headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia. As of February 2014, it employed more than 500 people in five offices: Arlington, San Francisco, London, Singapore, and Japan.

In June 2010, [[iLike]] founder [[Hadi Partovi]] joined Opower's board to advise on its [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/opower-growth/ "Opower to Expand to West Coast, Names iLike Founder Hadi Partovi to Advisory Board,"] TechCrunch, June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Opower opened a second office in [[San Francisco]] and had Fred Butler, a former president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and commissioner of the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]], join its advisory board.

In 2013, Opower added former utility CEOs John Rowe and Dick Kelly, and former White House Director, Carol Browner, to its advisory board. Tom Brady, former chairman of BGE, was named chairman of the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elp.com/articles/2013/06/former-ceos-of-xcel--exelon-join-opower.html "Former CEOs of Xcel, Exelon Join Opower], ''Electric Light &amp; Power'', June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Opower added Marcus Ryu, CEO of Guidewire, and Deep Nishar, SVP of Products and User Experience at LinkedIn, to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allthingsd.com/20130916/opower-adds-guidewires-marcus-ryu-and-linkedins-deep-nishar-to-board/ "Opower adds Guidewire's Marcus Ryu and Linkedin's Deep Nishar to board,"]"All Things Digital", September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] announced the company as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/NR_TP2011 Thirty-One Visionary Companies Selected as Technology Pioneers 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the company announced its third round of venture capital funding, a $50 million investment led by [[Accel Partners]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], to accelerate its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113000021.html "Opower plans expansion with $50 million investment,"] ''The Washington Post'', Nov. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to Opower headquarters in Arlington in 2010, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said the company's growth is "a model of what we want to be seeing all across the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House press release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Opower was named to the Inaugural CNBC Disruptors 50 List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100637276 "CNBC Disruptor 50"] CNBC, May 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Opower was named the #1 fastest-growing tech company in the DC region, and #20 in the US, by Deloitte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/TMT_us_tmt/us_tmt_fast500_rankings_110713.pdf "Technology Fast 500 2013 Ranking"], Deloitte, November 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Dan Yates gave the keynote address at the Cleantech Group's Cleantech Forum in San Francisco in March 2014. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1378&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=p-N2&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=156690981409924149615&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=193&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A156690981409924149615%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1378%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary/"Opower CEO Dan Yates #CFSF14 Keynote - Passion, Science, Incremental Change], Vimeo, March 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower held its [[initial public offering]] on April 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2014/04/04/opower-ipo-opens-up-strong-starts-trading-at-25-per-share/ "Opower IPO: Opens up strong, starts trading at $25 per share"], Gigaom, April 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower laid off&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2016/04/11/layoffs-at-arlington-based-opower/;|title=ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. Local News|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7.5 % of its global workforce on April 8, 2016.

On May 2, 2016, Opower announced that it was being acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://opower.com/oracle/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/oracle-agrees-to-buy-arlington-energy-data-firm-opower-for-532-million/2016/05/02/83739416-107f-11e6-93ae-50921721165d_story.html|title=Oracle agrees to buy Arlington energy data firm Opower for $532 million|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/opower/index.html|title=Oracle and Opower|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and technology ==
Opower's software uses statistical [[algorithm]]s to perform [[pattern recognition]] analysis from data in order to derive information for utility customers. Without any devices installed in the home, the platform can perform usage-disaggregation analysis, presenting end users information such as heating or cooling usage apart from overall usage, and thus allowing them to spot additional opportunities to save money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/opower-separates-heat-light-in-home-energy/ "Opower Separates Heat, Light in Home Energy,"] ''Greentech Media'', December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The average customer receiving the Opower platform has cut energy usage by more than 2.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-11-09/energy-use-neighbor-vs-dot-neighbor Energy Use: Neighbor vs. Neighbor]", ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] concluded in a June 2010 ''report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceee.org/pubs/e105.htm "Advanced Metering Initiatives and Residential Feedback Programs: A Meta-Review for Household Electricity-Saving Opportunities,"] American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that customer-feedback programs, like Opower, could boost [[energy security]], help the environment and save consumers money.

Opower's Energy Reports incorporate the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]] techniques of [[Robert Cialdini]], Opower's chief scientist and the author of ''Influence'', a 1984 book on persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/21/21climatewire-finding-the-weapons-of-persuasion-to-save-ene-8137.html?pagewanted=1;title "Finding the 'Weapons' of Persuasion to Save Energy,"] ''New York Times'', June 21, 2010, originally published in ClimateWire&lt;/ref&gt; The reports include targeted tips that seek to motivate customers to lower their energy consumption to the "normal" neighborhood rate. The reports also feature [[Smiley|smiley-face emoticons]] for the most energy-efficient homes, a feature that Opower added after research showed that some consumers who used less energy than average started using more once they knew the norm. The reports also compare energy usage among neighbors with similarly sized houses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-01-homeenergy01_ST_N.htm "Do you use more energy than your neighbors?"] ''USA Today'', 1 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The company mails the reports to consumers, but also offers the information in other formats, including internet portals, [[Text messaging|text messages]], email and in-home energy displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20003852-54.html?tag=mncol;title "Opower looks to add human touch to smart grid,"] CNET, May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Opower's software enables customers to input more information to generate recommendations about specific types of energy use, such as [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/02/opowers-new-marketplace-entices-homeowners-to-become-energy-efficient/ |title= OPOWER’s New Marketplace Entices Homeowners To Become Energy Efficient | work = [[The Daily Energy Report]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President Obama's visit ==
[[Image:OPOWER-Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Barack Obama]] President [[Barack Obama]] visited Opower headquarters in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] on March 5, 2010. He touted the company as an economic "success story" amid a troubled economy and as a "great emblem" for clean energy jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He made the visit two months after announcing a "$2.3 billion program"&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/08/news/economy/green_manufacturing_jobs/index.htm "Obama unveils $2.3 billion for clean energy jobs,"] ''CNN Money'', January 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of tax credits for "[[green job]]s." "The work you do here...is making homes more energy efficient, it's saving people money, it's generating jobs, and it's putting America on the path to a clean energy future", Obama said at Opower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972936_1973104,00.html?xid=rss-specials "Can Small Lifestyle Changes Lead to Huge CO2 Cuts?,"] Time, March 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House released a video of Obama's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9AkF3IYko "Creating New Jobs in a Clean Energy Economy,"] White House YouTube channel, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peonidin''' is an [[O-methylated anthocyanidin]] derived from [[Cyanidin]], and a primary [[plant]] [[pigment]]. Peonidin gives purplish-red hues to flowers such as the [[peony]], from which it takes its name, and roses. It is also present in some blue flowers, such as the [[morning glory]].

Like most [[Anthocyanidin|anthocyanidins]], it is [[pH]] sensitive, and changes from red to blue as pH rises because anthocyanidins are highly conjugated chromophores. When the pH is changed, the extent of the conjugation (of the double bonds) is altered, which alters the wavelength of light energy absorbed by the molecule. (Natural anthocyanidins are most stable in a very low pH environment; at pH 8.0, most become colorless.)  At pH 2.0, peonidin is cherry red; at 3.0 a strong yellowish pink; at 5.0 it is grape red-purple; and at 8.0 it becomes deep blue; unlike many anthocyanidins, however, it is stable at higher pH, and has been isolated as a blue colorant from the brilliant "Heavenly Blue" morning glory (''Ipomoea tricolor Cav cv'').

Because of its unusual color stability, a cafeyl-acylated buffered formulation of it has been patented for use as food coloring.

Peonidin, like many anthocyanidins, has shown potent inhibitory and apoptotic effects on cancer cells ''in vitro'', notably metastatic human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jung Yeon Kwon |author2=Ki Won Lee |author3=Haeng Jeon Hur |author4=Hyong Joo Lee | date = 2007 | title = Peonidin Inhibits Phorbol-Ester-Induced COX-2 Expression and Transformation in JB6 P+ Cells by Blocking Phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1095  | issue = 1 | pages = 513–520 | doi=10.1196/annals.1397.055 | pmid=17404064}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A very large question, however, has been raised about anthocyanidins' penetration and retention in human cells ''in vivo'', due to their rapid elimination from the human body.

By far the greatest dietary source of peonidin is raw [[cranberry|cranberries]], which contain 42&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g of fruit.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Blueberries, plums, grapes, and cherries also contain significant amounts, ranging from 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;mg/100&amp;nbsp;g. Only fresh fruit has been shown to contain significant peonidin; frozen blueberries have been shown to contain almost none.  Peonidin has been found in concentrations of up to 40&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g (cooked) of certain cultivars of purple fleshed sweet potatoes; the amount of peonidin varies greatly across cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://fsweb2.schaub.ncsu.edu/usdaars/acrobatpubs/s114-150/s132.pdf |author1=Van-Den Truong |author2=Nigel Deighton |author3=Roger T.

The higher level of peonidin in fresh fruit corresponds to the rule of thumb that more natural fruit is healthier. Specifically, the amount of phenolic compounds in cranberries has been found to be inversely correlated with fruit size and crop yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=574_32 | journal = ISHS Acta Horticulturae | volume = 574: VII International Symposium on Vaccinium Culture | title = Evaluation Of Fruit Chemistry In Cranberry Germplasm: Potential For Breeding Varieties With Enhanced Health Constituents |author1=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="891">'''Primary cremation'''  and '''secondary cremation''' are terms in [[archaeology]] for describing [[burial]]s of  [[Cremation|cremated]] bodies.

Primary cremation refers to burials where the body is burned "on the spot", in the grave. A secondary cremation is the burning of the body in one spot and then burying the remains and [[grave good]]s elsewhere. Secondary cremation may also more specifically refer to a cremation where the body is burned on a [[pyre]], after which the bones are collected from the ashes and buried elsewhere (Sprague 2005:138). A famous account of such a burial is that of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', describing the funeral of [[Patroclus]].

[[File:BelorusianSkomorokhs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belarus]]ian skomorokhs as they appear in a 1555 German etching]]

A '''skomorokh''' (скоморох in [[Russian language|Russian]], скоморохъ in [[Old East Slavic]], скоморaхъ in [[Church Slavonic]]) was a [[medieval]] East Slavic [[harlequin]], or actor, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for oral/musical and dramatic performances. The [[etymology]] of the word is not completely clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&amp;morpho=1&amp;basename=%5Cusr%5Clocal%5Cshare%5Cstarling%5Cmorpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;text_word=%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85&amp;method_word=substring Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary entry for skomorokh]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] σκώμμαρχος (cf. σκῶμμα, "joke"); from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaramuccia'' ("joker", cf. [[English language|English]] ''[[scaramouch]]''); from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''masẋara''; and many others.

The skomorokhs appeared in [[Kievan Rus]] no later than the mid-11th century, but [[fresco]] depictions of skomorokh musicians in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] date to the 11th century.

The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' on skomorokhs concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced them as devil servants. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church often railed against them and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God or being downright diabolical. For example [[Theodosius of Kiev]], one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the 11th century, called the skomorokhs "evils to be shunned by good Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Feodosii Pecherskii, ''Sochinenia'', I. I. (Izmail Ivanovich) Sreznevksii, ed., in ''Ucheniia zapiski vtorogo otdelenie Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk'', Vol. 2, no. 2, (St. Petersburg: Tipografii Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, 1856), 195; See Russell Zguta, "Skomorokhi: The Russian Minstrel-Entertainers", ''Slavic Review'' 31 No. 2 (June 1972), 297&amp;ndash;298; Idem, ''Russian Minstrels: A History of the Skomorokhi'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups, who considered them not just useless but even ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy.

They were persecuted in the years of the [[Mongol yoke]], when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. Its art reached its peak in the 15th to the 17th centuries. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches, called ''glumy'' (глумы), performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of [[domra]], [[balalaika]], [[gudok]], [[bagpipes]] or [[buben]] (a kind of [[tambourine]]). The appearance of [[Russian puppet theatre]] was directly associated with skomorokh performances.

Skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares, engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually, the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun-loving saucy ''[[muzhik]]'' (мужик) of comic simplicity. In the 16 and 17th centuries, skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a ''vataga'' (ватага, big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and civilian authorities. 

In 1648 and 1657, [[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei Mikhailovich]] issued [[ukase]]s banning skomorokh art as blasphemous, but actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century, skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|balagans|ru|3=Балаган}}'' (балаган) and ''[[rayok]]s'' (раёк).

[[Image:North Fork Mountain - Nelson Sods.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Nelson Sods''' on [[North Fork Mountain]], West Virginia]]

'''Sods''' is a term used in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] of eastern [[West Virginia]] for a mountain top [[meadow]] or [[bog]], in an area that is otherwise generally forested. The term is similar (perhaps identical) to that of a "[[grass bald]]", a more widespread designation applied throughout the central and southern [[Appalachia|Appalachian region]].

The best known example of a sods is [[Dolly Sods]], a federally designated [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness area]] in [[Tucker County, West Virginia]] and popular destination for recreationalists. Other examples include [[North Fork Mountain|Nelson Sods]] ([[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]]) and Baker Sods ([[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]]).

==Ecology==
[[West Virginia University]] botanist [[Earl L. Core]] addressed the origin of the "sods" in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How did it happen that these grassy tracts were originally [prior to white settlement] treeless, when all the surrounding areas were covered with trees? No one really knows. Although the "sods" and "balds" have been the subject of much speculation, discussion, and research, no generally-accepted explanation has yet been proposed for their existence. Perhaps there is not really any one cause; the treelessness may be the result of a complex situation which may vary from place to place. Factors suggested may be classified as natural or artificial. Among the natural have been listed climatic, edaphic (soil), topographic, biotic and pyric (fire).&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1973), "Allegheny Flyback at Dahle Sods", ''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]]'', 29 July; Reprinted in the same author's 1975 book ''The Wondrous Year: West Virginia Through the Seasons'', [[Grantsville, West Virginia]]: [[Seneca Books]], pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominant grass is [[Danthonia compressa|Allegheny flyback]] (''Danthonia compressa''), a grass so light in weight that it would "fly back" against the scythe of the mower.&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1974), ''The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. I: Prelude'', [[Parsons, W.Va.]]: [[McClain Printing Co.]], pp 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">'''Sperm-mediated gene transfer''' (SMGT) is a transgenic technique that transfers [[genes]] based on the ability of [[sperm cells]] to spontaneously bind to and internalize exogenous [[DNA]] and transport it into an oocyte during fertilization to produce genetically modified animals.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Exogenous DNA refers to DNA that originates outside of the organism. Transgenic animals have been obtained using SMGT, but the efficiency of this technique is low. Low efficiency is mainly due to low uptake of exogenous DNA by the spermatozoa, reducing the chances of fertilizing the oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In order to successfully produce transgenic animals by SMGT, the spermatozoa must attach the exogenous DNA into the head and these transfected spermatozoa must maintain their functionality to fertilize the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Genetically modified animals produced by SMGT are useful for research in biomedical, agricultural, and veterinary fields of study. SMGT could also be useful in generating animals as models for human diseases or lead to future discoveries relating to human gene therapy.

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Mechanism==

The method for SMGT uses the sperm cell, a natural vector of genetic material, to transport exogenous DNA. The exogenous DNA molecules bind to the cell membrane of the head of the sperm cell. This binding and internalization of the DNA is not a random event. The exogenous DNA interacts with the DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) that are present on the surface of the sperm cell.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Spermatozoa]] are naturally protected against the intrusion of exogenous DNA molecules by an inhibitory factor present in mammals’ seminal fluid. This factor blocks the binding of sperm cells and exogenous DNA because in the presence of the inhibitory factor, DBPs lose their ability to bind to exogenous DNA. In the absence of this inhibitory factor, DBPs on sperm cells are able to interact with DNA and can then translocate the DNA into the cell. Therefore, the seminal fluid must be removed from the sperm samples by extensive washing immediately after [[ejaculation]].&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; After the DNA is internalized, the exogenous DNA must be integrated into the genome. There are various mechanisms suggested for DNA integration, including integrating DNA at oocyte activation, at nucleus decondensation, or at the formation of the pronulcei, but all of these suggested mechanisms imply that the integration of DNA happens after the penetration of the sperm cell into the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Controversy==

Sperm-mediated gene transfer is considered controversial because despite the successes, it has not yet become established as a reliable form of genetic manipulation. Skepticism arises based on the assumption that evolutionary chaos could arise if sperm cells could act as vectors for exogenous DNA.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Reasonable assumption tells us that because reproductive tracts contain free DNA molecules, sperm cells should be highly resistant to the risk of picking up exogenous DNA molecules. SMGT has been demonstrated experimentally and followed the assumption that nature has barriers against SMGT. These barriers are not always absolute and could explain the inconsistent experimental outcomes of SMGT.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; If there are natural barriers against SMGT, then the successes may only represent unusual cases in which the barriers failed. Two barriers have been identified; the inhibitory factor in seminal fluid that prevents binding to foreign DNA molecules and a sperm endogenous nuclease activity that is triggered upon interaction of sperm cells with foreign DNA molecules.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; These protections give reason to believe that unintentional interactions between sperm and exogenous genetic sequences is kept to a minimal. These barriers allow for protection against the threat that every fertilization event could become a potentially mutagenic one.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

==Applications of Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer==

=== Animal Transgenesis ===

Transgenic animals have been produced successfully using gene transfer techniques such as sperm-mediated gene transfer. Though this production has been successful, the efficiency of the process is low. Low efficiency of SMGT in the production of transgenic animals is mainly due to poor uptake of the exogenous DNA by the sperm cells, thus reducing the number of fertilized oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; From 1989 to 2004, there were over 30 claims for the production of viable transgenic animals using SMGT, but only about 25 percent of these demonstrated a transmission of the transgenes beyond the F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; This transmission is required in order to claim usable animal transgenesis. According to previous studies, numerous animal species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish, have been found susceptible to SMGT techniques, thus indicating that SMGT has broad applicability across a wide variety of Metazoan species.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Currently, despite the low frequency of transmission of transgenes, the frequency of phenotype modifications and overall animal transgenesis has been as high as 80 percent in some experiments.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Gene Therapy ===

The potential use of sperm-mediated gene transfer for embryo somatic gene therapy is a possibility for future research. Embryo somatic gene therapy would be advantageous because there seems to be an inverse correlation between the age of the patient and the effectiveness of gene therapy. Therefore, the possibility of gene therapy treatment before irreversible damage occurs would be ideal.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A majority of the experiments that report successful SMGT provide evidence of post-fertilization transfer and maintenance of transgenes.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; SMGT has potential advantages of being a simple and cost-effective method of gene therapy, especially in contrast with pronuclear microinjection, another transgenic technique. Nevertheless, despite some successes and its potential utility, SMGT is not yet established as a reliable form of genetic modification.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Spinmechatronics''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|ɪ|n|əm|ɛ|k|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|n|ɪ|k|s}} is [[neologism]] referring to an emerging field of research concerned with the exploitation of [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent phenomena and established [[spintronic]] methodologies and technologies in conjunction with electro-mechanical, magno-mechanical, acousto-mechanical and opto-mechanical systems. Most especially, spinmechatronics (or spin mechatronics) concerns the integration of [[micro-]] and [[nano-]] [[mechatronic]] systems with [[spin (physics)|spin]] physics and [[spintronics]].

==History and origins==
While spinmechatronics has been recognised only recently &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spinmechatronics.org&lt;/ref&gt; (2008) as an independent field, hybrid [[spin (physics)|spin]]-mechanical system development dates back to the early nineteen-nineties,&lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"&gt;J A Sidles, Noninductive detection of single-proton magnetic resonance. Appl. Phys. Lett., 58(24):2854 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; with devices combining [[spintronics]] and [[micromechanics]] emerging at the turn of the twenty-first century.

One of the longest established spinmechatronic systems is the [[Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope]] or MRFM. First proposed by J. A. Sidles in a seminal paper of 1991 &lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"/&gt; – and since extensively developed both theoretically and experimentally by a number of international research groups&lt;ref&gt;D Rugar et al., Single spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy. Nature, 430, 329 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G de Loubens et al., Magnetic resonance studies of the fundamental spin-wave modes in individual submicron Cu/NiFe/Cu perpendicularly magnetized disks. Phys. Rev. Lett., 98 (12), 127601 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[MRFM]] operates by coupling a magnetically loaded [[micro-]]mechanical cantilever to an excited nuclear, [[proton]] or [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] system. The [[MRFM]] concept effectively combines scanning atomic force microscopy ([[Atomic force microscope|AFM]]) with [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] to provide a spectroscopic tool of unparalleled sensitivity. [[Nanometre]] resolution is possible, and the technique potentially forms the basis for ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-high resolution magnetic, biochemical, biomedical, and clinical diagnostics.

The synergy of micromechanics and established [[Spintronics|spintronic]] technologies for sensing applications is one of the most significant spinmechatronic developments of the last decade. At the beginning of this century, [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] sensors incorporating [[Magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive]] technologies emerged &lt;ref&gt;M Löhndorf et al., Highly sensitive strain sensors based on magnetic tunnelling junctions. Appl. Phys. Lett.,  81 (2), 313 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and a wide range of devices exploiting similar principles are likely to realize research and commercial potential by 2015.

Contemporary innovation in spinmechatronics drives forward the independent advancement of cutting-edge science in [[spin (physics)|spin physics]], [[spintronics]] and [[micro-]] and [[nano-]][[mechatronics]] and catalyses the development of wholly new instrumentation, [[Control engineering|control]] and fabrication techniques to facilitate and exploit their integration.

==Key constitutive technologies==

===Micro- and nano- mechatronics===
[[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]: [[micro-]][[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems are the key ingredient of [[micro-]][[mechatronics]]. Micro-electromechanical systems are – as the name suggests – devices with significant dimensions in the micrometre regime or less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memsnet.org/mems/what-is.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jwnc.gla.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Highly suited to integration with electronic and microwave circuitry, they provide the key to electro-mechanical functionalities unachievable with [[Classical physics|classical]] precision [[mechatronics]]. Commercialisation of mass-produced [[Microelectromechanical systems]] products is rapidly picking up pace and includes printer ink-jet technology, 3D [[accelerometer]]s, integrated pressure sensors, and [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) displays. At the cutting edge of [[Microelectromechanical systems]] fabrication and integration technologies are [[nano-]] [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/293&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]]). Typical examples are micrometres long, tens of [[nanometre]]s thick, and have mechanical resonance frequencies approaching 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. Their small physical dimensions and mass (of order [[pico-]][[gram]]s) makes them highly sensitive to changes in [[stiffness]]; this, their synergy with mechanical and data processing systems, and the option of attaching chemical/ biological molecules, makes them ideal for ultra high-performance mechanical, chemical and biological sensing applications.

===Spin physics===
Spin physics is a broad and active area of [[condensed-matter physics]] research. ‘[[Spin (physics)|Spin]]’ in this context refers to a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] property of certain [[elementary particle]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and should not be confused with the [[Classical mechanics|classical]] (and better-known) concept of [[rotation]]. Spin physics spans studies of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]], [[electron]] and [[proton]] [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], [[magnetism]], and certain areas of optics. [[Spintronics]] is a branch of spin physics. Perhaps the two best known applications of spin physics are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) and the spintronic giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head.

===Spintronics===
Spintronic [[magnetoresistance]] is a major scientific and commercial success story. Today, most families own a spintronic device: the giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head in their computer. The science that gave rise to this phenomenal business opportunity – and earned the 2007 [[Nobel Prize]] for Physics – was the recognition that electrical carriers are characterized by both [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref&gt;M N Baibich et al., Giant magnetoresistance of (001)Fe/(001)Cr magnetic superlattices. Phys. Rev. Lett., 61, 2472 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/phyadv07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|tunnelling-magnetoresistance]] (TMR) – which uses the electron spin as a label to allow or forbid [[electron]] [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]]&lt;ref&gt;J S Moodera et al., Large magnetoresistance at room temperature in ferromagnetic thin film tunnel junctions. Phys. Rev. Lett., 74 (16), 3273 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; – dominates the hard disk market and is rapidly establishing itself in areas as diverse as magnetic logic devices and biosensors.&lt;ref&gt;J Schotter et al., A Biochip based on magnetoresistive sensors. IEEE Trans. Magn., 38, 5, 3365 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing development is pushing the frontiers of TMR devices towards the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]].

The '''Edinburgh School''' refers to a group of 20th century artists connected with [[Edinburgh]]. Most studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] during or soon after the [[First World War]], and some taught there together in the mid-20th century. As friends and colleagues, they discussed painting and were influenced by one another's work. Art critic Giles Sutherland, writing in ''[[The Times]]'', has suggested: "The work of the Edinburgh School is characterised by virtuoso displays in the use of paint, vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and themes such as still-life, seascape and landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Giles Sutherland, the British art critic and writer, in ''The Times'' 6 Oct 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are generally thought of as Edinburgh School painters.

*[[William Crozier (Scottish artist)|William Crozier]]&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the artist [[William Crozier (Irish artist)|William Crozier]] who was born in Glasgow in 1930 and is associated with both Ireland and Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;   (1893–1930)
*[[William Geissler]] (1894–1963)
*[[William George Gillies|Sir William Gillies]] (1898–1973)
*[[William MacTaggart|Sir William MacTaggart]]&lt;ref&gt;William MacTaggart is often known as Sir William MacTaggart or William MacTaggart the Younger, to distinguish him from his grandfather [[William McTaggart]] (no 'a' after the 'M') who was also a painter.&lt;/ref&gt; (1903–1981)
*[[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]] (1905–1962)
*[[Robin Philipson|Sir Robin Philipson]] (1916–1992)
*[[Anne Redpath]] (1895–1965)
*[[Adam Bruce Thomson]] (1885–1976)

Some other painters associated with Edinburgh may also be called Edinburgh School artists, or a 'new generation' of the Edinburgh School.

The 'Edinburgh School' refers to a group of artists whose work shares certain characteristics and is not the same as the '[[Edinburgh School of Art]]'. This latter name is quite often used for the college even though it has been officially called Edinburgh College of Art since 1907.

'''The Milky Way Project''' is a [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project whose main goal is to identify [[stellar-wind bubble]]s in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Users classify sets of [[infrared]] images from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ([[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/about/research|title=Zooniverse|website=www.zooniverse.org|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe bubbles in these images are the result of young, massive stars whose light causes shocks in interstellar gas.

==Details==

The Milky Way Project works with data taken from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer Galactic Plane Survey (MIPSGAL) and Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE). Only a small part uses WISE data. The project looks for bubbles, which can mean the formation of stars. The project also looks for knots, star clusters, and other objects such as young stars, [[supernova]] remnants, and newly discovered galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milky Way Project|url=http://spacehack.org/project/milky-way-project|website=Spacehack|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Milky Way Project: Can you help?|url=http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=574|website=Night Sky Network|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory - California Institute of Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Milky Way Project started as the ninth Zooniverse project in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/06/26/coming-soon/|title=Coming Soon…|last=Zooniverse|first=The|date=2010-06-26|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/12/07/site-goes-live/|title=Site Goes Live|last=ttfnrob|date=2010-12-07|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''phase 1'' worked with the colors: 4.5 μm for blue, 8.0 μm for green and 24 μm for red. This resulted in the Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Milky Way Project in 2012 with 5,106 bubbles, which can also be found in [[SIMBAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=R. J.|last2=Povich|first2=M. S.|last3=Kendrew|first3=S.|last4=Lintott|first4=C.

The ''annulus tool'' that was used to mark the bubbles in the Milky Way Project ''phase 1'' was at random round and needed improvement. This problem was solved after the introduction of the ''ellipse tool''. This new tool was used in the ''phase 2'' of the project, short after DR1. This changed the classification and the tool does fit the actual shape of the bubbles. The phase 2 also used different colors: 3.6 μm for blue, 4.5 μm for green and 8.0 μm for red. The same three colors as [http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/?target=&amp;fov=3.00&amp;survey=P%2FGLIMPSE360 GLIMPSE 360 in Aladin Lite].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/a-brief-history-of-the-milky-way-project-why-we-still-need-your-help/ |title=A Brief History of the Milky Way Project: Why We (Still) Need Your Help |author=tharinduj96 |date=2016-10-12 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phase 3'' is also called Phoenix since it started after a year offline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/the-milky-way-project-phoenix/ |title=The Milky Way Project: Phoenix |last=Povich |first=Matthew S. |date=2016-09-15 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now active. Phase 3 uses the same colors as phase 1 and the same ellipse tool as phase 2, combining the strength of phase 1+2.

The Milky Way Project did also search for star clusters and galaxies. Phase 2 additionally did search for Extended Green Objects (EGO), 4.5 μm emissions that seem to be connected to [[Astrophysical maser|outflow from massive young stellar objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cyganowski|first=C.

They are now called ''yellow balls'', a mix of compact [[Star formation|star-forming regions]] that show transition into bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerton|first=C.

Phase 3 aims to create a reliable bubble catalog (DR2) with the data from phase 2+3 (4.4 million classifications), an improved yellowball catalog and the largest bowshock catalog to date. For this goal the 24 μm part of the image is important: Bubbles are more easy to spot and bowshocks are most of the time visible at this wavelength.

The ''MWP classification aggregation pipeline'' is continuously tested and modified to avoid issues that were encountered in DR1.

A '''thermal vacuum chamber''' is a [[vacuum chamber]] in which the [[Radiation|radiative]] thermal environment is controlled.

Typically the thermal environment is achieved by passing [[liquid]]s or [[fluid]]s through thermal shrouds for cold [[temperature]]s or through the application of thermal [[Lamp (fixture)|lamps]] for high [[temperature]]s.

Thermal vacuum chambers are frequently used for testing [[spacecraft]] or parts thereof under a simulated [[Outer space|space]] environment.

[[File:Trapped key interlock switchgear door.JPG|thumb|This is a trapped key interlock on the door of an electrical switchgear cabinet. It is attached with one-way security screws to discourage casual removal, which would defeat the interlock scheme.]]
 
'''Trapped key interlocking''' utilizes [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s and [[key (lock)|key]]s for sequential control of equipment and machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting.

A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.

Trapped key interlocks were used in the [[French railway system]] in the 1890s to control track switching operations. French inventor was Mr Bourré. His original company is now known as STI, Serv Trayvou Interverrouillage SA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servtrayvou.comm/ S.T.I.]&lt;/ref&gt;. Later on,  the Englishman James Harry Castell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castell.com/ Castell]&lt;/ref&gt; (1880-1953), Frenchman, B. Trayvou&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servtrayvou.comm/ S.T.I.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the American R. L. Kirk &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkkey.com/|title=Kirk|website=KirkKey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed trapped key interlocking systems, and such systems are often referred to as '''Castell''' or '''Bourre Keys''' or '''Trayvou keys''' or '''Kirk key''' interlock systems. Both worked in the [[Electricity generation|power generation]] and distribution industries in the early part of the 20th century, and both pioneered the use of trapped key interlock for switchgear control. Trapped key interlocks can be found in many industrial settings including electrical utilities, railway, petroleum, and chemical plants as a response to [[occupational safety and health]] legislation.

==Interlock devices==
A typical trapped-key interlock device consists of a lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a cam.  The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock.  Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.

Some complex sequences use key exchange blocks or boxes, that allow alternative sequences of operation.
Interlock devices may have an electrical solenoid which holds the key until an electrical circuit is interrupted; for example, the power supply for a high-voltage cabinet has been de-energized, releasing a key to allow access to the interior of the cabinet. Some interlocks include a time delay function or a rotation detector to ensure a machine has had time to come to a stop before allowing the next step of an interlock sequence to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Macdonald|title=Practical Machinery Safety|publisher=Newnes|date=2004|isbn=0750662700|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key exchange block may only hold and release keys and may not have a bolt to interlock process equipment, or may be part of the interlock of a particular machine or device. 
	
[[File:Trapped key interlock transfer block.JPG|thumb|This is a transfer block, part of a trapped key interlock system. It does not have a bolt to stop operation of a device, but holds and releases other keys.]]

Manufacturers of trapped key interlock devices provide application guides showing typical interlock problems and recommended arrangements. Since the reliability and safety of the scheme critically depends on the possession of keys, duplicate keys must be carefully controlled to prevent any possibility of an unsafe operating sequence. For example, a lost key might be replaced only by a duplicate held off-site, or might require ordering a replacement from the original manufacturer.

==Example==
For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric [[kiln]] while it is operating, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. Whenever the kiln power switch is turned on, the key is automatically held by the interlock, and cannot be manually removed. In order to open the kiln door, the power switch must first be turned off, which releases the key and allows it to be removed from the interlock. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the power switch from being turned on. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the power switch interlock.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Fraser, ''The electric kiln: a user's manual'' 2nd edition, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

A '''turncoat''' is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a [[traitor]], as the switch mostly takes place under the following circumstances:
*In groups, often driven by one or more leaders.
*When the goal that formerly motivated and benefited the person becomes (or is perceived as having become) either [[Unwinnable|no longer feasible]] or [[Pyrrhic victory|too costly even if success is achieved]].

From a military perspective, opposing armies generally wear uniforms of contrasting colors to prevent incidents of [[Friendly fire]].  Thus the term "turn-coat" indicates that an individual has changed sides and his uniform coat to one matching the color of his former enemy.  For example, in the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century, [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army (see '''Examples''' below).

==Historical context==
Even in a modern historical context "turncoat" is often synonymous with the term "[[wikt:renegade|renegade]]", a term of religious origins having its origins in the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''"renegare"'' (to deny). Historical currents of great magnitude have periodically caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in their wake. In such a dire situation new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal treason becomes muddled. One example would be the situation that led to the [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'', signed on July 26, 1581 in the Netherlands, an instance where changing sides was given a positive meaning.

The first written use of the term meaning  was by J. Foxe in ''Actes &amp; Monumentes'' in 1570: "One who changes his principles or party; a renegade; an apostate." Cited 1571*&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] "turncoat, n. and adj." cites "John Foxe · The first volume of the ecclesiasticall history contaynyng the actes and monumentes of thynges passed..in this realme · Rev. ed., 1570 (2 vols.)."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Turncoat" could also have a more literal origin. According to the Rotuli Chartarum 1199–1216 two barons changed fealty from [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]],&lt;ref&gt;David Crouch. 2002. William Marshal. Knighthood, War and Chivalry, 1147–1219. Longman. London&lt;/ref&gt; to [[John, King of England|King John]]. In other words, they turned their coats (of arms) from one lord to another, hence turncoat.

==Process==
A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during [[military occupation]], after a nation has been defeated in [[war]] or after a major social upheaval, such as a [[revolution]]. Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the area in question quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival.

Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to [[Secrecy (sociology)|privileged information]] and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in [[dictatorships]] and [[authoritarian]] states when most of the population has been fed [[propaganda]] and [[triumphalism]] and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.

==Aftermath==
As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of [[Deception|burying and rewriting]] the past by [[Cover-up|concealing evidence]]. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashed]] to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|falsification]] of historical events.

Even after the death of a turncoat his family and friends may wish to keep uncomfortable secrets from the past out of the light. There is a fear of loss of prestige as well as a wish to honor the memory of a family member from the part of those who have experienced the positive side of the person.

In certain countries, individuals and organizations have actively investigated the past to bring turncoats to justice to face their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html Jean-Paul Cointet, ''Epuration légale: 400 000 dossiers, moins de 800 morts''; Historia (fr)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910175241/http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html |date=2004-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
There were many turncoats in:

*The [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century.  The siege of [[Corfe Castle]] was won by [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers when they turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army.&lt;ref&gt;[S03E10 Great British Railway Journeys]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the revolution of the British American colonies when U.S. Continental Army Major General [[Benedict Arnold]] defected to the side of the British in May 1779.
*Canada during the [[War of 1812]]. Some Canadians felt [[republican democracy]] was a better system of government than the [[British Monarchy]] and fought on the side of the invading Americans. Conversely the [[United Empire Loyalists]] left what was to be the United States and moved North to remain under British rule.
*Germany and Austria after World War II when many former enthusiastic members of the [[Nazi Party]] embraced the newly created nations of [[West Germany]] or [[East Germany]] and sought to erase or at least minimize their former role as Nazis. During the  decades that followed many former Nazis regained prestige and held high posts in the new republics. [[Kurt Waldheim]], an Austrian Nazi, even held the highest post at the [[UN]] for a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1934744.ece ''Kurt Waldheim, Austrian head of the UN who as president of his country was later tainted by charges of complicity in Nazi atrocities'', Timesonline&lt;/ref&gt;

{{this|water use in plant metabolism|water use efficiency by humans|Water efficiency}}

'''Water-use efficiency (WUE)''' refers to the [[ratio]] of [[water]] used in [[plant metabolism]] to water lost by the [[plant (botanical)|plant]] through [[transpiration]]. Two types of water-use efficiency are referred to most frequently:

*[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] water-use efficiency (also called intrinsic or instantaneous water-use efficiency), which is defined as the ratio of the rate of [[carbon assimilation]] (photosynthesis) to the rate of transpiration, and
* water-use efficiency of productivity (also called integrated water-use efficiency), which is typically defined as the ratio of [[biomass]] produced to the rate of transpiration.

Increases in water-use efficiency are commonly cited as a response mechanism of plants to moderate to severe [[soil]] water deficits, and has been the focus of many programs that seek to increase [[crop]] tolerance of [[drought]]. However, there is some question as to the benefit of increased water-use efficiency of plants in [[agricultural systems]], as the processes of increased yield production and decreased transpirational water loss (that is, the main driver of increases in water-use efficiency) are fundamentally opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, M. ''Water Use Efficiency in Plant Biology.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|1-4051-1434-7}}. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If there existed a situation where water deficit induced lower transpirational rates without simultaneously decreasing photosynthetic rates and biomass production, then water-use efficiency would be both greatly improved and a desired trait in [[crop productivity|crop production]].

'''European countries''' have had varying policies that confine '''women and military service''' or the extent of their participation in the national [[armed services]] of their respective countries, especially [[combatant]] roles in [[armed conflicts]] or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the [[enemy]], most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the [[First World War]] when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a [[career]] path or [[profession]] in the national armed services of their country as well as permit [[conscription]] equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all.

==Denmark==

Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|7}} the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as "concripts").&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex.

==Finland==

The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950194 Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995)] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females. In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for sanitary articles and smallclothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naiset.dsp Finnish Defence Forces.

Yearly, some 500 women complete the voluntary military service, while some 30,000 men complete the obligatory conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Finnish Defence Forces.

The women who have completed the voluntary military service are eligible for further military employment. If they have at least NCO training, they can apply for career NCO positions or for officer training. These career paths have been open since 1996, when the first women completed the military service. In 2005, 32 female career officers were in service. The number of female warrant officers was 16 and the number of female specialist officers 7. In comparison, there were a total of 2.584 officers and 894 specialist officers in service. The women made up about 16% of the total career NCO cadre. However, most of these career NCOs were grandfathered former female enlistees who had not undertaken military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/toiminnantuloksellisuus/pdf/htp05.pdf Finnish Defence Forces.

[[Image:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Red Guard soldier from [[Finnish Civil War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War. The fighting women of the Reds were shunned in the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] propaganda but in the Red side propaganda they were admired and also compared to the "[[amazons]] of old".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanha.hum.utu.fi/historia/raunistula/yhteiskunta/naiskaarti/kaarti7.html Hakala, A.

While the ''Lottas'' were not front line fighting units per sé, as a paramilitary organization they handled several important second-line duties freeing men to the actual fighting service. A voluntary Lotta unit manned a searchlight battery of Finnish [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in defense of Helsinki in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&amp;pid=36&amp;aid=530 Valonheitinlotat - ainutlaatuinen osa historiaa].

In 1961, the Finnish Defence Forces started to enlist females for second-line duties. The duties available to women were radar operator, sea-control person, and C3 person. Most of the female enlisted served in coastal artillery and [[Finnish Air Force]]. The women enlisted all served in the rank of ''värvätty'' (enlisted), using a special female uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soal.fi/tietopankki/index.php?group=00000210&amp;mag_nr=5 Sotilasammattiliitto SoAL ry.

In the beginning of the year 2007, the term enlisted (''värvätty'') was changed to NCO (''aliupseeri'') to better recognize the change in the duties of this personnel group. The female enlistees who had not undertaken military service were grandfathered. They remain in the rank of enlistee unless they complete the conscript NCO course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/tyojakoulutus/tehtavat/aliupseerit.dsp Aliupseerit: Sotilasammattihenkilöistä aliupseereiksi.] Finnish Defence Forces.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. At first, the women without previous military training experienced rather large problems in the Finnish peace-keeping units, most remarkably in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the mid-1990s. Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces. All duties in Finnish foreign operations are open to women, provided they have the necessary military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat/45min_2003/arkisto.shtml?91386 Naisista tasa-arvoisia rauhanturvaajia.] MTV3 news service.

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[Cantinières]]. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy.

[[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the [[Women in the French Resistance|French Resistance]].

Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in [[Luftwaffe]] artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/women-combat.htm D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' ([[Medical corps]]) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''[[Generalarzt]]'' (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female [[electronics technician]] argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance-Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing "it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1097492.stm Women join German fighting forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratrooper), aboard [[submarine]]s and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied [[military medicine]] or [[Military band|military-band]] roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, "The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1842630,00.html Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers. The German Bundeswehr now expects the percentage of all female personnel to rise to about 15 percent in the middle-term future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd443DgwBSUGYAfqR6GIBIQixoJRUfW99X4_83FT9AP2C3NCIckdHRQAlYgRn/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfQ180QTc!?yw_contentURL=/C1256EF4002AED30/W27DXCZE807INFODE/content.jsp Starke Truppe – Immer mehr Frauen entscheiden sich für die Bundeswehr (Powerful troop - more and more women join the Bundeswehr)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the first woman in the German air force received her jet-fighter licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6562/Content/EN/Artikel/2006/09/2006-09-26-erste-frau-im-jet-cockpit__en.html First woman to attain air force qualification as jet pilot]&lt;/ref&gt; A handful more are flying helicopters and transport planes.

==Ireland==
The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Italian Social Republic]] established the Female Volunteer Unit ({{lang-it|Corpo volontario femmnile}}) as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in [[Southern Italy]] during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the [[Italian Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm Informagiovani]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3 L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx Ministero della Difesa]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside the organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and of [[Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM]]. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno Esercito.difesa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in Norway have been serving in military roles since 1938. During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959.

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. 
In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military [[submarines]]

In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to extend [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.&lt;ref name="NMMSW"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/197152-norway-army-women-military-conscripts/ Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women]&lt;/ref&gt; It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt; Women born in 1997 and onwards will also be subject to conscription during wartime.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt;

As of 2017, 1341 of the 11596 military personnel in the Norwegian military forces were women (12%). Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. c&lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force.

==Poland==
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm Women in Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college [[nursing]] or [[veterinary]] degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army - in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{Main| Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was [[Nadezhda Durova]] who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army.

During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm Women's Death Battalion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They're not allowed in combat roles, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Russian army runs the [[Miss Russian Army]] beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that "Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the [[armed forces]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Soviet Union: 1917–1991===

{{Main| Soviet women in the Great Patriotic War}}
Women had the legal right to serve in the [[Red Army|Soviet Armed Forces]] throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LyudmilaPavlichenko1.jpg|thumb|Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] --&gt;

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/obrien.html] who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers.

In 1942 the [[Soviet Union]] formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in [[Polikarpov Po-2]] biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the "Nachthexen" ("[[Night Witches]]"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. [[Lydia Litvyak|"Lily" Litvak]] and [[Katya Budanova]] became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army.

In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves.

In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in [[post-Soviet countries]] still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls.

==Serbia==
 {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]]. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id%3D11756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
[[File:Breguet 19 Sabiha.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937]]
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Women may now join the British Armed forces in all roles except those whose "primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy": [[British Army Infantry|Infantry]], [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Royal Marines|Royal Marines Commandos]], [[RAF Regiment]], [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]]. In addition medical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} used to preclude service in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] or as Mine Clearance Divers, but in May 2014 it was announced that three women had become the RN's first female submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however, permitted access to special force's support units, such as commando engineers and are cleared to join the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]], a largely unknown branch of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] that does not bar women from joining.

Female personnel currently make up around 9% of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm Defence Factsheet, Women in the Armed Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929073139/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm |date=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female combatants can be found throughout Britain’s military history.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6502847.stm article] on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example is Queen [[Boudica]], who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women.

In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as [[Ethelfleda]] of Mercia, [[Matilda of England]], [[Isabella of France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou]] commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the [[English Civil War]]. Charles I's consort, [[Henrietta Maria of France]] was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643.

During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting [[surgeon]]s.

During [[World War I]] the British Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

Prior to [[World War II]], in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available.

In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army.

The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8&amp;nbsp;km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, ''Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army,'' Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of [[HMNB Clyde|HM Naval Base, Clyde]], Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer.

The [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|seizure]] of [[Royal Navy]] sailor [[Faye Turney]] in 2007 by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2411286.ece |title= Only the capture of Prince Harry could have done more damage |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commander-in-chief]] of the British Armed Forces is a woman ([[Queen Elizabeth II]]) though her position is only nominal.
