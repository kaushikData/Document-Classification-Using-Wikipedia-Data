      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3975">'''Alice Nzomukunda''' (born 12 April 1966) is a [[Burundi]]an politician and former [[Vice-President of Burundi|Second Vice-President]] of the country, from 29 August 2005 to 5 September 2006. She is an ethnic [[Hutu]] and was a member of the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD-FDD).

According to the constitution, Burundi's Second Vice-President is responsible for economic and social affairs. Nzomukunda was nominated by [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President]] [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] on 29 August 2005. She was endorsed by both chambers of [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] ([[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]] – 109 votes 'for', none 'against' and 46 votes 'for', 2 'against' in the [[Senate of Burundi|Senate]]) and immediately sworn in. She is originally from the capital city of [[Bujumbura]].

On 5 September 2006, Nzomukunda resigned as Second Vice-President,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/burundi/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=PAN60026lasitnannai0 "La situation du Burundi "reste précaire", selon Kofi Annan"], Panapress (Jeuneafrique.com), 4 November 2006 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steps&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5316690.stm "Burundi VP steps down over graft"], BBC News, 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; citing corruption and [[human rights]] abuses by the government, as well as casting doubt on the authenticity of a coup plot which saw former [[President of Burundi|president]] [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] arrested&lt;ref name=Steps/&gt; a few weeks before on August 21. She was replaced as Second Vice-President by [[Marina Barapama]].

Nzomukunda subsequently became First Vice-President of the [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=Entame&gt;[http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200802110206.html "Burundi: Le CNDD-FDD entame le processus de chasser Alice Nzomukunda du bureau de l'Assemblée Nationale."], ''Burundi Réalités'', Bujumbura (allAfrica.com), 10 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, Nzomukunda was expelled from the CNDD-FDD "for internal disciplinary reasons" at an extraordinary congress of the party. The CNDD-FDD also decided to remove her from her post as First Vice-President of the National Assembly,&lt;ref name=Main&gt;[http://en.afrik.com/news11337.html "Burundi’s main opposition party suspends participation in parliament"], Panapress (Afrik.com), February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 8 February 2008 it was announced in the National Assembly that her post was vacant; according to [[Evariste Ndayishimiye]], the President of the CNDD-FDD Parliamentary Group, since Nzomukunda had been expelled from the CNDD-FDD, she was no longer part of its parliamentary group, "did not represent anything", and was not entitled to the post of First Vice-President of the National Assembly. Other parties in the National Assembly disputed this, however, arguing that such a decision would have to be made by the National Assembly as a whole, not by a single party.&lt;ref name=Entame/&gt; The [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU) suspended its participation in the National Assembly to protest the use of force against Nzomukunda. Ndayishimiye said that parliamentary affairs should not be disrupted by internal party matters and alleged that FRODEBU had secret reasons for defending Nzomukunda.&lt;ref name=Main/&gt;

[[Saint]] '''Aloysius de Gonzaga''', [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ({{lang-it|Luigi Gonzaga}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/tag/name-aluigi/|title=CatholicSaints.Info   » Name Aluigi|website=catholicsaints.info|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9 March 1568{{spaced ndash}}21 June 1591) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] who became a member of the [[Society of Jesus]]. While still a student at the [[Roman College]], he died as a result of caring for the victims of a serious epidemic. He was  [[Beatification|beatified]] in 1605 and [[canonization|canonized]] in 1726.

== Early life&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt; ==
Gonzaga was born the eldest of seven children,&lt;ref name="dublin2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonzaga.ie/aloysius_gonzaga.html|title=Aloysius Gonzaga|publisher=Gonzaga College, Dublin|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his family's castle in [[Castiglione delle Stiviere]], between [[Brescia]] and [[Mantua]] in northern [[Italy]] in what was then part of the [[Duchy of Mantua]], into the illustrious [[House of Gonzaga]]. "Aloysius" is the Latin form of Aloysius de Gonzaga's given name in Italian, Luigi.&lt;ref name="univ2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/About/Mission/Who-Aloysius.asp|title=Who is Aloysius Gonzaga?|publisher=Gonzaga University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105231116/http://www.gonzaga.edu/About/Mission/Who-Aloysius.asp|archivedate=5 January 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=24 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Ferrante de Gonzaga (1544–1586), [[Marquis]] of Castiglione, and Marta Tana di [[Santena]], daughter of a baron of the [[Piedmont]]ese [[Della Rovere]] family.  His mother was a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Elisabeth of Valois|Isabel]], the wife of [[Philip II of Spain]].

As the first-born son, he was in line to inherit his father's title and status of Marquis.&lt;ref name="univ2"/&gt; His father assumed that Aloysius would become a soldier, as that was the norm for sons of the aristocracy and the family was often involved in the minor wars of the period. His military training started at an early age, but he also received an education in languages and the arts. As early as age four, Luigi was given a set of miniature guns and accompanied his father on training expeditions so that the boy might learn “the art of arms”.&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt; At age five, Aloysius was sent to a military camp to get started on his training. His father was pleased to see his son marching around camp at the head of a platoon of soldiers. His mother and his tutor were less pleased with the vocabulary he picked up there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= http://www.loyolapress.com/saint-aloysius-gonzaga.htm |author=Sisters of Notre Dame of Chardon, Ohio| title= Saints and Feast Days| publisher=Loyola Press|isbn= 978-0-8294-1505-6 | year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aloysius Gonzaga child.jpg|thumb|upright|Aloysius de Gonzaga as a boy]]
He grew up amid the violence and brutality of [[Renaissance]] Italy and witnessed the murder of two of his brothers.&lt;ref name="univ2"/&gt; In 1576, at age 8, he was sent to [[Florence]] along with his younger brother, Rodolfo, to serve at the court of the Grand Duke [[Francesco I de' Medici]] and to receive further education.&lt;ref name=oconor&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Conor|first=John Francis Xavier|title=St. Aloysius Gonzaga. The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1|year=1907|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01331c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there, he fell ill with a disease of the kidneys, which troubled him throughout his life. While he was ill, he took the opportunity to read about the saints and to spend much of his time in prayer. He is said to have taken a private vow of [[chastity]] at age 9. In November 1579, the brothers were sent to the [[Duke of Mantua]]. Aloysius was shocked by the violent and frivolous lifestyle he encountered there.

Aloysius returned to Castiglione where he met [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinal]] [[Saint Charles Borromeo|Charles Borromeo]], and from him received First Ces in [[India]], Aloysius felt strongly that he wanted to become a missionary.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley, O.F.M.|first=Leonard|title=Saint of the Day|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He started practicing by teaching [[catechism]] classes to young boys in Castiglione in the summers. He also repeatedly visited the houses of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[friar]]s and the [[Barnabite]]s located in [[Casale Monferrato]], the capital of the Gonzaga-ruled [[Duchy of Montferrat]] where the family spent the winter. He also adopted an [[ascetic]] lifestyle.
{{Jesuit}}
The family was called to Spain in 1581 to assist the [[Holy Roman Empress]] [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]]. They arrived in [[Madrid]] in March 1582, where Aloysius and Rodolfo became pages for the young [[Infante]] [[Diego, Prince of Asturias|Diego]].&lt;ref name=oconor/&gt; Aloysius started thinking in earnest about joining a [[order (religious)|religious order]]. He had considered joining the Capuchins, but he had a Jesuit confessor in Madrid and decided instead to join that order. His mother agreed to his request, but his father was furious and prevented him from doing so.

In July 1584, a year and a half after the Infante's death, the family returned to Italy. Aloysius still wanted to become a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], but several members of his family worked hard to persuade him to change his mind. When they realized there was no way to make him give up his plan, they tried to persuade him to become a [[secular clergy|secular priest]] and offered to arrange for a [[Diocese|bishopric]] for him. If he were to become a Jesuit he would renounce any right to his inheritance or status in society.&lt;ref name=coulson&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cin.org/saints/aloysius.html |last= Coulson| first= John| title=The Saints: A Concise Biographical Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family's attempts to dissuade him failed; Aloysius was not interested in higher office and still wanted to become a missionary.

== Religious life ==
In November 1585, Aloysius gave up all rights of inheritance, which was confirmed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]]. He went to [[Rome]] and, because of his noble birth, gained an audience with [[Pope Sixtus V]]. Following a brief stay at the [[Palazzo Aragona Gonzaga]], the Roman home of his cousin, Cardinal [[Scipione Gonzaga]], on 25 November 1585 he was accepted into the [[novitiate]] of the Society of Jesus in Rome. During this period, he was asked to moderate his asceticism somewhat and to be more social with the other novices.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;

Aloysius' health continued to cause problems. In addition to the kidney disease, he also suffered from a skin disease, chronic headaches and [[insomnia]]. He was sent to [[Milan]] for studies, but after some time he was sent back to Rome because of his health. On 25 November 1587, he took the three religious [[vows]] of [[chastity, poverty and obedience]]. In February and March 1588, he received [[minor orders]] and started studying [[theology]] to prepare for [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. In 1589, he was called to [[Mantua]] to mediate between his brother Rodolfo and the Duke of Mantua. He returned to Rome in May 1590. It is said that, later that year, he had a vision in which the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] told him that he would die within a year.

[[File:St. Aloysius Gonzaga. St. Joseph's Church, Macao..JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, St. Joseph's Church, [[Macao]]]]
In 1591, a [[pandemic|plague]] broke out in Rome. The Jesuits opened a hospital for the stricken, and Aloysius volunteered to work there.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; After begging alms for the victims, Aloysius began working with the sick, carrying the dying from the streets into a hospital founded by the Jesuits. There he washed and fed the plague victims, preparing them as best he could to receive the sacraments. But though he threw himself into his tasks, he privately confessed to his spiritual director, Fr. [[Robert Bellarmine]], that his constitution was revolted by the sights and smells of the work; he had to work hard to overcome his physical repulsion.

At the time, many of the younger Jesuits had become infected with the disease, and so Aloysius’s superiors forbade him from returning to the hospital. But Aloysius—long accustomed to refusals from his father—persisted and requested permission to return, which was granted. Eventually he was allowed to care for the sick, but only at another hospital, called Our Lady of Consolation, where those with contagious diseases were not admitted. While there, Aloysius lifted a man out of his sickbed, tended to him, and brought him back to his bed. But the man was infected with the plague. Aloysius grew ill and was bedridden by 3 March 1591, a few days before his 23rd birthday.

Aloysius rallied for a time, but as fever and a cough set in, he declined for many weeks. It seemed certain that he would die in a short time, and he was given [[Anointing of the Sick|Extreme Unction]]. While he was ill, he spoke several times with his confessor, the cardinal and later saint, [[Robert Bellarmine]]. Aloysius had another vision and told several people that he would die on the [[octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/stream/lifeofsaintaloys00cepauoft#page/n11/mode/2up |last= Cepari |first=Virgil, S.J. |title= Life of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga| page= 232| publisher=Benziger Brothers| location= New York| year= 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, 21 June 1591, he seemed very well in the morning, but insisted that he would die before the day was over. As he began to grow weak, Bellarmine gave him the [[last rites]] and recited the prayers for the dying. He died just before midnight. As Fr. Tylenda tells the story, "When the two Jesuits came to his side, they noticed a change in his face and realized that their young Aloysius was dying. His eyes were fixed on the crucifix he held in his hands, and as he tried to pronounce the name of Jesus he died."&lt;ref name=craughwell&gt;{{cite web|last=Craughwell|first=Thomas J.|title=Patron Saints for Modern Challenges|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Nov2002/Feature2.asp#F4|work=St. Anthony Messenger|publisher=American Catholic|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marmoutier Abbaye 96.jpg|thumb|Painting of Aloysius Gonzaga in [[Marmoutier Abbey, Alsace]], France]]

Purity was his notable virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= William |last=James|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|page=258 |publisher=Penguin Books|year= 1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AezbiIYHssC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[mysticism|mystic]] St. Maria [[Magdalena de Pazzi]] claimed to have had a vision of him on 4 April 1600. She described him as radiant in glory because of his "interior works," a hidden martyr for his great love of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/stream/thelifeofstmarym00fabruoft#page/n151/mode/2up |last= Fabrini| first= Placido |title= The Life of St Mary Magdalen De-Pazzi| year= 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneration ==
[[Image:Tiepolo Gonzaga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Saint Aloysius Gonzaga in Glory'' by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], incomplete provenance]]
Aloysius was buried in the Church of the Most Holy Annunciation, which later became the church of [[Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Rome|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] (Sant'Ignazio) in Rome.&lt;ref name="dublin2"/&gt; His name was changed to "Robert" before his death, in honor of his confessor. Many people considered him to be a saint soon after his death, and his remains were moved into the Sant'Ignazio church, where they now rest in an urn of [[lapis lazuli]] in the Lancellotti Chapel. His head was later translated to the basilica bearing his name in [[Castiglione delle Stiviere]]. He was beatified only fourteen years after his death by [[Pope Paul V]], on 19 October 1605. On 31 December 1726, he was canonized together with another Jesuit novice, [[Stanislaus Kostka]], by [[Pope Benedict XIII]].

==Patronage==
In 1729, Pope Benedict XIII declared Aloysius de Gonzaga to be the [[patron saint]] of young students. In 1926, he was named patron of all Christian youth by [[Pope Pius XI]]. Owing to the manner of his death, he has been considered a patron saint of plague victims. For his compassion and courage in the face of an incurable disease, Aloysius Gonzaga has become the patron both of [[AIDS]] sufferers and their caregivers.&lt;ref name=craughwell/&gt; Aloysius is also the patron of [[Valmontone]], a town in [[Lazio]].

==Iconography==
In art, St Aloysius is shown as a young man wearing a black [[cassock]] and [[surplice]], or as a [[Page (occupation)|page]]. His attributes are a [[lily]], referring to innocence; a [[cross]], referring to piety and sacrifice; a skull, referring to his early death; and a [[rosary]], referring to his devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/life-times-st-aloysius-gonzaga |last= Martin |first= James, S.J.| title=The Life of Times of St. Aloysius Gonzaga| journal= America| date= 20 June 2011| accessdate= 27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church.png|thumb|St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on the campus of [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]]]
Saint Aloysius' [[feast day]] is celebrated on 21 June, the date of his death. 
 
Gonzaga College High School: Washington Seminary, as Gonzaga was originally called, began classes for lay students in 1821 in the heart of Washington, D.C. and was later renamed Gonzaga College.  [[Gonzaga College High School]] is a Catholic college preparatory school for boys in grades 9-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sketch of Gonzaga College from its Foundation in 1821 till the Celebration of the Diamond Jubilee in 1896 |author=Gonzaga College |year= 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on the campus of Gonzaga High School in Washington DC is used for the Graduation ceremonies of the Gonzaga.  It had been an operating parish church until 2016.  When the church was formally dedicated in 1859, [[The New York Times]] wrote, "In internal architectural beauty, it is said not to be surpassed by any church in the world."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[St. Aloysius Senior Secondary School]]s are established throughout India.

Several buildings and institutions in [[Spokane, Washington]] are named after Gonzaga. [[Gonzaga University]] is a [[Roman Catholic]] university which also has St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church on its campus, which is overseen by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane|diocese of Spokane]]. [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]] is a private, Roman Catholic high school. Finally, St. Aloysius Gonzaga Catholic School is a K-8 school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vergara|first1=Matt|title=St. Aloysius School in Spokane celebrates 100 years|url=http://www.krem.com/news/local/spokane-county/st-aloysius-school-in-spokane-celebrates-100-years/315548596|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=KREM2 News|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Joseph in [[Gelsenkirchen]], the location of German soccer club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], has a glass window of the saint with a soccer ball and refers to the club colors and its strong fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der Fußball-Heilige wacht über die St.-Joseph-Kirche in Schalke|url = https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/gelsenkirchen/der-fussball-heilige-wacht-ueber-die-st-joseph-kirche-in-schalke-id4859975.html|website = WAZ|access-date = 2016-02-06|first = Felix zur|last = Nieden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Aloysius' death, on his feast day in 1608, the three daughters of his brother, Rodolfo, established a community of women dedicated to education, under the formal name of the [[Noble Virgins of Jesus]]. This community still exists, although {{as of|2012|lc=y}} it is currently reduced to two members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.diocesidimantova.it/istituto.asp?id=18 |title=Religious Institutes of the Diocese of Mantua, Italy |access-date=2012-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122195104/http://www.diocesidimantova.it/istituto.asp?id=18 |archive-date=2010-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work The Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Fr. John Croiset mentions St. Aloysius' devotion to the Sacred Heart.

[[image:Weighing of the heart3.jpg|thumb|This detail scene from the [[Papyrus]] of [[Hunefer]] (ca. 1375 B.C.) shows [[Hunefer]]'s heart being weighed on the scale of [[Maat]] against the [[feather of truth]], by the [[jackal]]-headed [[Anubis]]. The [[ibis]]-headed [[Thoth]], [[scribe]] of the [[gods]], records the result. If his heart is lighter than the feather, [[Hunefer]] is allowed to pass into the [[afterlife]]. If not, he is eaten by the waiting '''Ammit'''. [[Vignette (graphic design)|Vignettes]] such as these were a common [[illustration]] in [[Egypt]]ian [[Book of the dead|books of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.egyptartsite.com/hall1.html |title=Egyptian Book of the Dead |publisher=Egyptartsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Ammit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ᵻ|t}}; {{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜥm-mwt|ꜥm-mwt]]}}, "devourer of the dead";&lt;ref name=Wörterbuch&gt;Erman, Adolf; Grapow, Hermann (1926-1961) ''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, volume 1, page 184.9&lt;/ref&gt; also rendered '''Ammut''' or '''Ahemait''') was a [[demon]]ess and [[goddess]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] with a body that was part [[lion]], [[hippopotamus]] and [[crocodile]]—the three largest "man-eating" animals known to ancient Egyptians. A [[funerary]] deity, her titles included "Devourer of the Dead", "Eater of [[Heart]]s", and "Great of Death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses, Second Edition|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-02362-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ammit lived near the [[Justice|scales of justice]] in [[Duat]], the Egyptian [[underworld]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, [[Anubis]] weighed the heart of a person against the feather of [[Ma'at]], the [[goddess]] of truth, which was depicted as an ostrich feather (the feather was often pictured in Ma'at's headdress). If the heart was judged to be not pure, Ammit would devour it, and the person undergoing judgement was not allowed to continue their voyage towards [[Osiris]] and [[immortality]]. Once Ammit swallowed the heart, the soul was believed to become restless forever; this was called "to die a second time". Ammit was also sometimes said to stand by a [[lake of fire]]. In some [[traditions]], the unworthy hearts were cast into the fiery lake to be destroyed. Some [[scholars]] believe Ammit and the lake represent the same concept of [[wikt:destroy|destruction]].

Ammit was not [[worshipped]]; instead she embodied all that the [[Egyptians]] feared, threatening to bind them to eternal restlessness if they did not follow the principle of [[Ma'at]].

==Influence on popular culture==
*Ammut appears (using the 'u' version of the name) as a recurring character in the cartoon ''[[Mummies Alive!]]''. The evil ancient Egyptian wizard Scarab summons Set and Anubis in episode 3, and Ammut tagged along. He remains behind to be a general annoyance to Scarab and his familiar Heka. Ammut generally acts like a dog on the show, despite being part feline.
*Ammit was made male as a character in the ''[[Palladium RPG]]''. A monster of the same name is also a card in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''
*In addition, Ammit also intermittently appears in ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', a trilogy based on Egyptian Myths. In the book series, Ammit follows suit as the original myths, being the servant and companion of [[Anubis]]. Ammit is portrayed as tiny, about the size of a dog.
* Ammit is also featured in the ''[[Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris]]'' video game.
* Ammit Cryearth is a Grimoire in form of a hand mirror that reflects the true form of the holder; it appears in ''[[BlazBlue: Remix Heart]]'' manga.
* The ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' set [[Amonkhet]], which is based on ancient Egyptian life and mythology, features the card Baleful Ammit, as well as an Ammit creature mentioned twice in its official lore. Ammit also appeared in the following set "Hour of Devastation" in the card Ammit Eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amonkhet Story|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/amonkhet/story|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the Titans, monsters summoned from magic amulets in the animated series, ''[[Huntik: Secrets &amp; Seekers]]'', is a large crocodile called Ammit Heart-Eater.
* The extinct crocodile ''[[Pristichampus]]'' in the season 3 premiere of ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'' is said to be the inspiration for the story of Ammit (called Ammut in the show) after going through the anomaly.
* In the 2017 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Origins]]'', the main protagonist, Bayek, experiences a hallucination in which his heart is weighed in the Duat and Ammit, portrayed inaccurately as a gigantic serpent, swallows his heart, and in the sequence then Bayek must battle Ammit to retrieve his heart.
* Ammit also appears in The Tombquest series book 5: The Final kingdom.
* Ammut appears within the second episode of the 2003 cartoon TV series "Tutenstein" after she is summoned by El Zabkar to destroy Tut. She is then present for the young Pharaoh's judgement within the hall of two truths alongside Anubis, Thoth, Ma'at and Osiris. She is correctly portrayed as being chimeric in stature: staying true to her descriptions within the original ancient Egyptian texts and mythology.

'''Amos Bronson Alcott''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|k|ə|t|,_|-|k|ɪ|t}}; November 29, 1799{{snd}}March 4, 1888) was an American [[teacher]], writer, [[philosopher]], and [[reform movement|reformer]]. As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a [[veganism|vegan]] diet before the term was coined. He was also an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate for [[women's rights]].

Born in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] in 1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books: ''Records of a School'' and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels''. Alcott became friends with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and became a major figure in [[transcendentalism]]. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]], a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.

Alcott married [[Abby May]] in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters. Their second was [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa May]], who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' in 1868.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
A native [[New England]]er, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] (then recently renamed from "Farmingbury") on November 29, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Bronson Alcott. The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. The family originally spelled their name "Alcock", later changed to "Alcocke" then "Alcox". Amos Bronson, the oldest of eight children, later changed the spelling to "Alcott" and dropped his first name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school taught only reading, writing, and spelling and he left this school at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, his uncle, Reverend Tillotson Bronson, invited Alcott into his home in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], to be educated and prepared for college. Bronson gave it up after only a month&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was self-educated from then on.&lt;ref name=Hankins129&gt;{{Harvnb|Hankins|2004|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin [[William Alcott]], with whom he shared books and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronson Alcott later reflected on his childhood at Spindle Hill: "It kept me pure... I dwelt amidst the hills... God spoke to me while I walked the fields."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at age 15, he took a job working for clockmaker [[Seth Thomas (clockmaker)|Seth Thomas]]&lt;ref name=Reisen9&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the nearby town of [[Plymouth, Connecticut|Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shepard|1937|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, Alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Reisen9/&gt; Instead, he left home and became a traveling salesman in the [[Southern United States|American South]],&lt;ref name=Hankins129/&gt; peddling books and merchandise. He hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents, "to make their cares, and burdens less... and get them free from debt", though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well-being. In March 1823, Alcott wrote to his brother: "Peddling is a hard place to serve God, but a capital one to serve [[Mammon]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, he fictionalized this experience in his book, ''New Connecticut'', originally circulated only among friends before its publication in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career and marriage===
[[File:Abby May Alcott.jpg|thumb|Abby May Alcott in her later years]]
By the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a job as a schoolteacher in Cheshire with the help of his Uncle Tillotson.&lt;ref name=Bedell17&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly set about reforming the school. He added backs to the benches on which students sat, improved lighting and heating, de-emphasized [[rote learning]], and provided individual [[slate (writing)|slates]] to each student—paid for by himself.&lt;ref name=Reisen10&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott had been influenced by [[educational philosophy]] of the [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and even renamed his school "The Cheshire Pestalozzi School".&lt;ref name=Bedell17/&gt; His style attracted the attention of [[Samuel Joseph May]], who introduced Alcott to his sister [[Abby May]]. She called him, "an intelligent, philosophic, modest man" and found his views on education "very attractive".&lt;ref name=Reisen10/&gt; Locals in Cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods. Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened  private school for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unemployed by March 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place "where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at [[King's Chapel]] on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house.&lt;ref name=Reisen13&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a [[boarding house]] run by a Mrs. Newall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for [[slavery]]. In November 1830, he and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded what he later called a "preliminary Anti-Slavery Society", though he differed from Garrison as a [[nonresistance|nonresistant]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Lewis. ''Radical Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislavery Thought''. University of Tennessee Press, 1995: 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott became a member of the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]].{{sfn|Bearse|1880|p=3}}

Attendance at Alcott's school was falling. A wealthy [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] named Reuben Haines proposed he and educator William Russell start a new school in Pennsylvania&lt;ref name=Reisen13/&gt; associated with the [[Germantown Academy]]. Alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on December 14.&lt;ref name=Matteson42&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was established in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Alcotts were offered a rent-free home by Haines. Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby [[Philadelphia]] instead.&lt;ref name=Matteson42/&gt; Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house.&lt;ref name=Matteson43&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that their first child, a daughter they named [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]], was born on March 16, 1831,&lt;ref name=Reisen13/&gt; after 36 hours of labor.&lt;ref name=Matteson43/&gt; By the fall of that year, their benefactor Haines died suddenly and the Alcotts again suffered financial difficulty. "We hardly earn the bread", wrote Abby May to her brother, "[and] the butter we have to think about."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple's only son was born on April 6, 1839, but lived only a few minutes. The mother recorded: "Gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Germantown that the couple's second daughter was born. [[Louisa May Alcott]] was born on her father's birthday, November 29, 1832, at a half-hour past midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronson described her as "a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germantown school, however, was faltering; soon only eight pupils remained.&lt;ref name=Matteson50&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their benefactor Haines died before Louisa's birth. He had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them. As Abby wrote, his death "has prostrated all our hopes here".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1833, the family moved to Philadelphia,&lt;ref name=Matteson50/&gt; where Alcott ran a day school. As usual, Alcott's methods were controversial; a former student later referred to him as "the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott began to believe Boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish. He contacted theologian [[William Ellery Channing]] for support. Channing approved of Alcott's methods and promised to help find students to enroll, including his daughter Mary. Channing also secured aid from Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] and Boston mayor [[Josiah Quincy, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental educator===
On September 22, 1834, Alcott opened a school of about 30 students, mostly from wealthy families.&lt;ref name=Packer55&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] because classes were held at the [[Masonic Temple]] on Tremont Street in Boston.&lt;ref name=Dahlstrand110&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assistant was [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]], later replaced by [[Margaret Fuller]]. [[Mary Peabody Mann]] served as a French instructor for a time.&lt;ref name=Gura88&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as [[Friedrich Fröbel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in "spiritual culture", which included interpretation of the [[Gospel]]s, and advocated ''object teaching'' in writing instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = American Journal of Education|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hgkCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Wait, Green, and Company|date = 1828-01-01|language = en|first = William|last = Russell|first2 = William Channing|last2 = Woodbridge|first3 = Amos Bronson|last3 = Alcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Jesus]], and William Ellery Channing.&lt;ref name=Dahlstrand110/&gt;

During this time, the Alcotts had another child. Born on June 24, 1835, she was named [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth Peabody Alcott]] in honor of the teaching assistant at the Temple School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age three, however, her mother changed her name to Elizabeth ''Sewall'' Alcott, after her own mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1835, Peabody published her account as an assistant to the Temple School as ''Record of a School: Exemplifying the General Principles of Spiritual Culture''.&lt;ref name=Gura88/&gt; While working on a second book, Alcott and Peabody had a falling out and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' was prepared with help from Peabody's sister [[Sophia Peabody|Sophia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; published at the end of December 1836.&lt;ref name=Packer55/&gt; Alcott's methods were not well received; many found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous. For example, he asked students to question if Biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'', [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]] criticized Alcott's "flippant and off hand conversation" about serious topics from the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]] to [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name=Gura89&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph T. Buckingham]] called Alcott "either insane or half-witted" and "an ignorant and presuming [[charlatan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not sell well; a Boston lawyer bought 750 copies to use as waste paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple school was widely denounced in the press. Reverend [[James Freeman Clarke]] was one of Alcott's few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from Boston periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott was rejected by most public opinion and, by the summer of 1837, he had only 11 students left and no assistant after Margaret Fuller moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and, as the school closed, Alcott became increasingly financially desperate. Remaining steadfast to his pedagogy, a forerunner of [[progressive education|progressive]] and [[democratic school]]ing, he alienated parents in a later "parlor school" by admitting an [[African American]] child to the class, whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests.

===Transcendentalism===
Beginning in 1836, Alcott's membership in the [[Transcendental Club]] put him in such company as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Orestes Brownson]] and [[Theodore Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32–33. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member with the Club's second meeting and hosted their third.&lt;ref name=Gura89/&gt; A biographer of Emerson described the group as "the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality".&lt;ref name=Gura5&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Henry Hedge]] wrote of the group's nature: "There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women".&lt;ref name=Gura5/&gt; Alcott preferred the term "Symposium" for their group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hankins|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 1840, Alcott moved to the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]&lt;ref name=Packer115&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; urged by Emerson. He rented a home for $50 a year within walking distance of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Emerson's house]]; he named it Dove Cottage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they also called it Concordia Cottage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of Alcott's philosophies, Emerson offered to help with his writing, which proved a difficult task. After several revisions, for example, he deemed the essay "Psyche" (Alcott's account of how he educated his daughters) unpublishable.&lt;ref name=Reisen35&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] which were eventually published in the Transcendentalists' journal, ''[[The Dial]]''. Emerson wrote to Margaret Fuller, then editor, that they might "pass muster &amp; even pass for just &amp; great".&lt;ref name=Packer115/&gt; He was wrong. Alcott's so-called "[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] Sayings" were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible; Fuller herself disliked them, but did not want to hurt Alcott's feelings.&lt;ref name=Packer116&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first issue, for example, he wrote:
{{quote|text=Nature is quick with spirit. In eternal systole and diastole, the living tides course gladly along, incarnating organ and vessel in their mystic flow. Let her pulsations for a moment pause on their errands, and creation's self ebbs instantly into chaos and invisibility again. The visible world is the extremist wave of that spiritual flood, whose flux is life, whose reflux death, efflux thought, and conflux light. Organization is the confine of incarnation,—body the atomy of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Felton|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On July 26, 1840, Abby May gave birth again. Originally referred to as Baby for several months, she was eventually named [[May Alcott|Abby May]] after her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, she changed the spelling of her name to "Abbie" before choosing to use only "May".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With financial support from Emerson,&lt;ref name=Schreiner95&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott left Concord on May 8, 1842, to a visit to England, leaving his brother Junius with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met two admirers, [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] and Henry C. Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were leaders of [[Alcott House]], an experimental school based on Alcott's methods from the Temple School located about ten miles outside  London.&lt;ref name=Schreiner95/&gt; The school's founder, James Pierpont Greaves, had only recently died but Alcott was invited to stay there for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott persuaded them to come to the United States with him; Lane and his son moved into the Alcott house and helped with family chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persuaded in part by Lane's [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist views]], Alcott took a stand against the [[John Tyler]] administration's plan to annex [[Texas]] as a slave territory and [[tax resistance|refused to pay]] his [[Tax per head|poll tax]]. Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, "A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax... After waiting some time to be committed [to jail], he was told it was paid by a friend. Thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual poll tax was only $1.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident inspired [[Henry David Thoreau]], whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the Alcott family set up a sort of domestic post office to curb potential domestic tension. Abby May described her idea: "I thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children, indeed all of us, to interchange thought and sentiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruitlands===
[[File:Fruitlands in 1915.jpg|thumb|right|Alcott and Charles Lane founded "Fruitlands" in 1843.]]
{{main|Fruitlands (transcendental center)}}
Lane and Alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a [[Utopia]]n society. Alcott, however, was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community. In a letter, Lane wrote, "I do not see anyone to act the money part but myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1843, he purchased a {{convert|90|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Packer148&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up front, he paid $1,500 of the total $1,800 value of the property; the rest was meant to be paid by the Alcotts over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it "Fruitlands" despite only ten old apple trees on the property.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; In July, Alcott announced their plans in ''The Dial'': "We have made an arrangement with the proprietor of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership".&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt;

Their goal was to regain access to [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] by finding the correct formula for perfect living, following specific rules governing agriculture, diet, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this, they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hankins|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike a similar project named [[Brook Farm]], the participants at Fruitlands avoided interaction with local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling themselves a "consociate family", they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; After some difficulty, they relented and allowed some cattle to be "enslaved".&lt;ref name=Felton132&gt;{{Harvnb|Felton|2006|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also banned coffee, tea, alcoholic drinks, milk, and warm bathwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; They only ate "aspiring vegetables"—those which grew upward—and refused those that grew downward like potatoes. As Alcott had published earlier, "Our wine is water,—flesh, bread;—drugs, fruits."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; For clothing, they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it, as well as cotton, silk, and wool, because they were products of slave labor.&lt;ref name=Felton132/&gt; Alcott had high expectations but was often away when the community most needed him as he attempted to recruit more members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental community was never successful, partly because most of the land was not [[arable land|arable]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Sterling F. ''Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004: 118. {{ISBN|0-674-01160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott lamented, "None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders were often away as well; in the middle of harvesting, they left for a lecture tour through [[Providence, Rhode Island]], New York City, and [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its seven months, only 13 people joined, included the Alcotts and Lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Felton|2006|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Abby May and her daughters, only one other woman joined, Ann Page. One rumor is that Page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane believed Alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the [[nuclear family]]. He quit the project and moved to a nearby [[Shakers|Shaker]] family with his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lane's departure, Alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abby May thought Lane purposely sabotaged her family. She wrote to her brother, "All Mr. Lane's efforts have been to disunite us. But Mr. Alcott's ... paternal instincts were too strong for him."&lt;ref name=Matteson161&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the final payment on the farm was owed, Sam May refused to cover his brother-in-law's debts, as he often did, possibly at Abby May's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment failed, the Alcotts had to leave Fruitlands.

The members of the Alcott family were not happy with their Fruitlands experience. At one point, Abby May threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere, leaving Bronson behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa May Alcott, who was ten years old at the time, later wrote of the experience in ''Transcendental Wild Oats'' (1873): "The band of brothers began by spading garden and field; but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Concord===
[[File:The Wayside Concord Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Wayside]], home in turn to the Alcott family, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Margaret Sidney]]]]
In January 1844, Alcott moved his family to Still River, a village within Harvard&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Carruth, Gorton. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 62. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, on March 1, 1845, the family returned to Concord to live in a home they named "The Hillside" (later renamed "[[The Wayside]]" by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Emerson and Sam May assisted in securing the home for the Alcotts.&lt;ref name=Bedell234&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in the home, Louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later said her years at the home "were the happiest years" of her life; many of the incidents in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868) are based on this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott renovated the property, moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color, as well as tending to over six acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 1845, Abby May was granted a sum from her father's estate which was put into a trust fund, granting minor financial security.&lt;ref name=Bedell234/&gt; That summer, Bronson Alcott let [[Henry David Thoreau]] borrow his ax to prepare his home at [[Walden Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at The Hillside,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; including fugitive slaves, which they hosted in secret as a station of the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott's opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] which began in 1846. He considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of "a people bent on conquest, on getting the golden treasures of Mexico into our hands, and of subjugating foreign peoples?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Abby May insisted they leave Concord, which she called "cold, heartless, brainless, soulless". The Alcott family put The Hillside up for rent and moved to Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, next door to Peabody's book store on West Street, Bronson Alcott hosted a series based on the "Conversations" model by Margaret Fuller called "A Course on the Conversations on Man—his History, Resources, and Expectations". Participants, both men and women, were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1853, Alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in an extracurricular, non-credit course.&lt;ref name=Bedell319&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott and his family moved back to Concord after 1857, where he and his family lived in the [[Orchard House]] until 1877. In 1860, Alcott was named superintendent of Concord Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schriener|2006|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War years and beyond===
[[File:OrchardHouseConcord2CMA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Orchard House]] in Concord, Massachusetts]]
Alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in 1860. In his journal for November 6, 1860, he wrote: "At Town House, and cast my vote for [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the Republican candidates generally—the first vote I ever cast for a President and State officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical William Lloyd Garrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had attended a rally led by [[Wendell Phillips]] on behalf of 17-year-old [[Thomas Sims]], a fugitive slave on trial in Boston. Alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse; when gunshots were heard, he was the only one who stood his ground, though the effort was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of [[Anthony Burns]]. A group had broken down the door of the Boston courthouse but guards beat them back. Alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group, [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], "Why are we not within?" He then walked calmly into the courthouse, was threatened with a gun, and turned back, "but without hastening a step", according to Higginson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Louisa moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to volunteer as a nurse. On January 14, 1863, the Alcotts received a telegram that Louisa was sick; Bronson immediately went to bring her home, briefly meeting Abraham Lincoln while there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa turned her experience into the book ''[[Hospital Sketches]]''. Her father wrote of it, "I see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry David Thoreau died on May 6, 1862,&lt;ref name=Schreiner216&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely from an illness he caught from Alcott two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At Emerson's request, Alcott helped arrange Thoreau's funeral, which was held at First Parish Sanctuary in Concord,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thoreaufarm.org/2012/04/remembering-henry-david-thoreau/ |title=Remembering Henry David Thoreau |author=Patricia Hohl |date=April 23, 2012 |publisher=Thoreau Farm Trust|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite Thoreau having disavowed membership in the church when he was in his early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson wrote a eulogy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emerson |first1=Ralph Waldo |year=1862 |title=Thoreau |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |volume=10 |issue=58 |pages=239–249 |publisher=Ticknor and Fields |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWACAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=loon%20intitle%3AAtlantic&amp;pg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alcott helped plan the preparations.&lt;ref name=Schreiner216/&gt; Only two years later, neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne died as well. Alcott served as a pallbearer along with [[Louis Agassiz]], [[James Thomas Fields]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Hawthorne's death, Alcott worried that few of the Concord notables remained. He recorded in his journal: "Fair figures one by one are fading from sight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Lincoln was assassinated, which Alcott called "appalling news".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, Alcott met with publisher Thomas Niles, an admirer of ''Hospital Sketches''. Alcott asked Niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter; instead, he suggested she write a book about girls. Louisa May was not interested initially but agreed to try.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. ''Irving to Irving: Author-Publisher Relations 1800–1974''. New York: R. R. Bowker Company, 1974: 36. {{ISBN|0-8352-0772-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "They want a book of 200 pages or more", Alcott told his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''Little Women'', published later that year. The book, which fictionalized the Alcott family during the girls' coming-of-age years, recast the father figure as a chaplain, away from home at the front in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Alcott spoke, as opportunity arose, before the "[[lyceum]]s" then common in various parts of the United States, or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him. These "conversations" as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American Transcendentalists led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer. He often discussed Platonic philosophy, the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with Spirit; upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature; and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alcott, Amos Bronson|volume=1|page=528|first=Charles F.|last=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Concord School of Philosophy.jpg|left|thumb|Hillside Chapel, home to Alcott's Concord School of Philosophy]]
Alcott's published books, all from late in his life, include ''Tablets'' (1868), ''Concord Days'' (1872), ''New Connecticut'' (1881), and ''Sonnets and Canzonets'' (1882). Louisa May attended to her father's needs in his final years. She purchased a house for her sister Anna which had been the last home of Henry David Thoreau, now known as the [[Thoreau-Alcott House]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 45. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa and her parents moved in with Anna as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his wife Abby May on November 25, 1877, Alcott never returned to Orchard House, too heartbroken to live there. He and Louisa May collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers, letters, and journals. "My heart bleeds with the memories of those days", he wrote, "and even long years, of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa noted her father had become "restless with his anchor gone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave up on the memoir project and Louisa burned many of her mother's papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 1879, Alcott and [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]] wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the [[Concord School of Philosophy]] and Literature, which held its first session in 1879 in Alcott's study in the [[Orchard House]]. In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters.{{sfn|Richardson|1911|p=529}}  The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.

In April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, "Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud." Emerson died the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=234–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott himself moved out of Concord for his final years, settling at 10 Louisburg Square in Boston beginning in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Susan. ''The Literary Trail of Greater Boston''. Beverly, Massachusetts: Commonwealth Editions, 2005: 57. {{ISBN|1-889833-67-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he was bedridden at the end of his life, Alcott's daughter Louisa May came to visit him at Louisburg on March 1, 1888. He said to her, "I am going ''up. Come with me''." She responded, "I wish I could."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died three days later on March 4; Louisa May died only two days after her father.

==Beliefs==
Alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] as a means of disciplining his students. Instead, beginning at the Temple School, he would appoint a daily student superintendent. When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical "correction" he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.

The most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, "Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction". Alcott believed that early education must draw out "unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child" and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott's ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer [[Harriet Martineau]], for example, wrote dubiously that, "the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth; and that his business is to bring it out into expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in America, and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education. Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including "teach by encouragement", art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.{{sfn|Richardson|1911|p=528}}

The Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.

While many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/[[veganism]], sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a "Pythagorean diet": meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement. He further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and, in a sense, predicted modern [[environmentalism]] by condemning [[pollution]] and encouraging humankind's role in sustaining ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Mr Alcott's study.jpg|thumb|left|Alcott in his study at Orchard House]]
Alcott's philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent, hazy or abrupt. He formulated no system of philosophy, and shows the influence of [[Plato]], German [[mysticism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]] as filtered through the writings of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amos Bronson Alcott, an intellectual biography|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sk0rAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|date = 1982-01-01|isbn = 9780838630167|language = en|first = Frederick C.|last = Dahlstrand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Fuller referred to Alcott as "a philosopher of the balmy times of [[ancient Greece]]—a man whom the worldlings of Boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of Athens held [[Socrates]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. (editor). ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 152. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, Alcott related a story from his boyhood: during a total [[solar eclipse]], he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder. He reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be "tilting at the sun and always catching the fall".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Emerson, Alcott was always optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic in thinking. Writer [[James Russell Lowell]] referred to Alcott in his poem "Studies for Two Heads" as "an angel with clipped wings".&lt;ref name=Bedell319/&gt; Even so, Emerson noted that Alcott's brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing. "When he sits down to write," Emerson wrote, "all his genius leaves him; he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought."&lt;ref name=Reisen35/&gt; His "Orphic Sayings", published in ''The Dial'', became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless. In New York, for example, ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' published a parody titled "Gastric Sayings" in November 1840. A writer for the ''Boston Post'' referred to Alcott's "Orphic Sayings" as "a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger".&lt;ref name=Packer116/&gt;

Modern critics{{who|date=October 2011}} often fault Alcott for not being able to financially support his family. Alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man, once writing to his mother that he was "still at my old trade—hoping."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott held his principles above his well-being. Shortly before his marriage, for example, his future father-in-law Colonel Joseph May helped him find a job teaching at a school in Boston run by the Society of Free Enquirers, followers of [[Robert Owen]], for a lucrative $1,000 to $1,200 annual salary. He refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs, writing, "I shall have nothing to do with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the other perspective, Alcott's unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields, in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers.

'''Bamyan'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} ({{lang-fa|بامیان}}; {{lang-el|μπάμια}}, which means land of Okra), also [[spelled]] '''Bamiyan'''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/208 Unesco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128162824/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/208|date=January 28, 2007}}, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7508917.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Bamian''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/aftoc.html|title=About this Collection|work=The Library of Congress|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the capital of [[Bamyan Province]] in central [[Afghanistan]]. With an altitude of about 2,550 m and a population of about 100,000, Bamyan is the largest town in the central Afghanistan region of [[Hazarajat]], and lies approximately 240 kilometres north-west of [[Kabul]], the national capital. Many statues of Buddha are carved into the sides of cliffs facing Bamyan city.  In 2008, Bamyan was found to be the home of the world's oldest oil paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/photogalleries/Bamian-pictures/|title=Oldest Oil Paintings Found in Caves|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bamiyan valley marked the most westerly point of Buddhist expansion and was a crucial hub of trade for much of the second millennium CE. It was a place where East met West and its archaeology reveals a blend of Greek, Turkic, Persian, Chinese and Indian influence. The valley is one of Afghanistan's most touristic places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2014/09/bamiyan_can_a_small_afghan_mountain_town_best_known_for_its_blown_up_buddhas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated on the ancient [[Silk Route]], the town was at the crossroads between the East and West when all trade between [[China]] and the [[Middle East]] passed through it. The [[Hunas]] made it their capital in the 5th century. Because of the cliff of the Buddhas, the ruins of the Monk's caves, [[Shahr-e Gholghola]] ('City of Sighs', the ruins of an ancient city destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] during the [[1221 siege of Bamiyan]]), and its local scenery, it is one of the most visited places in Afghanistan. The [[Shahr-e Zuhak, Bamyan|Shahr-e Zuhak]] mound ten miles south of the valley is the site of a citadel that guarded the city, and the ruins of an [[acropolis]] could be found there as recently as the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Trudy;Salkin, Robert M.;Schellinger, Paul E; La Boda, Sharon (1995) ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania'', P.79. Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|1-884964-04-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SHAHR-I-ZOHAK - AFGHANISTAN.jpg|left|thumb|[[Shahr-e Zuhak, Bamyan|Shahr-e Zuhak]]]]
The town is the cultural center of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group of Afghanistan. Most of the population lives in downtown Bamyan. The valley is cradled between the parallel mountain ranges of the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Koh-i-Baba]].

Bamyan is a small town with a bazaar at its center. It has no infrastructure of electricity, gas, or water supplies. According to [[Sister Cities International]], Bamyan has established a sister city relationship with [[Gering, Nebraska]], United States. It has an airport with a [[gravel]] runway.

Mountains cover ninety percent of the province, and the cold, long winter, lasting for six months, brings temperatures of three to twenty degrees Celsius below zero. Mainly [[Daizangi]] Hazara people live in the area. Transportation facilities are increasing, but sparse. Notably Bamyan is now connected by road to Kabul through Parwan province and through Maidan Wardak. The connection between Maidan Shar and Bamyan – 136&amp;nbsp;km long – makes it possible to reach Kabul in a 2-hour drive. The connection is almost completed missing just 15&amp;nbsp;km of paving 
 
The main crops are [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[mushung]], and baquli, grown in spring. When crops are damaged by unusually harsh weather, residents herd their livestock down to [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] and [[Maidan Province|Maidan]] provinces to exchange for food.

The city and the province are served by [[Bamyan Airport]]. A new airport has been completed in 2015 with an asphalt runway. The project was funded by the Japanese Government and carried out by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

== Climate ==
Bamyan's climate is transitional between [[cold arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk'') and [[Cold semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] (Köppen ''BSk''), with cold winters and warm, dry summers. Precipitation mostly falls in late winter and spring.

{{History of Afghanistan}}

The city of Bamyan was part of the [[Buddhist]] [[Kushan Empire]] in the early centuries of the Christian era. After the Kushan Empire fell to the [[Sassanids]], Bamyan became part of the [[Kushansha]], vassals to the Sassanids. The [[Hephthalites]] conquered Bamyan in the 5th century. After their Khanate was destroyed by the Sassanids and Turks in 565, Bamyan became the capital of the small [[Kushano-Hephthalite]] kingdom until 870, when it was conquered by the [[Saffarids]]. The area was conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]] in the 11th century. In 1221 the city and its population were completely [[Siege of Bamyan (1221)|wiped out by]] [[Genghis Khan]]. The [[Qarlughids]] established their capital in the city soon thereafter. The first European to see Bamyan was [[William Moorcroft (explorer)]] about 1824.
During 1998–2001, Bamyan has been the center of combat between [[Taliban]] forces and the anti-Taliban alliance; mainly [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]] – amid clashes among the warlords of local militia. Bamyan is also known as the capital of [[Daizangi]].

=== Buddhas ===
[[File:Buddhas of Bamiyan in 19 century.JPG|thumb|Drawing of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] by [[Alexander Burnes]], as he saw them during his visit in Bamiyan in 1832]]
{{main|Buddhas of Bamiyan}}
On the cliff face of a mountain nearby, three colossal statues were carved 4,000 feet apart. One of them was 175 feet (53 m) high standing statue of [[Buddha]], the world's tallest. The ancient statue was carved during the [[Kushan]] period in the fifth century. The statues were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001, on the grounds that they were an affront to Islam, even though they were left intact by Muslim rulers for 1200 years. Limited efforts have been made to rebuild them, with negligible success.

At one time, two thousand monks meditated in caves among the [[sandstone]] cliffs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The caves were also a big tourist attraction before the long series of wars in Afghanistan. The world's earliest oil paintings have been discovered in caves behind the destroyed statues. Scientists from the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] have confirmed that the oil paintings, probably of either [[walnut]] or [[poppy seed]] oil, are present in 12 of the 50 caves dating from the 5th to 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Cotte, ''[[J. Anal. At. Spectrom.]]'', 2008, 23, {{doi|10.1039/b801358f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals typically have a white base layer of a lead compound, followed by an upper layer of natural or artificial pigments mixed with either resins or walnut or poppy seed drying oils.  Possibly, the paintings may be the work of artists who travelled on the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/bamiyan European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, "Synchrotron light unveils oil in ancient Buddhist paintings from Bamiyan"], March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves at the base of these statues were used by Taliban for storing weapons. After the Taliban were driven from the region, civilians made their homes in the caves. Recently, Afghan refugees escaped the persecution of the Taliban regime by hiding in caves in the Bamiyan valley. These refugees discovered a fantastic{{clarify|date=September 2011}} collection of Buddhist statues as well as jars holding more than ten thousand fragments of ancient Buddhist manuscripts, a large part of which is now in the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]]. This has created a sensation among scholars, and the find has been compared with the discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

From 2003–13, a [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] was based in Bamyan, first manned by U.S. forces, and, since about 2003, by personnel from the [[Military history of New Zealand#Afghanistan 2001–2013|New Zealand Defence Force]]. The 34th Division in the area, part of the [[4th Corps (Afghanistan)|4th Corps]], was affiliated with [[Karim Khalili]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Vinay Bhatia]], Mark Sedra, ''Afghanistan, Arms and Conflict: Post-9/11 Security and Insurgency'', Routledge, 2008, {{ISBN|113405422X}}, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Bamiyan was one of the first pilot centres for the [[Afghan New Beginnings Programme]] of [[Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]]. On 4 July 2004 disarmament began in Bamiyan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/printinfocusnews.asp?nid=764|title=Press Briefing by Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Spokesman for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Afghanistan|date=4 July 2004|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 July 2004 disarmament was continuing in Bamiyan including soldiers from the 34th and 35th Divisions of the then [[Afghan Army]], often referred to as the Afghan Military or Militia Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/printinfocusnews.asp?nid=770|title=Press Briefing by David Singh Senior Media Relations Officer and by UN agencies in Afghanistan|date=15 July 2004|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demography ===
The population of this city is estimated to be 100,000 in 2016. Hazaras make up almost entire population of Bamyan.

=== Land use ===
Bamyan, located	in the central highlands, is one of the oldest cities in the country and is widely known for the giant, ancient Buddha statues that were carved into the side of a cliff. {{Citation needed span|The city of Bamyan is dominated by agriculture at 54% with only 18% of total land classified as built-up.|date=June 2016}}

'''Manuera Benjamin Riwai Couch''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|JP}} (27 June 1925 – 3 June 1996) was a New Zealand politician and [[rugby union]] player. He was a team-member of the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] and the [[Māori All Blacks|New Zealand Māori rugby union team]] in the 1940s.

==Early life==
Couch was born in 1925 in [[Christchurch]] and he grew up on [[Banks Peninsula]]. Couch's parents were Methodists and he was largely raised by his grandmother who belonged to the [[Salvation Army]]. He attended Christchurch Technical School. He married Bessie Carter, his childhood sweetheart who was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Couch was in the Royal New Zealand Air Force at the end of World War II but was never sent into battle. At the age of 24 Couch joined the LDS Church. He moved to the [[Wairarapa]] in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref name="All Blacks bio" /&gt;

==Rugby union==
A [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|first five-eighth]], Couch represented [[Wairarapa Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa]] at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]], from 1947 to 1949. He played seven matches for the All Blacks including three internationals.&lt;ref name="All Blacks bio"/&gt; Of [[Ngāi Tahu]] and [[Ngāti Mutunga]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Couch, Manuera Benjamin Riwai|first= S.G.|last= Snow|id=5c39|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also played 20 matches for [[Māori All Blacks|New Zealand Māori]] between 1948 and 1950.&lt;ref name="All Blacks bio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=184 |title = Ben Couch | last = Knight | first = Lindsay | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Museum | accessdate = 21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[Minister of Māori Affairs]] and [[Minister of Police (New Zealand)|Minister of Police]] in the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|third National Government]], but lost his seat in 1984 to [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]'s [[Reg Boorman]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; While Minister of Police, he called for the [[Birching|birch]] to be introduced for violent offenders and allowed the police to use longer batons. He created some controversy by wearing a [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok rugby team]] blazer at the time of their [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|1981 tour of New Zealand]] as well as attending a public meeting organised by the League of Rights. This was despite his having been denied entry to South Africa as part of the All Blacks rugby team in the 1940s because of his race.

In the [[1991 Birthday Honours|1991 Queen's Birthday Honours]] Couch was appointed a [[Queen's Service Order|Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] for public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52564 |date=15 June 1991 |page=31 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s he was involved in various Māori organisations.

'''Sir Bernard Rowland Crick''' (16 December 1929 – 19 December 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/19/bernard-crick-dies | title = Sir Bernard Crick dies aged 79 | author = Haroon Siddique | date = 19 December 2008 | work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[political theorist]] and [[democratic socialist]] whose views can be summarised as "politics is ethics done in public". He sought to arrive at a "politics of action", as opposed to a "politics of thought" or of ideology, and he held that {{As written|"political power is power in the [[subjunctive mood]]."}}&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Crick, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tASVLbC0Q5cC&amp;vq= ''In Defence of Politics''], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading critic of [[behaviouralism]].

==Career==
Crick was born in England, the son of Harry Edgar and Florence Clara Crick, and educated at [[Whitgift School]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 2007'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 2007 : 519&lt;/ref&gt;. He read Economics at [[University College London]], but terminated his studies there in order to transfer to the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) for his B.Sc. (Econ.) in 1950. While working on his Ph.D. - published in 1958 as ''The American Science of Politics'' - he was a Teaching Fellow at Harvard , 1952-54; Assistant Professor, McGill, 1954-55; Visiting Fellow, Berkeley, 1955-56).&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 2007'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 2007 : 519&lt;/ref&gt;. Returning to Great Britain in 1956, he obtained his Ph.D at the LSE and was appointed to an Assistant and later a Senior Lectureship, 1957-65.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 2007'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 2007 : 519&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During his time at LSE, recollections of which appear in his contribution to ''My LSE'',&lt;ref&gt;Abse, Joan (ed)., London: Robson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Crick craved for greater recognition than his Senior Lecturership signified. LSE's promotion system was notoriously slow at the time. When appointed Professor of Political Theory and Political Institutions at Sheffield in 1965 Crick told ''Beaver'', the LSE student newspaper, that he was "going to a better place from the point of view of teaching students".&lt;ref&gt;''Beaver'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;. The ambition for a professorship also played its part.

Crick sponsorsed the LSE's new-formed "Society Against Racial Discrimination" (1963). The indigenous British, he remarked, should treat immigrant ethnicities "as equals – and as no more than equals".&lt;ref&gt;Recollection of Dr Geoffrey Thomas, School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, University of London, who attended the inaugural meeting.&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous contributor adds : 'At least one member of audience wondered who proposed treating immigrants as "more than equals".'

Any university teacher has to manage the transition from school to university for his or her students. A first-year undergraduate in 1963, Geoffrey Thomas (later of the School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, London) recalls his naive bewilderment at a clash between authorities. Professor H. R. G. Greaves promoted one view of [[cabinet collective responsibility]] in his lectures, and Dr Crick quite another in his classes. "You might be interested to know," Thomas innocently remarked with some bafflement in a tutorial, "that your views on collective responsiibity are polar opposite to those of Professor Greaves". "Then," Crick urbanely observed, "having equal access to both of us you are in a position of unique advantage." A student learnt one difference between school and university that afternoon.

Crick's lectures at LSE displayed the freshness of his language – one might approach a subject, he once said, "with an eye well-dressed with knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;Recollection of Dr Geoffrey Thomas, School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, University of London, who attended the inaugural meeting.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is only one of many Crickian metaphors. Crick's sharp but kindly humour should also be noted. Thomas recalls the following: "There are two questions: whether ideals have an influence on history and whether politics is to be sensibly seen as the attempt to achieve values. Are all ideals the product of circumstance?" The answer might have been sententious. Instead Crick said: "Marxism grew out of one messianic, ill-tempered, bearded, boily individual".&lt;ref&gt;Recollection of Dr Geoffrey Thomas, School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt;


Crick was an advisor to British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] during the 1980s. When Labour came to power in 1997, Crick was appointed by his former student [[David Blunkett]] to head up an advisory group on [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]]. The group's final report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/6123_crick_report_1998.pdf |title=Education for citizenship and the teaching of democracy in schools |author=Advisory Group on Citizenship |date=22 September 1998 |publisher=[[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|QCA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327021218/http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/6123_crick_report_1998.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998, known as the Crick Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/citizenship_education/archive/2008/11/20/ten-years-after-crick-report.aspx | title = Ten Years after the Crick Report | date = 19 November 2008 | work = [[Hansard Society]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090106190751/http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/citizenship_education/archive/2008/11/20/ten-years-after-crick-report.aspx | archivedate = 6 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the introduction of citizenship as a core subject in the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]].&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2248319.stm |title=Blunkett names 'Britishness' chief |accessdate=20 August 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=10 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted in the 2002 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|new years honours list]] for "services to citizenship in schools and to political studies".&lt;ref name= "bbc" /&gt; He authored the 2004 Home Office book ''[[Life in the United Kingdom]]: A Journey to Citizenship'', which forms the basis for the new [[Life in the United Kingdom test|citizenship test]] required by all people naturalising as British citizens.

He taught for a number of years at the [[University of Sheffield]] (1965-71)&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 2007'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 2007 : 519&lt;/ref&gt;. and founded the Department of Politics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/politics/about-us "About us"], Department of Politics, Birkbeck. University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Vice-President of the [[British Humanist Association]].  He took early retirement from Birkbeck in 1984, setting off for Edinburgh to be with his partner, Una MacLean Macintosh. He remained domiciled there, becoming an ardent proponent of a Scottish parliament.

Once in Scotland, Crick, who eventually came to view himself as an "honorary Scot", engaged vigorously with political and civil society in Edinburgh and Scotland as a whole. Thus for instance, he for many years wrote a weekly column for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper and he was active in the [[Campaign for a Scottish Assembly]], which was the precursor to the push for a full Scottish Parliament.

Crick co-authored, with David Millar, an influential pamphlet entitled ''Making Scotland's Parliament Work''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_Scotland_s_Parliament_Work.html?id=Q7ogAAAACAAJ ''Making Scotland's Parliament Work''], John Wheatley Centre, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper helped drive the move to structure the new parliament and its committees in line with European rather than Westminster norms; this was in fact achieved and the parliament today reflects Crick and Millar's recommendations.

Later in his life in Scotland Crick was delighted to be appointed Stevenson Visiting Professor at [[Glasgow University]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/politics/stevensontrust/about/bernardcrick/ |title=Stevenson Trust for Citizenship: Sir Bernard Crick |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his frail heath at that time, Crick delivered a series of widely praised and very popular public lectures. Upon his death Glasgow University marked his contribution by establishing the Bernard Crick Memorial Lecture.

Crick made many other contributions to Scottish political life, from participating in his local Labour Party, to defending Glenogle Baths from closure, to, in his last weeks of life, penning a humorous Op-Ed for ''The Scotsman'' on the chaos caused by the tram line delays in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/bernard-crick-day-of-the-bollards-when-traffic-stood-still-1-1279522 |first=Bernard |last=Crick |title=Day of the bollards, when traffic stood still |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Crick was married three times and divorced twice. His first wife was Joyce Crick, a senior lecturer in German at University College, London, and a translator of [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. They married in September 1953 and had two sons. His older son, Olly, is an educator and drama practitioner, who among other things has written a book on Commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudlin|first=John|last2=Crick|first2= Olly|title=Commedia Dell'Arte: A Handbook for Troupes|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-415-20409-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgMKhwelZzUC&amp;dq=Olly+Crick&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger son, Tom, works in international conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/peace/conflict_resolution/program_staff.html|title=Conflict Resolution Program|publisher=The Carter Center|accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Margaret Emily Cahill in 1978, and his third wife was Freda Edis. They married in December 1989 and later separated. There were no children from the later marriages.

Crick died from [[prostate cancer]] at the age of 79, in St. Columba's Hospice, [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |author1=Mark McLaughlin |author2=John Gibson |title=Jazz band helps Sir Bernard's funeral go with a real swing |work=Edinburgh Evening News |page= |date=7 January 2009  |accessdate=25 March 2009 |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/latestnews/Jazz-band-helps-Sir-Bernards.4850421.jp }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been diagnosed about fourteen years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Crick: [http://www.orwell.ru/a_life/crick/english/e_bbbel "Big Brother belittled"], ''The Guardian'', 19 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and legacy==
Crick was awarded four honorary doctorates. He was made a vice-president of the [[Political Studies Association|Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom]], which also gave him a lifetime achievement award on its 50th anniversary in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/professor-sir-bernard-crick-1-1152951 |title=Professor Sir Bernard Crick |work=The Scotsman |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- (unencyclopaedic style, unreferenced content) In a 1965 interview with ''Beaver'', the LSE's undergraduate newsheet, Crick announced his ambition to write "a big book on the conditions of political freedom", though none appeared. and the fact is congruent with Crick's cast of mind. Despite the scintillating fun and real perceptiveness of ''[[In Defence of Politics]]'', Crick had little aptitude for the higher reaches of political theory. He was creative about institutional politics, as 'The Reform of Parliament' (1964) makes clear, but his biography of Orwell, well-researched and competent, operated at the middle range of political theory with which (at least on one view – nothing is uncontroversial) he was most at home.--&gt;

Crick was knighted in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3884593/Sir-Bernard-Crick.html "Sir Bernard Crick" (obituary)], ''The Telegraph'', 21 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, the University of Sheffield established the Sir Bernard Crick Centre.  The centre aims to 'Bridge a number of gaps that appear to have emerged in recent decades (if not before). The first gap concerns  the relationship between the governors and the governed in democratic countries.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crickcentre.org/about/ |title=About the Centre |website=The Crick Centre |publisher=[[University of Sheffield]] |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre also aims to communicate social science to the public – or the social implications of 'hard' scientific advances  – without, in doing so, losing those elements of scholarship that provide depth and context.

Glasgow University also recognised Sir Bernard's contribution by establishing an annual memorial lecture series.&lt;ref name="Stevenson Trust"/&gt;

==Work on George Orwell==
In 1974 Crick started work on a biography of [[George Orwell]] with the help of Orwell's second wife [[Sonia Brownell]]. The hardback edition rights were used to set up a grant in conjunction with [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] to fund projects by new writers that would have interested Orwell.  In 1980, just before the book was published, a friend of Crick's, [[David Astor]], agreed to match the grant.  Over the years there were contributions by Richard Blair, Orwell's adopted son, and also ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, among others.  Due to a lack of discernible projects, after five years the fund was diverted to produce an annual memorial lecture at Birkbeck College and the [[University of Sheffield]], and also to provide small departmental grants.  The lectures at Birkbeck continue; in November 2009 the Orwell Lecture was given by [[Hilary Mantel]].

In 1993 Crick set up the [[Orwell Prize]] with sponsorship from ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'' to honour political writing.  Two awards are given out each year – one for political journalism and the other for a political book.  The first awards in 1994 went to [[Anatol Lieven]] for his book ''The Baltic Revolution'' and to ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' journalist [[Neal Ascherson]]. Crick was on the judging panel until the 2007 awards.

==Ideas==
According to Crick, the ideologically driven leader practises a form of anti-politics in which the goal is the mobilisation of the populace towards a common end—even on pain of death. [[Mao Zedong]] of China said, "Power grows from the barrel of a gun," and [[Joseph Stalin]] of Russia said, "The Pope? How many battalions does he control?" Such views, in Crick's estimation, are anti-political, because the speaker seeks to overcome any ethics of his constituency with the threat of violence.

The "political virtues" were an important feature of Crick's classic book ''In Defence of Politics''; he saw them as an alternative to "ideology" or any "absolute-sounding [[ethics|ethic]]". They included but were not limited to:
* [[Prudence]]
* [[Conciliation]]
* [[Compromise]]
* Variety
* [[Adaptability]]
* [[wikt:liveliness|Liveliness]]

==Anti-behaviouralism==
Crick's first book, ''The American Science of Politics'' (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, and little known in Britain.  He identified and rejected their basic premises:  that research can discover uniformities in human behaviour, that these uniformitiess could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements, that quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analysed statistically, that political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions, and the value-free research was the ideal, with the goal of social science to be a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Crick, Bernard," in John Ramsden (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics'' (2002), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Rudolph "Butch" Warren Jr.''' (August 9, 1939 &amp;ndash; October 5, 2013) was an American jazz bassist who was active during the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Marc |title=Edward 'Butch' Warren, Washington-born bassist, dies at 74 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/edward-butch-warren-washington-born-bassist-dies-at-74/2013/10/06/89a11a2e-2eb0-11e3-bbed-a8a60c601153_story.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Warren's mother was a typist. His father, Edward Sr., was an electronics technician who played piano and organ part-time in clubs in Washington, D.C. The Warren home was often visited by jazz musicians [[Billy Hart]], Jimmy Smith, and [[Stuff Smith]]. The first time Butch Warren played bass was at home on a instrument left by [[Billy Taylor]], who had played bass for [[Duke Ellington]]. Warren has cited [[Jimmy Blanton]], another Ellington bassist, as his biggest inspiration.&lt;ref name="Russonello"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Russonello |first1=Giovanni |title=Butch Warren: To Hell &amp; Back - JazzTimes |url=https://jazztimes.com/departments/overdue-ovation/butch-warren-to-hell-back/ |website=JazzTimes |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren began playing professionally at age 14 in a Washington, D.C. band led by his father. He later worked with other local groups, including that of Stuff Smith, as well as with altoist and bandleader [[Rick Henderson]] at the [[Howard Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Quick |first1=Erik R. |title=Butch Warren |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=22403 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decades"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Marc |title=Decades of Discord Lie Between a Man and His Music |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/20/AR2006052001226.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=21 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 19, he sat in with [[Kenny Dorham]] to substitute for an absent trumpeter. A few days later, Dorham invited him to New York City, where he spent the next six months as a sideman at a club in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="Russonello" /&gt; He appeared on his first recording in January 1960 with Dorham, saxophonist Charles Davis, pianist [[Tommy Flanagan]], and drummer Buddy Enlow.&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sonny Clark]] he recorded for [[Blue Note Records]] in 1961 on Clark's album ''Leapin' and Lopin' ''. [[Alfred Lion]], president of Blue Note, hired Warren to fill the vacancy of staff bassist. During this job he played on "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" with [[Herbie Hancock]].&lt;ref name="Russonello" /&gt; As sideman, he also recorded with [[Miles Davis]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Donald Byrd]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Joe Henderson]], [[Jackie McLean]], and [[Stanley Turrentine]].&lt;ref name="Decades" /&gt;

Mental illness and heroin addiction created problems for Warren. In 1963, his friend Sonny Clark died of an overdose. Months later, [[Thelonious Monk]] hired the 23-year-old Warren. Monk's band was surrounded by drugs and Warren quit after a yearlong tour. Moving back to D.C., he admitted himself to [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Russonello" /&gt; He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Keepnews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keepnews |first1=Peter |title=Butch Warren, 74, Prominent Jazz Bassist, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/arts/music/butch-warren-74-prominent-jazz-bassist-dies.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the onset of his illness he played professionally only occasionally, including a regular gig at the jazz club Columbia Station in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="Back"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Marc |title=Butch is Back: A Jazz Legend Resurfaces - Raw Fisher |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/07/butch_is_back_a_jazz_legend_re.html |website=voices.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His only solo effort was captured on "Butch's Blues" but he was better known as a sideman on many albums, including Dexter Gordon's ''[[Go (Dexter Gordon album)|Go]]''&lt;ref name="Yanow"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yanow |first1=Scott |title=Butch Warren|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/butch-warren-mn0000939322/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis Fuatovich Shafikov''' ({{lang-ru|Денис Фуатович Шафиков}}, {{lang-ba|Шафиҡов Денис Фуат улы|Şafiqov Denis Fuat ulı}}; born 3 June 1985) is a Russian [[professional boxer]]. He held the [[European Boxing Union|European]] [[super-lightweight]] title from 2011 to 2013, and has challenged three times for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[lightweight]] title. As of November 2017, Shafikov is ranked as the world's fifth best active lightweight by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringtv.com/ratings/?weightclass=281 "Ratings"]. ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''. 5 September 2017. Retrieved 24 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and seventh by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/ "Rankings"]. [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]]. Retrieved 24 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and amateur career==
Born into a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] family, Shafikov did not immediately take a liking to boxing when trying out different sports in childhood. He nonetheless began his [[amateur boxing]] career at 13 years old, in which he had "about 90 amateur fights and lost only 6 of them." His decision to turn professional was based on wanting to earn money for his family, rather than medals.&lt;ref name=maxbox&gt;Wainwright, Anson (2012). [http://www.maxboxing.com/news/max-boxing-news/denis-shafikov-i-want-to-conquer-the-world-as-djingis-khan-did "Denis Shafikov: "I want to conquer the world as Djingis Khan did.""]. Max Boxing. Retrieved 25 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Shafikov has been trained by [[Abel Sanchez]] since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Steve (6 July 2015). [http://www.boxingscene.com/abel-sanchez-monster-denis-shafikov--93199 "Abel Sanchez Has 'A Monster' in Denis Shafikov"]. BoxingScene. Retrieved 14 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on 30 November 2003, winning a four-round [[unanimous decision]] over Pavel Lyakhov, who also debuted. For the next eleven years, Shafikov would remain undefeated while fighting mainly in Finland, having moved there in 2007.&lt;ref name=maxbox/&gt; On 29 October 2010, he fought to a [[majority draw]] against [[Brunet Zamora]], with the regional [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Inter-Continental [[light-welterweight]] title on the line. A year later, on 23 September 2011, Shafikov won his first major regional championship—the [[European Boxing Union|European]] light-welterweight title—by forcing veteran contender [[Giuseppe Lauri]] to [[referee technical decision|retire in his corner]].&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Per Ake (23 September 2011).

Retrieved 25 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Two successful defences of the title were made in 2012: the first was against [[Lee McAllister]] on 25 February, which ended in an eighth-round corner retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, Jimmy (25 February 2012). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/17116009 "Lee McAllister loses European title fight against Denis Shafikov"]. ''[[BBC Sport]]''. [[BBC]].

Retrieved 25 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2014, Shafikov travelled to [[Macau]] to face [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[lightweight]] champion [[Miguel Vázquez]]. In what was described as a "lightweight title fight that completely sucked the air out of [the] venue" due to "clinching, headbutts and lots of other matters that don't quite reflect actual fighting", Vázquez went on to hand Shafikov his first professional loss in a lacklustre unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Jake (22 February 2014) [http://www.boxingscene.com/zou-shiming-wins-by-tko-vazquez-decisions-shafikov--74926 "Zou Shiming Wins By TKO, Vazquez Decisions Shafikov"]. BoxingScene. Retrieved 25 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 18 December, Shafikov received another opportunity to fight for the vacant IBF lightweight title, this time against [[Rances Barthelemy]], but lost again via unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Brian (19 December 2015). [http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/14397791/rances-barthelemy-claims-lightweight-title-denis-shafikov "Rances Barthelemy beats Denis Shafikov via unanimous decision"]. [[ESPN]]. Retrieved 25 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Shafikov returned on 2 July 2016 in emphatic style, beating down and [[technical knockout|stopping]] undefeated lightweight prospect [[Jamel Herring]] in the tenth and final round.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nigel Collins|Collins, Nigel]] (3 July 2016).

Retrieved 15 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2017, in his third world title challenge, Shafikov lost a competitive unanimous decision against IBF lightweight champion [[Robert Easter Jr.]], in a hard-hitting slugfest.&lt;ref&gt;Idec, Keith (July 1, 2017).

==Personal life==
Despite his nickname of "[[Genghis Khan]]", Shafikov is of [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] rather than [[Mongol]] ethnicity. The nickname was given to him by his Finnish promoter Pekka Mäki, with Shafikov saying that he wants to "conquer the world as Genghis Khan did." His favourite boxers include [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Manny Pacquiao]].&lt;ref name=maxbox/&gt;

[[File:Frances Ann Conant.png|thumb|Frances Ann Conant]]
'''Frances Ann Conant''' (1831–1875), also known as '''J. H. Conant''', was an American spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].

Conant was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], on April 28, 1831. Luther Colby, editor of the [[spiritualist]] newspaper the ''[[Banner of Light]]'', gave Conant free public [[séance]]s for seventeen years in [[Boston]] which were reported in the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Braude, Ann. (2001). ''Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America''. [[Indiana University Press]]. p. 148. {{ISBN|978-0253215024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritualists claimed that Conant made contact with the [[spirit]] of a deceased Boston physician who was alleged to have made diagnoses of disease and made treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. [[McFarland &amp; Company]]. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Courier]]'' criticized the reports, and Professor [[Cornelius Conway Felton]] claimed that Conant was known for making fanatical and wild statements.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Dee. (2014). ''Boston in the Golden Age of Spiritualism: Séances, Mediums &amp; Immortality''. [[The History Press]]. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-1626195875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impresario [[P. T. Barnum]] included an exposure of Conant in his 1865 book ''The Humbugs of the World''. He suggested that Conant had impersonated the spirits and found information about her sitters by looking at [[obituary]] notices from newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Barnum, P. T. (1866).

The '''Hainan people''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 海南人), also known as '''Hainanese''' or '''Hainam nang''' (in [[Hainanese]] dialect, are the native people (including [[Han Chinese]]) who originate from [[Hainan]], the southernmost and smallest Chinese [[province]]. The term "Hainanese" was frequently used by Hainanese-speaking Han Chinese ({{zh|海南漢人}}), who are the majority in the island, to identify themselves overseas. Nevertheless, other natives of the island such as [[Li people|Hlai]] ({{zh|黎族}}), [[Kim Mun language|Yao]] ({{zh|苗族}} "Miao people") and [[Utsul]]s also use the term.

==History==
[[File:The Survey April-September 1920 (1920) (14784285493).jpg|thumb|left|Hainanese children at the Presbyterian Mission playground in [[Hainan]], 1920.]]
Most Hainanese Han people were originally [[fisherfolk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Doling|title=The Annals of Philippine Chinese Historical Association, Issues 3-7|year=1972|publisher=Philippine Chinese Historical Association|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Chinese provinces of [[Fujian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Hattaway|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|year=2004|publisher=William Carey Library|isbn=08-780-8361-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guangdong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Koen De Ridder|contribution=Weiying Gu|title=Authentic Chinese Christianity: Preludes to Its Development (nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries)|year=2001|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=90-586-7102-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guangxi]] who later settled in the island of Hainan, while the [[Li people|Li]] natives came to the island earlier and were descendants of the Yue tribe, from [[mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Goodman|title=China's Provinces in Reform: Class, Community and Political Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=11-347-1270-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ancestors of the [[Southern Min]] [[Hainanese]]-speaking people came from [[Putian]] city in [[Fujian province]] as Jinshi and military personnel settlers and in some areas barbarians like Li people assimilated into their race too, while all of the ancestors of the [[Danzhou]]-speaking people came from Guangdong. As a result of the assimilation of other dialect groups, most Hainanese genetically cluster with Han Chinese from Guangdong and Guangxi instead of Fujianese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv | title=A comprehensive map of genetic variation in the world's largest ethnic group - Han Chinese | biorxiv=162982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, Hainan has been a source for immigrants. Towards the turn of the 20th century, many Hainanese migrated to various [[Southeast Asia]]n nations, where they worked as cooks, restaurateurs, coffee shop owners, clothesmakers, sailors and hoteliers. [[Chan Sing]], one of the "villain" movie stars that dotted the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong movie industry]] was of Hainanese ancestry, as was the bartender who invented the world-famous [[Singapore Sling]] at the renowned Singapore [[Raffles Hotel]], Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon. In Thailand, singer [[Nichkhun]] of [[2PM]], media mogul [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], the politically influential [[Sarasin family]], as well as two of the wealthiest business families, the [[Chirathivat family|Chirathivats]] and the [[Chaleo Yoovidhya|Yoovidhyas]], all trace their ancestries to Hainan.

==Culture==

===Language===
In Hainan, the local [[Han Chinese]] speak [[Hainanese]], a [[Min Chinese]] language also known as ''Qiongwen'', as their native tongue. The dialect of [[Wenchang]] (文昌) is spoken by Hainanese from the northern parts of Hainan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bulaien.hainanconnection.com/places-of-interest/35-wenchang/48-wenchang-city |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605040703/http://www.bulaien.hainanconnection.com/places-of-interest/35-wenchang/48-wenchang-city |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Wenchang Hainanese descended from Jinshi and merchants from Putian as many of their Jiapu show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptwhw.com/?post=2198]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also why they pronounce some words with the Hokkien twang (example: close door is "gieh mui" for other Hainanese dialects. Wenchang pronounce as "gueh mui', similar just like in Hokkien "gui mng"). Today, many Wenchang Hainanese still return to Putian for ancestors tomb cleaning (清明). With Hainan's proximity to Guangdong and Guangxi, some locals can also understand and speak [[Cantonese]]. [[Standard Chinese]] (phonologically based on [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]]) is also the lingua franca in the island province as in the rest of China.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Hainan cuisine}}
[[File:Hainanese Chicken Rice.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hainanese chicken rice]].]]
The Hainanese are known for their signature dishes such as the [[Hainanese chicken rice]], [[Wenchang chicken]], Hainanese pork chop, Hainanese mutton soup, Hainanese salted fish soup and [[beef noodle soup]].

Notably, in [[Singapore]], these signature dishes are served at the various eateries located along [[Middle Road, Singapore|Purvis Street]], within the Hainanese enclave; as a result, Purvis Street is often referred to as "Hainan Second Street", while [[Middle Road, Singapore|Middle Road]] and Seah Street are referred to as "Hainan First Street" and "Hainan Third Street" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Ng WY|title=Youth camps keep Hainanese alive|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/youth-camps-keep-hainanese-alive|publisher=The Straits Times Singapore|date=23 March 2017|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hainanese chicken rice is a recognised dish throughout Southeast Asia due to the Hainanese diaspora in these areas who famed it. It is often labelled as Singapore's [[national dish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kugiya|first=Hugo|title=Singapore's national dish: Hainan chicken rice|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=''[[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]''|url=http://crosscut.com/2010/03/18/food/19683/Singapore-s-national-dish:-Hainan-chicken-rice/|accessdate=August 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831041040/http://crosscut.com/2010/03/18/food/19683/Singapore-s-national-dish%3A-Hainan-chicken-rice/|archive-date=2011-08-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
Hainanese opera (Qiong opera) is a passion for many Hainanese, particularly for the older generation. Enriched with local flavours, Hainanese opera is part and parcel of Hainanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Doling|title=Visiting Arts regional profile: Asia Pacific arts directory|year=1996|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|isbn=92-310-3254-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist''''' is an [[alternative comic]] written and drawn by [[Diane DiMassa]]. It features the title character wreaking violent vengeance on male oppressors. Recurring characters include Hothead's cat Chicken, her friend Roz, a talking lamp, and [[transgender]] love interest Daphne.

== Overview ==
The series began in 1991, published under the imprint [[Diane DiMassa|Giant Ass Publishing]], and ran to 21 issues, which were originally collected and published as two volumes: ''Hothead Paisan'' and ''The Revenge of Hothead Paisan''. These volumes were later combined and republishes as a 428-page [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], ''The Complete Hothead Paisan'', the page-count of which includes a 10-page [[comic strip]] introduction to the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist|last=Dimassa|first=Diane|publisher=Cleis Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57344-084-4|location=San Francisco|page=10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gabrielle Dean, the character of Hothead represents a "phallicized dyke" who is "at the mercy of her own rage against society, which she expresses by castrating men who are exaggerated stand-ins for the patriarchal order".&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Gabrielle|editor1-last=Foster et. al|editor1-first=Thomas|title=The gay '90s : disciplinary and interdisciplinary formations in queer studies|date=1997|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-8147-2673-0|page=208|chapter=The "Phallacies" of Dyke Comic Strips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ilhama Guliyeva''' (17 August 1943, [[Lankaran]], [[Azerbaijani SSR]] — 25 February 2016, [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]) was an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[celebrity]], [[actress]] and [[singer]] of Azerbaijani [[folk music|folk]] and [[classical music]]. Throughout active musical-stage career, Ilhama Guliyeva gained popular success in her respective genre of music and received such major state-level honors as [[Honored Artist]] of [[Azerbaijani SSR]] in 1982, [[People's Artist]] of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] in 1998 and People's Artist of the [[Republic of Dagestan]] in 2007.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Ilhama Guliyeva was born on August 17, 1943 in [[Lankaran]], [[Azerbaijani SSR]]. Her mother – {{ill|Tükəzban İsmayılova|az}}, was a popular  [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] singer and [[khanende]], and father – Mazahir Guliyev, worked as a [[prosecutor]] in Lankaran. Due to his job appointment, Ilhama Guliyeva spent her very early years in  [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] city of Azerbaijan. However, when Ilhama reaches the age of six, her parents divorce. Ilhama Guliyeva's mother, moving to [[Baku]], marries a famous Azerbaijani  [[taar|tar]]  player – {{ill|Həbib Bayramov|az}}, who later becomes a supportive [[stepfather]] that actively engages in growing up and educating Ilhama Guliyeva.

=== Education ===
At this early age, she gets enrolled in a 7-year musical school for piano training in [[Baku]]. As Guliyeva finishes both musical and high schools, with a great desire she wants to build her profession in the musical field. Nevertheless, young Ilhama faces definitive dissent from her parents. Taking into account the difficulties of music, they try to inspire her to master another art. Therefore, she enters the faculty of [[philology]] of the [[Azerbaijan State University]] in 1960 and continues non-musical studies in subsequent years. In 1964, Ilhama Guliyeva graduates from the university, but like every talented person with high [[musical intelligence]], young Guliyeva could not get away from music.

=== Early musical career ===
In 1963, with the support of Ziniat Alizadeh, who was in close relations with Guliyeva's family, she starts performing at the university's "''Sevinj''" [[pop music|pop]] ensemble. As Guliyeva's parents still oppressed her passion for music, these musical activities were kept in secret from her family. In 1964, a competition of young talents from all over the world was held in [[Moscow]]. By the request of Mrs. Zinyat, Ilhama Guliyeva gets permission from her family and flies to [[Russia]]. Her family thought she was going to the festival as a [[Audience|spectator]]. Competing with young singers from many countries, Ilhama Guliyeva performs the songs of [[Rauf Hajiyev]] and [[Tofig Guliyev]]. As Guliyeva becomes the winner of the competition, she returns to Baku and gets invited to perform at the [[orchestra]] of the Azerbaijan State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company ([[AzTV]]). Starting from 1965 until 1970, Ilhama Gulliyeva starts performing songs composed by [[Khayyam Mirzazade]], [[Tofig Bakikhanov]] and [[Emin Sabitoglu]] in various genres of [[pop music]], such as [[slow rock]], [[jazz]], [[R &amp; B]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[blues]], as a [[solo (music)|soloist]] of the orchestra, headed by {{ill|Tofiq Əhmədov|az}}.

=== 1970s – 1980s ===
From 1970 until 1980, Ilhama Guliyeva performed at various stages as a soloist of the [[Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall]]. In 1972, "''The Evening of Azerbaijani Composers''" gets held in the [[House of the Unions]] in [[Moscow]] where Guliyeva performs several songs. After the concert, a promimnent Azerbaijani composer [[Fikrat Amirov]] meets with Guliyeva and promises to compose [[art songs]] for her. Such songs as "''Mən səni araram''", "''Göy Göl''", "''Gülür ellər gülür''", "''Gülərəm gülsən''", "''Toy mahnısı/Toydur bugün''" and "''De görüm neyləmişəm''" became wonderful musical outputs of their cooperation, which went down in history of [[Azerbaijani music]] since then. Each of these songs is accompanied by [[folk instruments]] and [[orchestra]], and has its own unique and colorful shades peculiar to [[Azerbaijani folk music]]. In the late 1970s, accompanied by the [[instrumental ensemble|Musical ensemble]] "Dan Ulduzu", which was headed by Gulala Aliyeva, Ilhama Guliyeva performs many art songs of such outstanding Azerbaijani composers as {{ill|Oqtay Kazımi|az}}, {{ill|Oqtay Rəcəbov|az}}, {{ill|Ramiz Mirişli|az}}, [[Arif Malikov]], [[Ahmad Bakikhanov]] etc. Since then, Ilhama Guliyeva goes on tours to foreign countries ([[England]], [[Spain]], [[Denmark]], [[Turkey]], [[Germany]] etc.) and represents Azerbaijani music on the world stage.

=== 1990s – 2000s ===
After the death of {{ill|Habib Bayramov|az}} in 1994, {{ill|Tükazban İsmayılova|az}} stopped performing and quit the musical stage. This heavily affects Ilhama Guliyeva, and she quits singing for a short period of time. After several years, Guliyeva starts to cooperate with an Azerbaijani composer {{ill|Faiq Sücəddinov|az}} and performs such popular in Azerbaijan lyrical songs as "''Neylərsən''", "''Kaman''", "''Bilsən necə darıxmışam''" etc.  In the beginning of the first decade of the 2000s, Guliyeva performed such songs as "''Gedirəm''", "''Unut Məni''", "''Unuda bilməzsən''" and "'''Yaşın nə fərqi var ki?/Love knows no age'''" which became appellative and the most popular song of Guliyeva's repertoire. This and other series of lyrical songs of Guliyeva contributed to transformation of [[Azerbaijani music]]. Since the beginning of the second decade of the 2000s, Guliyeva became the venerable elderly artist in the field of music in Azerbaijan, and young artists began making [[cover version]]s of art songs that she used to sing.

=== Socio-political activity ===
In the beginning of the 2000s, Ilhama Guliyeva publicly supports a new candidate for presidency – [[Ilham Aliyev]]. She gives concerts in the regions of Azerbaijan, runs her [[propaganda]] and makes a worthy contribution to Ilham Aliyev's successful election. Moreover, in 2002, Guliyeva receives the status of "''International Cultural Executor''" at the World Women's Congress&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_International_Democratic_Federation Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Beirut]], the title of "''The Art Queen of the Turkic World''" in [[country|Turkey]] and four Humay Awards in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaspi.az/az/az/ilhame-quliyevanin-mehebbet-dusturu/ İlhamə Quliyevanın məhəbbət düsturu]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, together with a group of intelligent Azerbaijani women, Ilhama Guliyeva participated in several [[United Nations Office at Geneva|UN Geneva]] meetings and defended the rights of Azerbaijani women and children who had been affected by the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]. In 2004, at various conferences, symposiums and protest rallies in [[Goteborg]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Paris]], [[Istanbul]] and in front of the building of [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]], Guliyeva had comprehensive public speeches on [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|Armenian occupation]] of Azerbaijani internationally recognized territories. As the result of active socio-political participation, Guliyeva was elected as the president of the "''Academy of Culture''" under the World Congress of Azerbaijanis/[[:az:Dünya Azərbaycanlıları Konqresi|Dünya Azərbaycanlıları Konqresi]] in 2004. In 2007, at the headquarters of the [[Universal Peace Federation]] in [[Washington DC]], Guliyeva received the status of [[Goodwill Ambassador]]. [[File:Ilhama Guliyeva 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Ilhama Guliyeva receives "''Yaxşıların Yaxşısı'' / Best of the Bests" Award, 2011.]]

== Personal life ==
Ilhama Guliyeva created a short-term family life with '''Faig Mirmohsunov''' in the 1980s. During this very short marriage period, she adopted the surname of her spouse. However, she ended this marriage shortly and returned to her original last name. Moreover, Guliyeva adobted a child – '''Orkhan Nadirov''', who is claimed to be a grandson of Guliyeva's aunt.

== Guliyeva and contradictory attitudes towards her personality ==
[[File:Ilhama Guliyeva at the TV Show-Program.jpg|thumb|right|Ilhama Guliyeva at the TV Show "A-dan Z-yə". [[ANS TV]] studio, 2015.]]
Ilhama Guliyeva was a very peculiar [[musical artist]] with flamboyant personality. Despite that Guliyeva was respected and loved for her voice and songs, she constantly faced public criticism and dissent towards her personality. Considering the fact that the major segment of Azerbaijani society is [[conservative]] with [[traditional values]], this persistent negative attitude towards Guliyeva was due to her liberal behavior with regard to love affairs in the 1980s and 90s. However, nowadays it is an interesting scene to observe when foreign musical artists with no greater decent "ethical" background visit Azerbaijan, the people rush to highly greet and express their deep respect towards them in concert halls and [[social media]]. Considering these vestiges as a temporary phenomenon of a developing society, she never took them seriously, continued to actively participate in musical life of the country and became a leading musical artist of so-called [[show business]] in Azerbaijan.

===Ilhama Guliyeva vs. Flora Kerimova===
Guliyeva was [[hegemonic]], loved glory and honor, as well as demanded respectful attitude from everyone. This made her get into numerous conflicts with many other musical artists of Azerbaijan. Her major disputes were with such Azerbaijani singers as [[:az:Nazpəri Dostəliyeva|Nazpəri Dostəliyeva]], [[:az:Elza Seyidcahan|Elza Seyidcahan]], [[Aygün Kazımova]] and [[Brilliant Dadashova]]. Although she had a good and friendly relationship with all her colleagues at the end of her life, the only artist with whom she had not put up since the beginning of her musical career was another [[People's Artist]] of [[Azerbaijan]] [[Flora Kerimova]]. Despite that in 1995, during the joint interview with Kerimova and Guliyeva, they claimed not to be rivals since the genres of music they performed were different, it is not a secret that the issues as "who would go on stage to perform first" or "who would record a song of popular composer before anyone else" were ones of the main causes of their enmity. Since Kerimova went on streets against newly elected Azerbaijani government in 2003, she became unwelcomed and later left her active musical career. However, as [[TV channel]]s were inviting Kerimova to [[talk shows]], she used to insult Guliyeva, naming her a "disgrace to the musical stage and art, as well as to the Azerbaijani nation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfHr4E3u26I İlhamə Quliyeva səhnəyə, sənətə və millətə ləkədir]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while Guliyeva in her public and TV speeches held Kerimova in high esteem,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ZYBIalM6M İlhamə Quliyeva Flora Kərimova haqda danışdı]&lt;/ref&gt; Kerimova's attitude towards Guliyeva didn't change throughout time.

== Unexpected death ==
Starting from 2016, Ilhama Guliyeva had [[heart failure]] simptoms. Having full of vigour and enthusiasm, Ilhama Guliyeva died of [[thromboembolism]] on February 25, 2016. Despite the fact that [[ambulance service]] arrived on time, her health condition had already deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.milli.az/culture/410773.html İlhamə Quliyeva vəfat etdi]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2016, Ilhama Guliyeva was buried next to her mother {{ill|Tükazban Ismayılova|az}} and stepfather {{ill|Həbib Bayramov|az}} in the Second [[Alley of Honor]] in [[Baku]]. The reason of the death of Ilhama Guliyeva was investigated and revealed by ''the Court of Medical Expertise and Pathological Anatomy'' of [[Azerbaijan]]. 
As a sign of respect towards Guliyeva's musical creativity, such Azerbaijani high ranking social and political figures as President [[Ilham Aliyev]], Prime Minister [[Artur Rasizade]], Speaker of National Assembly [[Ogtay Asadov]], Minister of Culture and Tourism [[Abulfaz Garayev]], [[People's Artist of USSR]] and [[Azerbaijan]] [[Zeynab Khanlarova]], composer [[Eldar Mansurov]] and others signed [[obituary]] and expressed their condolences to Guliyeva's family members:&lt;ref&gt;[http://modern.az/az/news/97130/#gsc.tab=0 Prezidentlə baş nazir İlhamə Quliyevanın vəfatı ilə bağlı nekroloq imzaladı]&lt;/ref&gt;

He pleaded guilty in 2018 to wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering relating to misuse of the state's surplus money and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.

==Background==

A native of [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma]], Files graduated [[cum laude]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[accounting]] from [[Arkansas State University]] in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]]. Previously, he had attended [[Ouachita Baptist University]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]].&lt;ref name=vsmart/&gt; He is the owner of FFH Construction, a general construction firm. From 1997 to 2004, he was the president and superintendent of the Fort Smith Christian School. Prior to that, he was hired to help start operations of the Baldor Electric Company plant in [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]], Arkansas, as the accountant and materials manager.  He and his wife, the former Michaela K.

The senator [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] [[Little League]] [[baseball]] and [[basketball]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Political life==
From 1999 to 2003, he represented District 12 in the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]]. Files was first elected to the State Senate in 2010 in District 13.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2011/Member%20Profiles/Jake%20Files.pdf|title=Jake Files|publisher=arkleg.state.ar.us|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His district number was switched through [[redistricting]] from District 13 to District 8, effective January 2013, and his district boundaries changed to include most of the cities of [[Greenwood, Arkansas|Greenwood]] and [[Hackett, Arkansas|Hackett]].&lt;ref name=vsmart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/16268/jake-files#.UplRqBXnYfQ|title=Jake Files' Biography|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on Senate committees for Revenue &amp; Taxation, Transportation, Technology, Legislative Affairs, Joint Budget, and Senate Efficiency. He was also a member of the Joint (House and Senate) Legislative Committee on Auditing. He was chairman of the Revenue and Taxation Committee.

==Fraud scandal==
In early 2017, Files was accused of submitting false bids for the River Valley Sports Complex, a planned park of softball fields at Chaffee Crossing in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]]. Though initially denying the charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Kate|title=State Senator: Claims Of False Bids For Fort Smith Complex Aren’t True|url=http://5newsonline.com/2017/02/20/state-senator-claims-of-false-bids-for-fort-smith-complex-arent-true/ |accessdate=1 March 2017|publisher=KFSM|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Files pleaded guilty to wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas]] in January 2018.&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{ cite web |first= Dave |last= Hughes |title= Arkansas lawmaker pleads guilty to wire fraud, money laundering; governor says senator to resign soon |url= http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/jan/29/arkansas-lawmaker-pleads-guilty-wire-fraud-money-l/?breaking |publisher= Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date= January 29, 2018 |accessdate= January 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his senate seat in February.&lt;ref name="sentenced"/&gt;

===Plea===
The plea agreement says Files and Lee Webb, a member of the [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian County]] Election Commission, convinced the City of Fort Smith to appropriate $1.6 million for the project in 2014. Files then created three fictitious companies to bid for the project. He later proposed steering $150,000 of public funds from the state's General Improvement Fund (GIF) to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hammersly|first1=Lisa|title=In dark on bids Arkansas senator submitted, companies say|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/feb/19/in-dark-on-bids-files-submitted-compani/?latest|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Files had control over the funds, and was chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee.

'''James Elliott Bama''' (born April 28, 1926, [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]])&lt;ref name="Mantle Fielding's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Brian M.|title=James Bama: American Realist|year=2006|publisher=Flesk|location=Santa Cruz, CA|isbn=0-9723758-8-0|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[artist]] known for his realistic paintings and etchings of [[Western United States|Western]] subjects. Life in [[Wyoming]] led to his comment, "Here an artist can trace the beginnings of Western history, see the first buildings, the oldest wagons, saddles and guns, and be up close to the remnants of Indian culture ... And you can stand surrounded by nature's wonders."

==Biography==
Born in [[Manhattan]] in 1926, he grew up copying [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[comic strip]]. He had his first professional sale when he was 15, a drawing of [[Yankee Stadium]] in the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''. He graduated from New York's [[The High School of Music and Art|High School of Music and Art]] and entered the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]], working as a mechanic, [[mural]] painter, and physical training instructor.

When discharged from the service, and back in New York City, he studied drawing and anatomy at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]]. Beginning in 1951, he was an illustrator at New York's Charles E. Cooper Studios for 15 years. His first paperback cover was Nelson Nye's ''A Bullet for Billy the Kid'' (1950). Bama had a 22-year career as a successful [[commercial artist]], producing paperback book covers, movie posters and illustrations for such publications as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and his numerous clients included the New York Giants football team, the Baseball and Football Halls of Fame and the U.S. Air Force. Beginning with ''The Man of Bronze'' (1964), he did a powerful set of 62 covers for the ''[[Doc Savage]]'' Bantam Books paperbacks, often using as a model actor [[Steve Holland (actor)|Steve Holland]], star of TV's ''Flash Gordon'' (1954–55). He also painted the box cover art for [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]]'s monster model kits, including [[King Kong]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]], [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and [[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdevito.com/tim.htm The Art of Joe DeVito - Tim Lasiuta Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he married Lynne Klepfer, a New York University graduate with an art history major. Two years later, in June, 1966, the couple headed west as guests of artist Bob Meyers at his Circle M ranch near [[Cody, Wyoming]]. Meyers had walked out on his career as a successful Manhattan illustrator with such magazines as ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' to run his ranch and paint. After return visits in 1967, the Bamas left New York and moved during September, 1968, into a cabin on Meyers’ ranch. Bama began to paint contemporary Western subjects during the daytime while doing his freelance illustrations in the evenings. He recalled, "I never came out here with the idea to be a Western artist. It just happened, and that’s the way it should be."

In 1970 Bob Meyers was murdered, and his widow Helen moved from the ranch. The Bamas moved to a house on Dunn Creek, Wapiti, 20 miles outside Cody, in 1971. In May, 1971, Bama connected with a New York dealer, prompting his decision to abandon illustration and put his total concentration into the creation of easel paintings. In Wapiti, James and Lynne Bama built a home and studio, moving into it when their son Ben was born in 1977.

His work is collected in ''The Western Art of James Bama'' (Bantam Books, 1975) and ''The Art of James Bama'' (1993). Brian M. Kane's ''James Bama: American Realist'' (Flesk, 2006) has an introduction by [[Harlan Ellison]].

==Style==
Bama's art is realism. He sometimes takes advantage of his medium to use lighting techniques—such as [[Butterfly (lighting)|butterfly lighting]]—that would not be practical in a photograph taken under ambient light.

==Awards==
Bama was inducted into the Illustrator’s Hall of Fame on June 28, 2000. At the [[Buffalo Bill Historical Center]], when he was the first Honored Artist at the Buffalo Bill Art Show in 2003, Bama commented, "Everything I’ve done — the rodeo, the trappers, the mountain men — has been done around here. The fact that I’m from Cody makes this very significant to me. They’re really honoring Cody and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center."

He was inducted into the Monster Kid Hall Of Fame at [[The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Biography ==
Jean el Mouhouv Amrouche was born February 7, 1906 in Ighil Ali, in the [[Soummam River#River valley|valley of Soumman]], in [[petite Kabylie]]. Amrouche emigrated with his family to [[Tunisia]] while still young. Jean had his secondary education at Alaoui college and then left for the ''Ecole Normale Superieure de Saint-Cloud''. He intends to become a teacher. The poet Armand Guibert made him known in Tunisia by publishing his two collections of poems, ''Cendres'' (poems 1928–1934) in 1934 and ''Étoile secrète'' in 1937. He wrote at that time (poems, literary criticism) in Tunisian journals and gave lectures at the ''Cercle de l'Essor'' in Tunis. For several years with his friend Armand Guibert, he visited many countries in Europe. In 1943, he joined the Ministry of Information in Algiers, then the [[Radiodiffusion Française]].&lt;ref name="EB2485"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

[[File:john-hollingshead-1895.jpg|thumb|right|John Hollingshead in 1895]]
'''John Hollingshead''' (9 September 1827 – 9 October 1904) was an English theatrical [[impresario]], journalist and writer during the latter half of the 19th century. After a journalism career, Hollingshead managed the [[Alhambra Theatre]] and was later the first manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]]. Hollingshead also wrote several books during his life.

An innovative producer, Hollingshead brought [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] together in 1871 to produce their first joint work, a musical [[extravaganza]] called ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]''.  Among other theatrical works that he produced, he mounted a long series of popular [[Victorian burlesques]] at the Gaiety, engaging [[Meyer Lutz]] to compose original scores for them. He also produced operettas, plays and other works. These productions made stars of [[Nellie Farren]] and several others. At the Gaiety, in 1878, Hollingshead was the first theatre manager to light his auditorium with electric lights.

==Life and career==
[[File:John Hollingshead.jpg|thumb|right|Hollingshead in an 1870 cartoon]]
Hollingshead was born in [[Hoxton]], Greater London, the son of Henry Randall Hollingshead. He was educated at Homerton.&lt;ref name=Waddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|first=|others=Illustrated by [[s:Author:Frederick Waddy|Frederick Waddy]]|title=Cartoon portraits and biographical sketches of men of the day

|accessdate=6 January 2011|year=1873|publisher=Tinsley Brothers|location=London|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first worked as a bookkeeper for a soft goods company in London in the early 1850s while publishing political essays on finance and social reform.&lt;ref name=Hollingshead73&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He soon entered into a partnership as a clothing merchant.  During this time, Hollingshead and his friend [[Moy Thomas]] began publishing a penny paper called ''The Mail'' that proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, he decided to close his clothing business and begin working as a writer full-time.  By 1855, Hollingshead was married with two children.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London at the age of 77.

===Journalist and author===
Hollingshead started his journalism career in 1854 under the tutelage of [[Charles Dickens]] at ''Household Words'' magazine and then under [[W. M. Thackeray]] at ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0DE2D61230E132A25752C1A9669D946597D6CF Obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he acted as the "special correspondent" for ''[[The Morning Post]]'' during the London famine.  He also wrote essays, short stories and dramatic criticism.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=New Play at the Odeon; Said Not to Be a Good One, But to Be Interesting|date= 3 October 1892|work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E0D91E39E033A25750C0A9669D94639ED7CF |accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1864, and for several years thereafter, he contributed to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]]'', mostly writing on political topics related to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated the principles of Mill and [[Jeremy Bentham]].  One of his best-known essays was an 1857 piece called "The City of Unlimited Paper", which became famous during the monetary panic of 1857.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; In the 1860s he was on the staff of ''[[Good Words]]'' under [[Norman Macleod (1812–1872)|Norman Macleod]] as editor.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Hollingshead, John|magazine= Who's who biographies, 1901|pages=578–579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollingshead wrote a number of books from the 1850s into the 1860s, including ''On the canal: a narrative of a voyage from London to Birmingham'' (1858); ''Under Bow Bells'' (1860, a collection of some of his essays),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Bow bells |author=John Hollingshead |year=1860|publisher=Groombridge and sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSkgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22under+bow+bells%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_Z2ZbFtdi4&amp;sig=zAyJB2VoYq8ZE1lC7xCnvYt169I }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rubbing the Gilt Off'' (a collection of his early political essays (1860)&lt;ref name=Hollingshead73/&gt; ''Odd Journeys'' (1860, a collection of travels),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Odd journeys in and out of London |author=John Hollingshead |year=1860 |publisher=Groombridge |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKICAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22odd+journeys%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5S30XjAGf2&amp;sig=snXFbK3eXOFbNiNgKGjyzpWSqCY }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ways of Life'' (1861, a volume of humorous papers),&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; ''Ragged London'' (1861, a collection of his reports for the ''Morning Post''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ragged London in 1861 |author=John Hollingshead |year= |publisher= |isbn=1-4021-8921-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsz9S4a4YL4C&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22odd+journeys%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ft-1c6YG7F&amp;sig=KdWsTlRSMpHCf2GohX7kEuOglQg }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Underground London'' (1862).  Other publications included a collection of humorous stories entitled ''Rough Diamonds'' and two volumes of miscellaneous essays called ''Today''.  He also wrote plays.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;

[[File:John Hollingshead - Entr'acte.png|left|thumb|150px|Hollingshead in 1898]]
In the 1880s, Hollingshead returned to writing, producing books mostly about the theatre, including ''Plain English'' (1880),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plain English |author=John Hollingshead |year=1880 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoI0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22plain+english%22#PPA120,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Footlights'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footlights |author=John Hollingshead |year=1883 |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02oOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+footlights&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bQMymPBgcA&amp;sig=yrYxlnN4TpyKC_qXD57NcYvt1ts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the 1890s, he wrote a number of memoirs and more books about the theatres that he had managed.  In 1892, he also published ''The Story of Leicester Square'', tracing the history, geography and architecture of the London neighbourhood from earliest times through the date of publication.  His memoir entitled ''My Lifetime'', published in 1895, explores his life and career through that date.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

===Producer and theatre manager===

====The Alhambra Theatre and theatrical innovations====
In the 1860s, Hollingshead turned to theatre management. He helped establish the [[Alhambra Theatre]] and was the stage manager there from 1865 to 1868, in addition to producing musical pieces and ballets there.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring [[corps de ballet]] and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar, where the young ladies of the ballet hinted at more than [[terpsichorean]] pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. "The spark that lit the bonfire", in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'', The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure at the Alhambra, Hollingshead introduced London audiences to the [[Can-Can]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Hollingshead is also credited with inventing the practice of holding general matinées.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; Hollingshead was one of the first London theatre managers to eliminate fees for programmes and coat check.

He left the Alhambra to manage the newly redesigned [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]. In addition, Hollingshead managed shows at the [[Opera Comique]] from time to time. He produced a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Princess Toto]]'' there in 1881, paired with [[Rutland Barrington]]'s short play, ''Quid Pro Quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Savoy Opera |author=S.

====The Gaiety Theatre====
In 1868, Hollingshead took over the Gaiety Theatre, which had been a large [[music hall]]. The auditorium was rebuilt and, under Hollingshead, it became a venue primarily for musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], variety, continental [[operetta]], including several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]], and light comedy, under Hollingshead's management, from 1868 to 1886.  The theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with the successful ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], a burlesque of the opera ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx Digital Guide to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031152934/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx |date=31 October 2007 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert also wrote ''[[An Old Score]]'' for the theatre in 1869.  Another early production was [[Alfred Thompson (librettist)|Alfred Thompson]]'s ''Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key'' (1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030208.html Information about the ''Columbus'' burlesque]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nellie Farren]] starred in both ''Columbus'' and ''Robert the Devil''.  She continued as "Principal Boy" at the Gaiety for the next 25 years, first under Hollingshead and then under [[George Edwardes]].  Other Gaiety stalwarts were [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]], [[Kate Vaughan]] and [[Fred Leslie]].  The theatre's music director, [[Meyer Lutz]], composed or arranged the music for many of its most successful burlesques.

[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|400px|thumb|left|Illustration of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] work]]
In 1870, [[Henry James Byron]]'s ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' starred a young [[Henry Irving]].  This was the last play that theatre buff [[Charles Dickens]] saw before his death.  Other pieces at Hollingshead's Gaiety in 1870 included ''Dot'' ([[Dion Boucicault]]'s version of ''The Cricket on the Hearth''); and ''The Princess of Trebizonde'', based on the [[Jacques Offenbach]] operetta (1870).  ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first collaboration between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and [[J. L. Toole]] in the title role.  Offenbach's ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'' played in 1872, starring [[Fred Sullivan]].  This was followed by such works as ''Shilly-Shally'' (1872) by [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Charles Reade]]; ''Antony and Cleopatra'' (1873); and ''The Battle of Life'', (based on [[Charles Dickens]]'s Christmas story of that title).  Two other [[Dion Boucicault]] plays produced by Hollingshead's company in the early 1870s were ''Night and Morning'' and ''Led Astray''.  Boucicault's ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' was travestied in Byron's ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Includes a profile of the Gaiety and other Victorian theatres]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Montecristofarren.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sheet music from ''Monte Cristo, Jr.'']]
In the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its auditorium. Hollingshead's productions there included ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), Byron's farce ''Little Doctor Faust'' (1878)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information from Footlight Notes website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's ''Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle'' (1879);&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20050226home.html Information and images regarding ''Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Robbing Roy'' (1879).  [[Meyer Lutz]]'s ''[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves]]'' was performed in 1880 (Hollingshead had produced a highly successful charity production called ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' at the Gaiety in 1878), and a burlesque of ''[[Aladdin]]'', by [[Robert Reece]], in 1881.  These were followed by ''Little Robin Hood'' (1882), a burlesque by Reece, ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]], based on ''[[The Tempest]]''), ''Don Yuan'', Byron's ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' (a send-up of Boucicault's play), ''Mazeppa'' (1884), ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), and dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Plarr, Victor G. ''Men and Women of the Time'' (1898) G. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the Gaiety burlesques from 1868.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

Nevertheless, burlesque and risque operettas were the normal fare at the Gaiety.  Hollingshead called himself a "licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, [[Shakespeare]], taste and musical glasses."&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date= 4 January 2008 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, George Edwards took over the lease to the Gaiety.

'''Joseph Agricol Viala''' (22 September 1780, [[Avignon]] – 6 July 1793, [[Caumont-sur-Durance]]) was a child hero in the [[French Revolutionary Army]]. He was killed at age 12. 

==Life==
Viala was living in [[Avignon]] when, in 1793, a [[federalist revolts|federalist revolt]] broke out in the Midi after the fall of the [[Girondins]] in [[Paris]]. Supported by the British, the French Royalists allied themselves with the [[Federalist revolts|Federalists]] and took control of [[Toulon]] and [[Marseille]]. Faced with this uprising, the Revolutionary soldiers were forced to abandon [[Nîmes]], [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] and [[Arles]] to the insurgents and fall back on Avignon. The inhabitants of [[Lambesc]] and [[Tarascon]] joined up with the rebels from Marseilles and together they headed for the [[Durance]] in order to march on [[Lyon]], which had also [[Revolt of Lyon against the National Convention|revolted]] against the central government in Paris. The rebels hoped to destroy the Convention and put an end to the [[French Revolution]].

Joseph Agricol Viala was a nephew of [[Agricol Moureau]], a [[club des Jacobins|Jacobin]] from Avignon, editor of the ''[[Courrier d'Avignon]]'' and administrator of the département of Vaucluse. Joseph Agricol thus became commander of the "Espérance de la Patrie", a [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] formed wholly of young men from Avignon.&lt;ref name=Vovelle2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Vovelle |first=Michel |year=2005 |chapter=Viala, Agricol Joseph |editor-last=Soboul |editor-first=Albert |editor-link=Albert Soboul |title=Dictionnaire historique de la Révolution française |location=Paris |publisher=Quadrige |language=fr |p=1087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On hearing news of the approach of the rebels from Marseille, at the start of July 1793, the Republican forces (mainly those from Avignon) gathered to stop the rebels crossing the Durance. Viala attached himself to the national guards from Avignon. Numerically inferior, their only solution was to cut the ropes of the [[Pont de Bonpas|bac de Bonpas]] under enemy fire. To do so, they had to cross a road completely exposed to rebel fire and behind which the Revolutionary forces had dug in. Despite its necessity, the Revolutionary forces were reluctant to undertake such a hazardous mission. According to accounts of the event, the 12-year-old Viala grabbed a hatchet, launched himself at the cable and started to cut it. He was the subject of several musket vollies and he was mortally wounded by a musket ball from one of them. One account stated:
{{quote|text=In vain they tried to hold him back ; he braved the danger and no one could stop him from carrying out his audacious plan. He seized a sapper's hatchet, he shot at the enemy several times with his musket, then, despite the musket balls whistling around him he reached the river bank and, seizing his hatchet, struck the rope with vigour. Luck seemed to be with him at first, he nearly completed his perilous task without being hit, when at that moment a musket ball pierced his breast. He still managed to get up ; but he fell again with great force, crying out [in [[Provencal dialect]]] "M’an pas manqua ! Aquo es egaou ; more per la libertat." ("They haven't missed me! All is equal - I die for liberty."). Then he expired after the sublime farewell, without a complaint or regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1852 |chapter=Joseph Agricol Viala |editor-last=Mullié |editor-first=Charles |title=Biographie des célébrités militaires des armées de terre et de mer de 1789 à 1850 |language=fr |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k36796t.image.hl.r=corvisart.f3 |accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Viala's attempt was unable to stop the rebels crossing the Durance, however. Nevertheless, it allowed the Revolutionary forces to carry out an ordered retreat without being able to pick up Viala's body. According to tradition, the Revolutionary soldier who heard Viala's last words tried to pick up the body but had to retreat before he could do so. This left the body to be insulted and mutilated by the advancing Royalists before they crossed the river. Learning of her son's death, Viala's mother said "Yes [...] he died for the fatherland!".

==Honours==
===18th century===
Viala and [[Joseph Bara|Bara]] were the best known child heroes of the French Revolution, though Viala was later and thus less well-known - indeed, the Jacobin press did not invoke his memory before [[pluviôse]] [[an II]]. It was above all the speech made by [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] before the Convention on 18 [[floréal]] which contributed to the spread of Viala's mythology. In that speech, Robespierre stated "By what fate or by what ingratitude has one yet hero younger and worthier of posterity been left forgotten?". At the request of [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac|Barère]], the assembly voted that Viala be honoured in the [[Panthéon]], though the ceremony had to be postponed from 30 [[messidor]] to 10 [[thermidor]] and was then cancelled on [[Thermidorian reaction|Robespierre's fall]] on 9 Thermidor. Even so, during the month of [[prairial]], [[Claude-François de Payan|Payan]] published a ''Précis historique sur Agricol Viala'' which contributed to Viala's rising popularity. A civic festival was organised in Avignon on 30 [[messidor]] "in honour of Bara and Viala".{{r|Vovelle2005}} An engraving of Viala's face was also distributed to all primary schools.

The engraver [[Pierre-Michel Alix]] (1762–1817) produced a head-and-shoulders portrait of Viala. [[Louis Emmanuel Jadin]] (1768–1853) wrote the one-act play ''Agricol Viala, ou Le jeune héros de la Durance'' (''Agricol Viala, or The young hero of the Durance''), put on in Paris on 1 July 1794. 1794 also saw the composition of the marching song the ''[[Chant du départ]]'', whose fourth stanza is placed in a child's mouth and mentions both Bara and Viala. The 1795-launched ship ''[[French ship Viala (1795)|Viala]]'' was named after him.

===19th and 20th centuries===
[[File:Death of Viala-Pierre-Paul Prudhon-MBA Lyon 1966-13-IMG 0455.jpg|thumb|''The death of Viala'', by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]].]]
In 1822, the sculptor Antoine Allier created a life-size bronze monument to Viala, showing him nude and from behind, with his right hand placed on a hatchet and his left arm gripping a pole with a ring and a length of rope. After being given by the [[Louvre]] to the town museum, it was set up on place Gustave-Charpentier, in the suburb of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], in June 1993.

Under the [[French Third Republic]], historgraphy and scholarly literature contributed to renewed interest in the figures of Viala and Bara.{{r|Vovelle2005}} Viala is also one of the 660 figures whose names are engraved on the [[Arc de triomphe]] (he appears on the 18th column as ''VIALA'') and the rue Viala, in the [[15e arrondissement of Paris]], bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v2asp.paris.fr/v2/nomenclature_voies/Voieactu/9741.nom.htm|title=rue Viala|last=|first=|date=9 June 2008|publisher=|language=french|work=paris.fr|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the historiographical struggle between pro- and anti-Revolutionary figures, local anti-Revolutionary historians have tried to establish that Viala provoked the rebels with rude gestures. Other than Viala, it seems above all to have been his uncle (known as the "homme rouge" or "red man") who had been seen doing this.{{r|Vovelle2005}}

'''José Azueta Abad''' (May 2, 1895 – May 10, 1914), usually known as '''José Azueta''', was a [[Mexican Navy]] lieutenant who became famous for his role in the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]], where he was fatally wounded. He is one of the most revered national heroes in Veracruz.

==Early life and education==
Born in Guerrero on May 2, 1895, son to Commodore Manuel Azueta Perillos and Josefa Abad. Due to the labor of his father in military service, the family moved to the port of [[Veracruz]]. There he completed basic education in José Miguel Macías of Veracruz School where he showed quick progress especially at discipline and behavior. At age 11, his father was promoted to Captain of the ship to the Director of the Naval Academy, at that time, Jose showed his interest and affection for the profession of his father, and in 1909 he began taking classes at the Navy school. At 15, he applied to the Naval Academy and  was approved on August 27.

The son of Commodore [[Manuel Azueta]], commander of the [[Veracruz Naval Academy]], [[Lieutenant]] Azueta was wounded on April 21, 1914, the first day of the invasion.

==Career==
Azueta was manning a [[machine gun]] placed outside the building, facing the incoming U.S. troops on his own and causing a number of casualties. After having been mortally wounded by [[U.S. Navy]] marksman [[Joseph Gabriel Harner|Joseph G. Harner]], who took several shots at him from about 300 yards away, he was rescued from the battlefield and taken to his home,.&lt;ref&gt;[The Landing at Veracruz:1914'', Jack Sweetman, 1968, p.71]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle, U.S. [[Admiral]] [[Frank Friday Fletcher]] heard of Azueta's actions and sent word to him via messenger that he (Fletcher) wished to visit the fallen defender and pay his respects. Azueta—through his surgeon and local political activist Dr. [[Roberto Reyes Barreiro]]—sent word to Fletcher refusing the visit, saying "If the American (Fletcher) enters my house, I will either kill him or me." Fletcher then offered to send his personal doctor to take care of him. However, Azueta refused medical services offered by the occupation army and only allowed local Dr. Rafael Cuervo Xicoy to treat him. Dr. Xicoy lacked medical supplies to assist Azueta properly. At the time of his death, Lt. Azueta was being cared for by the surgeon Reyes Barreiro.

On April 24, Lieutenant Azueta was promoted immediately to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] by the President of the Republic &lt;!---Huerta, presumably?---&gt; for his performance in combat. On April 29, he was awarded a gold medal with the Decoration of the Second U.S. Invasion. Again on May 1, he was issued the [[Military decorations of Mexico|3rd Class Military Merit medal]].

Azueta died of his wounds on May 10, Mexico's Mother's Day. During his funeral hundreds of citizens marched holding his coffin on their shoulders to the city's cemetery in open defiance to directives from the occupation army forbidding assembly.

==Legacy==
[[Image:José Azueta - herido - May-1914.jpg|thumb|right|José Azueta, hospitalized ''([[General National Archive (Mexico)|Archivo General de la Nación]])'']]
The [[municipalities of Mexico|municipalities]] of [[José Azueta, Guerrero]], and [[José Azueta, Veracruz]], were named after him.

'''Katrina Kaif''' ({{IPA-hns|kəˈʈriːnaː ˈkɛːf|pron}}, born '''Katrina Turquotte''', 16 July 1983) is an English actress who works in [[Bollywood|Hindi films]].&lt;ref name="citizen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hafeez |first=Mateen |title=Working in Bollywood for years, but shy of citizenship? |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Working-in-Bollywood-for-years-but-shy-of-citizenship/articleshow/6458769.cms?referral=PM |accessdate=1 March 2014 |work=The Times of India |date=30 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117202653/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Working-in-Bollywood-for-years-but-shy-of-citizenship/articleshow/6458769.cms?referral=PM |archivedate=17 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics for her acting prowess, she has established herself in Bollywood and is one of India's highest-paid actresses.

Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and her family lived in several countries before she moved to [[London]]. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker [[Kaizad Gustad]] spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in ''[[Boom (film)|Boom]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, ''[[Malliswari (2004 film)|Malliswari]]'' (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies ''[[Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?]]'' (2005) and ''[[Namastey London]]'' (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to [[Androcentrism|male-dominated]] films.

Kaif's performance in the terrorism drama ''[[New York (film)|New York]]'' (2009) was better received, earning her a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]] nomination. After roles in ''[[Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani]]'' (2009), ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010) and ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'' (2011), she received her second [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] nomination for her performance in ''[[Mere Brother Ki Dulhan]]'' (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the spy thriller ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' (2012) and its [[Tiger Zinda Hai|2017 sequel]], and the action thriller ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013), all of which rank among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films of all time]]. 

In addition to acting, Kaif is involved with her mother's charity and participates in stage shows. She is guarded about her personal life, which is a subject of media scrutiny, as is her background.

But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with ''[[The Indian Express]]'', she said she was not in touch with her father.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;

The younger woman is sitting on the right wearing a white dress, while the older woman is wearing a black dress.|Kaif with her mother at the [[People's Choice Awards India]], 2012|268x268px]]
Kaif says that her mother decided to "dedicate her life to social causes", which led to the family's relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time:&lt;blockquote&gt;Our transitions in growing up were—from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from Japan by boat to France&amp;nbsp;...

After that we went to Belgium, then to Hawaii, which was a short time, and then came to London.&lt;ref name="dumb"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to their frequent relocation, Kaif and her siblings were [[Homeschooling|home-schooled]] by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chaudhury |first=Shoma |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main40.asp?filename=hub041008The_man.asp |title=The Man Of The Family |journal=[[Tehelka]] |volume=5 |issue=39 |accessdate=18 June 2014 |date=4 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714141625/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main40.asp?filename=hub041008The_man.asp |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India.&lt;ref name="dumb"/&gt; According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it would be easier to pronounce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My name’s Turquotte: Katrina |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/My-names-Turquotte-Katrina/articleshow/4986854.cms?referral=PM |accessdate=12 October 2013 |work=The Times of India |date=9 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215032330/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/My-names-Turquotte-Katrina/articleshow/4986854.cms?referral=PM |archivedate=15 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry.&lt;ref name="cream"/&gt; In a 2011 interview with ''[[Mumbai Mirror]]'', ''[[Boom (film)|Boom]]'' producer [[Ayesha Shroff]] accused Kaif of fabricating her history: "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience&amp;nbsp;... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too&amp;nbsp;... religious?&amp;nbsp;... [[Mohammad Kaif]] was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great".&lt;ref name="rise"/&gt; Kaif called Shroff's comments "hurtful".&lt;ref name="cream"/&gt;

Critics praised her action sequences but criticised her lack of dialogues. Rachit Gupta of ''[[Filmfare]]'' said, "The screenplay goes easy on [Kaif] by not giving her stand and&amp;nbsp;dialogue.

'''Max Pulver''' is the author of three [[graphology]] books (1931,1934 and 1949) and several articles. He developed the theory of symbolism of space. His work discusses pressure, intelligence, and [[crime]]. He founded the ''Schweizerische Graphologische Gesellschaft'' (Swiss Graphological Society) in 1950 and was president until his death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== Symbolism ==
=== Major Symbolism ===
Major [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] starts with the point, and examines where and how it travels, to derive an understanding of the [[personality]]. This travel is not restricted to strokes. It can be equally applied to white space within a page, or the page as a whole.

=== Minor Symbolism ===
This looks at the stroke structures, or sequence of stroke structures, reflecting upon what they are [[symbol]]s of. Within this context, a strong leftward moving stroke through a [[signature]] would be symbolic of removing one's self from life. How that removal manifests depends upon what else is contained within the [[handwriting]].

'''Michel Mirowski''' (October 14, 1924 – March 26, 1990) was a physician who helped develop the [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcmj.org/article/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator-mirowski-its-current-use|title=The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: From Mirowski to its current use {{!}} BC Medical Journal|website=www.bcmj.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], he practiced medicine in [[Israel]] before coming to [[Sinai Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. While there he collaborated with [[Morton Mower|Dr. Morton Mower]] and later Dr. Stephen Heilman's [[artificial pacemaker]] company to develop the first implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

==Early life==
Mirowski was born as '''Mordechai Frydman''' on October 14, 1924, in [[Warsaw]]. When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland in the fall of 1939, his father renamed him as '''Mieczysław Mirowski''' to try to protect him from the [[anti-Semitism]] of the time. Later, his French wife, Anna, would call him Michel, by which he became known.

To escape the Nazis, Mirowski fled to [[Ukraine]], and for the next five years survived under the most appalling conditions. By 1944 he was an officer in a Polish regiment and returned to Poland where, as the war ended, he registered as a medical student at the University of [[Gdańsk]]. "Warsaw had been completely destroyed, including its ghetto," he remembered. "None of my family was left. I couldn't even find our old home." Mirowski attended medical school there for a year, but gradually came to believe, "I had to leave Poland. I had become a Zionist. After all that had happened and that I had seen, the Jews had to have a country of their own to survive. As far as Poland was concerned, it had become a cemetery for me. I told myself that I would never return."

===Medical training===

Mirowski emigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], but no medical schools were operating there in the early post-war years.  He returned to Europe to seek training and entered the medical school at [[Lyon]], France, in the fall of 1947. His French was poor, and his English almost non-existent. He listened to the lectures and demonstrations in French and studied medical texts in English as he taught himself both languages.

Graduating in 1954, Mirowski returned to Israel and to a position at the Tel Hashomer Hospital where he became first assistant to Dr. Harry Heller, the chief of medicine, an association which would eventually lead him to his great project. Having decided to practice cardiology, Mirowski studied at the [[Cardiological Institute in Mexico City]] and with Dr. [[Helen Taussig]], the pioneering pediatric cardiologist at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore.

===Treating dangerous arrhythmias===
For the next 5 years, Mirowski was the sole cardiologist at [[Asaf Harofeh Hospital]], 15 miles from [[Tel Aviv]]. In 1966, Professor Heller started having episodes of ventricular tachycardia (a dangerous rapid heart rhythm) and died 2 weeks later while at dinner with his family.

Mirowski wondered what could have been done to prevent his mentor's death. He reasoned that it should be possible to implant a defibrillator in the body that would convert arrhythmias when they occurred. He consulted cardiologists who knew more about such devices. They told him that debrillators could not be miniaturized. In an era when defibrillators weighed 30 to 40 pounds, it seemed preposterous to propose reducing it to the size of a cigarette box.

Mirowski decided that only in the United States could he find the funds and technical support for the project that was becoming almost an obsession for him. Through an American colleague, Mirowski learned of a job at [[Sinai Hospital of Baltimore]], an affiliate of the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], where he would be director of the coronary care unit but have half of his time to work on his defibrillator. So his family, which now consisted of Anna and their three daughters - each of whom would become a doctor -returned to the United States.

For the next 12 years, Mirowski and his colleagues developed their device and miniaturized it to be implanted in patients. On February 4, 1980, the first patient received a defibrillator, installed in an operating room at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Since then, the device Mirowski invented, much improved and further miniaturized, has been installed in millions of patients.

==Later life==
In the mid 1980s, Mirowski developed [[multiple myeloma]], a cancer of the blood. When his medical condition became desperate, and fighting against the odds as usual, he insisted on receiving the most intensive [[chemotherapy]]. When the disease stopped responding, his oncologist raised the possibility of a [[bone marrow transplantation]], then in experimental development for the treatment of myeloma. A near relative as donor would be needed. Mirowski's brother, Abraham, had died in the [[Holocaust]]. Mirowski died on March 26, 1990 at the age of 65 years.

Though his work had been ridiculed for many years&amp;mdash;someone described it as a "bomb inside the body"&amp;mdash;and he was long unable to obtain grants to support the development of the defibrillator, the last 5 years of his life brought Mirowski both recognition and acclaim. Professional societies and leaders of academic medical institutions honored him. He received invitations to write more articles and give more lectures than he could accept. So he picked and chose, accommodating his friends and those who supported him in darker times. Often with his wife or children, he traveled where he wished since now he was welcome everywhere.

When he spoke overseas, Mirowski usually lectured in [[English language|English]], but he often discussed his papers during the question and answer period in the language of the country he was visiting. He spoke [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Yiddish]] fluently, but he never learned [[Italian language|Italian]] and refused to learn [[German language|German]].

Mirowski was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] for co-inventing with [[Morton Mower]] the [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator]] (ICD) in the 1960s after his mentor died of a heart arrhythmia. The Patent number is 4,202,340 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/175.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021025130854/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/175.html |archivedate=2002-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mary (given name)|name ''Mary'']] (Greek ''{{lang|grc|Μαριαμ}}'' or ''{{lang|grc|Μαρια}}'') appears 61 times in the [[New Testament]], in 53 different verses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=Mary&amp;version1=GNT&amp;searchtype=phrase&amp;resultspp=500&amp;displayas=long&amp;sort=bookorder Bible Gateway search results for ''Mary'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was the single most popular female name among Palestinian Jews of the time, borne by about one in five women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony | last=Bauckham | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Bauckham | year=2006 | page=89 | isbn=0802831621 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the New Testament references to ''Mary'' provide only the barest identifying information. Scholars and traditions therefore differ as to how many distinct women these references represent and which of them refer to the same person.

A common [[Protestant]] tradition holds that there are six different women named as ''Mary'' in the New Testament: Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary Magdalene; Mary of Bethany; Mary mother of James the younger; Mary mother of John Mark; and Mary of Rome.&lt;ref name=WWB255/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/mary.html retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A common [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes six New Testament saints called ''Mary'': Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary Magdalene; Mary, mother of James and Joses;&lt;ref name=smithmag/&gt; (Mary) Salome (who is also identified as the mother of James and Joseph the sons of Zebedee); Mary of Clopas; Mary of Bethany, sister of Martha and Lazarus.

And there are other variations. In most traditions at least [[three Marys]] are present at the Crucifixion and at the Resurrection, but again traditions differ as to the identities of these three, and as to whether they are the same three at these two events.

==Mary, mother of Jesus==
[[File:Frari (Venice) - Sacristy - Il Sassoferrato - Madonna in prayer.jpg|thumb|''The Madonna in Sorrow'', by [[Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato|Sassoferrato]], 17th&amp;nbsp;century]]
{{main|Mary, mother of Jesus}}
Mary the mother of Jesus, also known as ''[[the Madonna]]'', is one of the main characters of the Gospels. The terms ''[[Mariology]]'' and, in the context of [[Christianity]], ''Marian'' (for example in ''[[Marian devotions]]'' and ''[[Marian apparition]]''), both most commonly refer to this person.

She is mentioned by name twelve times in the [[Gospel of Luke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|1:27–2:34}} note Chapter 1 verses 27, 30, 34, 38–39, 41, 46, 56 and Chapter 2 verses 5, 16, 19, 34&lt;/ref&gt; five times in the [[Gospel of Matthew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|1:12–24, 2:11, 13:55}}&lt;/ref&gt; once in the [[Gospel of Mark]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|6:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once in the [[Book of Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|1:14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of these mentions by name are within [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas story]], which appears only in Matthew and Luke, not in Mark or John. Only two of the Gospel passages that mention this Mary by name, {{bibleref2|Matthew|13:55}} and {{bibleref2|Mark|6:3}}, are later in Jesus' life, and they are generally accepted as [[parallel passage]]s describing the same event. In addition {{Bibleref2|Matthew|12:46–50}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|3:31–35}} both describe Mary's visit to Jesus as an adult but without mentioning her by name, and {{Bibleref2|Luke|2:48–51}} describes an event from Jesus' later childhood with Mary again a major player but not mentioned by name.

The [[Gospel of John]] mentions her twice &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|2:1–12}} {{Bibleref2|John|19:25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without naming her, and is the only one of the Gospels to explicitly state that she was present at the Crucifixion. Matthew and Mark both list two women named ''Mary'' as present,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:56}} {{bibleref2|Mark|15:40}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most traditions do not identify either of these with the mother of Jesus, leading to the conclusion that there were [[three Marys]] present. Matthew and Mark also record the attendance of many other women whom they do not name,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:55}} {{bibleref2|Mark|15:41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luke does not identify by name any of the ''many women'' present.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|23:49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All traditions affirm her presence at the Crucifixion. Roman Catholic tradition assigns her feast days of January 1 (Mother of God), March 25 (Annunciation), August 15 (Assumption) and December 8 (Immaculate Conception), while the Church of England celebrates March 25 (Annunciation), May 31 or 2 July (visitation to Elizabeth), 15 August (Blessed Virgin), 8 September (Birth, and alternative date for Blessed Virgin) and 13 December (Conception).&lt;ref name=CofE&gt;See [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran church commemorates her at lesser festivals on May 31 (visitation to Elizabeth) and August 15 (Mother of Our Lord).&lt;ref name=Lutheran&gt;See [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary Magdalene==
[[File:Gheorghe Tattarescu - Magdalena.jpg|thumb|''Magdalena'' by [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]]]]
{{main|Mary Magdalene}}
Mary Magdalene is named three times in Matthew, four times in Mark, twice in Luke and three times in John,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=Mary+Magdalene&amp;version1=ESV&amp;searchtype=phrase&amp;resultspp=500 Bible Gateway search  results for ''Mary Magdalene'']&lt;/ref&gt; and was given the title ''Apostle to the Apostles'' by no less a person than [[St Augustine]].&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;Doyle, Ken. "Apostle to the apostles: The story of Mary Magdalene". ''Catholictimes'', 11 September 2011 {{cite web |url=http://ct.dio.org/comment-and-dialogue/question-corner/apostle-to-the-apostles-the-story-of-mary-magdalene.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416001954/http://ct.dio.org/comment-and-dialogue/question-corner/apostle-to-the-apostles-the-story-of-mary-magdalene.html |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }} Accessed 23 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

All four Gospels name her as one of the small group of women who found the tomb empty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:1–7}} {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1–8}} {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:10–12}} {{Bibleref2|John|20:1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; all but Luke name her as one of the many women present at the Crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:56}} {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:40}} {{Bibleref2|John|19:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luke names none of ''the women who had followed him from Galilee'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|23:49}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would include her. Matthew and Mark both name her as one of the small group who placed the body in the tomb.&lt;ref name=burial&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:59–61}} {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Crucifixion, however, the only explicit mention of her is in {{Bibleref2|Luke|8:2}}, in which she is one of only three named of the many women accompanying Jesus in his travels. Here she is also described as one of the ''women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities'', and as the one ''from whom seven demons had gone out''.

Several scholars and traditions identify her with other women in the New Testament, but none of these are universally accepted.&lt;ref name=LordLong&gt;Pakenham, Frank. 1974. ''The Life of Jesus Christ''. London: William Cloves &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0 283 98153 9}}. pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic]] tradition, in particular, has from time to time identified her with both Mary of Bethany and with the unnamed woman ''who was a sinner'' of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:37–39}},&lt;ref&gt;Pope, H. 1910. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09761a.htm St. Mary Magdalen], in The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=83 retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-saints.info/patron-saints/saint-mary-magdalene.htm retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the view that she is mentioned more times than Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the New Testament, and also giving rise to the legend that made her a model of a penitent sinner and even, according to [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory]], a reformed prostitute.&lt;ref name=smithmag&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/magdalene.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This view, which was taken to its extreme in ''[[Golden Legend|Legenda Aurea]]'' (c. 1260),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden230.htm retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is no longer affirmed by the Roman Catholic Church &lt;ref name=blainey159&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey|Blainey, Geoffrey]]. 2011. ''A Short History of Christianity.'' Camberwell: Viking. {{ISBN|9780670075249}} p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; but remains in popular devotion.

Her [[feast day]] is July 22, and is celebrated then by the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches and by the Church of England.&lt;ref name=CofE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt;

==Mary of Bethany==
[[File:Harold Copping Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary 400.jpg|thumb|''Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary'' by [[Harold Copping]], depicting the scene from Luke 10]]
{{main|Mary of Bethany}}
Mary, the sister of [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], lived with them in [[Bethany]], near Jerusalem. Jesus visited them there on at least two occasions. ''Mary and Martha'' are mentioned by name in John 11:1–12:8 and in Luke 10:38–41.

Three other passages, one each in Matthew, Mark and Luke, refer to an unnamed person identified by some but by no means all &lt;ref name=LordLong/&gt; authorities as this Mary, or as Mary Magdalene, or both. Roman Catholic tradition in particular identifies the person in Luke with both Mary of Bethany and [[#Mary Magdalene|Saint Mary Magdalene]].

John describes two visits by Jesus to Mary and Martha. In {{Bibleref2|John|11}}, Jesus raises Mary's brother Lazarus from death. Mary, Martha and Lazarus already appear to be very close friends of Jesus at this time. On a subsequent visit in {{Bibleref2|John|12:1–8}}, Mary anoints Jesus' feet.

{{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:6–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:3}} are generally agreed to be [[parallel passage]]s each to the other. An unnamed woman anoints Jesus at Bethany, this time in the house of ''Simon the Leper'', and she anoints his head rather than his feet. Some traditions also assert that this is the same incident as in John 12, despite the obvious discrepancies.

In {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–40}}, Jesus dines at the home of a Pharisee named Simon, but here the locality is not given. A ''woman of the city, who was a sinner'' anoints his feet, and again her name is not given. Many scholars regard this as the same incident as described in Matthew 26 and Mark 14, again despite some discrepancies. Some authorities identify this person as Mary Magdalene,&lt;ref name=smithmag/&gt; and some the event as that in John 12, again with some discrepancies.

In summary, each of the four Gospels reports an anointing. Matthew and Mark are generally agreed to describe the same event. Authorities differ as to the others, and only in John is Mary named.

In {{Bibleref2|Luke|10:38–41}}, Jesus visits Mary and Martha in an unnamed village, and Lazarus is not mentioned. It is generally agreed that these are the same Mary and Martha as in John 11-12, but whether this Mary is also the unnamed woman in Matthew 26, Mark 14 and Luke 7 (or even whether the unnamed woman in Luke is the same one as in Matthew and Mark) is not generally agreed.&lt;ref name=LordLong/&gt;

The Lutheran church commemorates her together with Martha and Lazarus on 29 July.&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt;

==Mary of Clopas==
{{main|Mary of Clopas}}

Mary, the wife of [[Clopas]], is named only once in the New Testament, in {{bibleref2|John|19:25}}, where she is listed as one of four women standing by the Cross, the others being Mary the mother of Jesus, her sister (or perhaps cousin, the Aramaic words being the same), and Mary Magdalene. An alternative reading is that the list is of only three women, and that Mary of Clopas is also the sister (or cousin) of Mary the mother of Jesus, as some traditions maintain. The passage could also be interpreted to mean that Mary of Clopas is Clopas' daughter, rather than his wife, but this is not the general view.

Many scholars identify her with ''[[#The other Mary|the other Mary]]'' mentioned twice in Matthew,&lt;ref name=WWB257&gt;''Who was Who in the Bible'', {{ISBN|0 7852 4240 6}}, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smalley&gt;S. S. Smalley, Dean Emeritus of [[Chester Cathedral]], England. "Mary," ''New Bible Dictionary'', 1982. p. 793&lt;/ref&gt; and also therefore with ''[[#Mary, mother of James|Mary mother of James (the younger)]]'' in the parallel passages in Mark.&lt;ref name=Lion&gt;Alexander, David and Pat. 1973. ''The Lion Handbook of the Bible''. {{ISBN|0-85648-010-X}}. p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the Roman Catholic tradition. Her feast day is April 24.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4956 retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars suggest that ''Clopas'' is a variant spelling of ''[[Cleopas]]'', and that Mary of Clopas is Cleopas' wife and also the unnamed person who is with him when they meet the risen Christ on the Emmaus Road in {{bibleref2|Luke|24:13–35}}. This is a minority view.&lt;ref&gt;http://topicalbible.org/c/cleopas.htm and http://topicalbible.org/c/cleophas.htm both retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Tabor]] suggests that Mary of Clopas is the same person as Mary the mother of Jesus, and that Clopas is her second husband, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] having died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabor|first=James|title=[[The Jesus Dynasty]]|year=2006|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-7432-8723-4|authorlink=James Tabor|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reading of John 19:25 then also shortens the list there to three: This Mary, her sister (or cousin), and Mary Magdalene. This view is controversial.

==Mary, mother of James==

There are five passages generally agreed to refer to ''Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses'', and two others which may refer either to her or to another ''Mary'' who was the mother of a different ''James''.
&lt;!-- ''Mary mother of Josseph'' redirects here. Please change the redirect if this anchor name changes --&gt;
{{anchor|Mary mother of Joseph}}
 
''Mary, mother of James'' is mentioned explicitly in four passages:
* {{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:55–56}} describing the Crucifixion: ''There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, among whom were Mary Magdalene and '''Mary the mother of James and Joseph''' and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.'' This is also the only reference to ''Mary mother of Joseph''.
* {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:40}} the parallel passage to Matthew 27:55–56: ''There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and '''Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses''', and Salome.'' This is also one of two references to ''Mary mother of Joses'', the other being Mark 15:47.
* {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}} leading up to the Resurrection: ''When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, '''Mary the mother of James''', and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.''
* {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:10}} following the Resurrection: ''Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and '''Mary the mother of James''' and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles''.

Most authorities agree that Mark 15:40 and 16:1 refer to the same person, but traditions and authorities differ as to the Matthew and Luke passages. Some regard them all as a single person, some as two (in various combinations), and some even as three different people. If three, then the Matthew and Luke passages are the only explicit references to either of these other two. There is a similar variety of opinions as to exactly which person is referred to as ''James'' on each occasion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm retrieved 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic tradition identifies the person in the Matthew passage as [[#Mary Salome|Saint Mary Salome]]. According to this reading, ''Mary the mother of James and Joseph'' is distinct from the ''mother of the sons of Zebedee'' who is referred to as [[#Mary Salome|Saint Mary Salome]], and the other references to ''mother of James'' refer to [[#Mary of James|Saint Mary of James]]. Protestant tradition similarly identifies two different people as being described as ''Mary mother of James'', one being the mother of [[James the younger]] and the other being the mother of [[James, son of Zebedee]].       
&lt;!-- ''Mary mother of Joses'' redirects here. Please change the redirect if this anchor name changes --&gt;
{{anchor|Mary mother of Joses}}

===Mary, mother of James the younger===
{{main|Mary (mother of James the Less)}}

In addition to the references to ''Mary mother of James'' in Mark 15:40 and 16:1, {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:47}} states that ''Mary Magdalene and '''Mary the mother of Joses''' saw where he was laid.'' Most authorities identify the person named ''Mary'' accompanying Mary Magdalene in these three passages as the same person, and hold also that she is ''the other Mary'' named twice in Matthew, see below, making at least five references to her in total.

If so this person could be unambiguously described as either ''Mary mother of Joses'' or ''Mary mother of James the younger'', but despite the former name appearing in both Mark 15:40 and 15:47 as opposed to only Mark 15:40 for the latter, it is ''mother of James the younger'' which has been generally adopted. She is also sometimes referred to as ''Mary,  mother of [[James son of Alphaeus]]'', and identified by Roman Catholic tradition as Mary Jacobe.

The Lutheran church commemorates her together with Joanna and Salome on August 3,&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt; and the Roman Catholic church on May 25.

&lt;!-- ''The other Mary'' and ''The Other Mary'' redirect here. Please change the redirects if this anchor name changes --&gt;
{{anchor|The other Mary}}

===''The other Mary''===
{{Redirect2|The Other Mary|The other Mary|the novel by Bruce Marshall|The Other Mary (novel)}}
Two passages in Matthew refer to ''Mary Magdalene and '''the other Mary''''':
* {{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:61}}, which is a [[parallel passage]] to {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:47}} which reads instead ''Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses''.
* {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:1–4}}, which is a parallel passage to {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1–5}} which reads instead ''Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James''.

It is generally agreed that these four passages refer to the same person accompanying Mary Magdalene, and also that she is the same person named in {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:40}} as ''Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses'', also in the company of Mary Magdalene on that occasion.

Many authorities identify ''the other Mary'' as ''[[#Mary, mother of James the younger|Mary mother of James the younger]]''.

==Mary, mother of John Mark==
{{main|Mary, mother of John Mark}}

''Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark'' is named only once, in {{bibleref2|Acts|12:12}}, which is the first undisputed reference to [[John Mark]], who is then twice named later in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|12:25, 15:37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This John Mark is identified by some with [[Mark the cousin of Barnabas]], and also by some with [[Mark the Evangelist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=William L.|author-link=William L. Lane|title=The Gospel According to Mark|year=1974|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably by the [[Coptic Church]].

It has been conjectured that she is the same person as [[#Mary of Rome|Mary of Rome]] but there is no general support for this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09749b.htm retrieved April 5, 2013 ''It is only a conjecture that she is the same as the mother of John Mark.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary Salome===
{{main|Mary Salome}}

The name ''Salome'' appears twice in the New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=Salome&amp;searchtype=phrase&amp;version1=47&amp;language1=en&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73&amp;resultspp=500&amp;displayas=long&amp;sort=bookorder Bible Gateway search results for ''Salome'']&lt;/ref&gt; both times in Mark, and both times in a list of three women, the others being Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James (the younger).

Roman Catholic tradition identifies this person as Mary mother of John Mark and also as mother of [[James, son of Zebedee]], and names her ''Mary Salome'' &lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Mary Salome and Zebedee]]''&lt;/ref&gt; making her the third of the [[three Marys]] at the resurrection. She also therefore becomes the person referred as ''the mother of the sons of Zebedee'' (James and Joseph).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|20:20}} {{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her feast day is October 22.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4962 retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary of Rome==
{{main|Mary of Rome}}
In [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:6|ESV|16:6}}, Paul asks the recipients to ''Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.'' Nothing else is known about this person.&lt;ref name=WWB255&gt;''Who was Who in the Bible'', {{ISBN|0-7852-4240-6}}, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oorvazi Irani''' is an independent filmmaker based in Mumbai, India. Apart from being a filmmaker, she is a film educationalist, an acting coach, and a film critic and the Director of her home production company SBI Impresario Pvt. Ltd incorporated by her father Sorab Irani in 1975. Currently, she has directed [[The Path of Zarathustra]] a movie on Parsis. She has also directed two short films “The K File” and “Mamaiji” (Grandmother).  As a film educationalist she heads the subject of film at the SVKM J.V. Parekh International school in Mumbai, India besides teaching as a freelance educationalist at various prestigious film institutions on special invitation. She has also recently introduced the Michael Chekhov Acting technique to India with her DVD which she has researched, presented, directed and co-produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asha Centre Profile|url=http://www.ashacentre.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=689:oorvazi-irani&amp;Itemid=3|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Oorvazi was born in a cultured Parsi family in January, 1977. Her family background has had an important contribution in shaping her artistic sensibility.

Her father Sorab Irani is a filmmaker himself. He had started his career as General Manager of Himalaya Films, a production &amp; distribution company of Shree [[Chetan Anand (director)|Chetan Anand]], [[Dev Anand]] and [[Vijay Anand (Hindi film maker)|Vijay Anand]] and later got associated with European television and Channel Four. He was also trained in Indian classical music. Oorvazi’s association with her father since childhood has influenced her in developing her passion and understanding of cinema as well as music.

As a child, her close association with her aunt Dr. Mrs. Khurshid B. Shroff, who is a Bharata Natayam Dancer &amp; Teacher and a PHD in dance, inducted Oorvazi into the sphere of dance, without any formal training of it.

She did her graduation in Arts from the Jai Hind College, Mumbai. After that she pursued the FTII &amp; NFAI Film Appreciation Course designed for teacher’s training as well as the Online Teacher’s IB Film Course. During her term in college she started assisting her father on a travelogue series “Ramayana a Journey” that he was producing for Channel Four Television, London. The concept behind this film was following the route that Lord Rama had taken during his journey from Ayodhya to Lanka. Oorvazi became the head of research for this project and also assisted in direction. It took 3 years in making and was completed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzfTpfqfHrg|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Oorvazi started her career as the Director of her home media production company SBI Impresario Pvt. Ltd. incorporated by her father in 1975. She has been involved with international critically acclaimed film projects with her company in the area of research, production and direction.

Apart from running the home production company, Oorvazi also took up the role of a film educationalist. She currently heads the subject of film at the ‘SVKM J.V.Parekh  International School’. Besides this, she also has conducted Film Appreciation modules at various prestigious institutions including The [[Mumbai University]] Post Graduate One Year Diploma Course for Film and Television, The Digital Academy Film School Mumbai, Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Educationalist Profile|url=http://www.oorvazichekhovindia.com/profile.html|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigating the 26/11 drama|url=http://www.mid-day.com/lifestyle/2012/may/270512-Investigating-the-26-11-drama-online.htm|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Creative Excellence – ICE, the Education division of Balaji Telefilm and ‘Understanding Cinema’ module of the BMM syllabus at The Ghanshyamdas Saraf Girls College, Mumbai (Affiliated to the University of Mumbai). She has been invited to conduct the filmmaking workshop at Birla Institute of Science and Technology, Goa Campus for their Waves winter 2009 cultural festival.

=== ''Michael Chekhov Acting Technique'' ===

Oorvazi’s association with acting and actors as an artist made her curious to understand the process of acting. She started researching on this topic extensively and came across the revolutionary Michael Chekhov Acting Technique. The Michael Chekhov technique was developed by Mikhail Aleksandrovich Chekhov aka [[Michael Chekhov]], who as a student of [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] furthered his technique of method acting and molded it into an exercise to get to the core of a character. Chekhov trained Hollywood actors like [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Mala Powers]], [[Yul Brynner]]. Apart from his direct students, other actors have also benefited from his technique described in his book, ‘On the Technique of Acting’. Significant among them are actors like [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], who have cited this book as a major influence on their acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unmasking the Other Chekhov|url=http://www.timescrest.com/culture/unmasking-the-other-chekhov-7809|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Times Crest}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oorvazi was the pioneer in bringing this Michael Chekhov acting technique to India. As an acting coach, she taught this technique to her students. She has recently come out with a DVD titled ‘The Michael Chekhov Acting Technique’. The DVD is a step by step Guide to understanding the Basic Tools and Fundamental Concepts of the Michael Chekhov Acting technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Chekhov Acting Technique DVD|url=http://www.indianentertainment.info/2011/10/10/oorvazi-irani.html|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emoting With Ease|journal=Life Positive|url=http://www.lifepositive.com/Mind/News/Emoting_with_ease112011.asp|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The President of the Chekhov Association, USA, [[Joanna Merlin]], endorsed the DVD by stating:

:''"In Oorvazi Irani's sensitive presentation of the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique, she guides the actor through Chekhov's psycho-physical process with, grace, elegance, intelligence and joyfulness. Oorvazi is an articulate actor and teacher, profoundly moved and motivated by Chekhov's lifelong study of the art of acting. In this formidable and artistic presentation, Oorvazi provides a progressive journey for actors, inspiring them to explore their untapped imaginative resources, deepening and enriching their creative individuality."''

Filmmaker [[Ashutosh Gowarikar]], after watching this DVD, gave the following feedback to Oorvazi:&lt;br /&gt;
:''"It is superbly done. There is a lot of intrigue in this method, the way you have described it. :) I feel you might need some fierce marketing for its awareness to spread. Very well packaged tutorial on the Chekhov technique ! Wish you all the success with it !"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chekhov DVD Testimonials|url=http://www.oorvazichekhovindia.com/testimonials.html|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Oorvazi has conducted a special seminar cum workshop for the Russian Culture Centre on the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Centre Workshop Invitation|url=http://oorvazifilmeducation.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mc-invite_final.jpg|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where her DVD was also screened. She has also conducted special acting modules of the Acting technique on special invitation for reputed organizations like Thespo14 @ Prithvi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop at Thespo|url=http://qtpthescript.blogspot.in/p/thespo-at-prithvi.html|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is the most popular youth theater group based in Mumbai), Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute(which is the acting school for big stars like Hritik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra etc.), and a special module for non-actors at the popular indie film community platform  www.madaboutmovies.com . This is besides the regular courses that she conducts as a freelance independent acting coach for the technique, for amateurs and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wanna Act Like Johnny Depp?|journal=BollywoodLife|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/wanna-act-like-johnny-depp/|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completion of her father’s project, ‘Ramayana a Journey’, she also got involved in another one of his projects, a documentary called ‘Lord Ganesha – The Elephant Head God’. This film traced the origins of Lord Ganesha, the mythological stories associated with him as well as captured the essence of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Mumbai. Oorvazi acted as an associate director in this project.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Oorvazi has also been a freelance photo editor in 2004 for Life Positive Magazine and in 2006 the CEO for the south Mumbai branch of the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting institute.

As the Director of SBI Impresario she has been the project consultant for the art show ‘Unity in Diversity: Artists from Auroville’ at the Cymroza Art Gallery in September 2007.

=== ''Mamaiji'' ===

&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011 she researched, scripted and directed  her first independent short  film “Mamaiji” (Parsis in India refer to their maternal grandmother as Mamaiji). The film is as much about an archetypical grandmother as it is about the personal story of Moti (Morvarid) Nadirshah Roowalla, the director’s Mamaiji(grandmother), who was born in Iran in 1927, and now lives in India. The film is a portrait of a grandmother sans a realistic treatment, rather the film’s time and space is suspended in an artistic realm beyond the real and the unreal and therein lies it’s charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Extraordinary in The Ordinary|url=http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/2013/05/mamaiji-grandmother-short-film-by.html#.UlFvjyf9qdk|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film has had private screenings in some prestigious film institutes like FTII and NFAI in Poona as well as certain private viewings. It was received warmly by viewers and film enthusiasts. Veteran filmmaker [[Govind Nihalani]], after watching this film, remarked:

:''"I loved her film on her grandmother. Very beautiful and poetic. She seems to be headed in the right direction"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Govind Nihalani's feedback|url=http://oorvazifilmeducation.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/govind-nihalanis-response-to-my-recent-short-films/|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The K File'' ===

In early 2012, celebrated author and screenwriter [[Farrukh Dhondy]] came to Sorab Irani, his close friend with a very interesting script.It was a quasi-realistic take on the judgement of [[Ajmal Kasab]], the lone surviving terrorist of 26/11 Mumbai attacks and presented an alternate ending to Kasab’s fate(It may be recalled that the decision of Kasab’s hanging was pending at that time). Sorab immediately recognized the potency of the script and wanted his daughter Oorvazi to direct the film. On receiving the script, Oorvazi’s response was (In her own words):

:''"Initially I was a bit hesitant about approaching such a political and socially charged subject, since I am not a very politically inclined person myself. However, on reading the script multiple times, the genius of the writer, the depth of what this film could say, struck me. The great thing about this story was that it was not limited to the 26/11 attacks or the Kasab dilemma. This aspect excited me as an artist, because it gave me a scope to explore greater questions, reflections on terrorism and the contemporary times. That is something that really made me want to make the film."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The K FIle Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn7wXJSu4Ek|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That was how ‘The K File’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigating the 26/11 drama|url=http://www.mid-day.com/lifestyle/2012/may/270512-Investigating-the-26-11-drama-online.htm|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;  happened. The 10 min short film dealing with the Kasab paradox created quite a stir. It was released on YouTube in May, 2012 and became an instant success. ‘The K File’ has been viewed online by millions of people. Priyanka Dasgupta of ‘The Times of India’ came out with an article titled, ‘Kasab is now Asab’, in which she praised the film and declared that it was now ''‘A talking point in cyberland’''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kasab is now Asab|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-06/news-interviews/32057128_1_mutton-biryani-ajmal-kasab-short-film|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been an integral part of research and writing for the international textbook on Indian cinema “From Aan to Lagaan and Beyond” published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oorvazifilmeducation.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/from-aan-to-lagaan-an-exclsuive-interview-with-the-author-of-the-book-moti-gokulsingh-by-oorvazi-irani/|accessdate=4 November 2013|title=From Aan to Lagaan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Winslow Milton''' (born 1930) is a [[colorblind]] American [[artist]] who was diagnosed with [[deuteranopia]] after hearing a comment about the pink in his landscapes.&lt;ref name=PWM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/16/364092778/for-one-artist-colorblindness-opened-up-a-world-of-black-and-white|title=For One Artist, Colorblindness Opened Up A World Of Black And White|author=Angela Evancie|date=16 November 2014|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A creator of [[black and white]] [[etching]]s and [[engraving]]s that often display an extraordinary degree of photo-realistic detail placed in the service of a truly visionary aesthetic, his themes include [[architecture]], [[history]], [[mythology|myth]], and [[memory]], their intersections and hidden juxtapositions. His pieces often compress long periods of time into a single moment, as in "Family Reunion" and "The Train from Munich."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Peter Milton received his MFA from [[Yale University]] in 1961. His work has been exhibited in most major museums in the U.S. and Europe, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[British Museum]] and the [[Tate Gallery]], London, and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris.  Two major book collections of his work have been published: ''The Primacy of Touch: The Drawings of Peter Milton'' (New York: Hudson Hills Press, 1993) and ''Peter Milton: Complete Prints 1960-1996'' (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1996).

'''Robert Bateman''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OBC|RCA}} (born 24 May 1930) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Natural history|naturalist]] and [[painting|painter]], born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.robertbateman.ca/biography.html| publisher=Robert Bateman Website| title=Biography| accessdate=2014-12-23| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Robert was always interested in art, but never intended to make a living from it. He was fascinated by the natural world in his childhood; he recorded the [[Visual perception|sight]]ings of all of the birds in the area of his house in Toronto and did small paintings with birds in their habitats.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bateman.html| publisher=[[CBC News]]| title=The Life And Times of Robert Bateman| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found inspiration from the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]; later, he became interested in making abstract paintings of nature.&lt;ref name="pengal"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pengal.com/artists/robert-bateman-originals| publisher=Peninsula Gallery| title=Robert Bateman, (Originals)| accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the mid-1960s that he changed to his present style, [[realism (visual arts)|realism]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; In 1954, he graduated with a degree in [[geography]] from [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College in the University of Toronto]]. Afterwards, he attended [[Ontario College of Education]]. Starting in 1957, Bateman travelled around the world for 14 months in a Land Rover with his friend Bristol Foster. As they made their way through Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Australia, Bateman painted and sketched what he saw.

Bateman became a high school teacher of art and geography, and continued focusing his life on art and nature.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His work started to receive major recognition in the 1970s and 1980s. Robert Bateman's show in 1987, at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC, drew the largest crowd for a living [[artist]].&lt;ref name="Pegasus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusgallery.ca/artist/Robert_bateman.html|title=Algonquin Park Untitled|publisher=Pegasus Gallery|accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Bateman's paintings are acrylic on various media, and have been shown in major one-man exhibitions around the world.&lt;ref name="environmental"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertbateman.ca/art/environmental/environmental1.html|title=Environmental Paintings|publisher=Robert Bateman Website|accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateman also has numerous books devoted to his works.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; After two decades as a high school teacher, he became a full-time artist in 1976. A year later Mill Pond Press started making signed, limited edition prints of some of his paintings; over the years, these prints resulted in millions of dollars being raised for environmental causes.

In 1999, the Audubon Society of Canada declared Bateman one of the top 100 environmental proponents of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Fitz&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates' |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |date=30 March 2007| page=807| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitzhenry-Whiteside-Canadian-Facts-Dates/dp/1554550092/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419371354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fitzhenry+and+whiteside+book+of+canadian+facts#reader_1554550092| isbn=978-1554550098| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bateman Secondary School]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], [[Robert Bateman High School]] in [[Burlington, Ontario]], and Robert Bateman Public School, [[Ottawa, Ontario]] are named for him. He is an Honorary Director of the [[North American Native Plant Society]], and has received thirteen honorary doctorates from institutions like the University of Victoria, University of Toronto, Royal Roads University, and McGill University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanps.org/index.php/contact-us/nanps-board|title=The 2014-2015 NANPS Board of Directors|publisher=North American Native Plant Society|accessdate=2014-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001042/http://www.nanps.org/index.php/contact-us/nanps-board|archivedate=2013-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent home for his works can be found in the Inner Harbour of Victoria, BC. [http://batemancentre.org The Robert Bateman Centre] houses the definitive collection of his works, and also includes a dynamic program of public events. It supports the Bateman Foundation, a not for profit organization to encourage dialogue about humanity's relationship to the natural world.

=== Family Life ===

Robert Bateman married Suzanne Bowerman in 1960. They had three children: Alan, Sarah, and John.

In 1975, Bateman married Birgit Freybe Bateman. Their two children are Christopher and Robert.

In the early 1980s Bateman and Birgit moved to Salt Spring Island. The couple purchased a home located on Reginald Hill Road, looking out on Fulford Harbour, that was designed by [[Hank Schubart]] and originally built for actress [[Eileen Brennan]]. In the early 2000s the Batemans moved from the Reginald Hill house to a house on a lake in Salt Spring designed by their son in law, Robert Barnard.

'''Saint George''' ({{lang-gr|Γεώργιος}}, ''Geṓrgios''; {{lang-la|Georgius}}; d. 23 April 303&lt;ref name=AASS&gt;
''[[Acta Sanctorum]] Aprilis t. III'' (vol. 12), [https://archive.org/stream/actasanctorum12unse#page/n147/mode/2up 101]&amp;ndash;165; [[Martyrology of Usuard]] (9th century).&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]] of Greek origin and a member of the [[Praetorian Guard]] for [[Roman emperor]] [[Diocletian]], who was sentenced to death for refusing to recant his Christian faith. He became one of the most [[Saint George in devotions, traditions and prayers|venerated]] [[saint]]s and [[Great martyr|megalo-martyrs]] in [[Christianity]], and was especially venerated by the [[Crusader States|Crusaders]].

In [[hagiography]], as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]] and one of the most prominent [[military saint]]s, he is immortalised in the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. His memorial, [[Saint George's Day]], is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. (See under "Feast days" below for the use of the Julian calendar by the Eastern Orthodox Church.)

[[England]], Georgia and several other nation states, cities, universities, professions and organisations all claim Saint George as their [[patronages of Saint George|patron]].

==Legend==
[[File:Georgian fresco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|St. George slays the dragon. Georgian Fresco]]
The core of the legend is that George was a Roman officer of Greek descent from [[Cappadocia]] or [[Syria Palaestina]] who was martyred in one of the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|pre-Constantinian persecutions]]. Beyond this, early sources give conflicting information.
There are two main versions of the legend, a Greek and a Latin version, which can both be traced to the 5th or 6th century.
The saint's veneration dates to the 5th century with some certainty, and possibly still to the 4th. The addition of the [[Saint George and the Dragon|dragon legend]] dates to the 11th century.

The earliest text preserving fragments of George's narrative is in a Greek hagiography identified by [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] of the scholarly [[Bollandist]]s to be a [[palimpsest]] of the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/actasanctorum12unse#page/n148/mode/1up Acta Sanctorum], Volume 12, as republished in 1866&lt;/ref&gt; 
An earlier work by [[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church history]]'', written in the 4th century, contributed to the legend but did not name George or provide significant detail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church History (Eusebius)]], book 8, chapter 5; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0640%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1 Greek text here], and [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0265-0339,_Eusebius_Caesariensis,_Historia_ecclesiastica_%5BSchaff%5D,_EN.pdf English text here]. Eusebius's full text as follows:{{quote|Immediately on the publication of the [[20,000 Martyrs of Nicomedia|decree against the churches in Nicomedia]], a certain man, not obscure but very highly honored with distinguished temporal dignities, moved with zeal toward God, and incited with ardent faith, seized the edict as it was posted openly and publicly, and tore it to pieces as a profane and impious thing; and this was done while two of the sovereigns were in the same city,—the oldest of all, and the one who held the fourth place in the government after him. But this man, first in that place, after distinguishing himself in such a manner suffered those things which were likely to follow such daring, and kept his spirit cheerful and undisturbed till death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The work of the Bollandists [[Daniel Papebroch]], [[Jean Bolland]], and [[Godfrey Henschen]] in the 17th century was one of the first pieces of scholarly research to establish the saint's historicity via their publications in ''[[Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Christopher | last = Walter | year = 2003 | title = The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 1-84014-694-X | page = 110}}.
Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca 271, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gelasius I]] stated that George was among those saints "whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose actions are known only to God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|page=737|title=George, Saint|volume=11|quote=In the canon of Pope Gelasius (494) George is mentioned in a list of those 'whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A critical edition of a Syriac ''Acta'' of Saint George,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} accompanied by an annotated English translation, was published by E.W. Brooks (1863–1955) in 1925.

===Greek version===
The compiler of this ''Acta Sancti Georgii'', according to Hippolyte Delehaye, "confused the martyr with his namesake, the celebrated [[George of Cappadocia]], the [[Arianism|Arian]] intruder into the see of Alexandria and enemy of St. [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]]".

In the Greek tradition, George was born in to Greek Christian parents, in [[Cappadocia]].
His father died for the faith when he was fourteen, and his mother returned with George to her homeland of Syria Palaestina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guiley|first1=Rosemary|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABkgU0GOBbcC&amp;pg=PA129 |quote=George was an historical figure. According to an account by Metaphrastes, he was born in Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) to a noble Christian family; his mother was Palestinian.|isbn=9781438130262|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few years later, George's mother died. George travels to the capital [[Nicomedia]]  and joins the Roman army.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = A | last = Heylin | year = 1862 | title = The Journal of Sacred Literature and Biblical Record | volume = 1 | page = 244}}. {{citation | first = John H | last = Darch | year = 2006 | title = Saints on Earth | publisher = Church House Press | isbn = 978-0-7151-4036-9 | page = 56}}. {{citation | first = Christopher | last = Walter | year = 2003 | title = The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 1-84014-694-X | page = 112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
George is persecuted by one ''Dadianus''. 
In later versions of the Greek legend, this name is rationalized to [[Diocletian]], and George's martyrdom is placed in the [[Diocletian persecution]] of AD 303. The setting in Nicodemia is also secondary, and inconsistent with the earliest cultus of the saint being located in [[Lydda|Diospolis]].&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt;

George was executed by [[decapitation]] before Nicomedia's city wall, on 23 April 303. A witness of his suffering convinced Empress [[Alexandra of Rome]] to become a Christian as well, so she joined George in martyrdom. His body was returned to Lydda for burial, where Christians soon came to honour him as a martyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Fred | last = Hackwood | year = 2003 | title = Christ Lore the Legends, Traditions, Myths | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | isbn = 0-7661-3656-6 | page = 255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Butler"&gt;{{citation | first = Alban | last = Butler | year = 2008 | title = Lives of the Saints | isbn = 1-4375-1281-X}}.{{rp |166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin version===
[[File:Saint George in the Acta Sanctorum.png|thumb|Saint George in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', as collected in late 1600s and early 1700s. The Latin title ''De S Georgio Megalo-Martyre; Lyddae seu Diospoli in Palaestina''" translates as "''St. George Great-Martyr; [from] [[Lod|Lydda]] or Diospolis, in Palestine''.]]

The Latin ''Acta Sancti Georgii'' (6th century) follows the general course of the Greek legend, but Diocletian here becomes ''Dacian, Emperor of the Persians''. George lives and dies in [[Malatya|Melitene]] in Cappadocia.
His martyrdom is greatly extended, to more than twenty separate tortures over the course of seven years.
Over the course of his martyrdom, 40,900 pagans are converted to Christianity, including the empress Alexandra. When George finally dies, the wicked Dacian is carried away in a whirlwind of fire.
In later Latin versions, the persecutor is the Roman emperor [[Decius]], or a Roman judge named Dacian serving under Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Collins, ''St George and the Dragons: The Making of English Identity'' (2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z95VDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historicity debate===
There is little information on the early life of Saint George. [[Herbert Thurston]] in ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states that based upon an ancient cultus, narratives of the early pilgrims, and the early dedications of churches to Saint George, going back to the fourth century, "there seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George", although no faith can be placed in either the details of his history or his alleged exploits.&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt;
According to Donald Attwater, "No historical particulars of his life have survived, ... The widespread veneration for St George as a soldier saint from early times had its centre in Palestine at Diospolis, now Lydda. St George was apparently martyred there, at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century; that is all that can be reasonably surmised about him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwater|first1=Donald|title=Dictionary of Saints|year=1995|origyear=1965|location=London|publisher=Penguin Reference|edition=Third|page=152|quote=His best-known story, popularized in the later middle ages by the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', tells that he was a knight from Cappadocia, who rescued a maiden princess from a dragon at Silene in Libya, leading to the Christianity  of much of the kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Thurston]] in the saint's entry in the early 20th century ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' takes the position that there are no grounds for doubting the historical existence of Saint George, "but no faith can be placed in the attempts that have been made to fill up any of the details of his history."&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{Cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston |wstitle=St. George}} "There seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George, even though he is not commemorated in the Syrian, or in the primitive Hieronymian Martyrologium, but no faith can be placed in the attempts that have been made to fill up any of the details of his history. For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis. Still less is St. George to be considered, as suggested by Gibbon, Vetter, and others, a legendary double of the disreputable bishop, George of Cappadocia, the Arian opponent of St. Athanasius."&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been established that Saint George the Martyr and the Arian Bishop George of Alexandria&lt;!--George I of Alexandria was three centuries later and was not martyred. Confusion looks implausible, this looks like someone else--&gt; were not identical; furthermore that Bishop George was slain by Gentile Greeks for exacting onerous taxes, especially inheritance taxes.

===Saint George and the dragon===
[[File:St George and the Dragon Verona ms 1853 26r.jpg|thumb|Miniature from a 13th-century ''Passio Sancti Georgii'' ([[Verona]])]]
{{Main|Saint George and the Dragon}}

The legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] is first recorded in the 11th century, in a Georgian source.
It reaches Europe in the 12th century. In [[Golden Legend|The Golden Legend]], by 13th-century Archbishop of [[Genoa]]  [[Jacobus da Varagine]], George's death is at the hands of [[Dacian (prefect)|Dacian]], and about the year 287.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Caxton]]'s ''Golden Legend'' (1483), modernised translation by [[Frederick Startridge Ellis]] (1900); [http://catholicsaints.info/golden-legend-life-of-saint-george/  catholicsaints.info].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Martorell - Sant Jordi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Saint George Killing the Dragon,'' 1434/35, by [[Bernat Martorell]]]]

The ''Golden Legend'' offered a historicised narration of George's encounter with a [[dragon]].
This account was very influential, and it remains the most familiar version in English owing to [[William Caxton]]'s 15th-century translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Jacobus | last = De Voragine | year = 1995 | title = The Golden Legend | publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 978-0-691-00153-1 | page = 238}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval romances, the lance with which Saint George slew the dragon was called Ascalon after the [[Levant]]ine city of [[Ashkelon]], today in Israel. The name ''Ascalon'' was used by [[Winston Churchill]] for his personal aircraft during [[World War II]], according to records at [[Bletchley Park]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In [[Sweden]], the princess rescued by Saint George is held to represent the kingdom of Sweden, while the dragon represents an invading army.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Several sculptures of Saint George battling the dragon can be found in [[Stockholm]], the earliest inside [[Storkyrkan]] ("The Great Church") in the Old Town. Iconography of the horseman with spear overcoming evil was widespread throughout the Christian period.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, "Horus et Saint Georges, d'après un bas-relief inédit du Louvre". Revue archéologique, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim legends===

George ({{lang-ar|جرجس}}, ''Jiriyas'' or ''Girgus'') is included in some Muslim texts as a prophetic figure. The Islamic sources state that he lived among a group of believers who were in direct contact with last [[apostles of Jesus]]. He is described as a rich merchant who opposed erection of [[Apollo]]'s statue by [[Mosul]]'s king Dadan. After confronting the king, George was tortured many times to no effect, was imprisoned and was aided by the angels. Eventually, he exposed that the idols were possessed by Satan, but was martyred when the city was destroyed by God in a rain of fire.&lt;ref name=Littlefield&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNAWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA313&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE1rOukfnXAhUKro8KHf4nA94Q6AEIMDAC|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|author=Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M. Wheeler|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim scholars had tried to find a historical connection of the saint due to his popularity.&lt;ref name=Numen&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Numen (journal)|Numen]]|title="Georgic" Cults and Saints of the Levant|author=H. S. Haddad|publisher=Brill|year=1968|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim legend, he was martyred under the rule of [[Diocletian]] and was killed three times but resurrected every time. The legend is more developed in the Persian version of [[al-Tabari]] wherein he resurrects the dead, makes trees sprout and pillars bear flowers. After one of his deaths, the world is covered by darkness and is lifted only when he is resurrected. He is able to convert the queen but she is put to death. He then prays to God to allow him to die which is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=Second|volume= I, Part 2|editor1=P. Bearman|editor1-link=Peri Bearman|editor2=Th. Bianquis|editor3=C.E. Bosworth|editor3-link=C.E. Bosworth|editor4=E. van Donzel|editor5=W. P. Heinrichs|editor5-link=Wolfhart Heinrichs|publisher=Brill|author=[[Bernard Carra de Vaux]]|page=1047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Tha`labi]] states that he was from Palestine and lived in the times of some [[Disciples of Jesus in Islam|disciples of Jesus]]. He was killed many times by the king of Mosul, and resurrected each time. When he tried to starve him, he touched a piece of dry wood brought by a woman and turned it green, with varieties of fruits and vegetables growing from it. After his fourth death, the city was burnt along with him. [[Ibn al-Athir]]'s account of one of his deaths is parallel to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], stating, "When he died, God sent stormy winds and thunder and lightning and dark clouds, so that darkness fell between heaven and earth, and people were in great wonderment..." The account adds that the darkness was lifted after his resurrection.&lt;ref name=Numen/&gt;

===History===
A [[titular church]] built in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306–37) was consecrated to "a man of the highest distinction", according to the church history of [[Eusebius]]; the name of the ''titulus'' "patron" was not disclosed, but later he was asserted{{by whom|date=June 2017}} to have been George.

The veneration of George spread from [[Syria Palaestina]] through Lebanon to the rest of the [[Byzantine Empire]] – though the martyr is not mentioned in the Syriac ''[[horologion|Breviarium]]''&lt;ref name = "Butler" /&gt; – and the region [[Georgia (country)|east of the Black Sea]]. 
By the 5th century, the veneration of Saint George had reached the Christian [[Western Roman Empire]], as well: in 494, George was canonized as a [[saint]] by [[Pope Gelasius I]], among those "whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to [God]."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Paolo Veronese 023.jpg|thumb|left|The martyrdom of Saint George, by [[Paolo Veronese]], 1564]]
The early cult of the saint was localized in [[Lod|Diospolis (Lydda)]], in Palestine.
The first description of Lydda as a pilgrimage site where  George's relics were venerated is ''[[De Situ Terrae Sanctae]]'' by
the archdeacon Theodosius, written between 518 and 530.
By the end of the 6th century, the center of his veneration appears to have shifted to [[Cappadocia]].
The ''Life'' of [[Saint Theodore of Sykeon]], written in the 7th century, mentions the veneration of the relics of the saint in Cappadocia.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, "The Origins of the Cult of Saint George", ''Revue des études byzantines'' 53 (1995), 295&amp;ndash;326 (p. 296) ([https://www.persee.fr/doc/rebyz_0766-5598_1995_num_53_1_1911 persee.fr])&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[early Muslim conquests]] of the mostly Christian and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Middle East, a basilica in Lydda dedicated to Saint George existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Denys | last = Pringle | title = The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-521-39037-0 | page = 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church was destroyed by Muslims in 1010, but was later rebuilt and dedicated to Saint George by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. In 1191 and during the conflict known as the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–92), the church was again destroyed by the forces of [[Saladin]], Sultan of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (reigned 1171–93).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} A new church was erected in 1872 and is still standing.

In England, he was mentioned among the martyrs by the 8th-century monk [[Bede]]. The ''[[Georgslied]]'' is an adaptation of his legend in [[Old High German]], composed in the late 9th century. The earliest dedication to the saint in England is a church at [[Fordington, Dorset]] that is mentioned in the will of [[Alfred the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Riches, ''St. George: Hero, Martyr and Myth'' (Sutton, 2000), {{ISBN|0750924527}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint George did not rise to the position of "patron saint" of England, however, until the 14th century, and he was still obscured by [[Edward the Confessor]], the traditional patron saint of England, until in 1552 during the reign of [[Edward VI]] all saints' banners other than George's were abolished in the [[English Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;McClendon 1999:p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cornelis Schut - The beheading of Saint George.jpg|thumb|The martyrdom of Saint George, by [[Cornelis Schut]], 1634]]

Belief in an apparition of St. George heartened the [[Franks]] at the [[Battle of Antioch (1098)|Battle of Antioch]] in 1098,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Runciman|first1=Steven|title=A History of the Crusades I: The First Crusade|date=1951–52|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=978-0-141-98550-3|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made a similar appearance the following year at Jerusalem. The chivalric military [[Order of Sant Jordi d'Alfama]] was established by king [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter the Catholic]] from the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1201, [[Republic of Genoa]], [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (1326), and by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13350a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1913, ''s.v.'' "Orders of St. George"] omits Genoa and Hungary: see David Scott Fox, ''Saint George: The Saint with Three Faces'' (1983:59–63, 98–123), noted by McClellan 999:6 note 13. Additional Orders of St. George were founded in the eighteenth century (''Catholic Encyclopedia'').&lt;/ref&gt; and in England the 1222 [[Synod of Oxford]] declared [[Saint George's Day]] a feast day in the kingdom of England.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} [[Edward III of England]] put his [[Order of the Garter]] under the banner of St. George, probably in 1348. The chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] observed the English invoking Saint George as a battle cry on several occasions during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In his rise as a national saint, George was aided by the very fact that the saint had no legendary connection with England, and no specifically localized shrine, as that of [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury: "Consequently, numerous shrines were established during the late fifteenth century," Muriel C. McClendon has written,&lt;ref&gt;McClendon 1999:10.&lt;/ref&gt; "and his did not become closely identified with a particular occupation or with the cure of a specific malady."

The establishment of George as a popular and protective saint&lt;ref&gt;[[Desiderius Erasmus]], in ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'' (1509, printed 1511) remarked "The Christians have now their gigantic St. George, as well as the pagans had their [[Hercules]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in the West that had captured the medieval imagination was codified by the official elevation of his feast to a ''festum duplex''&lt;ref&gt;Only the most essential work might be done on a ''festum duplex''&lt;/ref&gt; at a church council in 1416, on the date that had become associated with his martyrdom, 23 April. Wide latitude existed from community to community in celebration of the day across late medieval and early modern England,&lt;ref&gt;Muriel C. McClendon, "A Moveable Feast: Saint George's Day Celebrations and Religious Change in Early Modern England" ''The Journal of British Studies'' '''38'''.1 (January 1999:1–27).&lt;/ref&gt; and no uniform "national" celebration elsewhere, a token of the popular and vernacular nature of George's ''cultus'' and its local horizons, supported by a local guild or confraternity under George's protection, or the dedication of a local church. When the [[English Reformation]] severely curtailed the saints' days in the calendar, Saint George's Day was among the holidays that continued to be observed.

===Veneration in the Levant===
George is renowned throughout the [[Middle East]], as both saint and prophet. His veneration by Christians and Muslims lies in his composite personality combining several Biblical, Quranic and other ancient mythical heroes.&lt;ref name="Hovannisian"/&gt;
[[File:StGeorgeDragged.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Saint George dragged through the streets (detail), by [[Bernat Martorell]], 15th century]]

[[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], reviewing the literature in 1999, tells us that [[J. E. Hanauer]] in his 1907 book ''Folklore of the Holy Land: Muslim, Christian and Jewish'' "mentioned a shrine in the village of Beit Jala, beside Bethlehem, which at the time was frequented by Christians who regarded it as the birthplace of St. George and by some Jews who regarded it as the burial place of the Prophet Elias. According to Hanauer, in his day the monastery was "a sort of madhouse. Deranged persons of all the three faiths are taken thither and chained in the court of the chapel, where they are kept for forty days on bread and water, the Eastern Orthodox priest at the head of the establishment now and then reading the Gospel over them, or administering a whipping as the case demands.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/asia/flhl/flhl12.htm|title= Folk-lore of the Holy Land, Moslem, Christian and Jewish | first = JE | last = Hanauer | year = 1907 |accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, according to [[Tawfiq Canaan|Taufiq Canaan]]'s ''Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palestine'', nothing seemed to have changed, and all three communities were still visiting the shrine and praying together."&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"&gt;{{cite book|title= From the Holy Mountain: a journey among the Christians of the Middle East |author=William Dalrymple|publisher= Owl Books | date = March 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalrymple himself visited the place in 1995. "I asked around in the [[Christian Quarter]] in [[Jerusalem]], and discovered that the place was very much alive. With all the greatest shrines in the Christian world to choose from, it seemed that when the local Arab Christians had a problem – an illness, or something more complicated: a husband detained in an Israeli prison camp, for example – they preferred to seek the intercession of Saint George in his grubby little shrine at Beit Jala rather than praying at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem or the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]."&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"/&gt; He asked the priest at the shrine "Do you get many Muslims coming here?" The priest replied, "We get hundreds! Almost as many as the Christian pilgrims. Often, when I come in here, I find Muslims all over the floor, in the aisles, up and down."&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="Georgic" Cults and Saints of the Levant |author=H. S. Haddad|jstor=3269569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' quotes G.A. Smith in his ''Historic Geography of the Holy Land'' p.&amp;nbsp;164 saying "The Mahommedans who usually identify St. George with the prophet Elijah, at Lydda confound his legend with one about Christ himself. Their name for Antichrist is Dajjal, and they have a tradition that Jesus will slay Antichrist by the gate of Lydda. The notion sprang from an ancient [[bas-relief]] of George and the Dragon on the Lydda church. But Dajjal may be derived, by a very common confusion between n and l, from Dagon, whose name two neighbouring villages bear to this day, while one of the gates of Lydda used to be called the Gate of Dagon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|page=737|title=George, Saint|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veneration in the Muslim world===
Saint George is described as a prophetic figure in Islamic sources.&lt;ref name=Littlefield/&gt; George is venerated by some Christians and Muslims because of his composite personality combining several Biblical, Quranic and other ancient mythical heroes. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In some of he is identified with [[Elijah]] or Mar Elis, George or Mar Jirjus and in others as [[al-Khidr]]. The last epithet meaning the "green prophet", is common to both Christian and Muslim folk piety. Samuel Curtiss who visited an artificial cave dedicated to him where he is identified with Elijah, reports that childless Muslim women used to visit the shrine to pray for children. Per tradition, he was brought to his place of martyrdom in chains, thus priests of Church of St. George chain the sick especially the mentally ill to a chain for overnight or longer for healing. This is sought after by both Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name="Hovannisian"&gt;''Religion and Culture in Medieval Islam'' by Richard G. Hovannisian, Georges Sabagh 2000 {{ISBN|0-521-62350-2}}, Cambridge University Press pages 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Elizabeth Anne Finn]]'s  ''Home in the Holy land'' (1866):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages =46–7|title=Home in the Holyland|author= Elizabeth Anne Finn|publisher=James Nisbet and Co | location = London|year= 1866}}  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=h8kBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA46  p. 46].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|St George killed the dragon in this country; and the place is shown close to [[Beirut|Beyroot]]. Many churches and convents are named after him. The church at Lydda is dedicated to St. George; so is a convent near [[Bethlehem]], and another small one just opposite the Jaffa gate, and others beside. The Arabs believe that St. George can restore mad people to their senses, and to say a person has been sent to St. George's is equivalent to saying he has been sent to a madhouse. It is singular that the Moslem Arabs adopted this veneration for St George, and send their mad people to be cured by him, as well as the Christians, but they commonly call him [[Khidr|El Khudder]]—The Green—according to their favourite manner of using epithets instead of names. Why he should be called green, however, I cannot tell—unless it is from the colour of his horse. Gray horses are called green in Arabic.}}

The mosque of Nabi Jurjis which was restored by [[Timur]] in the 14th century, was located in Mosul and supposedly contained the tomb of George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XMBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=saint+george+mosque+mosul&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCm7X5uYXYAhWLpY8KHT1TBtwQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20george%20mosque%20mosul&amp;f=false|title=Middle East and Africa: International Dictionary of Historic Places|publisher=I.B.

George or ''[[Hazrat]]'' Jurjays was the patron saint of Mosul. Along with [[Theodosius the Cenobiarch|Theodosius]], he was revered by both Christian and Muslim communities of [[Jazira Region|Jazira]] and [[Anatolia]]. The wall paintings of Kırk Dam Altı Kilise at [[Belisırma]] dedicated to him are dated between 1282-1304. These painting depicts him as a mounted knight appearing between donors including a Georgian lady called Thamar and her husband, the Emir and Consul Basil, while the Seljuk Sultan [[Mesud II]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Androncius II]] are also named in the inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUgyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA402&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4g73e-bzZAhUMiLwKHfw6A0oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Beyond the Legacy of Genghis Khan|author=Teresa Fitzherbert|editor=Linda Komaroff|chapter=Religious Diversity Under Ilkhanid Rule|publisher=Brill|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[General Roman Calendar]], the feast of Saint George is on 23 April. In the [[Tridentine Calendar]] of 1568, it was given the [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank]] of "Semidouble". In [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 calendar]] this rank was reduced to "Simple", and in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960 calendar]] to a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|"Commemoration"]]. Since [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]], it appears as an optional "[[Memorial (liturgy)|Memorial]]". In some countries, such as [[England]], the rank is higher. In England, it is a Solemnity (Roman Catholic) or Feast ([[Church of England]]): if it falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.&lt;ref&gt;The Divine Office: Table of Liturgical Days, Section I (RC) and Calendar, Lectionary and Collects (Church House Publishing 1997) p12 (C of E)&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint George is very much honoured by the Eastern Orthodox Church, wherein he is referred to as a "Great Martyr", and in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] overall. His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign [[Constantine the Great]] (305–37). When the church was consecrated, the [[relic]]s of the Saint George were transferred there. The other feast is on 26 November for a church dedicated to him in [[Kiev]], ''circa'' 1054.

In [[Bulgaria]], Saint George's day ({{lang-bg|Гергьовден}}) is celebrated on 6 May, when it is customary to slaughter and roast a lamb. Saint George's day is also a [[public holiday]].

In [[Egypt]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] refers to Saint George ({{Lang-cop|Ⲡⲓⲇⲅⲓⲟⲥ Ⲅⲉⲟⲣⲅⲓⲟⲥ or ⲅⲉⲱⲣⲅⲓⲟⲥ}}) as the "Prince of Martyrs" and celebrates his martyrdom on the 23rd of [[Paremhat]] of the [[Coptic calendar]] equivalent to 1 May.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} 
The [[Copts]] also celebrate the consecration of the first church dedicated to him on seventh of the month of Hatour of the Coptic calendar usually equivalent to 17 November.

In [[India]], the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]], one of the oriental catholic churches ([[Eastern Catholic Churches]]) and Malankara orthodox church venerate Saint George. The main pilgrim centers of the saint in India are at [[Edathua]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edathuapalli.org/church/ |title= St.George forane church Edathua-689573 |last= B |first= Sathish |publisher= Sathish B |date= 20 March 2008 |website= Edathuapalli |access-date= 5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Alappuzha]] district and [[Edappally]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edappallystgeorge.org/ |title= St.George forane church Edappally |last= St:George Church |first=  |publisher= St: George Church |date= 22 April 2014 |website= Edappally |access-date= 5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ernakulam]] district of the southern state of [[Kerala]].

The main feast day is 7 May, when the statue of the saint along with other saints is taken in procession around the church. Intercession to Saint George of Edathua is believed to be efficacious in repelling snakes and in curing mental ailments.The sacred relics of St. George were brought to [[Antioch]] from [[Mardeen]] in A.D.900 and were taken to Kerala, India from Antioch in 1912 by Mar Dionysius of Vattasseril and kept in the Orthodox seminary at Kundara, Kerala. H.H Mathews II Catholicos had given the relics to St. George churches at Puthupally, Kottayam District  and Chandanappally, Pathanamthitta district.

A highly celebrated saint in both the [[Catholic|Western]] and [[Eastern Christian|Eastern]] [[Christian]] churches, a large number of [[Patronages of Saint George]] exist throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Graham | last = Seal | year = 2001 | title = Encyclopedia of folk heroes | isbn = 1-57607-216-9 | page = 85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint George is the patron saint of '''[[England]]'''. His cross forms the national [[flag of England]], and features within the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and other national flags containing the Union Flag, such as those of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. By the 14th century, the saint had been declared both the patron saint and the protector of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Kathryn | last = Hinds | title = Medieval England | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7614-0308-6 | page = 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgia (country)|country of '''Georgia''']], where devotions to the saint date back to the fourth century, is not technically named after the saint, but is a well-attested [[back-formation]] of the English name. However, a large number of towns and cities around the world are. Saint George is one of the patron Saints of Georgia; the name Georgia (''Sakartvelo'' in Georgian) is an [[anglicisation]] of ''Gurj'', ultimately derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''gurj''/''gurjān'' ("wolf"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hock|first1=Hans Henrich|last2=Zgusta|first2=Ladislav|title=Historical, Indo-European, and Lexicographical Studies|date=1997|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3110128840|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=3|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronicles describing the land as ''Georgie'' or Georgia in French and English, date from the early Middle Ages, as written by the travellers [[John Mandeville]] and [[Jacques de Vitry]] "because of their special reverence for Saint George",&lt;ref&gt;David Marshall Lang, ''The Georgians,'' (New York: Frederick A Praeger, 1966), 17–18. The terms Georgia and Georgians appeared in Western Europe in numerous early medieval annals. The French chronicler [[Jacques de Vitry]] and the English traveller [[John Mandeville]] wrote that Georgians are called 'Georgian' because they especially revere Saint George.&lt;/ref&gt; but these accounts have been seen as [[folk etymology]] and are rejected by the scholarly community.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/&gt; Exactly 365 Orthodox churches in Georgia are named after Saint George according to the number of days in a year. According to legend, Saint George was cut into 365 pieces after he fell in battle and every single piece was spread throughout the entire country.&lt;ref name="Gabidzashvili"&gt;{{citation | last = Gabidzashvili | first = Enriko | year = 1991 | title = Saint George: In Ancient Georgian Literature | publisher = Armazi – 89 | place = Tbilisi, Georgia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = FJ | last = Foakes-Jackson | title = A History of the Christian Church | publisher = Cosimo | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-59605-452-2 | page = 556}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Antony | last = Eastmond | title = Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia | publisher = Penn State Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-271-01628-0 | page = 119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotions to Saint George in '''[[Portugal]]''' date back to the 12th century. [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357–1433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. "Portugal and Saint George" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply "Saint George" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = Vítor | last2 = André | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, Saint George is the patron of '''[[Aragon]]''' and '''[[Catalonia]]'''. These two autonomous communities were in the past two of the most important territories belonging to the [[Crown of Aragon]].
Saint George ({{lang-an|San Chorche}}) is the patron of [[Aragon]], one of the autonomous communities of [[Spain]]. This festivity is celebrated on the 23th of April as "The Day of Aragon". Legend says that the [[Pedro I of Aragon]] started in 1096 the conquest of [[Huesca]], which was under the rule of the [[Taifa]] in [[Zaragoza]], following the desires of his father, [[Sancho I of Aragon]]. The fight was hard and difficult, Christian militia trusted totally in God to win the battle.  God sent Saint George, who descended from Heaven riding on a horse, carrying with him a maroon cross to the battlefield. After seeing God's signal, militiamen returned to the battle field with more energy than ever. The [[moors]] could not believe what was happening, they were defeated, abandoning the battlefield rapidly. After half a year of being trapped, Pedro I finally entered the city.
To celebrate this victory, Saint George's cross was used as the insignia of Huesca and Aragon, honouring his name since he was their saviour. Nowadays, this cross is still present on Aragon's shield. 
The popular story which is told to school children and other places, is that Saint George defeated a dragon, and is celebrated by everybody throughout the community.
Saint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including [[Flag of Barcelona|the one]] of the Catalan capital, [[Barcelona]]. The Catalan tradition usually locates the events of his legend in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]]. 
The origins of the worship of Saint George go back to the [[Crown of Aragon]], and share the same legend as that of [[Aragon]]. By the 15th century Catalan men used to celebrate Saint George's Day by giving [[roses]] to women. One of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.

==Arms and flag==
{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}
[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]

It became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - "[[Saint George's Cross]]" probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this "George's flag", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' ("cross ensign of the commune of Genoa"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Ziggioto, "Genova", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, "Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].

The term "Saint George's cross" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).&lt;ref&gt;William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of "the plain or St George's cross" as "the mother of all the others" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography and models==
[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]

Saint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Saint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bitumenized). 
Saint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].

During the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller, second only to the Bible among books published by early English printer [[William Caxton]] (''circa'' 1415-1492).

'''Sheila Rowbotham''' (born 1943) is a British [[socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] theorist and writer.

==Early life==
Rowbotham was born in [[Leeds]] (in present-day [[West Yorkshire]]), the daughter of a salesman for an engineering company and an office clerk.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington page 270"/&gt; From an early age, she was deeply interested in history.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington page 270"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; She has written that traditional political history "left her cold", but she credited Olga Wilkinson, one of her teachers, with encouraging her interest in [[social history]] by showing that history "belonged to the present, not to the history textbooks".&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington page 270"/&gt;

Rowbotham attended [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's College]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and then the [[University of London]]. She began her working life as a teacher in [[comprehensive school]]s and institutes of higher or [[Adult education]]. While attending St. Hilda's College, Rowbotham found her syllabus with its heavy focus on political history to be of no interest to her.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington page 270"/&gt; Through her involvement in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and various socialist circles including the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s youth wing, the [[Labour Party Young Socialists|Young Socialists]], Rowbotham was Introduced to [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington page 270"/&gt; Already on the left, Rowbotham adopted [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, pp. 270–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon disenchanted with the direction of party politics she immersed herself in a variety of left-wing campaigns, including writing for the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] political newspaper ''[[The Black Dwarf (Ali)|Black Dwarf]]''. In the 1960s, Rowbotham was one of the founders and leaders of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement associated with [[Ruskin College]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Hera "Rowbotham, Sheila", in ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Vol. 2, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999, p. 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 1960s she had become involved in the growing Women’s Liberation Movement (also known as [[Second-wave feminism]]) and, in 1969, published her influential pamphlet "Women's Liberation and the New Politics", which argued that Socialist theory needed to consider the oppression of women in cultural as well as economic terms. She was heavily involved in the conference ''Beyond the Fragments'' (eventually a book), which attempted to draw together [[democratic socialist]] and [[socialist feminist]] currents in Britain. Between 1983 and 1986, Rowbotham served as the editor of ''Jobs for Change'', the newspaper of the [[Greater London Council]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cook, 1999, p. 1021.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outlook on feminism==
Since then, Rowbotham has produced numerous studies and articles expanding upon her theory, which argues that as women's oppression is a result of both economic and cultural forces then a dualist perspective ([[socialist feminism]]) that examines both the public and private sphere is required to work towards liberation.

Rowbotham was especially influenced by Marxist social history as practised by [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Dorothy Thompson (historian)|Dorothy Thompson]].&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 271"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Combining a Marxist analysis with feminism, Rowbotham contends that capitalism not only systematically oppresses the working class, but also particularly oppresses women.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 271"/&gt; In her view, women are doubly oppressed as they are forced to sell their labour to survive, but also forced to use their labour to support their husbands and children.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 271"/&gt; Rowbotham is critical of traditional [[Marxist history]] for what she sees as the neglect of such issues as family history, the role of housewives in supporting the economy, sexuality, and maternity.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 271"/&gt; In her 1973 book ''Women's Consciousness, Men's World'', Rowbotham maintained that the domestic household work done by women was a part of commodity production as it allowed the production and reproduction of men's labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, she claimed that the human family was not just an instrument for disciplining and subjecting women to capitalism, but was a place where potentially humans could take refuge from what Rowbotham sees as the commodification of human relationships under capitalism&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Rowbotham's view, raising children, sexuality and need for human relationships means that the family can rarely be reduced down to a service commodity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Likewise, she argues for a Marxist history that accords equal importance to the role of both sexes in the history of revolutions, unions, political parties and protest movements.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 271"/&gt;

In such books as ''Women, Resistance and Revolution'' (1972) and ''Hidden from History'' (1973), Rowbotham put her ideas into practice by examining the experience of women in radical and revolutionary movements in [[Cuba]], [[Algeria]], [[Vietnam]], China, Russia, France and Britain from the 17th century to the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; In her opinion, working within the established order has never brought women any advances, and only through revolutionary socialist movements have women made any social gains.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt; Rowbotham has argued that though male revolutionaries are willing to accept women as partners as long as the revolution lasts, once the revolution is over, women are expected to return to their traditional roles.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt; In ''Hidden from History'', she examined [[British women's history]] from the 17th century to 1930 from a Marxist viewpoint.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For Rowbotham, the history of British women could best be defined through class oppression, the Industrial Revolution and sexism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Rowbotham has criticised [[Leninism]] and [[Bolshevism]], claiming that they "narrow the struggle of women's emancipation",&lt;ref name="Kate"&gt;{{cite web

She has criticised Soviet policies starting with the [[first five-year plan]] of 1928–33 for not only expecting women to work full-time, but also to take on the burdens of housework and child raising while at the same time banning abortion and birth control.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt; She has contended that to achieve women's liberation requires a "revolution within the revolution" or freedom from the "colony within the colony" as sexism was and is just entrenched in radical left-wing men as it is on the right.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt; She maintains that capitalism and sexism are so closely linked that the only way to destroy both is a radical change in the "cultural conditioning" of humanity as regards child-rearing, homes, laws, and the work.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt; Rowbotham's books were, and are still well received in radical feminist circles.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1973 book, ''Women's Consciousness, Men's World'', Rowbotham presented her analysis of contemporary social conditions from a Marxist-feminist perspective.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"/&gt; She argues that origins of sexism predate capitalism, and that the institution of marriage closely resembles [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"/&gt; She contends that as in feudalism serfs were obliged to serve their masters, wives are likewise contracted to serve their husbands.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"/&gt; In her books, Rowbotham has used a broad variety of sources such as government statistics, pamphlets, novels, interviews, songs, secondary sources, and her own history.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of criticism of Rowbotham is her heavy reliance on secondary sources for such books as ''Women, Resistance and Revolution'' and ''Hidden from History''.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 272"/&gt;

In her 1977 book ''Dutiful Daughters'', co-written with Jean McCrindle, Rowbotham interviewed fourteen women of lower-middle class and working class origin.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"/&gt; Though Rowbotham notes that the life stories of women interviewed for ''Dutiful Daughters'' were not intended to be representative of all British women, she argues that these snap-shots of different lives if combined with enough other oral histories can provide an understanding of the experience of ordinary women.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"/&gt;

As part of relating the personal to the political, Rowbotham has examined the sexual and political beliefs of such late 19th- to early 20th-century radicals as the gay rights activist [[Edward Carpenter]], who saw socialism as way for humanity's spiritual rebirth, and the feminist [[Stella Browne]] who fought for the legalisation of birth control and argued for the importance of sexual pleasure for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rowbotham argued that the political beliefs of Carpenter and Browne were closely tied to their personal lives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Besides her work as a historian, Rowbotham has been active in left-wing causes.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"/&gt; In her book ''Beyond the Fragments'', co-written with [[Hilary Wainwright]] and [[Lynne Segal]], Rowbotham called for the various fractions of the British left to unite, and work for a socialist Britain through grassroots activism.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"/&gt; She has great faith in activist social movements working from the bottom up to change society,&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274"/&gt; and feels that historians have a duty to contribute to social change by writing books that expose what she sees as the evils of society.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274-275"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, pp. 274–75.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, she is highly critical of those historians who, influenced by theories of French [[structuralism]] and [[post—structuralism]], write in a style unlikely to appeal to the general public.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 274-275"/&gt;

In Rowbotham's opinion, an issue of great importance is providing a definition of [[patriarchy]] so that women know what they are struggling against.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"/&gt; She finds fault with those feminists who deny men a role in the battle against sexism.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie page 273"/&gt; In her opinion, women and men should stand equally against both capitalism and sexism to achieve radical social reorganisation.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes-Warrington, 2000, pp. 273–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent professional life==
In 2004, Rowbotham was elected as a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  She was Professor of Gender and Labour History, Sociology at the [[University of Manchester]], England, until her involuntary retirement in 2008.

Rowbotham's involuntary retirement from the University of Manchester caused protest from students. The Facebook group Save Sheila Rowbotham was established to campaign for her continuation as a Lecturer. The same year she published the first ever biography of [[Edward Carpenter]], entitled ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'' and did continue to teach within the Sociology department at Manchester. In Autumn 2008, her request to stay on after the age of 65 to a third of her job was refused. However, after protests from students, academics and others internationally the university offered Rowbotham a third of research professorship. She is currently a Simon Professor.

Rowbotham's 2009 biography of [[Edward Carpenter]] was shortlisted for the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last year's shortlist|accessdate=26 July 2011|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/people/tait-black/shortlist-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowbotham was the Eccles Centre Writer in Residence at the [[British Library]] for 2012.

"'''The Soup Nazi'''" is the 116th episode of the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was the sixth episode of the seventh season. It first aired in the United States on November 2, 1995.

The Soup Nazi is also the nickname of the eponymous character, Yev Kassem, played by [[Larry Thomas (actor)|Larry Thomas]]. The term "[[Nazi]]" is used as an [[Reductio ad Hitlerum|exaggeration]] of the excessively strict regimentation he constantly demands of his patrons ([[cf.]] ''[[Grammar Nazi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 15 Seinfeld Food Related Episodes|publisher=Eating the Road|url=http://eatingtheroad.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/top-15-seinfeld-food-related-episodes/|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]], [[George Costanza|George]] and [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] visit a new soup stand [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] has been praising.  Jerry explains that the owner, Yev Kassem, is known as the "Soup Nazi" due to his temperament and insistence on a strict manner of behavior while placing an order.

At the soup stand, George tells Kassem that he didn't receive any bread with his order.  Kassem says bread is two dollars extra, even though George rightfully points out that the other customers received free bread, at which Kassem spitefully pushes the price up to three dollars. When George complains again, Kassem decrees "No soup for you!"  George's order is quickly taken away and his money returned.

En route to the soup stand with Jerry and George, Elaine notices a guy on the sidewalk with a giant armoire for sale.  She decides to forgo the soup in favor of buying the armoire. However, her [[building superintendent]] informs her that furniture move-ins are not allowed on Sundays, so she asks Kramer to watch the armoire and promises to get soup from Kassem for him in return.

On a subsequent visit, George successfully manages to buy soup (bread came with it this time), but Elaine, having ignored Jerry's advice on how to order, quickly draws Kassem's ire and she is banned for a year. During this time, two thieves (Bob and Cedric) intimidate Kramer and steal the armoire.

Later, Jerry and his current girlfriend Sheila ([[Alexandra Wentworth]]) visit the soup stand. Kassem is repulsed by their public displays of affection, so Jerry disavows knowing Sheila to stay on Kassem's good side. Jerry talks about the situation with George, who has expressed disgust at Jerry's "baby talk". Jerry admits he behaved facetiously with Sheila at the soup stand and vows to redeem himself. George considers this and begins to behave similarly with [[Susan Ross|Susan]] to express his disgust, but Susan instead takes this as a sign of George expressing their love in public.

Some time later, Kramer, who has befriended Kassem, tells him about the armoire theft. Kassem offers him an antique armoire he has in storage as a replacement. Elaine is elated, and goes to Kassem to thank him.  When Kassem learns the armoire was for Elaine, he says he would have rather destroyed it than give it to her. Upset, Elaine returns to her apartment with Jerry, where they discover the armoire is filled with Kassem's soup recipes. Elaine returns to the soup stand and confronts Kassem with the recipes, intent on ruining his business in revenge for mistreating her.

Jerry encounters [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], who is running to get a pot from his apartment. Newman tells him that because of what Elaine said to Kassem, he is closing down his stand and returning to Argentina and giving away whatever soup he has left. Jerry quickly runs home to follow Newman's lead.

==Production==
"The Soup Nazi" was [[Spike Feresten]]'s first credited ''Seinfeld'' episode as a writer. The idea for the episode arose when Feresten told [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]] about New York soup vendor '''[[Al Yeganeh]]''', who was nicknamed "The Soup Nazi." Seinfeld and David laughed and said, "That's a show. Do that as your first show." Feresten's inspiration for the armoire subplot was a New York apartment building where he had lived, which forbade moving furniture on certain days. The armoire thieves were written as [[homosexual]] because Larry David decided that, "Only gay guys would steal an armoire."&lt;ref name=DVDFeresten&gt;"Seinfeld - Season 7" DVD bonus material, in which, during the episode's "Inside Look" featurette, Feresten recounts this story.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cast table reading for "The Soup Nazi" was held on September 28, 1995, and it was filmed before a [[studio audience]] on October 3.&lt;ref name=DVDNotes&gt;"Seinfeld - Season 7" DVD bonus material, "Notes About Nothing" subtitles&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Elaine ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) imitates [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''. This was done at Jerry Seinfeld's suggestion, even though Louis-Dreyfus had never seen the film.&lt;ref&gt;"Seinfeld - Season 7" DVD bonus material, in which during the episode's "Inside Look" featurette, Louis-Dreyfus recounts this story.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soup Nazi was portrayed by [[Larry Thomas (actor)|Larry Thomas]], who was nominated for a 1996 Emmy for the role. Thomas, who did not realize that the character was based on a real person, received the inspiration for his portrayal from watching ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and studying [[Omar Sharif]]'s accent.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Lance (May 30, 2012).

A stone-faced immigrant chef with a thick [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-esque [[moustache]], he is renowned throughout [[Manhattan]] for his soups. He demands that all customers in his restaurant meticulously follow his strict queuing, ordering, and payment policies. Failure to adhere to his demands brings the stern admonition ("No soup for you!"), whereupon the customer is refunded and denied his or her order. He then yells to the next person in line, "Next!" Elaine parodies this when she reveals that she has his recipes. She says to him, "You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. NEXT!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Script, Episode 116 - The Soup Nazi|publisher=Seinology.com|url=http://www.seinology.com/scripts/script-116.shtml|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soup Nazi has a cameo in the ''Seinfeld'' [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]], in which his true name is revealed, but which he refuses to spell when asked by District Attorney Hoyt. He is the penultimate witness in the case against Seinfeld, Elaine, George and Kramer, before Babu Bhatt. He tells Hoyt about how he banned Elaine from his shop, only for her to return and ruin his business, forcing him to move to Argentina. Elaine angers him by smugly claiming, "His soup wasn't all that good anyway." During the recess, he is seen serving soup to Robin, Mr. Lipman, Poppie and Babu, all of whom enjoy it. Poppie appears to ask for salt with his soup, whereupon Kassem takes his soup away. He is present and obviously satisfied when Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer are found guilty and sent to prison.

===Inspiration===
[[Image:Soup-kitchen1.jpg|thumb|250px|The restaurant Soup Kitchen International was the inspiration for this episode of ''Seinfeld''. The restaurant closed in 2004, but has since reopened.]]
The character was inspired by '''Ali "Al" Yeganeh''', [[The Original Soup Man|a Persian soup vendor]] who ran [[Soup Kitchen International]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;See a profile of Yeganeh in "The Soup Man of 55th Street." ''[[New York Cookbook]]''. ed. Molly O'Neill. Workman Publishing, 1992. pp. 70-71. {{ISBN|1-56305-337-3}}; See one of his recipes on p. 78. of the same work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2012/06/22/no-soup-for-you/|title=No soup for you!|first=Kaja|last=Whitehouse|date=June 22, 2012|work=New York Post|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeganeh has stated on numerous occasions that he is very offended by the "Soup Nazi" moniker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/13/smbusiness/bc.apfn.ny.soupnazi.ap/?postversion=2007091310 Associated Press via CNN Money] {{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Spike Feresten]], Jerry Seinfeld and several members of the production team went to Soup Kitchen International for lunch weeks after "The Soup Nazi" aired. Upon recognizing Seinfeld, Yeganeh went into a profanity-filled rant about how the show had "ruined" his business and demanded an apology. Seinfeld allegedly gave what Feresten describes as "the most insincere, sarcastic apology ever given". Obviously having seen the episode, Yeganeh then bellowed, "No soup for you!" and ejected them from the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;See the Season 7 DVD extras, in which during the episode's ''Inside Look'', Feresten recounts this story.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nora Ephron]]'s DVD commentary, the first pop culture reference to Yeganeh (though not by name) seems to have come years before the ''Seinfeld'' episode, in the 1993 movie ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''. In the film, a character playing a writer{{refn|name=sleeplessCharacter|One source says the character was [[Meg Ryan|''Annie'']],&lt;ref name=sleeplessQuotation /&gt; but the script-transcript indicates the character was [[Tom McGowan#Movie credits|''Keith'']].&lt;!-- can somebody with access to the 1993 film verify which character spoke the line please? --&gt;}} [[Sales pitch#Beginning statement|pitches]] a story for [[The Baltimore Sun#Daily|the lifestyle section of the publication]] to [[Rosie O'Donnell|their editor]]: "This man sells the greatest soup you have ever eaten, and he is the meanest man in America.

[[File:EatNParkSoupNazi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An [[Eat'n Park]] sign featuring the Soup Nazi's catchphrase as a joke in 2016.]]
Like [[Jackie Chiles]], the Soup Nazi character (played by Thomas) has appeared in commercials after the end of the series.

* In an advertisement by the corporate lobbying group [[Center for Consumer Freedom]], he denies food to people he considers to be too fat.
* Thomas appeared, in character, along with Jerry Seinfeld in a television commercial for [[Acura]] that aired during the 2012 [[Super Bowl]]. In the advertisement, Seinfeld is trying to bribe an ordinary guy to get an Acura, offering him soup from The Soup Nazi, who happily offers "Soup for you!". After Jay Leno beat Jerry Seinfeld in bribing the ordinary guy, the Soup Nazi was seen with Jerry, an alien, and a "[[Munchkin]]" at a restaurant where they are angered at Jay Leno's actions.
* In 2013, [[Serbu Firearms]] refused to sell their model BFG-50A semi-automatic .50 rifles to the [[New York City Police Department]] after the passage of the [[NY SAFE Act]] that classified their weapon as an assault rifle.&lt;ref name=NoSerbuForYou&gt;{{cite journal |author=staff |title=Soup Nazi fires off over guns |journal=[[New York Post]] |date=April 2, 2013 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/soup_nazi_fires_off_over_guns_5U9yizmXkDaawodTxMbMaM |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berman2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berman, Jillian |date=April 3, 2013 |title=Larry Thomas, 'Soup Nazi' Actor, Pushes Serbu Firearms To Pull Pro-Gun T-Shirt Featuring His Face |journal=[[The Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/larry-thomas-serbu-firearms_n_3007567.html |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their refusal to sell the rifles, Serbu had T-shirts printed with an image of the Soup Nazi character with the words "No Serbu For You".&lt;ref name=NoSerbuForYou/&gt; Thomas, a gun control advocate, contacted [[Facebook]] and the [[T-shirt]] printers to have the shirts removed.&lt;ref name=NoSerbuForYou/&gt; Serbu has since removed the image of Thomas and replaced it with one of their founder Mark Serbu.&lt;ref name=SerbuTshirt&gt;{{cite web |author=Higginbotham, David |date=April 9, 2013 |publisher=guns.com |title=No Serbu For You, Soup Nazi Wants His Image Back |url=http://www.guns.com/2013/04/09/no-serbu-for-you-soup-nazi-wants-his-image-back/ |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
* Larry Thomas appeared as himself in the ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' episode "[[My Self-Examination]]." He denies he is the Soup Nazi when asked by J.D. ([[Zach Braff]]), who then tricks him into saying the catchphrase "No soup for you!" by asking him "What is [the catchphrase] again? It's like, 'You're out of luck in the soup department...'"
* Rapper [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]] used lines from the episode as an introduction and outro to his song "The Soup" on his 2010 mixtape ''More About Nothing''. He acts as the Soup Nazi and uses the soup chef's catchphrase "No soup for you!"
* In the sitcom ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', the crooked housing entrepreneur George Bluth Sr. is charged with signing a development deal with [[Saddam Hussein]], despite the embargo against [[Iraq]]. Bluth claims that he acted in good faith, mistakenly believing that Hussein was Larry Thomas because of his resemblance to the Soup Nazi. This gets referenced in a later episode, where Thomas appears in the role as a [[political decoy]] for Saddam Hussein who has lost his job because of the American invasion of Iraq.

===In-person promotions===
* Larry Thomas has used the character to promote soup kitchens for the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/home/Seinfeld-star-makes-sure-there-is-soup-for-Boise-homeless-104390699.html |title=Seinfeld star makes sure there is soup for Boise homeless &amp;#124; KTVB.COM Boise |publisher=Ktvb.com |date=October 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330150941/http://www.ktvb.com/home/Seinfeld-star-makes-sure-there-is-soup-for-Boise-homeless-104390699.html |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2012, the "Seinfeld Food Truck" embarked on an eight-stop United States tour. The truck, driven by Larry Thomas, handed out free soup along with other ''Seinfeld''-related food items: Snapple, Twix, Junior Mints, black and white cookies and muffin tops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Zoe | last = Bain | title = Seinfeld "No Soup for You!"

===Other===
* The episode inspired an actual soup chain, ''Soup Nutsy'', which opened in 1996 in New York City. Though it had no official connection to, or endorsement from, ''Seinfeld'' or its creators, it included specific ''Seinfeld'' references such as describing two of its soups as "Jerry's Favorite" and "Kramer's Favorite", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/nyregion/in-this-corner-soup-nutsy.html In This Corner, Soup Nutsy], Anthony Ramirez, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 4, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it was bought by [[Franchise Concepts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/04/nyregion/soup-nutsy-on-the-move.html Soup Nutsy on the Move], David Chen, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 4, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A few of its locations remain in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soupnutsy.ca/ Soup Nutsy homepage] (retrieved January 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

He operated on the Internet using the handle "Soupnazi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 18, 2009 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/18/nation/na-hacker18 |title=Ex-informant charged with even bigger data theft this time |work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell and her teacher decided on Unita Zelma.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 11, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell and her parents lived in Lula until 1936, when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the plantation on which he worked, and fled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him.&lt;ref name="breakup"/&gt; Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work.&lt;ref name="Haskins p.15"&gt;Haskins 1999, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|West Helena, Arkansas]], to live with Blackwell's great aunt so that she had the opportunity to receive an education.&lt;ref name="breakup"&gt;Blackwell 2006, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; A quality education in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system.&lt;ref name="Oral History"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usm.edu/oral-history/oral-history-collections-z#B |title=Oral History with Honorable Unita Blackwell |last=Garvey |first=Mike |website=Mississippi Oral History Program of University of Southern Mississippi |publisher=The University of Southern Mississippi Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage |access-date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida.&lt;ref name="African American History Online"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp? |title=Blackwell, Unita |last=Carey |first=Charles W. |website=African-American Political Leaders, Revised Edition, A to Z of African Americans |publisher=Facts on File, Inc. |access-date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 14 when she finished the [[eighth grade]], the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.&lt;ref name="Haskins p.15" /&gt;

===Marriage and move===
Blackwell was 25 when she first met Jeremiah Blackwell, a cook for the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, they traveled to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], and were married by a [[justice of the peace]].&lt;ref name="page101"&gt;Morrison 1987, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1957, Blackwell became extremely ill and was taken to the hospital in West Helena where she was pronounced dead. She was later found to be alive in her hospital room, and claims to have had a [[near-death experience]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 1957, the couple's only son, Jeremiah Blackwell Jr. (Jerry), was born.&lt;ref name="page101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Jeremiah's grandmother, "Miss Vashti", died. A few months later, the Blackwells moved into the [[shotgun house]] that his grandmother had left to him, in [[Mayersville, Mississippi]], a town of nearly five hundred people.&lt;ref name="African American History Online" /&gt;&lt;ref name="page101"/&gt; The Blackwell family was eventually able to build a larger brick home, but Blackwell wanted to keep the smaller house inherited from Jeremiah's grandmother.&lt;ref name="Haskins p.15"/&gt; After settling in Mayersville, Blackwell began to get involved in the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref name="African American History Online" /&gt;

==Civil rights activism==

===Voting discrimination===
Blackwell first got involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in June 1964, when two activists from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] came to Mayersville and held meetings in the church she belonged to concerning African Americans' right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 65–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/filmandmedia/collections/hampton/eyes1/blackwell.htm |title=Unita Blackwell |publisher=Washington University Film &amp; Media Archive |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002214309/http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/filmandmedia/collections/hampton/eyes1/blackwell.htm |archive-date=October 2, 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/oh_freedom/interview_blackwell.html |title=Oh Freedom Over Me: Selected Interviews, Unita Blackwell |last=Biewen |first=John |last2=Kate Cavett |year=1994 |publisher=American Public Media |access-date=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voices of Freedom |last=Hampton |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Hampton |author2=Steve Fayer |year=1990 |publisher=Bantam Books |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-553-05734-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week she and seven others went to the courthouse to take a voter registration test so that they could vote.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 3–8, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;iel=4;view=toc;idno=bla0015.0999.011 |title=Interview with Unita Blackwell |date=May 7, 1986 |publisher=Blackside, Inc. |access-date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were outside the courthouse waiting to take the test, a group of white farmers from the area heard what was happening and tried to scare them off.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; The group stayed there all day, but only two were able to take the test.

When the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] came to Mississippi in January 1965, Blackwell testified in front of them about her experiences with voter discrimination:&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/msdelta/ch3.htm |title=Racial and Ethnic Tensions in American Communities: Poverty, Inequality, and Discrimination—Volume VII: The Mississippi Delta Report&amp;nbsp;— Chapter 3: Voting Rights and Political Representation in the Mississippi Delta |publisher=United States Commission on Civil Rights |access-date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Blackwell's involvement with voter registration campaigns, she and other activists endured constant harassment.&lt;ref name="Haskins p.16"&gt;Haskins 1999, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SNCC and other movements===
After meeting [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] in the summer of 1964 and hearing her experiences in the Civil Rights Movement, Blackwell decided to join the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer 2005, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 83–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Can You Make A Difference?: A Memoir of a Life for Change |last=Schwartz |first=Robert J. |year=2002 |publisher=[[Lantern Books]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-59056-032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/12/17/growing-up-female/ |title=Growing Up Female |last=Schine |first=Cathleen |authorlink=Cathleen Schine |date=November 20, 2009 |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote.&lt;ref name="BET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="African American History Online" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1993, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In late August she and 67 other elected MFDP delegates traveled to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], intending to get the MFDP seated as "the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi."&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 106–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=king/&gt; They were eventually offered two [[Plurality-at-large voting|at-large seats]] but refused that compromise; the event, particularly Hamer's nationally televised testimony before the credentialing committee, brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web|title=Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP)|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_mississippi_freedom_democratic_party/|publisher=King Encyclopedia|agency=stanford.edu|access-date=January 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211160716/http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_mississippi_freedom_democratic_party/|archive-date=February 11, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s Blackwell worked as a community development specialist with the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. In the 1970s, through the National Council of Negro Women, she worked on a development program for low-income housing and encouraged people across the country "to build their own homes."&lt;ref name="African American History Online" /&gt; During her time participating in the Civil Rights Movement, she was jailed over 70 times because of her role in civil rights protests and other actions.&lt;ref name="Haskins p.16" /&gt;

===''Blackwell v. Issaquena County Board of Education''===
[[File:Logo SNCC.svg|thumb|100px|The SNCC pin]]
The Blackwells filed a suit, ''Blackwell v. Issaquena County Board of Education'', against the [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]] Board of Education on April 1, 1965, after the principal suspended over 300 black children, including Jerry, the Blackwells' son, for wearing pins that depicted a black hand and a white hand clasped with the word "SNCC" below them.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 133–136.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit covered several issues including the students' use of the "freedom pins", and asked that the Issaquena County School District desegregate their schools per the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi decided that the students were being disruptive with their use of the freedom pins, but that the school district had to desegregate their schools to comply with federal law, by the Fall of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 136–137, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was taken to the United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit in July 1966, where the previous decision by the District Court was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Blackwell v.

Blackwell's son and approximately 50 other children boycotted the school, because of its decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community decided that it was vital to school those children. She helped open [[freedom schools]] in [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]] to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; The schools became popular and continued to teach classes every summer until 1970, when the local schools finally desegregated.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell 2006, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career and later life==
Blackwell has been on 16 diplomatic missions to China since 1973.&lt;ref name="query" /&gt; As part of her commitment to better relations between the United States and China, she served for six years as president of the US-China Peoples Friendship Association, an association dedicated to promoting cultural exchange between the United States and China.&lt;ref name="African American History Online" /&gt; In 1979 Blackwell was appointed to the U.S. National Commission on the [[International Year of the Child]].&lt;ref name="Haskins p.15"/&gt; She was elected mayor of [[Mayersville, Mississippi]] in 1976 and held this office until 2001, making her the first female African-American mayor in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer 2005, pp. 418–19, 504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ruraldevelopment.org/bdbios.html |title=Board Members |publisher=ruraldevelopment.org |access-date=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years (1954–1965)|last=Williams|first=Juan|authorlink=Juan Williams|year=1987|publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-670-81412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/opinion/2015/02/28/rheta-johnson-voices-speak-space-time/24207199|title=Rheta Johnson: Voices speak through space and time|work=The Town Talk| date=February 28, 2015| agency=Gazette|accessdate=March 3, 2015|author=Johnson, Rheta|location=Bay St. Louis, Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She filed a petition&lt;ref name="Varsha Dongre High court Petition"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cghighcourt.nic.in/causelists/200814.pdf|title=HIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH AT BILASPUR |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 2006 alleging corruption and favouritism by the Chhattisgarh State Public Service Commission in the recruitment for 147 civil services posts in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahat|first1=Pavan|title=Deputy jailer suspended in Chhattisgarh for social media post on tribal’s torture|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/deputy-jailer-suspended-in-chhattisgarh-for-social-media-post-on-tribals-torture/article18401172.ece|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=The Hindu|date=6 May 2017|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the Supreme Court found her allegations Valid and ordered for a “fresh” merit list to be prepared. It also directed the commission to pay [[Indian_rupee|Rupees]] five [[lakh]] to her as legal expense and Rupees one lakh each for the other two petitioners. The tenacity and Persistence of the Petitioners, especially that of Varsha Dongre was appreciated by the court, for bringing out the acts of corruption and favouritism.&lt;ref name="Varsha Dongre High court Petition" /&gt;

== Facebook post controversy == 
In a [[Facebook]] post dated April 26, 2017, Dongre wrote about the general displacement in adivasi areas and alienation of adivasis from land, forests and rivers, in violation of constitutional safeguards, for corporate interests which is a violation of the 5th Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  She also shared her horrifying first-hand experience of witnessing the stripping, electric shock, sexual and other forms of torture of minor adivasis girls in the police stations and jails.&lt;ref name="Varsha Dongre Scroll"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Subramaniam|first1=Malini|title=Meet Chhattisgarh jailer Varsha Dongre: Suspended for exposing torture and sexual abuse of Adivasis|url=https://scroll.in/article/837732/peoples-servant-how-chhattisgarh-jailer-varsha-dongre-came-to-expose-repression-against-adivasis|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Facebook]] post, Dongre was suspended by the Chhattisgarh state government on May 6, 2017 on the grounds of “indiscipline and violation of service rules”.&lt;ref name="Varsha Dongre 1" /&gt;
She was issued a suspension letter signed by the director general of police (Jail administration), Raipur, Chhattisgarh with charges as follows:
“Miss Varsha Dongre, assistant jail superintendent, Raipur central jail is suspendedwith immediate effect for irresponsibly spreading wrong and misleading facts in media and remaining absent from her duty in an unauthorised manner. She is entitled to a salary as per official suspension norms and will be posted at the Ambikapur central jail during her suspension”.
The preliminary investigative officer was given seven days to probe her social media post but the officer, who handed over a 32-page notice to her, gave her only two days to file her reply.Varsha had, however, sent a 376-page reply to him. &lt;ref name="Varsha Dongre 1"&gt;{{cite news|title='I Was Suspended Without Being Heard': Chhattisgarh Whistleblower Who Wrote About Police Atrocities - The Wire|url=https://thewire.in/politics/chhattigarh-varsha-dongre-suspension|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=The Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugh Nanton Romney''' (born May 15, 1936), better known as '''Wavy Gravy''', is an American entertainer and [[activism|activist]] for peace, best known for his [[hippie]] appearance, personality and [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] beliefs. His [[moniker]] was given to him by [[B.B. King]] at the [[Texas International Pop Festival]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Dallasnews"&gt;{{cite web |via=Janis joplin.net |work=Dallas Morning News |url=http://www.janisjoplin.net/news/97/48/Texas-International-Pop-Festival-was-full-of-surprises-for-artists-fans-onlookers |title=Texas International Pop Festival was full of surprises for artists, fans, onlookers |author1=Michael E. Young |author2=Roy Appleton |date=August 30, 2009 |access-date=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's worked pretty well through my life," he says, "except with telephone operators – I have to say 'Gravy, first initial W.'"

Romney's [[clown]] persona resulted from his political activism. Frequently arrested at demonstrations, he decided he would be less likely to be arrested if he dressed as a clown, so he became a founding member of the Phurst Church of Phun, a secret society of comics and clowns dedicated to ending the Vietnam War through the use of political theater. "Clowns are safe," he said. Despite this, he also performs traditional clown activities such as jokes, magic tricks and entertaining children.

Wavy Gravy founded and co-founded several organizations, including [[Camp Winnarainbow]], the [[Seva Foundation]] and the [[Hog Farm]], an activist [[commune]]. He was also the official [[clown]] of the [[Grateful Dead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401051000/http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/explore/ady.cfm?day=18&amp;month=3&amp;year=2006 |title=Arts Days |archive-date=1 April 2007 |website=The Kennedy Center Arts Edge |url=http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/explore/ady.cfm?day=18&amp;month=3&amp;year=2006 |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has two radio shows on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]'s ''[[Jam On]]'' station.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/sirus-satellite-radio-personalities-2844372 |author=Corey Deitz |date=June 19, 2018 |title=Sirius XM Satellite Radio Personalities |website=Lifewire |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Romney was born in [[East Greenbush, New York]] on May 15, 1936. As a child, he took walks around the block with [[Albert Einstein]]. He attended [[Hall High School (Connecticut)|William Hall High School]] in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]]. In 1954, Romney volunteered for the military and was honorably discharged after 22 months in the [[United States Army]].
Under the [[G.I. Bill]], Romney entered [[Boston University]] Theater Department in 1957 and then attended the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] for the Theater in [[New York City]]. In 1958, he began reading poetry regularly at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. He eventually became the cafe's entertainment director, befriending musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Paxton]], and [[Dave Van Ronk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Web|last=Van Laarhoven|first=Kaspar|title=The Story of The Gaslight Cafe, Where Dylan Premiered 'A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall'|website=Bedford+Bowery|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|date=December 28, 2016|url=http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/12/the-story-of-the-gaslight-cafe-where-dylan-premiered-a-hard-rains-a-gonna-fall/|access-date=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His early career was managed by [[Lenny Bruce]] who brought Romney to California in 1962 where Romney did a live recording of ''Hugh Romney, [[Third Stream]] Humor'' as the opening act for [[Thelonious Monk]] at Club Renaissance in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Robin D.G. ''Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original'' Simon &amp; Schuster 2009 p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hog Farm===
The [[Hog Farm]] collective was established through a chain of events beginning with [[Ken Babbs]] hijacking the [[Merry Pranksters]]' bus, ''[[Further (bus)|Further]]'', to Mexico, which stranded the [[Merry Pranksters]] in Los Angeles. First Romney assembled a collective in [[North Hollywood]], visited by the likes of musicians such as [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] whom he managed, and [[Ravi Shankar]]. After moving to [[Sunland, Los Angeles|Sunland]], a suburb north of Los Angeles, he was evicted from his one-bedroom cabin when the landlord found out that a large group of assorted pranksters and musicians were staying there. Two hours later, a neighbor informed Romney that a nearby hog farm, owned by Claude Doty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zekley |first=Mickey |year=1995 |url=http://www.larkcamp.com/adventures1.html |title=The Hog Farm Blues |work=The Adventures Of A Street Musician – Part One}}&lt;/ref&gt; needed caretakers. Romney accepted the offer and worked the farm in exchange for rent. Local people, musicians, artists, and folks from other communes began staying at the mountain-top farm. In his book ''Something Good for a Change'', Gravy described this early period as a "bizarre communal experiment" where the "people began to outnumber the pigs".{{sfnp|Wavy Gravy|1992|p=229}}

Both Romney and his wife, [[Bonnie Beecher]], had jobs in Los Angeles. He worked for [[Columbia Pictures]] teaching improvisation skills to actors. Bonnie was a successful television actress, appearing in episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''.

By 1966, the Hog Farm had coalesced into an entertainment organization providing light shows at the [[Shrine Exposition Hall]] in Los Angeles for music artists like the Grateful Dead, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix. Beginning in 1967, the collective began traveling across the country in converted school buses purchased with  money earned as [[Extra (actor)|extras]] in [[Otto Preminger]]'s feature film ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968).

The Hog Farm relocated to Black Oak Ranch in northern California in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Black Oak Ranch History |url=http://katewolfmusicfestival.com/black-oak-ranch-history/ |website=Kate Wolf Music Festival |accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodstock Festival===
At the first [[Woodstock Festival]], Gravy and the Hog Farm collective accepted festival executive Stan Goldstein's offer to help with preparations.&lt;ref name="farmfriend"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wavy Gravy |title=The Hog Farm and Friends |publisher=Links Press |date=1974 |pages=72–74 |isbn=9780825630149 |location=New York |oclc=947606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravy called his group the "Please Force," a reference to their non-intrusive tactics at keeping order, e.g., "Please don't do that, please do this instead". When asked by the press&amp;nbsp;— who were the first to inform him that he and the rest of the Hog Farm were handling security&amp;nbsp;— what kind of tools he intended to use to maintain order at the event, his response was "Cream pies and [[Soda syphon|seltzer bottles]]"&lt;ref name="farmfriend"/&gt; (both being traditional clown props). In Gravy's words: "They all wrote it down and I thought, 'the power of manipulating the media', ah ha!" &lt;ref name=Yippie&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68, to 1984 | author=New Yippie Book Collective | isbn=9780912873008 |publisher=Bleecker Publishing|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravy has been the [[Master of Ceremonies]], and the only person to appear on the bill of all three Woodstock Festivals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Throughout the festival, Gravy made several announcements from the concert stage. He later wrote in his memoir that "the reason that I got do to all those stage announcements was because of my relationship with [[Chip Monck|Chip Monk]] [sic]. Chip built the stage at Woodstock."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |title=Something Good for a Change: Random Notes on Peace Thru Living |author=Wavy Gravy |date=1992 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=9780312078386 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=25367907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of the 20th Anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, he was interviewed — along with [[Ken Kesey]] — live on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' at the Bethel concert site, where he discussed his experience as the MC of the event.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Gravy's first appearance at an event in the [[Neo-Pagan]] community was at the WinterStar Symposium in 1998 with [[Paul Krassner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://murugabooker.com/ace.html |title=Expanding The Frontiers Of Your Consideration |dead-url=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075503/http://murugabooker.com/ace.html |archive-date=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}} He appeared there again in 2000 with [[Phyllis Curott]], where he joined Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] in a joint ritual of the [[Church of the SubGenius]] and his Church of the Cosmic Giggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

At the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]]'s psychedelic tribute to the 1960s "[[I Want To Take You Higher]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/exhibitpast/take-you-higher/ |title=The Psychedelic Era |publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905195019/http://www.rockhall.com/exhibitpast/take-you-higher/ |archive-date=2007-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravy's sleeping bag and tie-dyed false teeth were displayed. He and [[Paul Krassner]] appeared there on the last day of the exhibit on February 28, 1998.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Ventures==

===Camp Winnarainbow===
Gravy is also the co-founder, with his wife, of the circus and performing arts camp [[Camp Winnarainbow]], in  [[Laytonville, California]], near the Hog Farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campwinnarainbow.org/ |title=California overnight summer camp for kids and teens |website=Camp Winnarainbow |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2003, [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] produced an ice cream named "Wavy Gravy" (caramel-[[cashew]]-[[Brazil nut]] base with a chocolate hazelnut fudge swirl and roasted almonds) which helped drive a scholarship fund for underprivileged kids to attend Camp Winnarainbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/wavy_gravy.html |title=Wavy Gravy 1960's icon and activist |author=Dominick A.

===Artist===
Gravy has also been recognized for his work as a [[collage]] artist. He held a solo exhibition throughout April 1999, at the [[Firehouse Gallery]] under the direction of its owner [[Eric Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On the Towns; Going Out |author= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 April 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/04/nyregion/on-the-towns-going-out.html?pagewanted=4&amp;src=pm |accessdate=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to create larger works in collage for celebrities in the Bay Area of California. He began exploring collage in the early '60s even before becoming Wavy Gravy, his first works created while living above the Gaslight in Greenwich Village after being inspired by a [[Max Ernst]] collage he saw at the Bitter End when opening for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].

With hundreds of men being detained (women were held separately) in the "Hotel Diablo" – actually the old gymnasium at [[Cuesta College]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] – after arrests during the September 1981 [[Abalone Alliance]]-organized anti-nuclear protest, trespass/occupation and [[civil disobedience]] action at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]], Gravy organized and acted as MC for a variety show that he called the "Tornado of Talent" which featured, among other performers (and after the guards had allowed an acoustic guitar to be brought into the "jail"), [[Jackson Browne]]. Wavy arrived at the holding facility dressed in a pair of bright green coveralls.  After settling into his "bunk" (a thin mattress on the gym floor) he removed the coveralls to reveal a Santa Claus suit.

=== Nobody's Business/Nobody for President ===
Gravy established the store Nobody's Business across the road from the Hog Farm,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jonathan. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/still-hippy-after-all-these-years-395296.html "Still hippy after all these years"] ''Independent'' UK, October 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; reminiscent of his "Nobody for President" campaign — as in: "Who's in Washington right now working to make the world a safer place? Nobody!"; "Nobody's Perfect"; "Nobody Keeps All Promises"; "Nobody Should Have That Much Power"; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobodyforpresident.org/|title=Nobody for President, 2020 [Official Pages]|website=www.nobodyforpresident.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joke had previously been used in the 1932 short film ''[[Betty Boop for President]]''.

The "Nobody for President" campaign held a rally across from the [[White House]] on November 4, 1980 that included [[Yippies]] and a few [[anarchist]]s to promote the option of "none of the above"  choice on the ballot. &lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.headcount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nobody-for-President.jpg PHOTO: Nobody For President, Curtis Spangler and Wavy Gravy, October 12, 1976] (photo credit: James Stark) ''HeadCount.org''&lt;/ref&gt;After criticizing [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[John B. Anderson]], the committee offered the "perfect" candidate:&amp;nbsp;Nobody. "Nobody makes apple pie better than Mom. And Nobody will love you when you're down and out," Gravy told a crowd of 50 onlookers at the rally.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' "Anarchists Push Cause of 'None of the above'" November 5, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/2061/article/271/20th.anniversary.rendezvous.-.wavy.gravy|author=Wavy Gravy|title=20th Anniversary Rendezvous - Wavy Gravy|publisher=Whole Earth Review|website=WholeEarth.com|date=Winter 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romney has stated that he has no familial relationship with the [[Romney family]] of American politics, which includes [[George W. Romney|George W.]] and [[Mitt Romney]].

===Origin of name Wavy Gravy===
Two weeks after Woodstock, at the 1969 [[Texas International Pop Festival]] Romney was lying onstage, exhausted after spending hours trying to get festival-goers to put their clothes back on,&lt;ref name="Dallasnews"/&gt; when it was announced that [[B.B. King]] was going to play. Romney began to get up; a hand appeared on his shoulder. It was B.B. King, who asked, "Are you wavy gravy?" to which Romney replied "Yes." "It's OK; I can work around you," &lt;ref&gt;Interview {{who|date=July 2011}} on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', 26 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; said B.B. King, and he and [[Johnny Winter]] proceeded to jam for hours after that. Romney said he considered this a mystical event, and assumed Wavy Gravy as his legal name.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavygravy.net/bio/biography.html|title=About - Wavy Gravy|website=wavygravy.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3257">'''William Holme Twentyman''' (31 October 1802 – 7 May 1884) was a [[silversmith]] in [[Cape Town]], who amassed a considerable fortune on [[Mauritius]] and retired at the age of 39. Whilst on Mauritius he created a sealed case for a pocket watch to be worn under water. After trials soldered lugs were incorporated and a "strong canvas" band was tied to the wrist for ease of use. Twentyman also painted the dial orange as to be more clearly seen underwater. This creation was known as the Twentyman "orange gorilla" due to its large size.

==Life==
William Holme Twentyman was born in [[Liverpool]], the son of John Middleton Twentyman (a [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] and trader) and Phoebe Holme.  In 1818 he went to the Cape with his elder brother [[Lawrence Holme Twentyman]] (a [[silversmith]] and [[watchmaker]]), after they inherited money from a great uncle.  The brothers arrived in Cape Town on 12 June 1818 on the ''Ann''.  William was apprenticed to Lawrence as a silversmith and watchmaker, and later became a partner in Twentyman &amp; Co, running his own shop next door to that of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Mauritian Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828 he moved to Mauritius, arriving on the ''Winscales'' on 19 January 1829, where he ran a business as a watch seller and jeweler in [[Port Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Mauritian Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 1832 at the Anglican Church of Port Louis he married Celia Pinch, daughter of [[John Pinch the elder]] an architect in [[Bath, Somerset]].  During June/July 1832 he was caught up in the slave rebellion on Mauritius with his shop coming under siege.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Events at Mauritius, by John Jeremie, John Reddie, Published by Hatchard, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1841 William had amassed a considerable fortune and, with his family, had returned to England, residing at 21 Avenue Road, [[Regent's Park]], London.&lt;ref&gt;London PO Directory, 1841&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yehudit Simhonit''' (sometimes '''Simhoni''';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Her actual surname is "Simhoni"; however it was customary for Russian speakers to add a "t" ({{lang-he|"ת"}}) suffix to surnames of women&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he|יהודית שמחונית}}; 24 January 1902 - 5 December 1991) was a Zionist activist and politician.

==Biography==
Simhonit was born in [[Nahar-Tov]], an agricultural settlement in the [[Kherson Oblast]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Ukraine]]), and attended an agricultural high school. In 1917 she joined the Zionist Student Youth Federation.

In 1921 she and her husband Mordechai Simhoni made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]], and settled in [[Nahalal]], the newly established first [[moshav]]. In 1927 she became a member of the Union of Women Workers. She moved to kibbutz [[Tel Yosef]] in 1931, and moved again to [[Geva]] in 1943. A member of [[Mapai]], she represented the party in the fourth [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]].

In 1949 she was [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|elected]] to the first Knesset on the Mapai list. However, she resigned from the Knesset on 5 February 1951 and was replaced by [[Herzl Berger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexByKnesset_eng.asp?knesset=1 Knesset Members in the First Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

She later worked as a member of the [[Histadrut]]'s co-ordinating committee and chief cultural and welfare officer of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]'s [[Women's Affairs advisor|Women's Corps]]. Between 1960 and 1965 she served as head of the Histadrut's International Relations Department.

In 1965 she left Mapai and was a founding member of [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s new [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] party, and was amongst its leadership until the party was dissolved in 1968. She died in 1991.

Her son, Major General [[Asaf Simhoni]], was killed in a plane crash at the end of the [[Sinai War]]. Her grandson, Avner Simhoni, was killed in 1968 when a mine exploded in the [[Gulf of Suez]] during the military operations in the [[War of Attrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=סמל שמחוני, אבנר|url=http://www.izkor.gov.il/HalalKorot.aspx?id=92261|publisher=Izkor; The State of Israel, [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
