The '''Academia de Genealogía y Heráldica Mota-Padilla''' (''Academy of Genealogy and Heraldry Mota-Padilla'') was a cultural institution based in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], the second largest city in [[Mexico]]. According with an article published in the ''Genealogical Journal'' (1971), this institution was the first genealogical association in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;"Genealogical Journal", Utah Genealogical Association, Vol. 15-17, 1971, pp. 160-170&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was established on 12 January 1920 by [[Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad]] (1855–1923);&lt;ref name="Somos Primos"&gt;http://www.somosprimos.com/sp2004/spnov04/spnov04.htm&lt;/ref&gt; it was erected in memory of the first Historian of the former Kingdom of [[Nueva Galicia]] (New Galicia) in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], [[w:es:Matías Angel de la Mota Padilla|Matías Angel de la Mota Padilla]] (1688–1766), author of ''Historia de la Conquista del Reino de la Nueva Galicia'' (1741);&lt;ref&gt;http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5590915&lt;/ref&gt; among its members, the very same [[Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad]] was a direct descendant of the after mentioned author.&lt;ref name="Somos Primos" /&gt; 
This institution was privately funded and led by enthusiasts of the Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences whose main purpose was to promote the creation of a study about the history of the municipality of [[Unión de Tula]], [[Jalisco]], with a genealogical and heraldic research of the four founding families of that place, which were the Topete, the Villaseñor, the Lazcano and the Arriola families (the name of the place was originated through their initials: ''T'' ''V'' ''L'' ''A'').&lt;ref name="Family search"&gt;https://wiki.familysearch.org/es/M%C3%A9xico:_Asociaciones&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of time, the Academia's objectives went beyond the original idea, promoting any kind of Genealogical and Heraldic studies, then, more enthusiasts became members of this institution. They gathered monthly and produced some interesting works, like those published by journalist [[Alberto Santoscoy]] or by historian [[José R. Benítez]]; unfortunately, some of those papers are still unpublished.&lt;ref name="Family search" /&gt;

===Founding members===
The founding members were five: [[Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad]] (1855–1923), [[José Ignacio Dávila Garibi]] (1888–1981), [[Jorge Verea y Vallarta]] (1877–1958), [[Enrique Eduardo López Maldonado]] († 1938), and [[Alberto Santoscoy]] (1857–1906).&lt;ref name="Family search" /&gt;

[[File:Houghton MS Gr 20 - Theogeny, 10.jpg|thumb|A [[Greece|Greek]] manuscript of the beginning of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'']]

'''Ancient Greek literature''' refers to [[literature]] written in the [[Ancient Greek]] language from the earliest texts until the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], are the two epic poems ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'', set in the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean era]]. These two epics, along with the [[Homeric Hymns]] and the two poems of [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' and ''[[Works and Days]]'', comprised the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the [[Classical Greece|Classical]], [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]], and [[Roman Greece|Roman periods]].

The lyric poets [[Sappho]], [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], and [[Pindar]] were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. [[Aeschylus]] is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. [[Sophocles]] is famous for his tragedies about [[Oedipus]], particularly ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' and ''[[Antigone]]''. [[Euripides]] is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright [[Aristophanes]] wrote in the genre of [[Old Comedy]], while the later playwright [[Menander]] was an early pioneer of [[New Comedy]]. The historians [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] and [[Thucydides]], who both lived during the fifth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher [[Plato]] wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher [[Socrates]], dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student [[Aristotle]] wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential.

Important later writers included [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who wrote ''[[Argonautica|The Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyage of the [[Argonauts]]; [[Archimedes]], who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and [[Plutarch]], who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer [[Lucian of Samosata]] was a Hellenized Syrian, who wrote primarily works of [[satire]]. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later [[Greek literature]] and also [[western literature]] at large. In particular, many [[Roman literature|ancient Roman authors]] drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the [[Renaissance]], European authors in general, including [[Dante Alighieri]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], and [[James Joyce]], have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs.

This period of Greek literature stretches from [[Homer]] until the fourth century BC and the rise of [[Alexander the Great]]. The earliest known Greek writings are [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean]], written in the [[Linear B]] syllabary on clay tablets. These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc.); no real literature has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|title=The Decipherment of Linear B|date=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=978-1-107-69176-6|page=101|edition=Second}} "The glimpse we have suddenly been given of the account books of a long-forgotten people..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentrisChadwick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ventris|first1=Michael|last2=Chadwick|first2=John|title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek|date=1956|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=978-1-107-50341-0|page=xxix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkgPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR29&amp;dq=Why+have+no+works+of+Linear+B+literature+survived?&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9aTMzN3ZAhUux1kKHcEsAvsQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Why%20have%20no%20works%20of%20Linear%20B%20literature%20survived%3F&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], the original decipherers of Linear B, state that literature almost certainly existed in [[Mycenaean Greece]],&lt;ref name="VentrisChadwick"/&gt; but it was either not written down or, if it was, it was on parchment or wooden tablets, which did not survive the [[Late Bronze Age collapse#Greece|destruction of the Mycenaean palaces in the twelfth century BC]].&lt;ref name="VentrisChadwick"/&gt;

Greek literature was divided in well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialect]] and metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Heath, Malcolm|title=Aristotle's ''Poetics''|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1997|isbn=0-14-044636-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry there were three super-genres: epic, lyric and drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grendler, Paul F|title=The Universities of the Italian Renaissance|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8018-8055-6|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyric and drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four ([[Elegiac|elegiac]], [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]], [[monodic|monodic lyric]] and [[choral lyric]]); drama in three ([[Greek tragedy|tragedy]], [[Greek comedy|comedy]] and [[Pastoral drama|pastoral]] drama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frow|first=John|title=Genre|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28063-1|pages=57–59|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prose literature can largely be said to begin with [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name="Engels"&gt;{{cite book|last=Engels|first=Johannes|date=2008|chapter=Chapter Ten: Universal History and Cultural Geography of the ''Oikoumene'' in Herodotus' ''Historiai'' and Strabo's ''Geographika''|title=The Children of Herodotus: Greek and Roman Historiography and Related Genres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j5vzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=genres+of+prose+literature+in+ancient+Greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnvoCQnNHZAhUoneAKHboWAAEQ6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=genres%20of%20prose%20literature%20in%20ancient%20Greece&amp;f=false|editor-last=Pigoń|editor-first=Jakub|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, England|publisher=Cambridge Scholar Publishing|page=146|isbn=978-1-4438-0015-0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, several genres of prose literature developed,&lt;ref name="Engels"/&gt; but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred.&lt;ref name="Engels"/&gt;

=== Epic poetry ===

=== Lyric poetry ===

{{Main article|Greek lyric}}
[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, RA, OM - Sappho and Alcaeus - Walters 37159.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A nineteenth-century painting by the English painter [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] depicting the poetess [[Sappho]] gazing on in admiration as the poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] plays the [[lyre]]]]

[[Lyric poetry]] received its name from the fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the instrument called the [[lyre]]. Despite the name, however, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by [[cithara]], but by flute. These two latter genres were [[elegiac poetry]] and [[iambus (genre)|iambic poetry]]. Both were written in the [[Ionic dialect]]. Elegiac poems were written in [[elegiac couplets]] and iambic poems were written in [[iambic trimeter]]. The first of the lyric poets was probably [[Archilochus of Paros]], circa 700 BC, the most important iambic poet.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;J. P. Barron and P. E. Easterling, 'Elegy and Iambus', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered adventurer who led a very turbulent life.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982) page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Many lyric poems were written in the [[Aeolic Dialect]]. Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters. The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called "[[Nine Lyric Poets]]."&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Edmonds - [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdLGSRQvDYMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lyra Graeca (p.3)] Wildside Press LLC, 2007 {{ISBN|1-4344-9130-7}} [Retrieved 2015-05-06]&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the lyric poets, [[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]] (c. 630-c. 570 BC) was by far the most widely revered. In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, Judith P. (1979). "Sappho and her Social Context: Sense and Sensuality". ''Signs''. 4 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of her poems, "[[Ode to Aphrodite]]," has survived to the present day in its original, completed form.&lt;ref&gt;Rayor, Diane; Lardinois, André (2014). ''Sappho: A New Edition of the Complete Works''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-107-02359-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Sappho, her contemporary [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] of [[Lesbos]] was also notable for [[monodic]] lyric poetry. The poetry written by [[Alcman]] was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]], which was normally considered unpleasant to hear.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 3.15.2 {{lang|grc|Ἀλκμᾶνι ποιήσαντι ἄισματα οὐδὲν ἐς ἡδονὴν αὐτῶν ἐλυμήνατο τῶν Λακῶνων ἡ γλῶσσα ἥκιστα παρεχομένη τὸ εὔφωνον}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The later poet [[Pindar]] of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] was renowned for his [[choral]] lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;M. Davies's "Monody, Choral Lyric, and the Tyranny of the Hand-Book" in ''Classical Quarterly'', NS&amp;nbsp;38 (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;52&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age that followed the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the awakened national spirit of [[Athens]] was expressed in hundreds of tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god [[Dionysus]]. In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth. Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens. The poets competed for the prizes offered for the best plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|pages=284–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All fully surviving Greek tragedies are conventionally attributed to [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] or [[Euripides]]. The authorship of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus,&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Mark. ''The Authenticity of the Prometheus Bound''. Cambridge, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]'', which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are still questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, J. Michael, ''Euripides Our Contemporary'', University of California Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-520-26179-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus. Three of these plays, ''Agamemnon'', ''The Libation-Bearers'', and ''The Eumenides'', form a trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth (1952). "Form and Persecution in the Oresteia". The Sewanee Review. 60 (3: July – September): 377–396. {{JSTOR|27538150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these plays, ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', however, may actually be the work of Aeschylus's son [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]].&lt;ref&gt;West, M.L. Studies in Aeschylus. Stuttgart, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven works of Sophocles have survived, the most acclaimed of which are the [[Sophocles#Theban plays|three Theban plays]], which center around the story of [[Oedipus]] and his offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Suda (ed. Finkel et al.): s.v. Σοφοκλῆς.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theban Trilogy consists of ''[[Oedipus the King]]'', ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', and ''[[Antigone]]''. Although the plays are often called a "trilogy," they were actually written many years apart. ''Antigone'', the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Fagles| first = Robert| authorlink = | title = The Three Theban Plays | publisher = Penguin | year = 1986 | location = New York | page = 35 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oedipus the King'', the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles's career.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Although Sophocles won second prize with the group of plays that included ''Oedipus Rex'', its date of production is uncertain. The prominence of the Theban [[Plague (disease)|plague]] at the play's opening suggests to many scholars a reference to the plague that devastated Athens in 430 BC, and hence a production date shortly thereafter. See, for example, {{cite journal|authorlink=Bernard Knox|first=Bernard|last=Knox|title=The Date of the ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' of Sophocles|journal=[[American Journal of Philology]]|volume=77|issue=2|year=1956|pages=133–147|jstor=292475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oedipus at Colonus'', the second of the three plays chronologically, was actually Sophocles's last play and was performed in 401 BC, after Sophocles's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pomeroy |first=Sarah |first2=Stanley |last2=Burstein |first3=Walter |last3=Donlan |first4=Jennifer |last4=Roberts |title=Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |page=322 |isbn=0-19-509742-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nineteen surviving plays attributed to [[Euripides]]. The most well-known of these plays are ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', and ''[[Bacchae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;B.

Knox. "Euripides" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 339&lt;/ref&gt; His play ''[[Alcestis]]'', for instance, has often been categorized as a "[[problem play]]" or perhaps even as a work of [[tragicomedy]] rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

[[File:Lysistrata.jpg|thumb|225px|Illustration for [[Aristophanes]]'s ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1896)]]

Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of [[Dionysus]], but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At [[Athens]], the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes: Clouds K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page X.&lt;/ref&gt; These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', he ridicules [[Athenian democracy]]. In ''[[The Clouds]]'', he attacks the philosopher [[Socrates]]. In ''[[Lysistrata]]'', he denounces war.&lt;ref&gt;David Barrett's edition ''Aristophanes: the Frogs and Other Plays'' (Penguin Classics, 1964), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. [[John Lemprière]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca Classica]]'' describes him as, quite simply, "the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side [[Molière]] seems dull and [[Shakespeare]] clownish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roche|first1=Paul|title=Aristophanes: The Complete Plays: A New Translation by Paul Roche|date=2005|publisher=New American Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-451-21409-6|pages=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is ''[[The Frogs]]'', which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed for the first time at the [[Lenaia Festival]] in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roche|first1=Paul|title=Aristophanes: The Complete Plays: A New Translation by Paul Roche|date=2005|publisher=New American Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-451-21409-6|pages=537–540}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only Greek play that was ever given an [[encore]] performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, ''The Frogs'' still appeals to modern audiences.

=== Historiography ===
[[File:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|thumb|A second century AD Roman copy of a Greek [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Herodotus from the first half of the fourth century BC]]

Two notable historians who lived during the Classical Era were [[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] and [[Thucydides]]. Herodotus is commonly called "The Father of History."&lt;ref&gt;T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence. Thucydides's book ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' greatly influenced later writers and historians, including the author of the book of [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Byzantine Era]] historian [[Procopius]] of [[Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;''Procopius'', John Moorhead, ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing: M–Z'', Vol. II, Kelly Boyd, (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999), 962&lt;/ref&gt;

A third historian of ancient Greece, [[Xenophon]] of [[Athens]], began his ''[[Hellenica]]''  where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' 7.5.27; Xenophon. ''Xenophontis opera omnia'', vol. 1. Oxford, Clarendon Press. 1900, repr. 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon's most famous work is his book ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|The Anabasis]]'', a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne. Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher [[Socrates]]: ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|The Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|The Symposium]]'', and ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]''. Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different. Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Danzig, Gabriel. 2003.

=== Philosophy ===

Many important and influential philosophers lived during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called "[[Milesian school|Milesian philosophers]]": [[Thales of Miletus]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven and M. Schofield, ''The Presocratic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983, 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these philosophers' writings, however, only one fragment from Anaximander preserved by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] has survived.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Comments on Aristotle's Physics'' (24, 13):

: "{{lang|grc|Ἀναξίμανδρος [...] λέγει δ' αὐτὴν μήτε ὕδωρ μήτε ἄλλο τι τῶν καλουμένων εἶναι στοιχείων, ἀλλ' ἑτέραν τινὰ φύσιν ἄπειρον, ἐξ ἧς ἅπαντας γίνεσθαι τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς κόσμους· ἐξ ὧν δὲ ἡ γένεσίς ἐστι τοῖς οὖσι, καὶ τὴν φθορὰν εἰς ταῦτα γίνεσθαι κατὰ τὸ χρεών· διδόναι γὰρ αὐτὰ δίκην καὶ τίσιν ἀλλήλοις τῆς ἀδικίας κατὰ τὴν τοῦ χρόνου τάξιν, ποιητικωτέροις οὕτως ὀνόμασιν αὐτὰ λέγων. δῆλον δὲ ὅτι τὴν εἰς ἄλληλα μεταβολὴν τῶν τεττάρων στοιχείων οὗτος θεασάμενος οὐκ ἠξίωσεν ἕν τι τούτων ὑποκείμενον ποιῆσαι, ἀλλά τι ἄλλο παρὰ ταῦτα· οὗτος δὲ οὐκ ἀλλοιουμένου τοῦ στοιχείου τὴν γένεσιν ποιεῖ, ἀλλ' ἀποκρινομένων τῶν ἐναντίων διὰ τῆς αἰδίου κινήσεως.}}"

In [[ancient Greek]], quotes usually blend with surrounding text. Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, but Anaximander's writing, in "somewhat poetic terms" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curd, Patricia, ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known for certain about the life of the philosopher [[Pythagoras of Samos]] and no writings by him have survived to the present day,&lt;ref&gt;{{DGRBM|inline=1|title=Pythagoras |https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/616/mode/1up |pages=616–625}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an impressive corpus of poetic writings written by his pupil [[Empedocles of Acragas]] has survived, making Empedocles one of the most widely attested [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Trépanier, (2004), ''Empedocles: An Interpretation'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of fragments written by the philosophers [[Heraclitus of Ephesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles H. |title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus. An Edition of the Fragments with Translation and Commentary |year=1979 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-21883-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Democritus of Abdera]] have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berryman|first1=Sylvia|title=Democritus|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the classical philosophers, however, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] are generally considered the most important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early [[socratic dialogue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kofman |first=Sarah |title=Socrates: Fictions of a Philosopher |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3551-X |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhUg7xHDggIC&amp;dq=Martin+Cohen%2C+Philosophical+Tales&amp;q=an+idol#v=snippet&amp;q=an%20idol&amp;f=false ''Philosophical Tales: Being an Alternative History Revealing the Characters, the Plots, and the Hidden Scenes that Make Up the True Story of Philosophy''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 5, {{ISBN|1-4051-4037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the [[Socratic problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Rubel |first2=M. |last2=Vickers |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SmJ_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 147] |title=Fear and Loathing in Ancient Athens: Religion and Politics During the Peloponnesian War |publisher=Routledge |date=11 September 2014 |isbn=1-317-54480-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis-André Dorion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorion |first=Louis-André |url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/companions/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511780257&amp;cid=CBO9780511780257A004 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Socratic Problem (pp. 1–23) (The Cambridge Companion to Socrates) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-83342-4 |accessdate=2015-05-07 |doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521833424.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals. Some of the best-known of these include: ''[[The Apology of Socrates]]'', a purported record of the speech Socrates gave at his trial;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 1, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua01plat#page/16/mode/2up p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Phaedo]]'', a description of the last conversation between Socrates and his disciples before his execution;&lt;ref name="Ancient name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-soul/#3.2 |author=Lorenz, Hendrik|title=Ancient Theories of Soul |accessdate=2013-12-10 |date=22 April 2009 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Symposium (Plato)|The Symposium]]'', a dialogue over the nature of [[love]];&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;Plato, The Symposium.

Aristotle of Stagira is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential philosophical thinkers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Magee |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Magee |title=The Story of Philosophy |date=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first sentence of his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' reads: "All men by nature desire to know." He has, therefore, been called the "Father of those who know." His medieval disciple [[Thomas Aquinas]] referred to him simply as "the Philosopher". Aristotle was a student at Plato's [[Academy]], and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations. However, none of these exist today. The body of writings that has come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]].&lt;ref name="iep-lyceum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lyceum/ |title=The Lyceum |last=Morison |first=William |year=2006 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. Among Aristotle's most notable works are ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'', and ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Philosophers: Aristotle (384-322 BCE)|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle.html|website=Great Philosophers|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athens lost its preeminent status as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bury|first1=J. B.|title=A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great|date=1937|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|pages=724–821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world. In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of [[Christian]] thought. The [[Musaeum]], or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by [[Ptolemy I]]. The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library.&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 Μουσείον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek.

The Alexandrian poet [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] is best known for his epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]'', which narrates the adventures of [[Jason]] and his shipmates the [[Argonauts]] on their quest to retrieve the [[Golden Fleece]] from the land of [[Colchis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Susan|last=Stephens|title=Brill's Companion to Apollonius Rhodius; Second|edition=Revised|editor=T.

During the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[Old Comedy]] of the Classical Era was replaced by [[New Comedy]]. The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright [[Menander]]. None of Menander's plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, ''[[Dyskolos|The Bad-Tempered Man]]'', has survived to the present day in a near-complete form. Large portions of another play entitled ''[[Samia (play)|The Girl from Samos]]'' have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;Konstan, David (2010). ''Menander of Athens''.

''Timaeus of Tauromenium and Hellenistic Historiography''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''History'', though lost, is significant because of its influence on [[Polybius]]. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work. Timaeus also wrote the ''Olympionikai'', a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Truesdell S. (1958). Timaeus of Tauromenium.

=== Science and mathematics ===

[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1906, [[Archimedes Palimpsest|The Archimedes Palimpsest]] revealed works by [[Archimedes]] previously thought to have been lost.]]

[[Eratosthenes of Alexandria]] ({{circa}} 276 BC – {{circa}} 195/194 BC), wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference. Much that was written by the mathematicians [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]] has been preserved. Euclid is known for his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', much of which was drawn from his predecessor [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The ''Elements'' is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present. Among them are ''[[Measurement of the Circle]]'', in which he worked out the value of pi; ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', on his work in mechanics; ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''; and ''On Floating Bodies''. A [[Archimedes Palimpsest|manuscript of his works]] is currently being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/gen/com/images/technical%20summary_final.pdf |title=X-Ray Fluorescence Imaging of the Archimedes Palimpsest: A Technical Summary |first=Uwe |last=Bergmann |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prose fiction ===

Very little has survived of prose fiction from the Hellenistic Era. ''The Milesiaka'' by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC. ''The Milesiaka'' itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived. The book established a whole new genre of so-called "[[Milesian tales]]," of which ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by the later Roman writer [[Apuleius]] is a prime example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=P.G.|title=Lucius Madaurensis|journal=Phoenix|date=1968|volume=22|issue=2|pages=1–15|doi=10.2307/1086837|jstor=1086837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apuleius Madaurensis|first1=Lucius|last2=trans.

== Roman period ==
{{further|Roman Greece}}
While the transition from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifting the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the [[diadochi|Successors]] (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule. Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well. A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The [[New Testament]], written by various authors in varying qualities of [[Koine Greek]] also hails from this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance | last=Metzger | first=Bruce M. | year=1987 | pages=295–296 | isbn=0-19-826180-2 | url=http://ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601181717/http://www.ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkyns2016/&gt;{{rp|208-209}} the most important works being the [[Gospels]] and the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Saint Paul]].&lt;ref name="Trobisch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trobisch|first=David|title=Paul's Letter Collection: Tracing the Origins|year=1994|isbn=0-8006-2597-8|pages=1–27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkyns2016/&gt;{{rp|208-213}}

[[File:Plutarch of Chaeronea-03.jpg|thumb|A bust of [[Plutarch]], one of the most famous ancient Greek historians, from his hometown of [[Chaeronea]]]]

The historian [[Polybius]] was born about 200 BC. He was brought to [[Rome]] as a hostage in 168. In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of [[Carthage]] in 146.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0144:book=39:chapter=35&amp;highlight=lycortas|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 39, chapter 35|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diodorus Siculus]] was a Greek historian who lived in the 1st century BC, around the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a [[universal history]], ''[[Bibliotheca Historica]]'', in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Kenneth S. (1990).

His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched.

Arrian served in the Roman army. His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life. Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the ''Diatribai'', based on the teachings of his mentor [[Epictetus]].

Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]], who died about AD 119. His ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published. His other surviving work is the ''[[Moralia]]'', a collection of essays on ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics.&lt;ref&gt;"Plutarch".

The scientist of the Roman period who had the greatest influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer [[Ptolemy]].

=== Philosophy ===
[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|left|Head of [[Plotinus]], a major philosopher from the Roman Era]]
[[Epictetus]] ({{circa}} 55 AD – 135 AD) was associated with the moral philosophy of the [[Stoics]]. His teachings were collected by his pupil Arrian in the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' and the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Encheiridion]]'' (Manual of Study).&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laertius]], who lived in the third century AD, wrote ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', a voluminous collection of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher who ever lived. Unfortunately, Diogenes Laertius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor-first=Herbert S. |contributor-last=Long |contribution=Introduction |page=xvi |year=1972 |edition=reprint |first=Diogenes |last=Laërtius |title=Lives of Eminent Philosophers |volume=1 |publisher=Loeb Classical Library |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;"Diogenes Laërtius", ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of [[Epicurus]], for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LotEP|year=1925c|chapter=Epicurus|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major philosopher of his period was [[Plotinus]]. He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Enneads]]'' had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', München 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen.''&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus's philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of ''[[nous]]'', ''[[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|psyche]]'', and the "[[Henology|One]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Plotinus?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3237626.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians. The second-century Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]], who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially [[Platonism]].&lt;ref name=NSH_284&gt;New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge 3rd ed. 1914.

[[File:Gillis Backereel - Hero mourns the dead Leander.jpg|thumb|250px|''Hero Mourns the Dead Leander'' by [[Gillis Backereel]] (1640s)]]

Ancient Greek literature has had an enormous impact on [[western literature]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Western literature"&gt;{{cite web|title=Western literature|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-literature|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature. These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics.&lt;ref name="Western literature"/&gt; Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later [[Greek literature]]. For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work ''[[Hero and Leander]]'', written by [[Musaeus Grammaticus]].&lt;ref&gt;English translations of Musaeus Grammaticus' ''Hero and Leander: The Divine Poem of Musaeus: First of All Books Translated According to the Original'' (George Chapman, 1616); Hero &amp; Leander (E.E. Sikes, 1920)&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works. The Roman poet [[Vergil]], for instance, modeled his epic poem ''[[The Aeneid]]'' on ''The Iliad'' and ''The Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Epic: Homer and Virgil |last=Jenkyns |first=Richard |year=2007 |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |isbn=1-85399-133-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k0cXAQAAIAAJ |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], ancient Greek literature was largely forgotten in Western Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6563">'''Annette Jocelyn Otway-Ruthven''' (7 November 1909 – 18 March 1989) was an Irish [[historian]] specialising in [[History of Ireland (800–1169)|medieval Irish history]], and was among the earliest female academics appointed in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Otway-Ruthven, Jocelyn (1909–1989) - Dictionary definition of Otway-Ruthven, Jocelyn (1909–1989) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |journal=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/otway-ruthven-jocelyn-1909-1989 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
[[File:Professor Annette Jocelyn Otway-Ruthven (1909-89).jpg|thumb|A.J.Otway-Ruthven (1909-1989) was appointed Lecky Professor of History in Trinity College Dublin in 1951 and was one of the first female Fellows.]]
Otway-Ruthven was the daughter of Captain Robert Mervyn Bermingham Otway-Ruthven (1867–1919), Royal Artillery, of [[Castle Otway]], Co. Tipperary, and Margaret Casement (d. 1953), of Cronroe, Co. Wicklow. She had three sisters and a brother; two of her sisters died young. Through her mother Otway-Ruthven was related to [[Roger Casement]].

==Academic career==
Otway-Ruthven studied history in [[Trinity College, Dublin]], was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] of the College in 1928, and graduated BA in 1931. She continued her studies at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], [[University of Cambridge]], writing ''The king's secretary and the signet office in the XV century''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The king's secretary and the signet office in the XV century|last=Otway-Ruthven|first=Annette Jocelyn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she was awarded a PhD. 

She returned to Trinity College in 1938 as lecturer in medieval and modern history and in economic history; she succeeded [[Constantia Maxwell]] as [[Lecky Professor of History|Lecky professor]] in 1951. From 1965 she headed a new department of medieval history which, under her direction, became one of the finest departments in the College. In 1968 TCD made her one of its first female Fellows. The position of female academics in Trinity College when Otway-Ruthven was appointed in 1938, had barely improved since the first appointment of a woman, Constantia Maxwell, in 1909. Otway-Ruthven resented this discrimination: 'We were paid less than men doing the equivalent work, and I have been told that this was right since … we were less useful to the College.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otway-Ruthven|first=Annette Jocelyn|date=1977|title=Women in College 1927-77|journal=Trinity Trust News|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A former student, [[James Lydon (historian)|James Lydon]] (1928-2013), who later became a colleague of Otway-Ruthven at Trinity, said of her that ‘her contribution to Irish history ... will never be surpassed.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lydon|first=James|date=1980|title=Professor A.J.Otway-Ruthven|url=|journal=Trinity Trust News|volume=5, 2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydon also noted her kindness to students who were in difficulties. One of her most distinguished students was [[F. S. L. Lyons|F.S.L. Lyons]], who later became [[Provost (education)|provost]] of Trinity.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Select publications==
Otway-Ruthven's area of particular interest was Ireland in the [[twelfth century]] and the impact on the country of the [[Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland|arrival of the Anglo-Normans]]. She published extensively and her monograph ''A history of medieval Ireland'', was a landmark in Irish historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of medieval Ireland|last=Otway-Ruthven|first=Annette Jocelyn|publisher=Benn|year=1980|isbn=0510278000|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She translated the Cambridgeshire [[Domesday Book]] in 1941 and the ''Liber Primus Kilkenniensis''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otway-Ruthven|first=Annette Jocelyn|date=1961|title=Liber primus Kilkenniensis|url=|journal=Kilkenny Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she published [[Dowdall]] deeds with Charles McNeill in 1960 and brought a calendar of the Talbot de Malahide papers close to completion.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Otway-Ruthven also engaged in a project to reconstruct, from transcripts in London, Irish chancery rolls which had been lost in the destruction of the [[Public Record Office of Ireland]] in the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1922. Her work in this regard was acknowledged when the project was brought to completion in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chancery.tcd.ie/|title=Welcome To CIRCLE - CIRCLE|website=chancery.tcd.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
She was appointed to the [[Irish Manuscripts Commission]] in 1943 and was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society|FRHS]] in 1941 and [[Member of the Royal Irish Academy|MRIA]] in 1951. She was a member of the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions.

== Personal and later life ==
Otway-Ruthven was an amateur [[botanist]], raising rare plants in her garden at [[Rathgar]], and was also proficient in [[needlework]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|last=McGuire|first=James|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her retirement in 1980 she was incapacitated by a severe [[stroke]] which left her paralysed and near-speechless. The rest of her life was spent in a nursing home, where she died on 18 March 1989. Her papers are deposited in Trinity College, and the College has a portrait of her by the artist [[Derek Hill (painter)|Derek Hill]]. The College is also home to the Castle-Otway Harp, an eighteenth-century Irish musical instrument which, although it has no known association with the family, was in [[Castle Otway]] from the mid nineteenth century.

'''Arthur Roy Mitchell''' (December 18, 1889&amp;ndash; November 1977) &lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]]  [[artist]] and [[historian]] who was born on his father's [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] west of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] in [[Las Animas County, Colorado|Las Animas County]] in southern [[Colorado]].
 
Usually known as "Mitch," Mitchell in 1907 began work as a [[ranch]] hand in [[New Mexico]]. Soon, he was sketching scenes of [[cowboy]] and [[Western (genre)|western]] life and drawing political cartoons for [[newspaper]]s. After [[United States Army]] service in [[World War I]], he traveled to [[New York City]], where he studied at [[Grand Central School of Art]] under [[Harvey Dunn]]. By 1940, he had created more than 160 cover paintings for Western [[pulp magazine]]s.&lt;ref name=santafe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafetrailscenicandhistoricbyway.org/mitch.html|title=A.R. Mitchell Museum|publisher=santafetrailscenicandhistoricbyway.org|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers, Mitchell continued to paint in the [[American Southwest]] and often invited his mentor Dunn to come to Colorado to sketch the landscapes.&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armitchell.org/MitchBio.htm |title=Arthur Roy Mitchell Biography |publisher=armitchell.org |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014030/http://www.armitchell.org/MitchBio.htm |archivedate=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1944, Mitchell returned to Trinidad and launched the first art class at [[Trinidad State Junior College]], where he remained on the faculty until 1958. In 1959, he designed the official "Rush to the Rockies" emblem commemorating the 1859 [[Colorado gold rush]] centered about [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name=santafe/&gt; He also sought to preserve and restore historic Trinidad buildings, including the Baca House, the home of the founder of Trinidad, the Bloom Mansion, and the Pioneer Museum. He was the curator for the Trinidad Historic District until 1975.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; 
 
In 1972, he was named an honorary member of Cowboy Artists of America. In 1973, he was one of twenty-four academics entered into the National Academy of Western Artists. In 1974, he received the Honorary Trustees Award from the [[National Cowboy Hall of Fame]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], as "the man who has done the most for Southwest history" through his paintings.&lt;ref name=exhibit&gt;A.R. Mitchell Museum exhibits, 150 East Main Street, [[Trinidad, Colorado]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Four years after his death, the A.R. Mitchell Museum of Western Art was opened in 1981 on the [[Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway]] at 150 East Main Street in downtown Trinidad at the location of the former Jamieson Department Store. The museum displays some 250 of his major works, which are similar in theme to the better known western artists [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]]. The lifelong bachelor called his paintings "my children."&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;

Among his displayed works, none of which are dated in the museum collection, are ''When Nights Are Long'', ''Lazy Day'', ''Shadows at the Longhorn'', ''Homeward Bound'', ''Morning Friskies'', ''The Get-Away'', ''Bulldogger'', ''Holdup at First National Bank'', and ''Driving off Rustlers''.
 
In 1975, Mitchell retired to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], where he died two years later and is interred. Mitchell's sister, Ethel "Tot" Erickson (1892–1982),&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; laid the groundwork for opening the museum in his honor, completing the task only a year before her own passing.&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;

Mitchell once summed up his legacy, accordingly: "You look over the back trail, and you see the fine friends you've made, and you see you've managed to make a living doing something you really loved; so how could anyone ask for more?"&lt;ref name=santafe/&gt;

'''Athanasius Allanson''' (11 June 1804 – 13 January 1876) was an English [[Benedictine]] monk and historian, and [[Abbot of Glastonbury]] from 1874 to 1876. His secular forename was Peter.
London-born, he attended [[Ampleforth College]] in 1813 and graduated. He worked  extensively at the [[Ampleforth Abbey|Abbey]].

He was sent to St Peter's, Liverpool in 1828 but later worked at the mission at [[Swinburne]], Northumberland for the remaining 47 years of his life. In 1842, whilst working there, he was asked by the General Chapter of the English monks to prepare an historical account of monks since 1600. When he had completed it, he composed the ''Biography of the English Benedictines'', completed around 1858, but not published until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''Balik''' ({{lang-bg|Балик}}, [[Byzantine Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μπαλίκας}}; fl. c. 1320 and died 1347) was a noble of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] who increased the autonomy of his province and became [[Despot (court title)|despot]] of the [[Principality of Karvuna]]. During the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]] he supported the regent [[Anna of Savoy]] against pretender [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]. Balik died in 1347, either during an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] or killed during a retaliation campaign led by [[Umur Beg]], on behalf of [[John V Palaiologos]], that destroyed Dobruja's seaports. His brother [[Dobrotitsa]] succeeded him.

'''Lucy Barbara Hammond''' (née '''Bradby''', 1873–1961) was an English [[social historian]] who researched and wrote many influential books with her husband, [[John Lawrence Hammond]], including the ''Labourer'' trilogy about the impact of [[enclosure]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] upon the lives of workers.{{sfn|Spongberg|2016}}

==Early life and education==
Born on 25 July 1873, she was the seventh child of [[Edward Bradby]], who was a master at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and headmaster of [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury College]].{{sfn|DNB}}  In 1885, her father retired from Haileybury and moved to the new charitable settlement of [[Toynbee Hall]] in London's [[East End]], with the family residing at [[St Katharine Docks]] – a significant change from Barbara's rural upbringing but which she took in her stride.{{sfn|Weaver|1997|p=34}}  She was then sent to the progressive new boarding school of [[St Leonards School|St Leonards]] in Scotland, which was pioneering academic education for girls.{{sfn|DNB}}

In 1892, she won a scholarship to [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], following her sister Dorothy. She was the first woman student at Oxford to use a bicycle and was also head of the college's [[rowing club|boat club]], captain of the [[field hockey|hockey]] team and a tennis champion.{{sfn|LMH}}{{sfn|Weaver|2004}}  She further distinguished herself by being the first woman to take a [[double-first]] in [[Honour Moderations|Classical Moderations]] and [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] – a set of examinations renowned for their difficulty.{{sfn|DNB}}  This feat inspired a [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]]:{{sfn|LMH}}{{sfn|Delamont|2002|p=145}}
&lt;poem&gt;
::In spite of long hours with a [[Cram school|crammer]],
::I never get more than a Gamma,
::But the girl over there
::With the flaming red hair
::Gets Alpha Plus every time, damn her!    
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Marriage and writing==
At Oxford, she became a fellow of Lady Margaret Hall.{{sfn|Kleer|2000}}  There, she had met [[John Lawrence Hammond]] and they married in 1901 after he had established a career in political journalism, becoming the editor of the Liberal weekly review, ''[[The Speaker (periodical)|The Speaker]]'', in 1899.  They lived in [[Battersea]] and were both active in campaigning against the [[Opposition to the Second Boer War#Great Britain|Boer War]].  She was also active in the [[Women's Industrial Council]] until [[urogenital tuberculosis|ovarian tuberculosis]] forced her to retire and also prevented her from having children.{{sfn|DNB}}

The couple moved to [[Hampstead Heath]] in 1905 for the sake of her health, which was now delicate.{{sfn|DNB}}  In 1907, John became secretary of the [[Civil Service Commissioners (United Kingdom)|Civil Service Commission]] and this position gave him sufficient time to write books too.{{sfn|DNB}}  They worked together on these with Barbara focussing on the research while John concentrated on the writing.  While she had done better academically at Oxford, she told her husband John that "she hated using her brains".{{sfn|Feske|2000|p=104}}  He wrote that her strength was "putting great masses of fact &amp; detail in order, seizing their significance &amp; seeing how they should be set out."{{sfn|Feske|2000|p=104}}  Their first work together was a study of the effects of [[enclosure]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] upon the [[working class]]es.  When taken to the publishers, [[Longmans]], this was found to be too long and so Barbara restructured the work into separate volumes.{{sfn|Feske|2000|pp=109–116}} The first of these was ''The Village Labourer'' which was published in 1911.{{sfn|DNB}}  This was well-received and had an immediate political impact, informing Liberal policy produced by the [[Land Enquiry Committee]] of [[David Lloyd George]] – a driver of the [[Liberal welfare reforms]].{{sfn|Sutton|2013|p=29}}

In 1912, they moved again to a farmhouse called Oatfield in the rustic village of [[Piccotts End]] which was to be their home for most of their lives.  Barbara would work here while tending the large garden and collection of animals.  Their friend, the historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], recounted her spartan, therapeutic lifestyle which emphasised fresh air – open windows, long walks, riding and outdoor sleeping.{{sfn|Toynbee|1967|pp=95–107}}  She would make occasional trips to the [[Public Record Office]] for research while John spent more time in London for his job.  During the Second World War, he worked at the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and so they moved to [[Manchester]] for the duration but then returned to Piccotts End in 1945.  John died there in 1949 and Barbara died later in 1961.{{sfn|DNB}}

{{Campaignbox Spanish Civil War}}

The '''Biscay Campaign''' ({{lang-es|Campaña de Vizcaya}}) was an offensive of the [[Spanish Civil War]] which lasted from 31 March to 1 July 1937. 50,000 men of the [[Eusko Gudarostea]] met 65,000 men of the insurgent forces. After heavy combats the Nationalist forces with a crushing material superiority managed to occupy the city of Bilbao and the Biscay province.

==Background==
By late October 1936, all Gipuzkoa was occupied by the rightist rebel forces. The western front settled at the foot of Intxorta ([[Elgeta]]). However, Mola did not hide his plans to use air force against [[History of the Basques#Wartime|Basque territory]] loyal to the Republic. Despite [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] attempts at guaranteeing no shelling on civilians,{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=433|loc="In secret negotiations with Mola, reminding him that no safety guarantees could be provided for rebel rightist prisoners in such a scenario"}} Spanish Nationalist aircraft raided Bilbao on September 25 and 26, an indiscriminate attack on its starving population that spread a blaze of outrage across the city.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=433|loc="Dozens, including women and children, died and were mutilated. In the wake of the raid, [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo#History|anarchist squads]] assaulted the prison and killed 66 inmates"}}

Oblivious to foreseeable consequences, the Nationalists resumed ferocious air strikes against the city on 4 January 1937, prompting yet another outcry of indignation and an assault on the prison-ships where right-wingers were being held. It resulted in a death toll of 224.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=433|loc="The restoration of order by the Basque nationalist authorities prevented further bloodshed"}}

On 22 March 1937, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] decided to halt his offensive against Madrid and start an [[War in the North|offensive against the northern Republican held zone]]. The northern zone was politically divided and isolated from the central Republican zone. Furthermore, there was most of Spanish iron and coal and the chemical plants of Biscay.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=594}} The Nationalists decided to start the occupation of the northern Republican zone with the conquest of the Biscay province.

==Opposing forces==
The Nationalists had the Emilio Mola's Army of the North (55,000 men). The Nationalist attack started with the Navarrese Division, led by the General José Solchaga. This division had four brigades led by the Colonels [[Rafael García Valiño|Garcia Valiño]], Alonso Vega, Cayuela and Latorre (18,000 men) and the [[Flechas Negras Division|Black Arrow]] division (8,000 men with Italian officers). This force was established between [[Bergara|Vergara]] and [[Legutio|Villareal]], on the border of the Biscay province. The Nationalist had also 200 guns, 120 aircraft, the battleship ''[[Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII|España]]'', the cruisers ''[[Spanish cruiser Canarias|Canarias]]'' and ''[[Spanish cruiser Almirante Cervera|Almirante Cervera]]'' and the destroyer ''Velasco''.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=595}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=596}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=597}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=598}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=599}}

Opposing them, the Republicans had General [[Francisco Llano de la Encomienda]]'s Army of the North, theoretically numbered 150,000, but there were no unity between the Basque Nationalists, the Asturians and the Santaderinos. The Basque Army in Biscay had 30,000 men (most of them Basque Nationalists and also Asturians). The Republicans also had 140 guns, 25-30 aircraft, two destroyers and three submarines.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=594}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=595}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=596}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=597}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=598}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=599}}

==The offensive==
The Nationalist offensive started on 31 March and [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Octavillas_lanzadas_por_Mola_sobre_Bizkaia Mola threatened] to bomb the Basque cities and industries:"I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war.". The same day the [[Aviazione Legionaria]] bombed the town of [[Bombing of Durango|Durango]], there were 250 civilian deaths. On 1 April the Colonel [[Camilo Alonso Vega]] captured the mountains of Maroto, Albertia and Jarindo, and the Navarrase troops attacked the town of [[Ochandiano]] and encircled the Basque troops in it.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=599}} The Navarrese occupied the town on 4 April, after heavy combats and aerial bombardment. The Basque troops left 400 deaths and 600 prisoners. Then Mola, decided to stop the advance due bad weather.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=228}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=229}}

On 6 April the Nationalist government in Burgos announced the blockade of the Basque ports. The British government said that the blockade was effective and warned British ships not to go to Bilbao. Nevertheless, British merchants broke the blockade and entered in Basque ports. On 20 April the Nationalists continued their offensive after a heavy artillery bombardment. The Basque troops led by Major Pablo Belderraín tried to resist but the 1st Navarrese Brigade led by the colonel Garcia Valiño broke the front and occupied Elgeta. The same day the Legion Condor bombed [[Bombing of Guernica|Guernica]].

The Basques retreated to the [[Iron Belt]] line and the ''Legion Condor'' bombed the roads and woods with incendiary bombs. Then, the ''[[List of the Basque Autonomous Community Presidents|Lendakari]]'', [[José Antonio Aguirre (politician)|Jósé Antonio Aguirre]], decided to assume the command of the Basque troops, due the incompetence of Llano de la Encomienda. On 30 April the Italians occupied Bermeo, but the Republican battleship ''Jaime I'', was damaged by a mine.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=595-611}} As the Nationalist troops approached Bilbao, the autonomous Basque government made an international plea to save the children of war flocking to the city. More than 20,000 were [[Evacuation of children in the Spanish Civil War|evacuated to 'temporary' safety]] on chartered boats, most of them to permanent exile.

==The fall of Bilbao==
The Republican government tried to send fighters to the Basque country across France, but the French government returned the aircraft after confiscate its machine guns. The commander of the ''[[Spanish Republican Air Force]]'', [[Hidalgo de Cisneros]], decided to send 50 fighters and bombers to the Basque Country, across the Nationalist held territory, 45 reached Bilbao.

Meantime, the bad weather stopped again the Nationalist offensive, a new shipment of weapons (55 antiaircraft guns, 30 cannons and two squadrons of ''[[Chatos]]''), reached Bilbao, and the General [[Mariano Gámir Ulíbarri|Gámir]] was sent to Biscay in order to organize the defense of Bilbao and to replace Llano de la Encomienda. The Republican government launched two offensives in [[Segovia Offensive|Segovia]] and [[Huesca Offensive|Huesca]] to halt the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao but both failed.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=276}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=277}}

Mola died on 3 June and was replaced by General Davila. On 11 June the Nationalist troops reached the [[Iron Belt]] and on 12 June after a heavy aerial and artillery bombing (150 guns and 70 bombers) the Nationalist troops [[Battle of Bilbao|assaulted it]]. A Basque deserter, the Major Goicoechea gave to the Nationalist the plans of the Iron Belt.

The Nationalist attacked in the Mount Urcullu and broke the Basque lines. On 14 June the Basque government left Bilbao, on 18 June the Basque troops was ordered to leave the city and by 19 June the Nationalist conquered the city.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=667-674}} 200 thousand people were evacuated westwards to Santander, on trawlers first and cars, horse carts, lorries and on foot later. They were bombed over by [[Condor Legion]] aircraft along the way.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=436}}

==Aftermath==
The Basque army temporarily stabilized the front on a line that runs south from the village Ontón on the coast.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=437}} Biscay had the only factory in Spain capable of the manufacture of artillery shells and half of the Spanish production of explosives.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=673}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|p=674}} Virtually all manufacturing and shipbuilding industry remained untarnished, since the Basque nationalist authorities' opposed its destruction.

The arrival of the rebels to the city was followed by ransacking, murder, and pseudo-trials. 8,000 thousand were imprisoned for their Basque nationalist leanings, and many of them sent to forced 'work battalions'. In December, executions by fire-squad and [[garrote|garrote vil]] started to be conducted. The number of executions during and after the fall of Biscay is estimated at 916.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=436}} The [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|Basque autonomy]] was abolished and the Basque tongue forbidden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9004">'''Domingo de Vico''' was a Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar during the [[Spanish conquest of Chiapas]] and the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of Guatemala]] in the 16th century. He was originally from [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]].{{sfn|Hernández|2008|p=67}} Chronicler [[Antonio de Remesal]] recorded that de Vico studied theology in [[Úbeda]] and finished his studies in the [[Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca|San Esteban convent]] in [[Salamanca]].{{sfn|Hernández|2008|p=69}}

Domingo de Vico set out from Spain on 9 July 1544 with a group led by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] in an effort to enforce the [[New Laws]] that had been issued in 1542 to protect the indigenous inhabitants of the Spanish colonies from overexploitation by the ''[[encomienda|encomenderos]]''.{{sfn|Gómez Coutiño|2014|pp=18, 18n8}} De Vico was the [[prior]] of [[Cobán]] from 1554 until his death in 1555.{{sfn|García Ahumada|1994|p=222}} He was charged with the evangelisation of the [[Lakandon Ch'ol|Lakandon]] and [[Acala Ch'ol]] in the unconquered area that was then referred to by the Spanish as the ''Tierra de Guerra'' ("Land of War"),{{sfnm|1a1=Gómez Coutiño|1y=2014|1p=23|2a1=Thompson|2y=1966|2p=29}} and also as [[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]].{{sfn|García Ahumada|1994|p=222}}

==Works==
In 1544, [[Francisco Marroquín]], bishop of [[Guatemala]], charged Domingo de Vico with producing a treatise upon Indian idolatry. The work contained instructions to Dominicans upon how to use indigenous beliefs in their sermons in [[Chiapas]] and Guatemala. It was entitled ''Tratado de ídolos'' ("Treatment of Idols").{{sfn|Megged|1995|p=68}} His best known written work is his ''[[Theologia Indorum]]'', of which eleven copies survive, divided between the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]] (5 copies) and the [[Princeton University Library#Firestone Library|Firestone Library]] of [[Princeton University]], New Jersey (6 copies).{{sfn|Acuña|1985|p=283}} Among the copies in France are translations made in the [[Tz’utujil language|Tzutuhil]], [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] and [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]] languages.{{sfn|Acuña|1985|p=284}} During his short time in Guatemala before his death, he is believed to have compiled the ''Vocabulario de la lengua cakchiquel'' ("Vocabulary of the Kaqchikel language").{{sfn|Hernández|2008|p=69}} De Vico learnt the [[Ch’ol language]] and was able to preach to the Lakandon and Acala in their own language.{{sfn|Thompson|1966|p=29}}

De Vico wrote some religious poems in Kaqchikel upon the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. A work entitled ''Los Proverbios de Salomón, las Epístolas y los Evangelios de todo el año, en lengua mexicana'' ("The Proverbs of Solomon, the Epistles and Gospels for the whole year, in the Mexican tongue") was prevented from being published by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].{{sfn|García Ahumada|1994|p=222}}

==Death==
In 1555, Domingo de Vico and his companion Andrés López were killed by the Acala and their Lakandon allies.{{sfn|Caso Barrera|Aliphat|2007|p=53}} De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in what is now [[Alta Verapaz]], Guatemala), had offended the local Maya ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives.{{sfnm|1a1=Salazar|1y=2000|1pp=38, 52|2a1=ITMB|2y=1998}} The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated;{{sfn|Salazar|2000|p=39}} the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish.{{sfn|Salazar|2000|p=35}} In retaliation, the Spanish rounded up 260 Ch'ol in 1559, hanged 80 and branded the rest as slaves.{{sfn|Thompson|1966|p=29}}

Following the imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|Martial law]] in 1981 Kopówka became member of the [[Independent Students' Union]] branch of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], the first non–communist workers union in [[Warsaw Pact]] history.

[[File:Elizabeth I Armada Portrait British School.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth I Armada Portrait British School]]
'''Elizabethan literature''' refers to bodies of work produced during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603), and is one of the most splendid ages of [[English literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Elizabethan Literature | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184911/Elizabethan-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth I presided over a vigorous culture that saw notable accomplishments in the arts, voyages of discovery, the "[[Elizabethan Settlement]]" that created the [[Church of England]], and the defeat of military threats from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Elizabeth I, Queen of England 1533–1603 | title = Anthology ofthe British Literature | edition = concise | volume = A | publisher = Broadview | place = Petersborough | year = 2009 | page = 683}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her reign a London-centred culture, both [[court]]ly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. English playwrights combined the influence of the [[Medieval theatre]] with the [[Renaissance]]'s rediscovery of the [[Roman drama]]tists, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], for tragedy, and [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], for comedy. Italy was an important source for Renaissance ideas in England and the linguist and lexicographer [[John Florio]] (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, a royal language tutor at the Court of [[James I of England|James I]], who had furthermore brought much of the [[Italian language]] and culture to England. He also translated the works of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] from French into English.&lt;ref&gt;Frances A. Yates, ''The life of an Italian in Shakespeare’s England''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prose==
Two of the most important Elizabethan prose writers were [[John Lyly]] (1553 or 1554 – 1606) and [[Thomas Nashe]] (November 1567 – c. 1601). Lyly is an [[England|English]] writer, poet, dramatist, playwright, and politician, best known for his books ''[[Euphues|Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit]]'' (1578) and ''Euphues and His England'' (1580). Lyly's mannered literary style, originating in his first books, is known as ''[[euphuism]]''. Lyly must also be considered and remembered as a primary influence on the plays of William Shakespeare, and in particular the romantic comedies. Lyly's play ''[[Love's Metamorphosis]]'' is a large influence on ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kerrigan, J. ed. "Love's Labours Lost", New Penguin Shakespeare, Harmondsworth 1982, {{ISBN|0-14-070738-7}};&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gallathea]]'' is a possible source for other plays.&lt;ref&gt;"John Lilly and Shakespeare", by C. C. Hense in the ''Jahrbuch der deutschen Shakesp. Gesellschaft'', vols. vii and viii (1872, 1873).&lt;/ref&gt; Nash is considered the greatest of the English [[Elizabethan]] [[pamphleteer]]s.&lt;ref name=nicholl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholl|first1=Charles|authorlink=Charles Nicholl|newspaper=[[London Review of Books]]|title='Faustus' and the Politics of Magic|accessdate=11 May 2015|date=8 March 1990|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v12/n05/charles-nicholl/faustus-and-the-politics-of-magic|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[playwright]], [[poet]], and [[Satire|satirist]], who is best known for his novel ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]''.&lt;ref name=to&gt;{{cite news|author1=John O‘Connell|title=Sex and books: London's most erotic writers|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/sex-and-books-londons-most-erotic-writers|accessdate=26 November 2015|work=Time Out|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Puttenham]] (1529–1590) was a 16th-century English writer and literary critic. He is generally considered to be the author of the influential handbook on poetry and rhetoric, ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589).

==Poetry==
[[File:The Faerie Queene frontispiece.jpg|thumb|The epic poem ''The Faerie Queene'' by Edmund Spenser; titlepage, printed for William Ponsonby in 1590]]
Italian literature was an important influence on the poetry of [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] (1503–42), one of the earliest English Renaissance poets. He was responsible for many innovations in English poetry, and alongside [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]] (1516/1517–47) introduced the sonnet from Italy into England in the early 16th century.{{sfn |Tillyard| 1929}}{{sfn | Burrow |2004}}{{sfn|Ward | Waller | Trent | Erskine | 1907–21 | loc = p. 3}} Wyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English tongue, to civilise it, to raise its powers to those of its neighbours.{{sfn | Tillyard | 1929}}  While a significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the Italian poet [[Petrarch]], he also wrote [[sonnet]]s of his own.  Wyatt took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure.  Petrarch's sonnets consist of an "[[Petrarchan sonnet|octave]]", rhyming ''abba abba'', followed, after a turn (volta) in the sense, by a sestet with various rhyme schemes, however his poems never ended in a [[rhyming couplet]].  Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is ''cddc ee''. This marks the beginnings of  [[English sonnet]] with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century'', Volume B, 2012, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 16th century, English poetry was characterised by elaboration of language and extensive allusion to classical myths. The most important poets of this era include [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Sir Philip Sidney]]. Elizabeth herself, a product of [[Renaissance humanism]], produced [[occasional poems]] such as ''[[On Monsieur’s Departure]]'' and ''[[The Doubt of Future Foes]]''.

[[Edmund Spenser]] (c. 1552–99) was one of the most important poets of this period, author of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590 and 1596), an epic poem and fantastical [[allegory]] celebrating the [[Tudor dynasty]] and [[Elizabeth I]]. Another major figure, [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]] (1554–86), was an English poet, courtier and soldier, and is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan Age]]. His works include ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'', ''[[The Defence of Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]''. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as by [[Thomas Campion]] (1567–1620), became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. ''See [[English Madrigal School]]''.

Shakespeare also popularized the [[English sonnet]], which made significant changes to [[Petrarch]]'s model. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as those by [[Thomas Campion]], became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. ''See [[English Madrigal School]]''.

===Changes to the canon===
While the [[Western canon|canon]] of Renaissance English poetry  of the 16th has always been in some form of flux, it is only towards the late 20th century that concerted efforts were made to challenge the canon. Questions that once did not even have to be made, such as where to put the limitations of periods, what geographical areas to include, what genres to include, what writers and what kinds of writers to include, are now central.

The central figures of the Elizabethan canon are [[Edmund Spenser]], Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Ben Jonson]]. There have been few attempts to change this long established list because the cultural importance of these five is so great that even re-evaluations on grounds of literary merit has not dared to dislodge them from the curriculum. [[Edmund Spenser]] had a significant influences on 17th-century poetry. Spenser was the primary English influence on [[John Milton]].

In the 18th century interest in Elizabethan poetry was rekindled through the scholarship of [[Thomas Warton]] and others.

The [[Lake Poets]] and other [[Romantics]], at the beginning of the 19th century, were well-read in Renaissance poetry. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed only in the Victorian period, with anthologies like Palgrave's ''[[Golden Treasury]]''. A fairly representative idea of the "Victorian canon" is also given by [[Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch]]'s ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]'' (1919). The poems from this period are largely songs and apart from the major names, one sees the two pioneers [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]] and the Earl of Surrey, and a scattering of poems by other writers of the period. However, the authors of many poems are anonymous. Some poems, such as [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]]'s Induction to the ''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'', were highly regarded (and therefore "in the canon") but they were omitted from the anthology as non-lyric.

In the 20th century [[T. S. Eliot]]'s many essays on Elizabethan subjects were mainly concerned with [[Elizabethan theatre]], but he also attempted to bring back long-forgotten poets to general attention, like [[Sir John Davies]], whose cause he championed in an article in [[The Times Literary Supplement]] in 1926 (republished in [[On Poetry and Poets]], 1957).

The American critic [[Yvor Winters]] suggested in 1939, an alternative canon of Elizabethan poetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; In this canon he excludes the famous representatives of the [[Petrarchan|Petrarchan school]] of poetry, represented by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Edmund Spenser]], and instead turns his eye to a Native or Plain Style ''anti-Petrarchan'' movement, which he claims has been overlooked and undervalued. The most underrated member of this movement he deems to have been [[George Gascoigne]] (1525–1577), who "deserves to be ranked...among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher".&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 98&lt;/ref&gt; Other members were Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1552–1618), [[Thomas Nashe]] (1567–1601), [[Barnabe Googe]] (1540–1594), and [[George Turberville]] (1540–1610).

Characteristic of this movement is that a poem has 
::a theme usually broad, simple, and obvious, even tending toward the proverbial, but usually a theme of some importance, humanly speaking; a feeling restrained to the minimum required by the subject; a rhetoric restrained to a similar minimum, the poet being interested in his rhetoric as a means of stating his matter as economically as possible, and not, as are the Petrarchans, in the pleasures of rhetoric for its own sake. There is also in the school a strong tendency towards aphoristic statement.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Eliot and Winters were very much in favour of the established canon. Towards the end of the 20th century, however, the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Gary F.|title=English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0582090962|pages=263–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9gFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Waller,+Gary.+English+Poetry+of+the+Sixteenth+Century&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1qEpf-ANSw&amp;sig=JYcCfHZl4BWH3BWOjBqb38sisZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyrfv_x-nLAhWGQCYKHRxgD7sQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=reopening&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
{{see also|English Renaissance theatre}}

The [[Italian Renaissance]] had rediscovered the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]]. This revival of interest was instrumental in the development of the new drama, which was then beginning to make apart from the old mystery and [[miracle plays]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. The Italians were inspired by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (a major [[tragedy|tragic]] playwright and philosopher, the tutor of [[Nero]]) and by [[Plautus]] (whose [[comedy|comic]] clichés, especially that of the boasting soldier, had a powerful influence during the Renaissance and thereafter).  However, the Italian tragedies embraced a principle contrary to Seneca's ethics: showing blood and violence on the stage. In Seneca's plays such scenes were only acted by the characters. 
[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|205px|A 1596 sketch of a rehearsal in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical circular [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) and then James I (1603–25), in the late 16th and early 17th century, a London-centred culture, that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer [[John Florio]] (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of [[James I of England|James I]], and a possible friend and influence on [[William Shakespeare]], had brought much of the [[Italian language]] and culture to England. He was also the translator of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561), by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville]] and [[Thomas Norton|Norton]], and [[Thomas Kyd]]'s (1558–94) [[revenge tragedy]] ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (1592). Highly popular and influential in its time, ''The Spanish Tragedy'' established a new [[genre]] in English literature theatre, the [[revenge play]] or revenge tragedy. Its plot contains several violent murders and includes as one of its [[fictional character|characters]] a [[personification]] of [[Revenge]]. ''The Spanish Tragedy'' was often referred to, or parodied, in works written by other Elizabethan [[playwrights]], including [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. Many elements of ''The Spanish Tragedy,'' such as the [[play-within-a-play]] used to trap a murderer and a ghost intent on vengeance, appear in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]].'' Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for ''Hamlet''.

[[Jane Lumley]] (1537–1578) was the first person to translate [[Euripides]] into English. Her translation of ''[[Iphigeneia at Aulis]]'' is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Claire, ed. "Lumley, Joanna Fitzalan (c. 1537–1576/77)." ''The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature''. New York: Prentice Hall, 1992. 764.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616) stands out in this period both as a [[poet]] and [[playwright]]. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including [[Shakespearean history|histories]], [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], [[Shakespearean comedies|comedies]] and the late [[William Shakespeare's late romances|romances]], or tragicomedies. His early classical and Italianate comedies, like ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'', containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=p. 235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', and  ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. After the lyrical ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV, parts 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|2]]'', and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'',  and ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', based on Sir [[Thomas North|Thomas North's]] 1579 translation of [[Plutarch|Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', which introduced a new kind of drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=pp. 353, 358}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2005|loc=pp. 151–153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's career continued into the [[Jacobean Literature|Jacobean period]], and in the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called "[[Shakespearean problem play|problem plays]]", ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', as well as a number of his best known [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Anthony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=p. 85}}; {{Harvnb|Muir|2005|loc=pp. 12–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=pp. 40, 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final period, Shakespeare turned to [[Shakespeare's late romances|romance]] or [[tragicomedy]] and completed three more major plays: ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', as well as the collaboration, ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowden|1881|loc=p. 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' and ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', probably with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|Taylor|Jowett|Montgomery|2005|loc=pp. 1247, 1279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important figures in the [[Elizabethan theatre]] include [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]].

Marlowe's (1564–1593) subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] than any other thing. Drawing on German folklore, Marlowe introduced the story of [[Faust]] to England in his play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (c. 1592), about a scientist and magician who, obsessed by the thirst of knowledge and the desire to push man's technological power to its limits, sells his soul to the Devil. ''Faustus'' makes use of "the dramatic framework of the morality plays in its presentation of a story of temptation, fall, and damnation, and its free use of morality figures such as the good angel and the bad angel and the seven deadly sins, along with the devils Lucifer and Mephistopheles."&lt;ref&gt;"Christopher Marlowe." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 6 April 2013. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/365890/Christopher-Marlowe&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] (c. 1570–1632) was, between 1598 and 1602, involved in about forty plays, usually in collaboration. He is particularly remembered for ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'' (1599), a work where he appears to be  the sole author. Dekker is noted for his "realistic portrayal of daily London life and for "his sympathy for the poor and oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' (1996), pp. 266–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] (c. 1558–1592) was another popular dramatist but he is now best known for a posthumous pamphlet attributed to him, ''[[Greene's Groatsworth of Wit|Greenes, Groats-worth of Witte, bought with a million of Repentance]]'', widely believed to contain an attack on William Shakespeare.

Gads Forlag. 2016, p. 1065&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and areer==
Erland Kolding-Nielsen was born in the [[Frederiksberg]] district of Copenhagen on Monday January 13, 1947.  He obtained a MA in history in 1973, writing a thesis for the Gold Medal of the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He then served as lecturer in history and library science at the Royal School of Librarianship. Copenhagen, 1971 - 1980. Head of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences 1980 -1986.

==The Royal Library==
Erland Kolding Nielsen was appointed Director General af The Royal Library in March 1986. He has been leading the national library's physical and digital development within administration, organisation and collection development, and by digitalisation of the library's collections. The first online catalogue REX was introduced in 1987 with electronic circulation from 1990. All aspects of internal and external library management and services were fully digitalised from 2007, constituting the full digital library. All physical catalogues, including numerous handwritten, were retro-converted by 2015, the catalogues of the five main collections by 2010, into REX, now comprising more than 9 million records. Together with the State and University Library of Aarhus Kolding Nielsen managed for the first time in 70 years to get a new Legal Deposit Law through the Ministry of Culture, which was passed by the Parliament in 1997, and fundamentally revised again in 2004, including all digital formats. Established in 2009 as a new part of the National Bibliography a full registration of retro-digitalised collections of all kinds in Denmark (2016, c. 330).
The collections, now mounting to 35 million items (2015), were greatly enlarged in his time, the collections of photographs more than doubled to 20 million, big music and other private and institutional archives, the ''Netarchive.dk''  was established 2005, now comprising more than 25 billion documents and 2.4 million Danish websites.

The library as a research institution was greatly enhanced, including monumental scholarly editions as the ''Carl Nielsen Edition'' (52 vol.s 1998-2009), followed by the ''Danish Centre for Music Publication'' from 2009, the ''Correspondence of Werner Best with the German Foreign Office and other German Documents Concerning the Occupation of Denmark 1942-4''5 (in German, 10 vol.s 2012), and within the series ''Danish Humanist Texts and Studies'', altogether more than 300 volumes through 30 years. Succeeded with the 2nd Danish-Swedish exchange of manuscripts in 2011 (return of Codex holmiensis C 37 from Stockholm). As member since 1987 and chair since 1995 of the Commission on Exports of Cultural Assets he channelled many books, manuscripts and archived into the Royal Library.

From 1999 the cultural functions and services of the national library to the public were greatly enlarged, including a chamber orchestra-in-residence the ''DiamondEnsemble'' from 2004, a semi-permanent treasure exhibition in the ''Montana Hall'' 2006, the ''International Author’s Stage'' 2008, and lots of other exhibitions, lecture series, artists’ talks, conferences etc.

The iconic university library building from 1861 in Fiolstræde was completely renovated 1997, and a new Faculty Library for the Humanities at the Amager Campus of the [[University of Copenhagen]], completed in two phases in 1998 and 2008.

[[File:Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire.jpg|thumb|160px|Abbaye Saint Benoît de Fleury, the supposed origin of the book.]]
The '''''Fleury Playbook''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Livre de Jeux de Fleury'''}} — Orléans, Bibliothèque Municipale MS. 201) is a [[medieval]] collection of [[Latin]] [[Bible|biblical]] dramas dating from around 1200 [[AD]] It was included in a composite volume of sermons, biblical texts, liturgical dramas, and hymns that was bound and kept at the library of [[Fleury Abbey|Abbaye Saint Benoît de Fleury]], a [[Benedictine monastery]] at [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]], France, until after the [[French Revolution]] and is now housed in the Bibliothèque de la Ville (Municipal Library) at [[Orléans]], France.&lt;ref name="Tinkle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LTnNvYMfQQwYbxchbRjGSNNL24dYzK5QSHhmSw1WpvdKvY3JlQvG!1515409072!125390872?docId=5008189280|title=Comparative Drama, Vol. 38|last=Tinkle|first=Theresa|year=2004|publisher=Questia Media America|pages=1|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works in the playbook are told in a musical style similar to that of [[plainsong]].&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; The origin of the book is unknown, but it is possible that it was written by multiple authors.&lt;ref name="Tinkle" /&gt; The playbook consists of a total of 10 works, occupying pages 176–243 of the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anticoedition.co.uk/html/mcm6.htm|title=Fleury playbook|last=Thomas|first=Wyndham|publisher=Antico Edition|accessdate=2009-11-14|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/saint-benoit-sur-loire-abbey-fleury|title=Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire Abbey|last=Hayes|first=Holly|publisher=Sacred Destinations|accessdate=2009-11-14|location=Centre, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The playbook was compiled in the late 12th century. Although it is widely accepted that the ''Fleury Playbook'' was created in the Fleury Abbey, the [[neume]]s in the musical scores are not similar to those found there, nor was the Abbey known for any achievements in drama prior to the ''Fleury Playbook'', both of which suggest that the book may have been bound elsewhere. However, the manuscript was copied and housed in the abbey's [[scriptorium]], and may have served as an early example of a [[liturgical drama]].&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;Ogden, Dunbar H. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gTiGB15nXzcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=fleury+playbook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gzCUb2JLkY&amp;sig=SfMy9OqVW5vNR2Lv-Sh07s-kbw4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BgUPS8q7BYGjnQew-PDGAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fleury%20playbook&amp;f=false The Staging of Drama in the Medieval Church]. University of Delaware Press. p. 221. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-863-4}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The plays are both [[liturgical]] and non-liturgical (specifically those pertaining to St. Nicholas), and may be performed both monastically and non-monastically, as the text does not specify. As each drama appears to correspond with different dates of the [[liturgical year]], it is likely that main purpose of the playbook is not liturgical.&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parnaseo.uv.es/Ars/webelx/Pon%C3%A8ncies%20pdf/Petersen.pdf|title=The Ordo ad repraesentandum Herodem from the Fleury Playbook: Biblical Reception and Representational Ritual|last=Petersen|first=Nils Holger|publisher=Universitat de València-Estudi|accessdate=2009-11-26|location=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plays are meant to be performed, as evidenced by their structure, staging, and effects. Overall, the plays cover both [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] themes such as the [[Ten Commandments]] and conversion.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2" /&gt;

==Plays==
The ten works in the ''Fleury Playbook'' are written in the following order:&lt;ref name="Latin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cua.edu/faculty/drama/latin.cfm|title=Medieval Latin Drama in English Translation=|publisher=The Catholic University of America|accessdate=2009-11-26|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fyodor Sologub''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Сологу́б}}, born '''Fyodor Kuzmich Teternikov''', {{lang-ru|Фёдор Кузьми́ч Тете́рников}}, also known as '''Theodor Sologub'''; {{OldStyleDate|1 March|1863|17 February}} – 5 December 1927) was a Russian [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] poet, novelist, playwright and essayist. He was the first writer to introduce the morbid, [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] elements characteristic of European ''[[fin de siècle]]'' literature and philosophy into [[Russian literature|Russian prose]].

==Early life==
Sologub was born in [[St. Petersburg]] into the family of a poor tailor, Kuzma Afanasyevich Teternikov, who had been a serf in [[Poltava Governorate|Poltava guberniya]], the illegitimate son of a local landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dikman|first=M.I.|title=Fedor Sologub (Stikhotvorenie)|chapter=Introduction|page=7|location=Leningrad|publisher=Sovetskii pisatel|year=1975|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his father died of tuberculosis in 1867, his illiterate mother. Tatiana Semyonovna Teternikova, was forced to become a servant in the home of the aristocratic Agapov family, where Sologub and his younger sister Olga grew up. The family took an interest in the education of young Fyodor, sending him to a pedogogical institution where Sologub was a model student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cioran|first=Smauel D.|title=Drops of Blood|chapter=Translator's Forward &amp; Introduction|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=Ardis|year=1979|page=12|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing how difficult his mother's life was, Sologub was determined to rescue her from it, and after graduating from the St. Petersburg Teachers' Institute in 1882 he took his mother and sister with him to his first teaching post in [[Kresttsy]], where he began his literary career with the 1884 publication in a children's magazine of his poem "The Fox and the Hedgehog" under the name Te-rnikov.

Sologub continued writing as he relocated to new jobs in [[Velikiye Luki]] (1885) and [[Vytegra]] (1889), but felt that he was completely isolated from the literary world and longed to be able to live in the capital again; nevertheless, his decade-long experience with the "frightful world" of backwoods provincial life served him well when he came to write ''The Petty Demon''. (He said later that in writing the novel he had softened the facts: "things happened that no one would believe if I were to describe them."{{sfn|Dikman|1975|page=11}}) He felt sympathetic with the writers associated with the journal ''Severnyi vestnik'' (Northern Herald), including [[Nikolai Minsky]], [[Zinaida Gippius]], and [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], who were beginning to create what would be known as the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] movement, and in 1891 he visited Petersburg hoping to see Minsky and Merezhkovsky, but met only the first.

==Early literary career==
In 1892 he was finally able to relocate to the capital, where he got a job teaching mathematics, started writing what would become his most famous novel, ''The Petty Demon'', and began frequenting the offices of ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'', which published much of his writing during the next five years. There, in 1893, Minsky, who thought Teternikov was an unpoetic name, suggested that he use a pseudonym, and the aristocratic name Sollogub was decided on, but one of the ''l''s was omitted as an attempt (unavailing, as it turned out) to avoid confusion with Count [[Vladimir Sollogub]]. In 1894 his first short story, "Ninochkina oshibka" (Ninochka's Mistake), was published in ''Illustrirovanny Mir'', and in the autumn of that year his mother died. In 1896 he published his first three books: a book of poems, a collection of short stories, and his first novel, ''Tyazhelye sny'' (Bad Dreams), which he had begun in 1883 and which is considered one of the first decadent Russian novels.

In April 1897 he ended his association with ''Severny Vestnik'' and, along with Merezhkovsky and Gippius, began writing for the journal ''Sever'' (North). The next year his first series of fairy tales was published. In 1899 he was appointed principal of the Andreevskoe municipal school and relocated to their premises on [[Vasilievsky Island]]; he also became a member of the St. Petersburg District School Council. He continued to publish books of poetry, and in 1902 he finished ''The Petty Demon'', which was published partially in serial form in 1905 (in ''Voprosy zhizni'', which was terminated before the final installments). At this time his "Sundays," a literary group that met at his home, attracted poets, artists, and actors, including [[Alexander Blok]], [[Mikhail Kuzmin]], [[Alexei Remizov]], [[Sergei Gorodetsky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]] and [[Sergei Auslender]]. [[Teffi]] wrote of him at this period:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His face was pale, long, without eyebrows; by his nose was a large wart; a thin reddish beard seemed to pull away from his thin cheeks; dull, half-closed eyes. His face was always tired, always bored... Sometimes when he was a guest at someone's table he would close his eyes and remain like that for several minutes, as if he had forgotten to open them.  
He never laughed... Sologub lived on Vasilievsky Island in the small official apartment of a municipal school where he was a teacher and inspector. He lived with his sister, a flat-chested, consumptive old maid. She was quiet and shy; she adored her brother and was a little afraid of him, and spoke of him only in a whisper. He said in a poem: 
"We were holiday children, My sister and I"; they were very poor, those holiday children, dreaming that someone would give them "even motley-colored shells from a brook." Sadly and dully they dragged out the difficult days of their youth. The consumptive sister, not having received her share of motley shells, was already burning out. He himself was exhausted by his boring teaching job; he wrote in snatches by night, always tired from the boyish noise of his students...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So Sologub lived in his little official apartment with little icon lamps, serving his guests mint cakes, ruddy rolls, [[pastila]], and honey cakes, for which his sister went across the river somewhere on a horsecar. She told us privately, "I'd love to ride on the outside of the horsecar sometime, but my brother won't let me. He says it's unseemly for a lady."... Those evenings in the little apartment, when his close literary friends gathered, were very interesting.
 &lt;ref name="Fedor Sologub"&gt;Teffi, "[http://www.litera.ru/stixiya/articles/472.html Fedor Sologub]" (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fame and marriage==

At the time of the [[1905 Revolution]] his politically critical ''skazochki'' ("little tales") were very popular and were collected into a book, ''Politicheskie skazochki'' (1906). ''The Petty Demon'' was published in a standalone edition in 1907 and quickly became popular, having ten printings during the author's lifetime. Sologub's next major prose work, ''A Created Legend'' (1905–1913) (literally "the legend in the making," a trilogy consisting of ''Drops of Blood'', ''Queen Ortruda'', and ''Smoke and Ash''), had many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful description of the world. "It begins with the famous declaration that although life is 'vulgar . . . stagnant in darkness, dull and ordinary,' the poet 'creates from it a sweet legend . . . my legend of the enchanting and beautiful.'"&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''The Icon and the Axe'' (Vintage Books, 1970), p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

His increasing literary success was tempered for him by his sister's tuberculosis; in 1906 he traveled with her to [[Ufa Guberniya]] for treatment, and in June 1907 he took her to Finland, where she died on 28 June. The next month he returned to St. Petersburg and retired after 25 years of teaching. In the autumn of 1908 he married the translator Anastasia Chebotarevskaya (born in 1876), whom he had met at [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]]'s apartment three years before. Teffi wrote that she "reshaped his daily life in a new and unnecessary way. A big new apartment was rented, small gilt chairs were bought. The walls of the large cold office for some reason were decorated with paintings of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] by various painters... The quiet talks were replaced by noisy gatherings with dances and masks. Sologub shaved his mustache and beard, and everyone started to say that he resembled a Roman of the period of decline."&lt;ref name="Fedor Sologub"/&gt; He continued publishing poems, plays, and translations; the next year he traveled abroad for the first time, visiting France with his wife, and in September the dramatized version of ''The Petty Demon'' was published.

Between 1909 and 1911 ''The Complete Works of Fyodor Sologub'' were published in 12 volumes, and in 1911 a collection of critical works appeared, containing over 30 critical essays, notes, and reviews by famous writers. In 1913 he presented a lecture, "The Art Of These Days," that was so successful in St. Petersburg he took it on tour all over Russia. In 1914 he started a magazine, ''Dnevniki pisatelei'' (Writers' Journals), and went abroad with his wife, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] put an end to the magazine. In 1915 two collections of his stories and tales were published in English, and in 1916 ''The Petty Demon'', all translated by [[John Cournos]].

[[Image:Sologub F.K. &amp; Cebotarevskaia A.N. 1910-e Karl Bulla.jpg|thumb|250px|Fyodor Sologub &amp; Anastacia Tschebotarevskaia (1914)]]
Sologub continued touring and giving lectures, and in 1917 he welcomed the [[February Revolution]]. During the summer he headed the Soyuz Deyatelei Iskusstva (Union of Artists) and wrote articles with a strong anti-[[Bolshevik]] attitude. He was opposed to the [[October Revolution]] but remained in Petrograd and contributed to independent newspapers until they were terminated. In 1918 he spoke on behalf of the Union Of Artists; published ''Slepaia babochka'' (The Blind Butterfly), a collection of new short stories; had a play produced in Yalta; and joined the Petersburg Union of Journalists. But by the end of the year, because of Bolshevik control of publishing and bookselling, he did not have any outlets for his writing. Lev Kleinbort wrote of that period: "Sologub did not give lectures, but lived by selling his things."

Even though he was in principle opposed to emigration, the desperate condition in which he and his wife found himself caused him to apply in December 1919 for permission to leave the country; he did not receive any response.  Half a year later he wrote to Lenin personally, again without result. In mid-July 1921 he finally received a letter from [[Trotsky]] authorizing his departure, and he made plans to leave for [[Tallinn|Reval]] on 25 September. But on the evening of 23 September his wife, weakened by privation and driven to despair by the long torment of uncertainty, threw herself off the [[Tuchkov Bridge]] and drowned. 
His wife's death grieved Sologub for the rest of his life, and he referenced it often in his subsequent writing. (A poem dated 28 November 1921, begins "You took away my soul/ To the bottom of the river./ I will defy your wishes/ And follow you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sologub.narod.ru/texts/poems_anastasia.htm#1 Russian text]&lt;/ref&gt;) He gave up any thought of leaving Russia and relocated into an apartment on the banks of the Zhdanovka River, in which his wife had drowned.

In 1921 the [[New Economic Policy]] was begun, and from the end of the year his books (which had been published abroad with increasing frequency, notably in Germany and [[Estonia]]) began to appear in Soviet Russia. In December ''Fimiamy'' (Incense), a collection of poems, was published; the next two years more poetry collections and translations were published ([[Balzac]]'s ''Contes drolatiques'', [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Frédéric Mistral]]), and in 1924 the fortieth anniversary of Sologub's literary activities was celebrated at the [[Alexandrinsky Theater]] in Petersburg, with speeches by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], [[Mikhail Kuzmin]], [[Andrei Bely]], and [[Osip Mandelstam]], among others. In April of that year he was elected the honorary chairman of the Division of Translators in the Petersburg Union Of Writers, and two years later he became the chairman of the board of the Union. He had literary gatherings in his apartment, attended by such writers as [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Korney Chukovsky]]. His new poems, which had a classic simplicity, were appreciated by those to whom he read them, but they were not printed anymore.

==Death and legacy==
In May 1927 Sologub became seriously ill, and by summer he could leave his bed only rarely; his last poem was dated 1 October. After a long struggle, he died on 5 December in [[Leningrad]]. Two days later he was buried next to his wife in [[Smolensk Cemetery]].

While Sologub's novels have become his best-known works, he has always been respected by scholars and fellow authors for his poetry. 
The Symbolist poet [[Valery Bryusov]] admired the deceptive simplicity of Sologub's poetry and described it as possessing a [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkinian]] perfection of form. [[Innokenty Annensky]], another poet and contemporary of Sologub, wrote that the most original aspect of Sologub's poetry was its author's unwillingness to separate himself from his literature.

==''The Petty Demon''==

''The Petty Demon'' attempted to create a description of  ''[[poshlost']]'', a Russian concept that has characteristics of both evil and banality. The [[antihero]] is a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. The novel recounts the story of the morally corrupt Peredonov going insane and paranoid in an unnamed Russian provincial town, parallel with his struggle to be promoted to governmental inspector of his province. The [[omniscient]] [[third-person narrative]] allowed Sologub to combine his Symbolist tendencies and the tradition of Russian Realism in which he engaged throughout his earlier novels, a style similar to [[Maupassant]]'s [[fantastic realism (literature)|fantastic realism]].

Realistic elements of ''The Petty Demon'' include a vivid description of 19th-century rural everyday life, while a fantastic element is the presentation of Peredonov's hallucinations on equal terms with external events. While the book was received as an indictment of Russian society, it is a very metaphysical novel and one of the major prose works of the Russian Symbolist movement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[James H. Billington]] said of it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book puts on display a Freudian treasure chest of perversions with subtlety and credibility. The name of the novel's hero, Peredonov, became a symbol of calculating [[concupiscence]] for an entire generation... He torments his students, derives erotic satisfaction from watching them kneel to pray, and systematically befouls his apartment before leaving it as part of his generalized spite against the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Billington, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Louis Félix-Auguste-Beaujour, (Louis-Auguste Feris)''' (28 December 1765 [[Callas, Var]] – 1 July 1836, [[Paris]]) was a French [[diplomat]], politician, historian, and [[List of French ambassadors to the United States|French ambassador to the United States]].

== Biography ==
He studied in Aix-en-Provence and Paris, and entered the diplomatic service. 
He was successively secretary of legation in Munich in 1790, and Dresden in 1791, then consul general in Greece in 1794, and Consul General in charge of business in Sweden in 1799.

Back in France in 1800, [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Abbe Sieyes]], appointed him a member of the [[Tribunat]], where he was successively secretary and president of the Tribunat in 1803. 
Upon the dissolution of the assembly, he went to the United States as Commissioner General, with a mission to raise the money for the French government, that had been delegated to Mexico, by Spanish subsidies. After consul general in Washington from 1804 to 1811, he returned to France in 1814. Talleyrand made him Consul General in Smyrna in 1816, then Inspector General of the French Establishments in the Levant in 1817. In 1818, [[Louis XVIII]] gave the title of baron, and he then changed his name (Feris) to (Félix).

He was then deputy of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] from 1831 to 1834, and a [[peer of France]] in 1835. In 1836, he was elected member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. 
He founded a five-year prize, called the Felix Beaujour Awards, and awarded for the first time in 1832, awarded by the Academy, to the author of the best book on how to prevent or alleviate poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=672|title=BEAUJOUR Félix Baron de (1765-1836)|website=Appl-lachaise.net|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Baird''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born August 25, 1939) is a Canadian [[architect]] and architectural educator most closely associated with the [[University of Toronto]], although he also taught at [[Harvard University]]. Baird has been recognized for his teaching of [[architecture]] and [[urban design]] and was awarded the 2012 AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education.

==Education==
Baird was born in Toronto, and received his [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) degree from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1962. He carried out postgraduate research at University College, London.  While he was at University College, Baird co-edited the book ''Meaning in Architecture'' with [[Charles Jencks]].

==Career==
Baird returned to Canada by 1967 and joined the faculty of the School of Architecture at the University of Toronto, remaining until 1993.  He also emerged as a leading spokesman for improved urban design in Toronto.

Baird founded his architectural and urban design practice, George Baird Architect and Associates, in 1972.  In 1982 the office became Baird/Sampson Architects, and since 1998 has been Baird Sampson Neuert Architects Inc.  Projects include [[Cloud Gardens|Cloud Gardens Park]] in Toronto, Thomas L. Wells Public School in Toronto (the first LEED certified public school in Canada), the Old Post Office Plaza in St. Louis, and the Mission 2050 Research Centre at the University of Guelph in Ontario.  Baird Sampson Neuert received the RAIC Architectural Firm Award in 2007.

In 1993 Baird joined the faculty of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he taught design studio and architectural theory and served as director of master's degree programs.  In  2004, he returned to the University of Toronto to become dean of the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, a position he held until 2009.

George Harvey (1806–1876) [[Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum|The Stirling Smith Art Gallery &amp; Museum]]]]
'''Sir George Frederick Harvey''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Royal Scottish Academician|RSA]]}} (1 February 1806 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1876), [[Scotland|Scottish]] painter.

==Life==

He was the son of George Harvey, a [[watchmaker]], and Elizabeth Jeffrey and was born at 59 Main Street, [[St Ninians]], near [[Stirling]].

Soon after his birth his parents removed to Stirling, where George was apprenticed to Mr McLaren, a bookseller on Bow Street. His love for art having, however, become very decided, in his eighteenth year he entered the [[Trustees' Academy]] on Picardy Place in [[Edinburgh]]. Here he so distinguished himself that in 1826 he was invited by the Scottish artists, who had resolved to found a Scottish Academy, to join it as an associate (see [[Royal Scottish Academy]]).

Harvey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reformation|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/tullibody/STORIES/stories.html#reformation|website=Tullibody|publisher=Angel Fire|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original oil painting is rarely on display due to bad bitumen damage caused by Harvey’s experiments with varnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=George|title=Quitting the Manse|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/5023/quitting-manse-1847|website=National Galleries of Scotland|publisher=Antonia Reeve|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Tullibody Old Kirk]] which is depicted.]]
Harvey's first picture, "A Village School," was exhibited in 1826 at the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Edinburgh Institution]]; and from the time of the opening of the Academy in the following year he continued annually to exhibit. His best-known pictures are those depicting historical episodes in religious history from a puritan or evangelical point of view, such as "Covenanters' Preaching," "Covenanters' Communion," "[[John Bunyan]] and his Blind Daughter," "Sabbath Evening," and the "Quitting of the Manse."
[[File:The Curlers by Sir George Harvey.jpg|thumb|''The Curlers'' (1835) by Sir George Harvey]]
He was, however, equally popular in Scotland for subjects not directly religious; and "The Bowlers," "A Highland Funeral," "The Curlers," "A Schule Skailin'," and "Children Blowing Bubbles in the Church-yard of Greyfriars', Edinburgh," manifest the same close observation of character, artistic conception and conscientious elaboration of details. In "The Night Mail" and "Dawn Revealing the New World to Columbus" the aspects of nature are, made use of in different ways, but with equal happiness, to lend impressiveness and solemnity to human concerns. He also painted landscapes and portraits.

In 1829 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy; in 1864 he succeeded [[John Watson Gordon|Sir John Watson Gordon]] as president, a role which he held until 1876. He was knighted in 1867.

He died at 21 [[Regent Terrace]] in Edinburgh on 22 January 1876.&lt;ref name = Anne&gt;Mitchell , Anne (1993), “The People of Calton Hill”, [[Mercat Press]], James Thin, Edinburgh,  {{ISBN|1-873644-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Warriston Cemetery]] against the east wall, in the overgrown area just south of the former east gate.

==Family==

He was married firstly to Eliza Margaret Carstairs (1818-1844) and secondly to Margaret Muir (1805-1854).

==Published Works==
[[File:Georgeharvey.jpg|thumb|right|275px|"Portrait of [[Lacon Stockton]]" by George Harvey]]
Sir George Harvey was the author of a paper on the "Colour of the Atmosphere," read before the [[Edinburgh Royal Society]], and afterwards published with illustrations in ''Good Words''; and in 1870 he published a small volume entitled ''Notes of the Early History of the Royal Scottish Academy''. ''Selections from the Works of Sir George Harvey, PRSA'', described by the Rev. AL Simpson, FSA Scot., and photographed by Thomas Annan, appeared at Edinburgh in 1869.

'''Georges Raepsaet''' (born 3&amp;nbsp;August 1947) is a [[Belgians|Belgian]] [[classical archaeologist]] and [[Classical antiquity|historian of antiquity]]. His main research interests are the archaeology of ancient technologies, especially traction systems in [[Greco-Roman]] land transport and farming, the production and trade of ancient [[ceramic]]s and the wider socioeconomic implications of these technologies, as well as [[Roman Gaul]]. His methods include the use of [[Experimental archaeology|experimentation]].

== Career ==
Born in 1947 in the [[East Flanders|Eastern Flemish]] town of [[Oudenaarde]], Belgium, Raepsaet received his Master in Ancient History in 1969, and another one in Arts and Archaeology in 1972, both at the [[University of Brussels]]. In 1977 he completed his dissertation on the ''[[Pagus]] Condrustis'' and the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of Northern [[Gaul]]. In the following year, Raepsaet became senior lecturer at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] where he was appointed professor in 1992 and taught until his retirement in 2007. His courses focused, inter alia, on classical archaeology, ancient economic and social history, history of pre-industrial technologies, archaeology of Roman Gaul and excavation techniques. He founded and directed the university research units ''Laboratoire d’Archéologie classique'' and ''Centre de Recherches archéologiques''.

From 1997 to 1999 Raepsaet co-directed a research programme on the process of technological innovation in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Currently, he works as an expert for the [[European Science Foundation]] and chairs the scientific committee of the [[:fr:Musée royal de Mariemont|Museum of Mariemont]]. Since 1970 Raepsaet has been on the editorial board of the Belgian journal ''L’Antiquité Classique'' for which he has been reviewing each year about thirty books on classic archaeology, economic history and ancient technology.

[[File:Mähmaschine.jpg|thumb|Gallo-Roman [[reaper]], called ''vallus'']]

Since 1970 Raepsaet has participated in and directed several archaeological excavations and fieldworks in Western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean basin. These include underwater excavations at [[Martigues]], France, and [[Amathus]] on [[Cyprus]], as well as fieldwork at the site of the ''[[Diolkos]]'' on the [[Isthmus of Corinth|Isthmus]] and [[Styra]] on [[Euboea]] (1984–88). He also took part in excavations in [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], Syria (1978–79) and in numerous archaeological projects on the Roman period in his native Belgium (since 1968). At Brussels he was in charge of temporary exhibitions of [[Ancient Greek]] marbles (''Marbres helléniques'', 1987–88) and of [[Thracian gold]] (''Europalia Bulgarie'', 2002).

From 1997 to 2007 Raepsaet conducted a number of tests in [[experimental archaeology]] on ancient agricultural techniques, in particular on the efficiency of [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] and the [[reaper]] (''vallus''). Over the years Raepsaet has also been active in the study of the technology and trade of [[Ancient Roman pottery|Roman ceramics]], its distribution and transport network in the [[Roman province]]s and commercial and legal aspects related to it.

== Ancient technology and productivity ==
Much of Raepsaet's research since the 1970s has addressed and challenged the idea, still dominant at the time, of a lack of productivity of the [[Roman economy]]. Raepsaet criticized the "epistemological prejudice" particularly prevalent in studies of the 1960s and 1970s: these analyzed the classical world in terms of stagnation and technological blockage, effectively preventing scholarship from approaching the sizable corpus of evidence to the contrary from an unbiased perspective.&lt;ref name="Raepsaet 2008, 580–605"&gt;Raepsaet, Georges: "Landtransport, Part 2: Riding, Harnesses, and Vehicles", in [[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;580–605, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518731-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raepsaet focused on the key role of traction systems in land transport and [[plough]]ing, a field then dominated by strong primitivist views. He demonstrated that ancient transport capacities were in fact largely identical to and as developed and efficient as those of later periods up until the 19th century, but with the Romans enjoying the additional advantage of having a superior [[Roman roads|road network]] at their disposal. Through his study of Gallo-Roman harnesses, Raepsaet came to reject the early, but influential theory of [[Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes]] about the inefficiency of the Roman [[horse collar]]. In reality, draught animals in antiquity were able to move heavy loads of several dozens tons overland evident, for example, in the frequent transport of [[ancient monolith]]s or the regular use of the ''Diolkos'' ship trackway.&lt;ref name="Raepsaet 2008, 580–605"/&gt;

Raepsaet′s reappraisal of the technological level of ancient traction systems has been echoed and parallelled by a generation of classical scholars and historians of technology pursuing studies in diverse fields of ancient technology. From their collaborative effort to move beyond a sterile dichotomy of primitivism and modernism sprang, for example, [[Brill Publishers|Brill]]′s series on ''Technology and Change in History'' and the ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'' which received the 2009 book award of the [[Society for the History of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Brill: [http://www.brill.nl/tch Technology and Change in History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Society for the History of Technology: [http://www.historyoftechnology.org/awards/ferguson.html The Ferguson Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The increasingly positive perception of ancient technological developments and their economic impact has also contributed to a reevaluation of the performance of the ancient economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]]; [[Ian Morris (historian)|Morris, Ian]] ; Saller, Richard (eds.): ''The Cambridge Economic History of the Greco-Roman World'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-521-78053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gold working in the Bronze Age British Isles''' refers to the use of [[gold]] to produce ornaments and other prestige items in the [[British Isles]] during the [[Bronze Age]], between circa 2500 and c.800 BCE in Britain, and up to about 550 BCE in Ireland. In this period, communities in Britain and Ireland first learned how to work metal, leading to the widespread creation of not only gold but also [[copper]] and [[bronze]] items as well. Gold artefacts in particular were  prestige items used to designate the high status of those individuals who wore, or were buried with them.

Around 1,500 gold objects dating to the Bronze Age survive in collections, around 1000 of them from Ireland and the other 500 from Britain; this is a much smaller number than would have been originally crafted, leading archaeologists to believe that "many thousands of gold objects were made and used" in the Bronze Age British Isles.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 1"/&gt;
[[File:Gold collar ( 800-700 BC) from Co Clare (detail).jpg|thumb|Irish gold "gorget", 800-700 BC, found [[Tonyhill]], Co Clare. [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology|NMI, Dublin]]]]
Records indicate that Bronze Age gold artefacts had begun to be discovered by the 18th century at the least, although at the time many were melted down or lost. Only with the rise of the [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] and then [[archaeology|archaeological]] movements were the antiquity of these items recognised, after which they were more usually preserved in collections.
The archaeologist [[George Eogan]] noted that investigation of Bronze Age gold artefacts revealed not only "the work of craftsmen and technicians" from that period but also aided our understanding of "broader aspects of society such as social stratification, trade, commerce and ritual."&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 1"/&gt;

==Background==

===Gold and gold-working in prehistoric Europe===
In prehistory gold could be found in several areas of Europe; the Carpathian region, Iberia, south-western France, Brittany, Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 1"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col79|Coles and Harding 1979]]. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter in particular had rich gold reserves, and as such has been labelled an "ancient ''[[El Dorado]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haw61|Hawkes 1961]]. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, and in many cultures, gold has been highly valued as a [[precious metal]], in part because of its rarity and also because of its properties; for instance, unlike copper it is [[malleable]], flexible and homogenous, and can be worked by hammering, rather than having to be worked through casting, annealing or soldering. Any products made from gold do not corrode, but instead have what has been described as an "intrinsic beauty", with many prehistoric peoples probably ascribing gold items a "symbolic as well as a decorative function".&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 1"/&gt;

===Bronze Age Britain and Ireland===
First developed in 1836 by Danish archaeologist [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] as a part of his "[[Three-age system]]", the term "[[Bronze Age]]" is used by archaeologists to refer to those societies which have developed bronze technology but not yet learned how to work the more complicated process involved in making [[iron]] objects. The [[Bronze Age Europe|European Bronze Age]] lasted from circa 3200 BCE, when the [[Aegean civilizations]] of Greece first developed bronze technology, right through to c.600 BCE, when the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] came to an end with the development of iron among Scandinavian communities.

[[Image:Beaker culture.png|thumb|200px|left|The extent of the "Beaker Package" across Europe, which was accompanied by the use of Beaker pottery, metal and specialised burials.]]

The period known by archaeologists as [[Bronze Age Britain]] lasted from c.2500 BCE through to c.800 BCE, and was defined by the adoption of copper and bronze technologies on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adk08|Adkins, Adkins and Leitch 2008]]. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bronze Age Ireland]] followed a similar, yet distinct course.

The Early Bronze Age in the British Isles was marked by the adoption of what archaeologists call the "[[Beaker culture]]", which had arrived from continental Europe. Eogan noted that the "evidence from archaeology is that Beaker-using communities were the earliest metallurgists in Britain and Ireland", with their produce including "copper artefacts such as tanged daggers but also gold objects as well as the use of gold for embellishment."&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 13"/&gt;

==Styles and development==
[[File:British Museum gold thing 501594 fh000035.jpg|thumb|The [[Mold Cape]] is a unique survival from North Wales. British Museum]]
Bronze Age goldwork is marked by an elegant simplicity of design and fine execution, with decoration usually restricted to relatively simple geometric patterns such as parallel lines, chevron, zig-zag and circular patterns, often extremely small and perfectly executed, especially in Ireland, as can be seen by enlarging the lunula and Irish bracelet illustrated.  The objects are nearly all pieces of jewellery, and include clothes-fasteners (somewhat like large one-piece [[cuff-links]]), [[torc]]s, [[bracelets]], [[gold lunula]]e, smaller ornaments that were perhaps worn in the ear, nose or hair, or on clothing as brooches, and a range of thin disc or plaques probably sewn to clothing or worn in the hair. The ends of objects that are essentially bars bent into a round shape often thicken before ending in a flat or concave face, as for example in the [[Milton Keynes Hoard]]. The thickening is typically slight in torcs and bracelets, but extreme in clothes fasteners and ear decorations.  Tightly wound spirals in pairs are popular, as they were on the continent.

===Early Bronze Age===
Eogan (1994) noted that around 250 surviving gold objects are known to date to the Early Bronze Age, 165 of those from Ireland, and the other 83 from Britain.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 13"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; From analysing the designs of the earliest gold artefacts in Britain, Eogan noted that they "form a homogeneous group" which, when "taken in conjunction with other metal types demonstrate that a new technology was introduced."&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 18"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bronze Age pieces are generally much smaller, with very thin decorated discs or plaques common.  Two small gold cups have been found in England, the [[Rillaton Cup]] and the similar but now crushed [[Ringlemere Cup]].

Due to its natural resources, Ireland had a "rich Early Bronze Age [metal-working] industry", producing large quantities of metal axes, halberds and daggers, and as a part of this also had a "major gold industry", seeing the production of [[Gold lunula|lunula]]e and gold disks on a far larger scale than Britain.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 37"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Bronze Age===
[[File:Lambourne Hoard.jpg|thumb|left|The Lambourn Hoard, from [[Lambourn]], [[Berkshire]], with three bracelets and two folded twisted torcs ([[West Berkshire Museum]]).]]
The transition to the Late Bronze Age brought societal change to the British Isles, and also apparently increased availability of gold, which led to a trend to much larger and more massive pieces. The largest were jewellery worn round the neck in a range of styles, the most ostentatious wide flat collars or gorgets with ribbed decoration following the shape of the piece, and round discs at the side.  The [[Mold Cape]] is unique among survivals, but fits in with the trend to massive pieces emphasizing the neck and chest.  It was clearly not for prolonged wear, as the wearer could not raise their arms. In Ireland, lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold [[torc]]s, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular "gorgets" of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 88-89; 3:19-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs based on twisted bars or ribbons giving a spiral became popular, probably influenced by the Continent. "Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive", perhaps indicating "a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years", into the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold in Bronze Age society==

===Social stratification===
[[File:Burton Hoard.jpg|thumb|The Burton Hoard, from [[Burton, Wrexham]]. The gold items are a folded torc, a twisted-wire bracelet, a necklace pendant, 4 beads and 3 rings ([[National Museum Wales]]).]]
In Bronze Age Britain, gold objects were prestigious items, and archaeologists believe that those who owned them, or were buried with them, had a high status in society. Archaeologist George Eogan noted that gold reflected "ostentation in society, a society that has divisions along rank."&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 38"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==
Archaeologist George Eogan, in his study of Bronze Age gold-working, noted that very few  Bronze Age gold artefacts had been discovered through "controlled archaeological investigation", with the majority instead having been unearthed "by chance", as a result of "agricultural activities or peat-cutting".&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 2"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
Antiquarian interest in the gold artefacts of prehistory emerged in the British Isles during the [[Early Modern period]]. In 1696, the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], southern England obtained the [[Ballyshannon Disk]], the first such artefact of its type in their collection, although in ensuing centuries they would gain a number of other items to accompany it.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 3"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum]] in London would follow suit almost a century later, gaining its first Bronze Age gold artefact, a disk from [[Kirk Andrews]] on the Isle of Man, in 1782.&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 4"&gt;[[#Eog94|Eogan 1994]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1980, Joan J. Taylor published the first comprehensive study of the available evidence, entitled ''Bronze Age Goldwork of the British Isles''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tay80|Taylor 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the archaeologist George Eogan published an academic monograph on the subject, entitled ''The Accomplished Art: Gold and Gold-Working in Britain and Ireland during the Bronze Age'', which was brought out through the U.K.-based Oxbow Books. In it, Eogan noted that his study was "not a ''corpus'' or catalogue" of artefacts, instead being "an evaluation and interpretation of the material in social terms".&lt;ref name="Eogan 1994 1"/&gt;

The '''Great Divergence''' is a term made popular by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]'s book by that title, (also known as the '''European miracle''', a term coined by [[Eric Jones (economic historian)|Eric Jones]] in 1981){{sfn|Jones|2003}} referring to the process by which the [[Western world]] (i.e. [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]], eclipsing [[Medieval India]], [[Qing China]], the [[Islamic World]], [[Joseon Korea]], and [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]].

Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, [[colonialism]], resources, and "accidents of history".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

''Technological Forecasting and Social Change''. Volume 95, June 2015, Page 163].&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances, in areas such as [[railroads]], [[steamboats]], [[mining]], and [[agriculture]], were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of [[coal]] as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production.

==Terminology and definition==

The term "Great Divergence" was coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} in 1996 and used by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] in his book ''The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy'' (2000).

==Conditions in pre-Great Divergence cores==

Unlike modern industrial economies, pre-modern economies were constrained by conditions which greatly limited economic growth. Although core regions in Eurasia had achieved a relatively high standard of living by the 18th century, shortages of land, soil degradation, deforestation, lack of dependable energy sources, and other ecological constraints limited growth in per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=219}} Rapid rates of depreciation on capital meant that a great part of savings in pre-modern economies were spent on replacing depleted capital, hampering [[capital accumulation]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Massive windfalls of fuel, land, food and other resources were necessary for continued growth and capital accumulation, leading to [[colonialism]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=241}}
The Industrial Revolution overcame these restraints, allowing rapid, sustained growth in per capita incomes for the first time in human history.

===Western Europe===

After the [[Viking]], Muslim and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions waned in the 10th century, Europe entered a period of prosperity, population growth and territorial expansion known as the [[High Middle Ages]].
Trade and commerce revived, with increased specialization between areas and between the countryside and artisans in towns.
By the 13th century the best land had been occupied and agricultural income began to fall, though trade and commerce continued to expand, especially in [[Venice]] and other northern Italian cities.
The 14th century brought a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]]: famines, wars, the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics.
The resulting drop in the population led to falling rents and rising wages, undermining the [[feudal]] and [[manorial]] relationships that had characterized Medieval Europe.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=11–13}}

According to a 2014 study, "there was a ‘little divergence’ within Europe between 1300 and 1800: real wages in the North Sea area more or less stabilized at the level attained after the Black Death, and remained relatively high (above subsistence) throughout the early modern period (and into the nineteenth century); whereas, on the other hand, real wages in the ‘periphery’ (in Germany, Italy, and Spain) began to fall after the fifteenth century and returned to some kind of subsistence minimum during the 1500–1800 period. This ‘little divergence’ in real wages mirrors a similar divergence in GDP per capita: in the ‘periphery’ of Europe there was almost no per capita growth (or even a decline) between 1500 and 1800, whereas in Holland and England real income continued to rise and more or less doubled in this period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolt|first=Jutta|last2=van Zanden|first2=Jan Luiten|date=2014-08-01|title=The Maddison Project: collaborative research on historical national accounts|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=627–651|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12032|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Exploration]] navigators discovered new routes to the Americas and Asia.
Commerce expanded, together with innovations such as [[joint stock companies]] and various financial institutions.
New military technologies favored larger units, leading to a concentration of power in states whose finances relied on trade.
France and Spain developed absolute monarchies reliant on high taxes and state-backed monopolies, leading to economic decline.
The [[Dutch Republic]] was controlled by merchants, while [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] gained control of England after a long struggle culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]].
These arrangements proved more hospitable to economic development.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=16–18}}
At the end of the 16th century London and Antwerp began pulling away from other European cities, as illustrated in the following graph of real wages in several European cities:{{sfn|Allen|2001}}

[[File:European cities real wages.png|600px|center]]

The West had a series of unique advantages compared to Asia, such as the proximity of coal mines; the discovery of the [[New World]], which alleviated ecological restraints on economic growth (land shortages etc.); and the profits from colonization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=31–69, 187}}

===China===

China had a larger population than Europe throughout the Common Era.{{sfn|Feuerwerker|1990|p=227}}
Unlike Europe, it was politically united for long periods during that time.

During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=7, 113–199}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen N.|last2=Guan|first2=Hanhui|last3=Li|first3=David D.|date=2017-04-01|title=China, Europe and the Great Divergence: A Study in Historical National Accounting, 980-1850|ssrn=2957511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastery of [[paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jurchen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics.

In the [[Late Imperial China|late imperial period]] (1368–1911), comprising the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, [[Taxation in premodern China|taxation]] was low, and the economy and population grew significantly, though without substantial increases in productivity.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=91–92, 203–204}}
Chinese goods such as [[silk]], [[tea]] and [[ceramic art|ceramics]] were in great demand in Europe, leading to an inflow of silver, expanding the money supply and facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|pp=587, 590}}
By the end of the 18th century, population density levels exceeded those in Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=569}} China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=579}} The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750, before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen|last2=Gupta|first2=Bishnupriya|date=2006-02-01|title=The early modern great divergence: wages, prices and economic development in Europe and Asia, 1500–18001|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=2–31|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00331.x|issn=1468-0289|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1709/1/WRAP_Broadberry_CEPR-DP4947%5B1%5D.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist scholarship, however, estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=36, 219–225}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|pages=101–108|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
{{Main|Economic history of the Ottoman Empire}}

The [[Middle East]] was more advanced than Western Europe in 1000 CE, on par by the middle of the 16th century, but by 1750, leading Middle-Eastern states had fallen behind the leading Western European states of Britain and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|date=2017-06-15|title=Jared Rubin: Rulers, religion, and riches: Why the West got rich and the Middle East did not?|journal=Public Choice|language=en|pages=1–4|doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0464-6|issn=0048-5829|volume=172|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Islahi|first=Abdul Azim|title=Book review.

An example of a Middle-Eastern country that had an advanced economy in the early 19th century was [[Ottoman Egypt]], which had a highly productive industrial [[manufacturing]] sector, and [[per-capita income]] that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as [[France]] and higher than that of [[Japan]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="batou" /&gt; Other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], particularly [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and southeastern [[Anatolia]], also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began programs of state-sponsored [[industrialization]], which included setting up factories for weapons production, an [[iron]] [[foundry]], large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for [[ginning]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing. By the early 1830s, Egypt had 30 [[cotton mill]]s, employing about 30,000 workers.&lt;ref name="lockman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes on Egyptian Workers' History|author=Zachary Lockman|journal=International Labor and Working-Class History|issue=18|date=Fall 1980|pages=1–12|jstor=27671322}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, Egypt had the world's fifth most productive [[cotton industry]], in terms of the number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|page=181|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as [[animal power]], [[water wheel]]s, and [[windmill]]s, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870.&lt;ref name="batou193"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA193|pages=193–196|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[steam power]] had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer [[Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]] in 1551, when he invented a [[steam jack]] driven by a rudimentary [[steam turbine]],&lt;ref name="Hassan"&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]] (1976), ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', p. 34–35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, [[University of Aleppo]]&lt;/ref&gt; it was under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in the early 19th century that [[steam engine]]s were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt; [[Boiler]]s were manufactured and installed in Egyptian industries such as [[ironworks]], textile manufacturing, [[paper mill]]s, and [[hulling]] mills. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the [[Nile]]. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

After the death of Muhammad Ali in 1849, his industrialization programs fell into decline, after which, according to historian Zachary Lockman, “Egypt was well on its way to full integration into a European-dominated world market as supplier of a single raw material, cotton.” Lockman argues that, had Egypt succeeded in its industrialization programs, “it might have shared with Japan [or the United States] the distinction of achieving autonomous capitalist development and preserving its independence.”&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt;

===Japan===

Japanese society was governed by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], which divided Japanese society into a strict hierarchy and intervened considerably in the economy through state monopolies{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=251}} and [[Sakoku Edict of 1635|restrictions on foreign trade]]; however, in practice, the Shogunate's rule was often circumvented.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=214}} From 725-1974, Japan experienced GDP per capita growth at an annual rate of 0.04%, with major periods of positive per capita GDP growth occurring during 1150-1280, 1450-1600 and after 1730.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Oxford-Economic-and-Social-History-Working-Papers/japan-and-the-great-divergence-730-1874|title=Japan and the Great Divergence, 730-1874 {{!}} Oxford Economic and Social History Working Papers {{!}} Working Papers|website=www.economics.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no significant periods of sustained growth reversals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relative to the United Kingdom, GDP per capita was at roughly similar levels until the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan and the Great Divergence|last=Francks|first=Penelope|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|pages=31–38|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-57673-6_4|chapter = Japan in the Great Divergence Debate: The Quantitative Story|isbn = 978-1-137-57672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, per capita incomes in Japan were approximately a quarter of the British level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, 18th-century Japan had a higher [[life expectancy]], 41.1 years for adult males,{{failed verification|date= January 2018}} compared with 31.6 to 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}}

===Korea===

In its earlier days, Korea had healthy international trading relationships, receiving merchants from as far as the Middle East.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=137}}  Because of its strategic value to its neighboring countries, however, Korea had been invaded several times during its Goryeo and Joseon eras, starting with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Though repelled due to its strong navy and aid from China, the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century were particularly devastating to the peninsula and it never truly recovered until the modern era.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=165–168, 229–250}} Due to relatively frequent invasions, increased Western colonization of Asia, and the arrival of Christian missionaries, Korea began a long period of isolationism, maintaining diplomatic relationships primarily with China only.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=274}} For the rest of the Joseon period, the country was marred by economic hardships, peasant revolts, and political factionalism until it was annexed by Japan in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=270–273}}

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
Pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa was politically fragmented, just as early modern Europe was.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/state-capacity-and-economic-development/650D0C46C22E8BB53D3F5A47F085DB78|title=State Capacity and Economic Development by Mark Dincecco|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa was however far more sparsely populated than Europe.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to University of Michigan political scientist Mark Dincecco, "the high land/ labor ratio may have made it less likely that historical institutional centralization at the “national level” would occur in sub-Saharan Africa, thwarting further state development."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The transatlantic slave trade may have further weakened state power in Africa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Possible factors==

Scholars have proposed numerous theories to explain why the Great Divergence occurred.

===Coal===
[[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|upright|The distribution of coal deposits shaped industrial development in Britain.]]
In metallurgy and steam engines the Industrial Revolution made extensive use of coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] - as cheaper, more plentiful and more efficient than wood and [[charcoal]].
Coal-fired steam engines also operated in the railways and in shipping, revolutionizing transport in the early 19th century.

Kenneth Pomeranz drew attention to differences in the availability of coal between West and East. Due to regional climate, European coal mines were wetter, and deep mines did not become practical until the introduction of the [[Newcomen steam engine]] to pump out groundwater.  In mines in the arid northwest of China, ventilation to prevent explosions was much more difficult.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=65}}

Another difference involved geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable mining technologies, the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits differed vastly. The largest coal deposits in China are located in the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the [[Northern Song]] (960-1127). During the 11th century China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}} The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some small coal deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=62–66}} - all within a relatively compact island.

[[Ottoman Egypt]], which used steam power for industrial manufacturing [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali|under Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (ruled 1805-1848), had a lack of coal resources. However, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits, and [[boiler]]s were manufactured and installed in various industries. Egypt also imported coal from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Cairo gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]], which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that, in addition to having the necessary conditions for rapid industrialization, Egypt also had the necessary conditions for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Efficiency of markets and state intervention===
A common argument is that Europe had more free and efficient markets than other civilizations, which has been cited as a reason for the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=70}} In Europe, market efficiency was disrupted by the prevalence of [[feudalism]] and [[mercantilism]]. Practices such as [[entail]], which restricted land ownership, hampered the free flow of labor and buying and selling of land. These feudal restrictions on land ownership were especially strong in continental Europe. China had a relatively more liberal land market, hampered only by weak customary traditions.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}} Bound labor, such as [[serfdom]] and [[slavery]] were more prevalent in Europe than in China, even during the Manchu conquest.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=82}} Urban industry in the West was more restrained by [[guild]]s and state-enforced monopolies than in China, where in the 18th century the principal monopolies governed salt and foreign trade through [[Guangzhou]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=87, 196}}  Pomeranz rejects the view that market institutions were the cause of the Great Divergence, and concludes that China was closer to the ideal of a market economy than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] presents a contrary argument, that Western countries such as the United States, Britain and Spain did not initially have [[free trade]], but had [[protectionist]] policies in the early 19th century, as did China and Japan. In contrast, he cites the [[Ottoman Empire]] as an example of a state that did have free trade, which he argues had a negative economic impact and contributed to its [[deindustrialization]]. The Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports, which has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to only 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate:&lt;ref name="bairoch31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been free trade in Turkey, and what has it produced? It has destroyed some of the finest manufactures of the world. As late as 1812 these manufactures existed; but they have been destroyed. That was the consequences of competition in Turkey, and its effects have been as pernicious as the effects of the contrary principle in Spain.}}

===State prohibition of new technology===
[[Jared Diamond]] in the book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' argues that explicit outlawing of new technology was an important explanation for the divergence. For example, in China in 1432, a new Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was the world leader at the time. Diamond traces this to differences in geography. Outside Europe advanced cultures developed in areas whose [[geography]] was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires. In these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist. On the other hand, Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, as its many natural barriers (mountains, rivers) provide defensible borders. As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly. He argues that geographical factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change (Spain succeeded by France and then by the United Kingdom) than was possible elsewhere in Eurasia.

===Innovation===
Beginning in the early 19th century, economic prosperity rose greatly in the West due to improvements in technological efficiency,{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} as evidenced by the advent of new conveniences including the [[railroad]], steamboat, steam engine, and the use of [[coal]] as a fuel source.  These innovations contributed to the Great Divergence, elevating [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] to high economic standing relative to the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

It has been argued the attitude of the [[Eastern world|East]] towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to [[David Landes]], after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement on the basis of their indigenous traditions and achievements.{{sfn|Landes|2006|p=5}} The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.{{sfn|Lin|1995|p=276}}

In the early 19th century, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began a program of state-sponsored [[industrialization]],&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt; quick to adopt [[steam engine]] technology, and manufacturing [[boiler]]s for installation in a number of industries, including [[ironworks]], [[textile manufacturing]], [[paper mill]]s, and [[hulling]] mills.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt; While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits in Egypt while importing coal from overseas at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s when Egypt gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]] with its yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that Egypt had the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization in the early 19th century, and for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Wages and living standards===
Classical economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]] and [[Thomas Malthus]], argued that high wages in the West stimulated labor-saving technological advancements.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=49}}{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=525–526}} Economic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, more recent studies have depicted [[living standards]] in 18th century China and pre-Industrial Revolution Europe as comparable.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=36}} Life expectancy in China and Japan for adult males were 39.6 and 41.1 respectively, compared with 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}} Chinese laborers in the Yangtze delta consumed 4,600 calories per day on average (laborers in China overall consumed 2,637 calories on average) compared with 2,000-2,500 calories per day for England.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=39}} According to Pomeranz and others, there was modest per capita growth in both regions,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=107}} the Chinese economy was not stagnant, and in many areas, especially agriculture, was ahead of Western Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=45–48}} Chinese cities were also ahead in public health.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=46}} Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] estimated that China's GNP per capita in 1800 was $228 in 1960 [[US dollars]] (${{Inflation|US|228|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than Western Europe's $213 (${{Inflation|US|213|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars) at the time.&lt;ref name="braude534"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century|volume=3|author=[[Fernand Braudel]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1982|page=534|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&amp;pg=PA534|isbn=9780520081161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been similar findings for India. [[Real wages]] and living standards in 18th-century [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}}&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; Workers in the [[textile industry]], for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}} In the late 18th century, Mysore's average [[per-capita income]] was five times higher than [[subsistence]] level,{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|p=45}} i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 [[international dollars]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Economy Volume 1: A Millennial Perspective Volume 2: Historical Statistics|author=[[Angus Maddison]]|publisher=Academic Foundation|year=2007|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I242EL00ieAC&amp;pg=PA260|isbn=9788171886135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2007), ''Contours of the World Economy, 1–2030 AD. Essays in Macro-Economic History'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-922721-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;382, table A.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly for [[Ottoman Egypt]], its per-capita income in 1800 was comparable to that of leading Western European countries such as [[France]], and higher than the overall average income of Europe and Japan.&lt;ref name="batou"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|pages=181–196|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian Jean Barou estimated that, in terms of 1960 dollars, [[Egypt]] in 1800 had a per-capita income of $232 (${{Inflation|US|232|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars). In comparison, per-capita income in terms of 1960 dollars for France in 1800 was $240 (${{Inflation|US|240|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), for [[Eastern Europe]] in 1800 was $177 (${{Inflation|US|177|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), and for Japan in 1800 was $180 (${{Inflation|US|180|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref name="batou189"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty From The Wealth of Nations: Integration and Polarization in the Global Economy since 1760|author=[[M.

According to Paul Bairoch, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"/&gt; He estimated that, in 1750, the average [[GNP per capita]] in the [[Eastern world]] (particularly China, India and the Middle East) was $188 in 1960 dollars (${{Inflation|US|188|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than the West's $182 (${{Inflation|US|182|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|page=104|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it was after 1800 that Western European per-capita income pulled ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John M.

===European colonialism===
A number of economic historians have argued that [[European colonialism]] played a major role in the [[deindustrialization]] of non-Western societies. [[Paul Bairoch]], for example, cites [[British colonialism]] in India as a primary example, but also argues that European [[colonialism]] played a major role in the deindustrialization of other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and [[Latin America]], and contributed to a sharp economic decline in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=88–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern [[Economic history|economic historians]] have blamed [[British Empire|British colonial rule]] for India's deindustrialization in particular.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; The colonization of India is seen as a major factor behind both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt;

Up until the 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer,{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} with [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] the centers of cotton production.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}} In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress for [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], while implementing [[protectionist]] policies such as bans and [[tariff]]s to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Process of Economic Development|author=James Cypher|year=2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxFxAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|isbn=9781136168284}}&lt;/ref&gt; India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large [[captive market]] for British manufactured goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India|author=[[Henry Yule]], [[A. C. Burnell]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the capital amassed from [[Bengal]] following its conquest after the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of [[British India]]'s economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colonial Power, Colonial Texts: India in the Modern British Novel|first=M.

===Luxury consumption===
Luxury consumption is regarded by many scholars to have stimulated the development of [[capitalism]] and thus contributed to the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=114–115}} Proponents of this view argue that workshops, which manufactured luxury articles for the wealthy, gradually amassed capital to expand their production and then emerged as large firms producing for a mass market; they believe that Western Europe's unique tastes for luxury stimulated this development further than other cultures. However, others counter that luxury workshops were not unique to Europe; large cities in China and Japan also possessed many luxury workshops for the wealthy,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=163}} and that luxury workshops do not necessarily stimulate the development of "capitalistic firms".{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=164}}

===Property rights===
Differences in property rights have been cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Weingast|first2=Barry R.|date=1989|title=Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England|jstor=2122739|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=49|issue=4|pages=803–832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James|date=2005|title=The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change, and Economic Growth|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=546–579|doi=10.1257/0002828054201305|issn=0002-8282|hdl=1721.1/64034}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view states that Asian merchants could not develop and accumulate capital because of the risk of state expropriation and claims from fellow kinsmen, which made property rights very insecure compared to those of Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=169}} However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and that the threat of expropriation by Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=170}}

Government and policies are seen as an integral part of modern societies and have played a major role in how different economies have been formed. The Eastern societies had governments which were controlled by the ruling dynasties and thus, were not a separate entity. Their governments at the time lacked policies that fostered innovation and thus resulted in slow advancements. As explained by Cohen, the east had a restrictive system of trade that went against the free world market theory; there was no political liberty or policies that encouraged the capitalist market (Cohen, 1993). This was in contrast to the western society that developed commercial laws and property rights which allowed for the protection and liberty of the marketplace. Their capitalist ideals and market structures encouraged innovation.{{sfn|Landes|2006}}{{sfn|Lin|1995}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|year=1986|publisher=New York Basic Books |title=How The West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation Of The Industrial World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waley-Cohen|first=Joanna|title=China and Western Technology in the Late Eighteenth Century|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1993|volume=99|issue=5|pages=1525–1544|jstor=2167065|doi=10.2307/2167065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomeranz (2000) argues that much of the land market in China was free, with many supposedly hereditary tenants and landlords being frequently removed or forced to sell their land. Although Chinese customary law specified that people within the village were to be offered the land first, Pomeranz states that most of the time the land was offered to more capable outsiders, and argues that China actually had a freer land market than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}
Pomeranz does not address the most common form of land sale, known as the conditional sale. The conditional sale allowed the seller to return to the buyer many years after the sale, and many times, to demand extra payments. He also does not account for the inability of landlords to collect rent on second crops.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}}

However, [[Robert Brenner]] and Chris Isett emphasize differences in land tenancy rights.  They argue that in the lower Yangtze, most farmers either owned land or held secure tenancy at fixed rates of rent, so that neither farmers nor landlords were exposed to competition. In 15th century England, lords had lost their serfs, but were able to assert control over almost all of the land, creating a rental market for tenant farmers.  This created competitive pressures against subdividing plots, and the fact that plots could not be directly passed on to sons forced them to delay marriage until they had accumulated their own possessions.  Thus in England both agricultural productivity and population growth were subject to market pressures throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Brenner|Isett|2002}}

A 2017 study found that secure property rights in Europe, but not in large parts of the Middle-East, contributed to the increase of expensive labour-saving capital goods, such as water-mills, windmills, and cranes, in medieval Europe but its decrease in the Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Bavel|first=Bas|last2=Buringh|first2=Eltjo|last3=Dijkman|first3=Jessica|title=Mills, cranes, and the great divergence: the use of immovable capital goods in western Europe and the Middle East, ninth to sixteenth centuries|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/ehr.12571|issn=1468-0289|volume=71|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World===
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|Distribution of [[colonial empire]]s by the end of the 18th century]]
A variety of theories posit Europe's unique relationship with the New World as a major cause of the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7&amp;nbsp;percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on pre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=190}} According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=264}} New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to {{convert|25|e6acre|km2}} of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=266}}

Chen (2012) also suggested that the New World as a necessary factor for industrialization, and trade as a supporting factor causing less developed areas to concentrate on agriculture supporting industrialized regions in Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}}

===High-level equilibrium trap===
The [[high-level equilibrium trap]] theory argues that China did not undergo an indigenous industrial revolution since its economy was in a stable equilibrium, where supply and demand for labor were equal, disincentivizing the development of labor-saving capital.

===Culture===
Rosenberg and Birdzell claims that the so-called "eastern culture" of "respect" and "unquestionable devotion" to the ruling dynasty was as a result of a culture where the control of the dynasty led to a "silent society" that "did not ask questions or experiment without the approval or order from the ruling class". On the other hand, they claimed that the West of the late medieval era did not have a central authority or absolute state, which allowed for a free flow of ideas (Rosenberg, Birdzell, 1986). This so-called "eastern culture" also supposedly showed a "dismissal of change" due to their "fear of failure" and disregard for the imitation of outside inventions and science; this was different from the "western culture" which they claimed to be willing to experiment and imitate others to benefit their society. They claimed that this was a culture where change was encouraged, and sense of anxiety and disregard for comfort led them to be more innovative. [[Max Weber]] argued in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the [[Protestant work ethic]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]])  influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In his book ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' he blames Chinese culture for the non-emergence of capitalism in China. Chen (2012) similarly claims that cultural differences were the most fundamental cause for the divergence, arguing that the [[Humanism]] of the [[Renaissance]] followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (including revolutionary changes in attitude towards religion) enabled a mercantile, innovative, individualistic, and capitalistic spirit. For [[Ming Dynasty]] China, he claims there existed repressive measures which stifled dissenting opinions and nonconformity. He claimed that [[Confucianism]] taught that disobedience to one's superiors was supposedly tantamount to "sin". In addition Chen claimed that merchants and artificers had less prestige than they did in Western Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}} [[Justin Yifu Lin]] has argued for the role of the [[imperial examination]] system in removing the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation.&lt;ref name=Lin2011&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, "Demystifying the Chinese Economy", 2011, Cambridge University Press, Preface xiv, http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many scholars who have studied Confucian teachings have criticized the claim that the philosophy promoted unquestionable loyalty to one's superiors and the state. The core of Confucian philosophy itself was already [[Humanism|Humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|Rationalistic]]; it "[does] not share a belief in divine law and [does] not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will."&lt;ref name="juergensmeyer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer |first= Mark |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location = |isbn = 978-0-19-518835-6 |page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the central teachings of Confucianism is that one should remonstrate with authority. Many Confucians throughout history disputed their superiors in order to not only prevent the superiors and the rulers from wrongdoing, but also to maintain the independent spirits of the Confucians.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Xu Fuguan 徐復觀, ''Xueshu yu Zhengzhi zhi jian'' 學術與政治之間. (Taibei: Taiwan Xuesheng Shuju, 1980), 101–126, 331–395, 497–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the merchant class of China throughout all of Chinese history were usually wealthy and held considerable influence above their supposed social standing.&lt;ref name=Gernet /&gt; Historians like Yu Yingshi and Billy So have shown that as Chinese society became increasingly commercialized from the [[Song dynasty]] onward, Confucianism had gradually begun to accept and even support business and trade as legitimate and viable professions, as long as merchants stayed away from unethical actions. Merchants in the meantime had also benefited from and utilized Confucian ethics in their business practices. By the Song period, the [[Scholar-officials]] themselves were using intermediary agents to participate in trading.&lt;ref name=Gernet&gt;Gernet, Jacques (1962). ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright. Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}} pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
This is true especially in the [[Ming]]-[[Qing]] dynasties, when the social status of merchants had rose to such significance&lt;ref&gt;Yu Yingshi 余英時, ''Zhongguo Jinshi Zongjiao Lunli yu Shangren Jingshen'' 中國近世宗教倫理與商人精神.

Of the developed cores of the [[Old world]], India was distinguished by its [[Caste system in India|caste system]] of bound labor, which hampered economic and population growth and resulted in relative underdevelopment compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their [[Unfree labour|unfree laborers]] harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit and the development of markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India was not a very likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=212–214}}

Aspects of [[Islamic law]] have been proposed as an argument for the divergence for the [[Muslim world]]. Economist [[Timur Kuran]] argues that Islamic institutions which had at earlier stages promoted development later started preventing more advanced development by hampering formation of corporations, capital accumulation, mass production, and impersonal transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran, ''The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East'', 2010, Princeton University Press, http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9273.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar arguments proposed include the gradual prohibition of independent religious judgements ([[Ijtihad]]) and a strong [[communalism]] which limited contacts with outside groups and the development of institutions dealing with more temporary interactions of various kinds, according to Kuran.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft Vol. 153, No. 1, The New Institutional Economics Religion and Economics (March 1997), pp. 41–71 Published by: Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752985&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Donald Quataert]], however, the Ottoman Middle East's manufacturing sector was highly productive and evolving in the 19th century. Quataert criticizes arguments rooted in [[Orientalism]], such as "now-discredited [[stereotype]]s concerning the inferiority of [[Islam]]", economic institutions having stopped evolving after the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and decline of Ijtihad in religion negatively affecting economic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–8|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] noted that [[Ottoman law]] promoted [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[free trade]] earlier than Britain and the United States, arguing that free trade had a negative economic impact on the Ottoman Empire and contributed to its deindustrialization, in contrast to the more [[protectionist]] policies of Britain and the United States in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="bairoch31"/&gt;

In his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] argues that the human psychological traits (such as literacy, numeracy, and delayed gratification) needed for the divergence spread in England between 1200 and 1800 "at least culturally and perhaps also genetically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Farewell to Alms | first = Gregory | last = Clark | author-link = Gregory Clark (economist) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-691-12135-2 | pages = 8, 11, 120, 165, 271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shorter online version of Clark's work can be found here:  http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Capitalism%20Genes.pdf

===Political fragmentation===
Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China. China had both a printing press and movable type, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

Economic historian Tuan-Hwee Sng has argued that the large size of the Chinese state contributed to its relative decline in the 19th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sng|first=Tuan-Hwee|date=2014-10-01|title=Size and dynastic decline: The principal-agent problem in late imperial China, 1700–1850|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498314000205|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=54|pages=107–127|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast size of the Chinese empire created a severe principal-agent problem and constrained how the country was governed. In particular, taxes had to be kept low due to the emperor's weak oversight of his agents and the need to keep corruption in check. The Chinese state's fiscal weaknesses were long masked by its huge tax base. However, economic and demographic expansion in the eighteenth century exacerbated the problems of administrative control. This put a further squeeze on the nation's finances and left China ill-prepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One reason why Japan was able to modernize and adopt the technologies of the West was due to its much smaller size relative to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|last2=Moriguchi|first2=Chiaki|last3=Sng|first3=Tuan-Hwee|date=2015-10-28|title=Geopolitics and Asia's Little Divergence: A Comparative Analysis of State Building in China and Japan after 1850|ssrn=2682702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jeffrey G. Williamson]] has argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]], with [[British India|British rule]] later causing further deindustrialization.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior [[Industrial Revolution|factory technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and Poverty: When the Third World Fell Behind|author=[[Jeffrey G. Williamson]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2011|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiDslL0o-hUC&amp;pg=PA91|isbn=9780262295185}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Indian textiles still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Economic historian Prasannan Parthasarathi, however, has argued that there wasn't any such economic decline for several post-Mughal states, notably [[Bengal Subah]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], which were comparable to Britain in the late 18th century, until British colonial policies caused deindustrialization.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}

Stanford political scientist Gary W. Cox argues in a 2017 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Gary W.|date=2017|title=Political Institutions, Economic Liberty, and the Great Divergence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/political-institutions-economic-liberty-and-the-great-divergence/BF095246D91A9729C1A575B9A6706C95|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=77|issue=3|pages=724–755|doi=10.1017/S0022050717000729|issn=0022-0507|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her institutional innovations to foster substantial areas of “economic liberty,” where European merchants could organize production freer of central regulation, faced fewer central restrictions on their shipping and pricing decisions, and paid lower tariffs and tolls than their counterparts elsewhere in Eurasia. When fragmentation afforded merchants multiple politically independent routes on which to ship their goods, European rulers refrained from imposing onerous regulations and levying arbitrary tolls, lest they lose mercantile traffic to competing realms. Fragmented control of trade routes magnified the spillover effects of political reforms. If parliament curbed arbitrary regulations and tolls in one realm, then neighboring rulers might have to respond in kind, even if they themselves remained without a parliament. Greater economic liberty, fostered by the interaction of fragmentation and reform, unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth. &lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Justin Yifu Lin]] argued that China's large population size proved beneficial in technological advancements prior to the 14th century, but that the large population size was not an important factor in the kind of technological advancements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=1995-01-01|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early technological advancements depended on "learning by doing" (where population size was an important factor, as advances could spread over a large political unit), whereas the Industrial Revolution was the result of experimentation and theory (where population size is less important.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Representative government===
A number of economists have argued that representative government was a factor in the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The argue that absolutist governments, where rulers are not broadly accountable, are bad for property rights and innovation, and that they are prone to corruption and rent-seeking.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Long|first=J. Bradford|last2=Shleifer|first2=Andrei|date=1993-10-01|title=Princes and Merchants: European City Growth before the Industrial Revolution|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=36|issue=2|pages=671–702|doi=10.1086/467294|issn=0022-2186|citeseerx=10.1.1.164.4092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative governments however were accountable to broader segments of the population and thus had to protect property rights and not rule in arbitrary ways, which caused economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Globalization===
A 2017 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that "globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850-1900."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luigi|first=Pascali|date=|title=The Wind of Change: Maritime Technology, Trade, and Economic Development|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|issn=0002-8282|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ehsthelongrun.net/2017/08/24/globalisation-and-economic-development-a-lesson-from-history/|title=Globalisation and Economic Development: A Lesson from History|last=ehs1926|date=2017-08-24|website=The Long Run|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states that benefited from globalization were "characterised by strong constraints on executive power, a distinct feature of the institutional environment that has been demonstrated to favour private investment."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Chance===
A number of economic historians have posited that the Industrial Revolution may have partly occurred where and when it did due to luck and chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Zilibotti|first2=Fabrizio|date=1997-08-01|title=Was Prometheus Unbound by Chance?

==Economic effects==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world]]

The Old World methods of agriculture and production could only sustain certain lifestyles. Industrialization dramatically changed the European economy and allowed it to attain much higher levels of wealth and productivity than the other Old World cores. Although Western technology later spread to the East, differences in uses preserved the Western lead and accelerated the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Productivity===

When analyzing comparative use-efficiency, the economic concept of [[total factor productivity]] (TFP) is applied to quantify differences between countries.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  TFP analysis controls for differences in energy and raw material inputs across countries and is then used to calculate [[productivity]]. The difference in productivity levels, therefore, reflects efficiency of energy and raw materials use rather than the raw materials themselves.{{sfn|Comin|2008}}  TFP analysis has shown that Western countries had higher TFP levels on average in the 19th century than Eastern countries such as [[India]] or [[China]], showing that Western productivity had surpassed the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Per capita income===
Some of the most striking evidence for the Great Divergence comes from data on [[per capita income]].{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  The West's rise to power directly coincides with per capita income in the West surpassing that in the East.  This change can be attributed largely to the mass transit technologies, such as [[railroads]] and [[steamboats]], that the West developed in the 19th century.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} The construction of large ships, trains, and railroads greatly increased productivity. These modes of transport made moving large quantities of coal, corn, grain, livestock and other goods across countries more efficient, greatly reducing transportation costs. These differences allowed Western productivity to exceed that of other regions.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] has estimated the GDP per capita of several major countries in 1960 US dollars after the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1976}}, p. 286, table 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biaroch European GDP per capita 1830-1890.svg|center]]

His estimates show that the GDP per capita of Western European countries rose rapidly after industrialization.

For the 18th century, and in comparison to non-European regions, Bairoch in 1995 stated that, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"&gt;Chris Jochnick, Fraser A. Preston (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpqmITSjgWAC&amp;pg=PA86 ''Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis'', pages 86-87], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{details|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Before and during the early 19th century, much of continental European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This left Europe with abundant idle natural resources. [[England]], on the other hand, had reached the limit of its agricultural productivity well before the beginning of the 19th century.  Rather than taking the costly route of improving soil fertility, the English increased labor productivity by industrializing agriculture.  From 1750 to 1850, European nations experienced population booms; however,  European agriculture was barely able to keep pace with the dietary needs. Imports from the Americas, and the reduced caloric intake required by [[proletariat|industrial workers]] compared to farmers allowed England to cope with the food shortages.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=215–219}} By the turn of the 19th century, much European farmland had been eroded and depleted of nutrients.  Fortunately, through improved farming techniques, the import of [[fertilizers]], and [[reforestation]], Europeans were able to recondition their soil and prevent food shortages from hampering industrialization. Meanwhile, many other formerly [[hegemonic]] areas of the world were struggling to feed themselves&amp;nbsp;– notably China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=223–225}}

===Fuel and resources===
The global demand for wood, a major resource required for industrial growth and development, was increasing in the first half of the 19th century.  A lack of interest of [[silviculture]] in Western Europe, and a lack of forested land, caused wood shortages.  By the mid-19th century, forests accounted for less than 15% of land use in most Western European countries. Fuel costs rose sharply in these countries throughout the 18th century and many households and factories were forced to ration their usage, and eventually adopt forest conservation policies.  It was not until the 19th century that [[coal]] began providing much needed relief to the European energy shortage.  China had not begun to use coal on a large scale until around 1900, giving Europe a huge lead on modern energy production.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=219–225}}

Through the 19th century, Europe had vast amounts of unused [[arable land]] with adequate water sources. However, this was not the case in China; most idle lands suffered from a lack of water supply, so forests had to be cultivated.  Since the mid-19th century, northern China's water supplies have been declining, reducing its agricultural output.  By growing [[cotton]] for [[textiles]], rather than importing, China exacerbated its water shortage.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=230–238}}
During the 19th century, supplies of wood and land decreased considerably, greatly slowing growth of Chinese per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=228–219}}

===Trade===
[[File:Triangular trade.svg|thumb|right|18th century triangular trade between Europe, the New World, and Africa.]]

During the era of European imperialism, [[periphery countries]] were often set up as specialized producers of specific resources. Although these specializations brought the periphery countries temporary economic benefit, the overall effect inhibited the industrial development of periphery territories.  Cheaper resources for [[core countries]] through trade deals with specialized periphery countries allowed the core countries to advance at a much greater pace, both economically and industrially, than the rest of the world.{{sfn|Williamson|2008}}

Europe's access to a larger quantity of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it a distinct advantage through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their [[colonies]], including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought a distinct advantage to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialize]], they would turn to [[import substitution]], depriving the hegemonic nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, they were able to prevent this from happening.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=242–243}} Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from [[India]]. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=128, 226–227, 244}} The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=252–258}}

Western Europe was also able to establish profitable trade with Eastern Europe. Countries such as [[Prussia]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Poland]] had very little freedom in comparison to the West;{{vague|date=November 2010}} forced labor left much of Eastern Europe with little time to work towards proto-industrialization and ample manpower to generate raw materials.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=257–258}}

===Guilds and journeymanship===
A 2017 study in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' argued, "medieval European institutions such as guilds, and specific features such as journeymanship, can explain the rise of Europe relative to regions that relied on the transmission of knowledge within closed kinship systems (extended families or clans)".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Croix|first=David|last2=Doepke|first2=Matthias|last3=Mokyr|first3=Joel|title=Clans, Guilds, and Markets: Apprenticeship Institutions and Growth in the Pre-Industrial Economy|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|doi=10.1093/qje/qjx026|volume=133|year=2017|pages=1–70|hdl=2078.1/172953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds and journeymanship were superior for creating and disseminating knowledge, which contributed to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Löber Duke Ernest Augustus II Constantine on horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Ernest Augustus II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Duke Ernest Augustus II Constantine]] on horseback'' by [[Johann Friedrich Löber]], ca. 1756, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]. The young duke was depicted accompanied by his chancellor Heinrich von Bünau before his main residence - [[Schloss Weimar|Weimar City Castle]].]]

Count '''Heinrich von Bünau''' ({{lang-de|Heinrich Graf von Bünau}}; 2 June 1697 – 7 April 1762) was a statesman and historian from the [[Electorate of Saxony]], now part of [[Germany]].

==Life==
Born in [[Weissenfels]], Bünau was the son of Heinrich von Bünau (1665–1745), a Chancellor of the [[Elector of Saxony]] who was created a Count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on 24 March 1742.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://von-buenau.de Bünau family's website] states that by a "private ordinance" the family had obliged its men to use only the forenames Günther, Heinrich, and Rudolph, which is why within this very extended family there are numerous men with the name "Heinrich von Bünau". This has often led to confusion between them in previous research: for example, in the history of the Saxon state, Heinrich, Count of Bünau, has often been confused with his father of the same name, who was Chancellor at the Court of Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying at the [[University of Leipzig]], Bünau entered the service of the Electors of Saxony and became an assessor in the Upper Court (''Oberhofgericht'') at [[Leipzig]]. Later he became Senior [[consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory]] President and Privy Councillor (''Wirklicher Geheimrat'').

He received advancement through the good offices of the Cabinet Minister of the Electors of Saxony, [[Carl Heinrich von Hoym|Count von Hoym]], the uncle of his second wife. In 1734, after Hoym had been ousted by [[Heinrich von Brühl|Count Brühl]], Heinrich von Bünau was downgraded to the position of Senior Overseer of the [[County of Mansfeld]] in [[Eisleben]].

In 1741 however he entered the service of the [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VII]], who made him an Imperial Privy Councillor (''Reichshofrat''), the first [[Protestant]] to fill that role, and employed him as an ambassador in the area of Upper and Lower Saxony. In 1745, after the death of the emperor, Bünau withdrew to his estate at [[:de:Schloss Nöthnitz|Nöthnitz]] near [[Dresden]] to pursue his scientific and historical studies.

Between 1744 and 1751 he had [[Dahlen Castle]] built, on the [[Dahlen, Saxony|Dahlen]] estate he had acquired by marriage, and for the decoration of which he commissioned [[Adam Friedrich Oeser]] in 1756.

In 1751 Bünau was appointed as Guardian Governor of the Duchy of [[Saxe-Eisenach]], during the minority of Duke Constantin, for whom in 1756 he became Prime Minister in [[Weimar]]. In 1759, after the death of the Duke, he retired and spent the evening of his life on his estate at [[Ossmannstedt]], near Weimar,&lt;ref&gt;Apart from the estates of Nöthnitz, Dahlen, and Ossmannstedt already mentioned, Bünau also owned those of [[Domsen]], [[Göllnitz]] and [[Gross-Tauschwitz]].&lt;/ref&gt; where he died on 7 April 1762.&lt;ref&gt;His house at Ossmannstedt was used for a few years after his death as a summer house by the [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duchess Anna Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] and her sons. It was bought in 1797 by [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. It is now known as the ''[http://www.weimar-klassik.de/index.php?id=83 Wielandgut]'' and contains the Wieland Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
Bünau's private library comprised some 42,000 volumes. It was housed at first in Dresden, then on his estate at Nöthnitz, and he allowed public access to it. The archaeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] from [[Stendal]] worked at Nöthnitz between 1748 and 1754 as Bünau's secretary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57600">{{History of Montenegro}}
The '''history of Montenegro''' begins in the early [[Middle Ages]], into the former [[Roman province of Dalmatia]] that forms present-day [[Montenegro]]. In the 9th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half, [[Travunia]], the west, and [[Rascia]], the north. In 1042, [[Stefan Vojislav]] led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja and the establishment of the [[Vojislavljević dynasty]]. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046–81), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin|Bodin]] (1081–1101).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-01-16 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Balšić noble family]], then the [[Crnojević noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').  Large portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. Parts were controlled by Venice. From 1515 until 1851 the prince-bishops (vladikas) of Cetinje were the rulers. The [[House of Petrović-Njegoš]] ruled until 1918. From 1918, it was a part of [[Yugoslavia]]. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum held on 21 May 2006]], Montenegro declared independence on 3 June of that year.

==Early history==
{{main|Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|Illyria|Illyrian Wars|Praevalitana}}
[[File:Roman Roads in Montenegro 6a.svg|thumb|200px|right|Roman Roads in Montenegro]]Before the arrival of the [[Slavic people|Slavonic peoples]] in the [[Balkans]] during the 6th century AD, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by the [[Illyrians]].
During the Bronze Age, the Illirii, probably the southernmost Illyrian tribe of that time, that gave their name to the entire group&lt;ref name=Boardman629/&gt; were living near [[Skadar lake]] on the border of Albania and Montenegro and neighboring with the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tribes south.&lt;ref name=Boardman629&gt;John Boardman. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA629 The prehistory of the Balkans and the Middle East and the Aegean world]. Cambridge University Press, 1982. {{ISBN|978-0-521-22496-3}}, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes John. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&amp;id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C The Illyrians]. Wiley-Blackwell, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Along the seaboard of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], the movement of peoples that was typical of the ancient [[Mediterranean]] world ensured the settlement of a mixture of colonists, traders, and those in search of territorial conquest. Substantial [[Greek colonies]] were established on the 6th and 7th centuries BC and [[Celts]] are known to have settled there in the 4th century BC. During the 3rd century BC, an indigenous [[Illyrian kingdom]] emerged with its capital at [[Shkodër|Scutari]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] mounted several punitive expeditions against local pirates and finally conquered this [[Illyrian kingdom]] in  the 2nd century BC, annexing it to the province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]].

The division of the [[Roman Empire]] between [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] rule &amp;ndash; and subsequently between the [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Greek church]]es &amp;ndash; was marked by a line that ran northward from Shkodra through modern Montenegro, symbolizing the status of this region as a perpetual marginal zone between the economic, cultural, and political worlds of the Mediterranean peoples. As Roman power declined, this part of the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]] suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-[[nomadic]] invaders, especially the [[Goths]] in the late 5th century and the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] during the 6th century. These soon were supplanted by the Slavs, who became widely established in [[Dalmatia]] by the middle of the 7th century. Because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches, the area that is now Montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers, including some tribes who had escaped [[Romanisation (cultural)|Romanisation]].

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Map Byzantine Empire 1045 2000px svg.png|thumb|right|330px|Duklja in the 11th century]]
[[File:Arhpetar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The seal of prince Peter of Duklja from 10th century. Inscription says "Peter, archon of Diokleia, Amen".]]
{{main|Duklja|Travunija}}

In the second half of the 6th century, [[Slavs]] migrated from the [[Bay of Kotor]] to the River of [[Bojana (river)|Bojana]] and the hinterland of it as well as surround the Skadar lake. They formed the [[Principality]] of [[Duklja|Doclea]]. Under the following missions of [[Cyril and Methodus]], the population was [[Christianization|Christianised]]. The Slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of [[Duklja]] (Doclea) by the 9th century.

After facing subsequent [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] domination, the people were split as the Doclean brother-archonts split the lands among each other after 900. Prince [[Časlav Klonimirović]] of the [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian]] [[Vlastimirović dynasty]] extended his influence over Doclea in the 10th century. After the fall of the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Realm]] in 960, the Docleans faced a renewed Byzantine occupation through to the 11th century. The local ruler, [[Jovan Vladimir]] Dukljanski, whose cult still remains in the Orthodox Christian tradition, was at the time struggling to ensure independence.

[[Stefan Vojislav]] started an uprising against the Byzantine domination and gained a huge victory against the army of several Byzantine strategs in Tudjemili (Bar) in 1042, which put to an end the Byzantine influence over the Doclea. In the 1054 Great Schism, the Doclea fell on the side of the Catholic Church. Bar became a Bishopric in 1067. In 1077, [[Pope Gregory VII]] recognised Duklja as an independent state, acknowledging its King [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (Michael, of the Vojislavljević dynasty founded by nobleman Stefan Vojislav) as Rex Doclea (King of Duklja). Later on Mihailo sent his troops, led by his son Bodin, in 1072 to assist the uprising of Slavs in Macedonia. In 1082, after numerous pleas the Bar Bishopric of Bar was upgraded to an Archbishopric.

The expansions of the Kings of the Vojislavljević dynasty led to the control over the other Slavic lands, including [[Zahumlje]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Rascia]]. The might of the Doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the Grand Princes of Rascia in the 12th century. [[Stefan Nemanja]] was born in 1117 in Ribnica (today [[Podgorica]]). In 1168, as the Serbian Grand Zhupan, Stefan Nemanja took Doclea.

===The Venetian coastal Montenegro===
{{main|Venetian Dalmatia|First Scutari War|Second Scutari War}}
[[File:Venezia Montenegro.svg|thumb|[[Venetian Albania|Territory of Venetian Albania]]]]
After the dramatic fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (476), the romanised [[Illyrians]] of the coast of Dalmatia survived the barbarian invasions of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] in the 6th century and were only nominally under the influence of the [[Slavs]] in the 7th and 8th centuries. In the last centuries of the first millennium, these Romanised Illyrians started to develop their own neo-Latin language, called [[Dalmatian language]], around their small coastal villages that were growing with maritime commerce.
[[Venice]] started to take control of the southern Dalmatia around the 10th century, quickly assimilating the Dalmatian language with [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. By the 14th century the [[Republic of Venice]] was able to create a territorial continuity around the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Cattaro).

==Early modern period==
{{main|Cretan War (1645–69)|Morean War|Great Turkish War}}
The Republic of Venice dominated the coasts of today's Montenegro from 1420 to 1797. In those four centuries the area around the [[Cattaro]] (Kotor) became part of [[Venetian Albania]].

{{main|Serb uprising of 1596–97|Montenegro Vilayet|Metropolitanate of Montenegro}}
Part of today's Montenegro (the '''Ottoman Montenegro'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), called [[Sandžak]], was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control from 1498 to 1912, while [[Montenegrin Littoral|coastal Montenegro]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control and the rest of Montenegro was independent from 1516, when ''Vladika'' [[Vavila, Metropolitan of Zeta|Vavila]] was elected as ruler of Montenegro by its clans, and it became a [[Theocracy|theocratic state]]. Only small town centers were controlled by Ottomans, but mountains and rural area were de facto independent and controlled by several Montenegrin clans, which were warrior societies.&lt;ref name="Stephen Clissold 1966"&gt;Stephen Clissold (1966). ''A short history of Yugoslavia from earliest times to 1966'', chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

Montenegrin people were divided in clans (''Pleme''). Every adult male from clan was a warrior and took part in wars. Clans were ruled by chieftains, who also were military leaders of a clan. All clan leaders met up several times a year on ''Zbor'' (assembly) in [[Cetinje]], the Montenegrin capital, to make important decisions for the nation, to solve blood feuds and to declare wars.

Independent Montenegro of that time was divided in three parts:

- [[Old Montenegro]], which had territory of modern-day towns of [[Cetinje]] and part of [[Danilovgrad]]. It was core of Montenegro and Cetinje was the capital. Montenegrin Prince-Bishops (Vladikas) lived and ruled from Cetinje.

- [[Brda, Montenegro|Brda]] ("The Hills") included territories of northeastern Montenegro. This area was also known as "The Seven Hills" (Sedam Brda) because it was inhabited by seven Montenegrin clans: [[Vasojevići]], [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići]],  [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]], [[Kuči]], [[Bratonožići]], [[Moračani|Morača]] and [[Rovca]]. The clans were led by [[Vojvoda|Vojvodas]] (dukes), either elective or hereditary ones.

- [[Old Herzegovina]], an area in west Montenegro which was part of the short-lived medieval state of [[Herzegovina]].

In 1514, the Ottoman-controlled territory of Montenegro was proclaimed as a separate [[Sanjak of Montenegro]], by the order of [[Beyazid II|Sultan Beyazid II]]. The first [[Sanjakbeg|Sanjak-beg]] (governor) who was chosen was [[Ivan Crnojević]]'s son Staniša ([[Skenderbeg Crnojević]]), who converted to [[Islam]], and governed until 1528. Despite Skenderbeg's emphasized cruelty, the Ottomans did not have real power in Montenegro. ''Vladika'' Vavil was elected in 1516 as Montenegrin prince-bishop by the Montenegrin people.

====Elective Vladikas (1516–1696) ====
{{main|Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro}}

For 180 years after their first appointment, the Vladikas were elected by the clans and people — an arrangement which was ultimately abandoned in favour of the hereditary system in 1696. For most of this period the Montenegrin people were in constant struggle for existence against Ottoman Empire.

A pretender to Montenegrin throne, one of the [[Crnojević noble family|Crnojević]] family who had converted to [[Islam]], invaded Montenegro just as [[Skenderbeg Crnojević|Staniša]], thirty years before, and with the same result. Vukotić, the civil governor, repulsed the attack of Turks. Montenegrins, encouraged by the victory, besieged [[Jajce]] in modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], where the Hungarian garrison was closely hemmed in by the Ottoman army. The Turks were too much occupied with the Hungarian war to take revenge. The next Ottoman invasion of Montenegro took place in 1570.

The national historians are silent upon the subject of the [[Haraç]] (tax in Ottoman Empire), which the invaders are said to have exacted from the inhabitants of the free mountains. The refusal of high-spirited Montenegrin clans to pay tax any longer may have been the cause of the Pasha's invasion during the reign of [[Rufim Njeguš|Bishop Rufim]], when the Turks were driven back with heavy loss in [[Battle of Lješkopolje]] in 1604. About 1500 Montenegrin warriors attacked the Turkish camp on Lješkopolje field during the night, which counted 10.000 Ottoman soldiers. 

In 1613 Arslan Pasha gathered army of over 40.000 men to attack part of [[Old Montenegro]]. Ottoman soldiers were twice as numerous as whole population of Old Montenegro. On 10 September the Montenegrins met the Turkish army, on the same spot Skenderbeg Crnojević was defeated nearly a century ago . The Montenegrins, although assisted by some neighbouring tribes, counted 4000 and were completely outnumbered. But their valour and prowess were out of proportion to their numbers. The Turks suffered a disastrous defeat. Arslan Pasha was wounded, and the heads of his second-in-command and a hundred other Turkish officers were carried off and stuck on the ramparts of Cetinje. The Ottoman troops retreated in disorder; many were drowned in the waters of the [[Morača]], many more killed by Montenegrin pursuers.

Much light is thrown upon the condition of Montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer, Mariano Bolizza. This author, a patrician of Venice, residing at [[Kotor]] in the early part of the seventeenth century, spent a considerable time in the [[Old Montenegro]], and published in 1614 a description of [[Cetinje]]. At that time the whole male population of Cetinje available for war consisted of 8,027 persons, distributed among the ninety-three villages which it contained. But these few warriors were continually practising. The rapidity of their maneuvers was extraordinary, and for guerilla warfare they were among Europe's best.

The condition of the country at this period was naturally unsettled. War was the chief occupation of its inhabitants from sheer necessity, and the arts of peace languished. The printing-press, so active a century earlier, had ceased to exist ; the control of the Prince-Bishop over the five nahie, or districts, which then composed the principality, was weak; the capital itself was a mere village of a few houses. Still, even then, there was a system of local government. Each nahia was divided into tribes, or plemena, each presided over by a headman or kniez, who acted as a judge in disputes between the clansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Clissold (1966).

==Modern history==
{{main|Principality of Montenegro}}
[[File:Flags, about 1800.gif|thumb|left|Flags of Montenegro,about 1800 AD]][[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petar Petrović Njegoš]] perhaps the most influential ''vladika'', reigned in the first half of the 19th century. In 1851 Danilo Petrović Njegoš became ''vladika'', but in 1852 he married, threw off his ecclesiastical character, assuming the title of ''[[knjaz]]'' (Prince) [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo I]]&lt;!--Danilo II?--&gt;, and transformed his land into a secular principality.

Following the assassination of Danilo by [[Todor Kadić]] in [[Kotor]], in 1860, the Montenegrins proclaimed [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] as his successor on August 14 of that year. In 1861-1862, Nicholas engaged in an unsuccessful [[Montenegrin-Ottoman War (1861-62)|war]] against the Ottoman Empire with Montenegro holding onto its independence only by the skin of its teeth. 

He was much more successful in 1876. Following the Herzegovinian Uprising, partly initiated by his clandestine activities, he yet again declared war on Turkey. [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] joined Montenegro, but it was defeated by Turkish forces that same year. Russia now joined in and decisively routed the Turks in 1877-78.  The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (March 1878) was highly advantageous to Montenegro, as well as Russia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''European Alliances and Alignments, 1871-1890'' (2nd ed. 1950) pp 121-66&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gains were trimmed somewhat by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878). In the end Montenegro was internationally recognized as an independent state, its territory was effectively doubled by the addition of {{convert|1900|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, the port of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and all the waters of Montenegro were closed to warships of all nations; and the administration of the maritime and sanitary police on the coast was placed in the hands of Austria. 

Under Nicholas I the country was also granted its first constitution (1905) and was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1910. During his reign Montenegro was an ally of Russia in the [[Russo-Japanese war]]. Montenegrin volunteers were fighting in the Russian Army.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armchairgeneral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=76870&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-net.ru/store/element.php?IBLOCK_ID=30&amp;SECTION_ID=0&amp;ELEMENT_ID=3515#%F0%E5%F6%E5%ED%E7%E8%E8 |title=Ганин А.В.

In the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913), Montenegro did make further territorial gains by splitting [[Sanjak]] with Serbia. However, the captured city of [[Skadar]] had to be given up to the new state of [[Albania]] at the insistence of the Great Powers despite the Montenegrins having invested 10,000 lives for the conquest of the town from the Ottoman-Albanian forces of [[Essad Pasha Toptani]].

===World War I===
Montenegro suffered severely in [[World War I]]. Shortly after [[Austria-Hungary]] declared war on Serbia (28 July 1914), Montenegro lost little time in declaring war on the [[Central Powers]] - on Austria-Hungary in the first instance - on 6 August 1914, despite Austrian diplomacy promising  to cede [[Shkoder]] to Montenegro if it remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;For Montenegro's entry into the war, see E. Czega, "Die Mobilmachung Montenegros im Sommer 1914", ''Berliner Monatshefte'' '''14''' (1936): 3–23, and Alfred Rappaport, "Montenegros Eintritt in den Weltkrieg", ''Berliner Monatshefte'' '''7''' (1929): 941–66.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
For purposes of coordination in the fight against the enemy army, Serbian General [[Bozidar Jankovic]] was named head of High Command of both Serbian and Montenegrin armies. Montenegro received 30 [[artillery]] pieces and financial help of 17 million [[Serbian dinar|dinars]] from Serbia. [[French Third Republic|France]] contributed a colonial detachment of 200 men located in Cetinje at the beginning of war, as well as two radio-stations - located on top of [[Mount Lovćen]] and in Podgorica. Until 1915 France supplied Montenegro with necessary war material and food through the port of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], which was blockaded by Austrian battleships and submarines. In 1915 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] took over this role, running supplies unsuccessfully and irregularly across the line [[Shengjin]]-[[Bojana (river)|Bojana]]-[[Lake Skadar]], an unsecured route because of constant attacks by Albanian irregulars organised by Austrian agents. Lack of vital materials eventually led Montenegro to surrender.

Austria-Hungary dispatched a separate army to invade Montenegro{{when|date=August 2014}} and to prevent a junction of the Serbian and Montenegrin armies. This force, however, was repulsed, and from the top of the strongly fortified  Lovćen, the Montenegrins carried on the bombardment of [[Kotor]] held by the enemy. The Austro-Hungarian army managed to capture the town of [[Pljevlja]] while on the other hand the Montenegrins took [[Budva]], then under Austrian control. The Serbian victory at the [[Battle of Cer]] (15–24 August 1914) diverted enemy forces from [[Sandžak|Sandjak]], and Pljevlja came into Montenegrin hands again. On August 10, 1914, the Montenegrin infantry delivered a strong attack against the Austrian garrisons, but they did not succeed in making good the advantage they first gained. They successfully resisted the Austrians in the second invasion of Serbia (September 1914) and almost succeeded in seizing [[Sarajevo]]. With the beginning of the third Austro-Hungarian invasion, however, the Montenegrin army had to retire before greatly superior numbers, and Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German armies finally overran Serbia (December 1915). However, the Serbian army survived, and led by King [[Peter I of Serbia]], started retreating across Albania. In order to support the Serbian retreat, the Montenegrin army, led by [[Janko Vukotic]], engaged in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] (6–7 January 1916). Montenegro also [[Montenegrin Campaign (World War I)|suffered a large scale invasion]] (January 1916) and for the remainder of the war remained in the possession of the Central Powers. See [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]] for details. The Austrian officer [[Viktor Weber Edler von Webenau]] served as the military governor of Montenegro between 1916 and 1917. Afterwards [[Heinrich Clam-Martinic]] filled this position.

King Nicholas fled to Italy (January 1916) and then to France; the government transferred its operations to [[Bordeaux]]. Eventually the allies liberated Montenegro from the Austrians. A newly convened [[Podgorica Assembly|National Assembly of Podgorica (''Podgorička skupština'', ''Подгоричка скупштина'')]], accused the Кing of seeking a separate peace with the enemy and consequently deposed him, banned his return and decided that Montenegro should join the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on December 1, 1918. A part of the former Montenegrin military forces still loyal to the King started a rebellion against the amalgamation, the [[Christmas Uprising]] (7 January 1919).

===Yugoslavia===
[[File:Zetska banovina01.png|thumb|Map of Zeta Banovina]]
In the period between the two [[World War]]s, Nikola's grandson, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander Karageorgevich]] dominated the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. In 1922 Montenegro became part of Zeta area and later [[Zeta Banate]].The administrative seat of banate became former Montenegrin capital [[Cetinje]]. During this period, Montenegrin people were still  divided between politics of Greens and Whites. The dominant political parties in Montenegro were [[Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Democratic Party]], [[People's Radical Party]], [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], [[Agrarian Party (Yugoslavia)|Alliance of Agrarians]], [[Montenegrin Federalist Party]] and Yugoslav Republican Party. During this period, two main problems in Montenegro were lost sovereignty  and bad economic situation. All of the parties except Federalists had the same attitude towards the first question, favouring centralism to federalism. The other question was more complex, but the fact on which all of the parties agreed is that the situation was far from good and that the government did nothing to improve the life in area. Devastated by war, Montenegro was never paid the reparations to which it had right as one of the Allies in the Great War. Most of the population lived in rural areas, but the smaller population of citizens had better standards of life. There was no infrastructure and industry was formed of few companies.

===The puppet "Kingdom of Montenegro" and World War II===
{{Main|Leftist errors (Yugoslavia)|Uprising in Montenegro (1941)}}
During World War II, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] occupied Montenegro in 1941 and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] the area of Kotor (Cattaro), where there was a small [[Venetian language|Venetian]] speaking population. (The Queen of Italy - [[Elena of Montenegro]] - was daughter of the former king of Montenegro and was born in [[Cetinje]].)

The English historian [[Denis Mack Smith]] wrote that the Queen of Italy (considered the most influential Montenegrin woman in history) convinced her husband the King of Italy [[Victor Emmanuel III]] to impose on Mussolini the creation of an independent Montenegro, against the wishes of the fascist Croats and Albanians (who wanted to enlarge their countries with the Montenegrin territories). Her nephew [[Prince Michael of Montenegro]] never accepted the offered crown, pledging loyalty to his nephew King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]].

The puppet [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941–1944)|Kingdom of Montenegro]] was created under fascist control while [[Krsto Zrnov Popović]] returned from his exile in [[Rome]] in 1941 to attempt to lead the [[Zelenaši]] ("Green" party), who supported the reinstatement of the Montenegrin monarchy. This militia was called the [[Lovćen Brigade]]. Montenegro was ravaged by a terrible guerrilla war, mainly after [[Nazi Germany]] replaced the defeated Italians in September 1943.

During World War II, as was the case in many other parts of Yugoslavia, Montenegro was involved in some sort of civil war. Besides Montenegrin Greens, the two main factions were the [[Chetniks|Chetnik Yugoslav army]], who swore allegiance to the government in exile and consisted mainly of Montenegrins who declared themselves as Serbs (many of its members were Montenegrin Whites) and [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav Partisans]], whose aim was the creation of a Socialist Yugoslavia after the war. Since both factions shared some similarities in their goals, particularly those relating to a unified Yugoslavia and anti-Axis resistance, the two sides joined hands and in 1941 started the [[13th July uprising]], the first organised uprising in occupied Europe. This occurred just two months after Yugoslavia capitulated, and liberated most of Montenegrin territory, but the rebels were unable to regain control of major towns and cities. After the failed attempts to liberate the towns of [[Pljevlja]] and [[Kolasin]], the Italians, reinforced by Germans,  recaptured all insurgent territory. At the leadership level, disagreements regarding state policy (Centralist monarchy vs. Federal Socialist republic) eventually led to a split between the two sides; they then became enemies from thereon. Constantly, both factions were trying to gain support among the population. The monarchist Chetniks had influential scholars and revolutionaries among their supporters, such as [[Blažo Đukanović]], [[Zaharije Ostojić]], Radojica Perisic, [[Petar Baćović]], Mirko Lalatovic, and [[Bajo Stanišić]], the hero of the anti-fascist uprising. However, eventually the Chetniks in Montenegro lost support among the population, as did other Chetnik factions within Yugoslavia. The ''de facto'' leader of the Chetniks in Montenegro, [[Pavle Djurisic]], along with other prominent figures of the movement like Dusan Arsovic and [[Đorđe Lašić]], were held responsible for massacres of Muslim population in eastern [[Bosnia]] and [[Sandzak]] during 1944. Their ideology of a homogeneous Serbia within Yugoslavia proved to be a major obstacle in recruiting liberals, minorities, and Montenegrins who regarded Montenegro as a nation with its own identity. These factors, in addition to the fact that some Chetniks were negotiating with the [[Axis powers|Axis]], led to the Chetnik Yugoslav army losing support among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1943. In the same year, Italy, who was until then in charge of the occupied zone, capitulated and was replaced by [[Germany]], and the fighting continued.

[[Podgorica]] was liberated by the socialist Partisans on 19 December 1944, and the war of liberation had been won. [[Josip Broz Tito]] acknowledged Montenegro's massive contribution to the war against the Axis powers by establishing it as one of the six republics of [[Yugoslavia]].

===Montenegro within Socialist Yugoslavia===
{{Main|Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Informbiro period}}
From 1945 to 1992, Montenegro became a constituent republic of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]; it was the smallest republic in the federation and had the lowest population. Montenegro became economically stronger than ever, since it gained help from federal funds as an under-developed Republic, and it became a tourist destination as well. After war years proved turbulent and were marked by political eliminations. [[Krsto Zrnov Popović]], the leader of Greens  was assassinated in 1947, and 10 years later, in 1957, the last Montenegrin Chetnik [[Vladimir Šipčić]] was also murdered. During this period Montenegrin Communists such as [[Veljko Vlahović]], [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]], [[Vladimir Popović (1914-1972)|Vladimir Popović]] and Jovo Kapicić held key positions in the federal government of Yugoslavia. In 1948 Yugoslavia faced the [[Tito-Stalin split]], a period of high tensions between Yugoslavia and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] caused by disagreements about each country's influences on its neighbours, and the resolution of [[Informbiro]]. Political turmoil began within both the communist party and the nation. Pro-Soviet communists faced prosecution and imprisonment in various prisons across Yugoslavia, notably [[Goli Otok]]. Many Montenegrins, due to their traditional allegiance with Russia, declared themselves as Soviet-orientated. This political split in the communist party saw the downfall of many important communist leaders, including Montenegrins [[Arso Jovanović]] and [[Vlado Dapčević]]. Many of the people imprisoned during this period, regardless of nationality, were innocent - this was later recognised by the Yugoslav government. 1954 saw the expulsion of prominent Montenegrin politician [[Milovan Đilas]] from the communist party for criticising party leaders for forming a "new ruling class" within, Yugoslavia along with [[Peko Dapčević]].

Through the second half of the 1940s and the whole of the 1950s, the country underwent infrastructural rejuvenation thanks to federal funding. Montenegro's historic capital [[Cetinje]] was replaced with [[Podgorica]], which in the inter-war period became the biggest city in the Republic - although it was practically in ruins due to heavy bombing in the last stages of WW II. Podgorica had a more favorable geographical position within Montenegro, and in 1947 the seat of the Republic was moved to the city, now named Titograd in honor to Marshal Tito.  Cetinje received the title of 'hero city' within Yugoslavia. [[Youth work actions]] built a railway between the two biggest cities of [[Titograd]] and [[Nikšić]], as well as an embankment over [[Skadar lake]] linking the capital with the major port of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]]. The port of Bar was also rebuilt after being mined during the German retreat in 1944. Other ports that faced infrastructural improvement were [[Kotor]], [[Risan]] and [[Tivat]]. In 1947 [[Jugopetrol Kotor]] was founded. Montenegro's industrialisation was demonstrated through the founding of the electronic company Obod in Cetinje, a steel mill and [[Trebjesa brewery]] in Nikšić, and the [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant]] in 1969.

===Breakup of Yugoslavia and Bosnian war===
The [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup of communist Yugoslavia]] (1991–1992) and the introduction of a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]] found Montenegro with a young leadership that had risen to office only a few years earlier in the late 1980s.

In effect, three men ran the republic: [[Milo Đukanović]], [[Momir Bulatović]] and [[Svetozar Marović]]; all swept into power during the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] — an administrative [[coup]] of sorts within the Yugoslav Communist party, orchestrated by younger party members close to [[Slobodan Milošević]].

All three appeared devout communists on the surface, but they also had sufficient skills and adaptability to understand the dangers of clinging to traditional rigid old-guard tactics in changing times. So when the old Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist and the multi-party political system replaced it, they quickly repackaged the Montenegrin branch of the old Communist party and renamed it the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS).

The inheritance of the entire infrastructure, resources and membership of the old Communist party gave the DPS a sizable head start on their opponents in the newly formed parties. It allowed them to win the first multi-party parliamentary election held on 9 and 16 December 1990, and presidential elections held on 9 and 23 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701210204/http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |date=July 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has ruled Montenegro {{As of|2006|alt=ever since}} (either alone or as a leading member of different ruling coalitions).

During the early-to-mid-1990s Montenegro's leadership gave considerable support to Milošević's war-effort. Montenegrin reservists fought on the Dubrovnik front line, where Prime Minister Milo Đukanović visited them frequently.

In April 1992, following a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum]], Montenegro decided to join Serbia in forming the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY), which officially put the Second Yugoslavia to rest.

During the 1991&amp;ndash;1995 [[Bosnian War]] and [[Croatian War]], Montenegro participated with its police and military forces in the attacks on [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatiatraveller.com/southern_dalmatia/Dubrovnik/bombing.html |title=Bombing of Dubrovnik |website=Croatiatraveller.com |date=1991-10-23 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops, aggressive acts aimed at acquiring more territories by force,
characterized by a consistent pattern of gross and systematic violations of
human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r121.htm |title=A/RES/47/121. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montenegrin General [[Pavle Strugar]] has since been convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yihr.org/uploads/newsletters/eng/28.pdf |format=PDF |title=Shedding Light on Fate of Missing Persons |website=Yihr.org |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in [[Foča]], where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/VIII-03.htm#III.A.25]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002103252/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/VIII-03.htm#III.A.25 |date=October 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1992, the [[United Nations]] imposed an embargo on FRY: this affected many aspects of life in the country.

Due to its favourable geographical location (access to the Adriatic Sea and a water-link to Albania across [[Lake Skadar]]) Montenegro became a hub for smuggling activity. The entire Montenegrin industrial production had stopped, and the republic's main economic activity became the smuggling of user goods - especially those in short supply like petrol and cigarettes, both of which skyrocketed in price. It became a ''de facto'' legalized practice and it went on for years. At best, the Montenegrin government turned a blind eye to the illegal activity, but mostly it took an active part in it. Smuggling made millionaires out of all sorts of shady individuals, including senior government officials. Milo Đukanović continues to face actions in various Italian courts over his role in widespread smuggling during the 1990s and in providing safe haven in Montenegro for different [[Italian Mafia]] figures who also allegedly took part in the smuggling distribution chain.

===Recent history (1996 to present)===
[[File:Montenegro municipalities.png|thumb|240px|right|Map of modern Montenegro.]]
In 1997 a bitter dispute over presidential election results took place. It ended with Milo Đukanović winning over Momir Bulatović in a second-round run-off plagued with irregularities. Nonetheless, the authorities allowed the results to stand. Former close allies had by this time become bitter foes, which resulted in a near-warlike atmosphere in Montenegro for months during the autumn of 1997. It also split the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]]. Bulatović and his followers broke away to form the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP), staying loyal to Milošević, whereas Đukanović began to distance himself from Serbia. This distance from the policies of Milošević played a role in sparing Montenegro from the heavy bombing that Serbia endured in the spring of 1999 during the [[Operation Allied Force|NATO air-campaign]].

Đukanović came out a clear winner from this political fight, as he never lost power for even a day. Bulatović, on the other hand, never held office again in Montenegro after 1997 and eventually retired from politics in 2001.

During the [[Kosovo War]], ethnic Albanians took refuge in Montenegro, but were still under threat by Serbian soldiers, who were able to take refugees back into Serbian controlled areas and imprison them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=STEVE CRAWSHAW in Rozaje |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/war-in-the-balkans-montenegro--albanian-refugees-tortured-by-serbs-1090436.html |title=War In The Balkans: Montenegro - Albanian refugees tortured by Serbs &amp;#124; News |publisher=The Independent |date=1999-04-29 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1999, at the height of the [[NATO]] offensives, 21 Albanians died in several separate and unexplained incidents in Montenegro, according to the republic’s prosecutor. Another group of around 60 Albanian refugees was fired upon in [[Kaludjerski Laz]] by Yugoslav Army members, leading to the death of six people, including a woman aged 80 and a child, killed in crossfire that allegedly came from three machine-gun posts of the then Yugoslav Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kosovo.birn.eu.com/en/1/70/3221/ |title=BIRN Kosovo Home :: BIRN |website=Kosovo.birn.eu.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2016-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114095157/http://kosovo.birn.eu.com/en/1/70/3221/ |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all, 23 Albanians were killed in Kaludjerski Laz, and Montenegrin prosecutors have charged 8 soldiers, among which is Predrag Strugar, son of convicted Montenegrin war criminal General Pavle Strugar, with "inhuman treatment against civilians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL152349220080801 |title=Montenegro charges 8 over murder of 23 Albanians |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Montenegro was bombed as part of NATO operations against Yugoslavia, though not as heavily as Serbia. The targets were mostly military ones such as [[Podgorica Airbase|Golubovci Airbase]]. According to some reports, the airport was attacked because of an operation Yugoslav pilots undertook on 26 April, when they (without knowledge of supreme command) flew over a border into [[Albania]] with 4 [[G-4 Super Galeb]]s and bombed [[Tirana International Airport|Rinas Airport]] which housed 24 [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopters and parts of [[82nd Airborne Division]]. They ended up with destroying nine Apaches and damaging the rest while also destroying [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) training camps in the vicinity of airport.Eight civilian casualties are reported during the course of the war. During the operation,allegedly 10 aircraft were shot down over Montenegro. The first one was [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Tornado IDS]], eventually crashed in [[Skadar Lake]], and the second one was [[Mirage 2000]] of [[French Air Force]], whose pilot catapulted before plane crashed in mountain [[Rumija]]. Apparently both planes were shot on 15.04.1999. The rest of them are [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) downed on various locations,including [[Valdanos]], but the only model that has been identified is [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter]], downed in [[Bay of Kotor]] on 28 May. However, this has never been confirmed.

In 2003, after years of wrangling and outside assistance, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia renamed itself as  "[[Serbia and Montenegro]]" and officially reconstituted itself as a loose union. The [[State Union]] had a parliament and an army in common, and for three years (until 2006), neither Serbia nor Montenegro held a referendum on the break-up of the union. However, a referendum was announced in Montenegro to decide the future of the republic. The ballots cast in the controversial [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|2006 independence referendum]] resulted in a 55.5% victory for independence supporters, just above the 55% borderline mark set by the EU. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006.

For 16 October 2016, the day of the [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary election]], a [[Montenegrin coup d'état|coup d'état]] against the government of [[Milo Đukanović]] had been prepared, according to the Montenegrin Special Prosecutor.&lt;ref name="rferlcoup"&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-coup-charges-confirmed/28535744.html Montenegrin Court Confirms Charges Against Alleged Coup Plotters] Radio Liberty, 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, [[Andrija Mandić]] and [[Milan Knežević (Montenegrin politician)|Milan Knežević]], were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as "preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro" and an "attempted terrorist act."&lt;ref name="rferlcoup" /&gt;

In June 2017, Montenegro formally [[Montenegro–NATO relations|became a member]] of [[NATO]], an eventuality that had been rejected by about half of the country's population and had triggered a promise of retaliatory actions on the part of Russia's government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/25/montenegro-tensions-russia-joins-nato-member Montenegro finds itself at heart of tensions with Russia as it joins Nato: Alliance that bombed country only 18 years ago welcomes it as 29th member in move that has left its citizens divided] The Guardian, 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tass.ru/politika/3682321 МИД РФ: ответ НАТО на предложения российских военных неконкретный и размытый] // ″Расширение НАТО″, [[TASS]], 6 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.ru/web/guest/kommentarii_predstavitelya/-/asset_publisher/MCZ7HQuMdqBY/content/id/2740071 Комментарий Департамента информации и печати МИД России в связи с голосованием в Скупщине Черногории по вопросу присоединения к НАТО] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]]′s Statement, 28.04.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intentionality''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept and is defined by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' as "the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/intentionality/ |title=Intentionality |date=Aug 31, 2010 |author=Jacob, P.  |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The once obsolete term dates from medieval [[scholastic philosophy]], but in more recent times it has been resurrected by [[Franz Brentano]] and adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]].  The earliest theory of intentionality is associated with [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]], and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chisholm, Roderick M. |year=1967 |title=Intentionality |journal=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy |volume=4 |issue= |pages=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview&lt;!--'Act psychology' and 'Intentionalism (philosophy of mind)' redirect here--&gt; ==
The concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary [[philosophy]] by [[Franz Brentano]] (a German philosopher and [[Psychology|psychologist]] who is generally regarded as the founder of &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''act psychology''', also called &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''intentionalism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Franz-Brentano Franz Brentano – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in his work ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]'' (1874). Brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of [[consciousness]] that are thus "psychical" or "mental" phenomena, by which they may be set apart from "physical" or "natural" phenomena.
{{quote|Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction towards an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We could, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.| Franz Brentano|source=''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'', edited by Linda L. McAlister (London: Routledge, 1995), pp. 88–89.}}

Brentano coined the expression "intentional inexistence" to indicate the peculiar [[ontological]] status of the contents of mental phenomena. According to some interpreters the "in-" of "in-existence" is to be read as locative, i.e. as indicating that "an intended object ... exists in or has ''in-existence'', existing not externally but in the psychological state" (Jacquette 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;102), while others are more cautious, stating: "It is not clear whether in 1874 this ... was intended to carry any ontological commitment" (Chrudzimski and Smith 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;205).

A major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire, i.e. whether it involves [[teleology]]. Dennett (see below) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the "[[intentional stance]]". However, most philosophers use "intentionality" to mean something with no teleological import. Thus, a thought of a chair can be about a chair without any implication of an intention or even a belief relating to the chair. For philosophers of language, what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. This lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below.

To bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] followed on Brentano, and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention, both in [[continental philosophy|continental]] and [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David Woodruff|title=Husserl|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-28974-2|pages=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-TD3QmLHtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Brentano's view, French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') identified  intentionality with [[consciousness]], stating that the two were indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean-Paul Sartre |coauthors= |title=Being and Nothingness |year=2012 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=1453228551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (''[[Being and Time]]''), defined intentionality as "[[Heideggerian terminology|care]]" (''Sorge''), a [[sentience|sentient]] condition where an individual's existence, [[facticity]], and being in the world identifies their ontological significance, in contrast to that which is merely [[ontic]] ("thinghood").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Heidegger |coauthors= |title=Being and Time |year=1967  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=84 |isbn=0631197702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other 20th-century philosophers such as [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[A.J. Ayer]] were critical of Husserl's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayer|first=A.J.|title=More of My Life|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-19-281878-3|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=Don|title=Perception: And Our Knowledge Of The External World, Volume 3|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-29562-9|pages=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmlmLuQU4OAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ayer that describing one's knowledge is not to describe mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald|first=Graham|title=Alfred Jules Ayer|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/#5|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content, and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siewert|first=Charles|title=Consciousness and Intentionality|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/#PheConInt|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Sartre also referred to "consciousness" as "[[nothing]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franchi|first=Leo|title=Sartre and Freedom|url=http://files.lfranchi.com/papers/sartre.and.freedom.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonist]] [[Roderick Chisholm]] has revived the Brentano thesis through linguistic analysis, distinguishing two parts to Brentano's concept, the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Alex|title=Intentionality|url=http://mit.edu/abyrne/www/intentionality.html|work=Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the Scholastics, arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of Brentano's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena.&lt;ref name=bechtel&gt;{{cite book|last=Bechtel|first=William|title=Philosophy of Mind: An Overview for Cognitive Science|year=1988|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale NJ|isbn=978-0805802214|pages=44–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKbTvOBByQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chisholm's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are: existence independence, truth-value indifference, and [[opaque context|referential opacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horosz|first=William and Tad S. Clements|title=Religion and Human Purpose: A Cross Disciplinary Approach|year=1986|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-9024730001|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In current [[artificial intelligence]] and [[philosophy of mind]], intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Might the Singularity never occur?|url=http://singularity.org/singularity-faq/#r38|work=Singularity FAQ|publisher=Singularity Institute|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Searle]] argued for this position with the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, according to which no [[syntactic]] operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with [[semantic]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marconi|first=Diego|title="On the Referential Competence of Some Machines", in Integration of Natural Language and Vision Processing: Theory and Grounding Representations, Volume 3, edited by Paul Mc Kevitt|year=1996|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-9401072335|pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72dw2jkKfIwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atlan|first=H.|title="Ends and Means in Machine-Like Systems", in New Perspectives on Cybernetics: Self-Organization, Autonomy and Connectionism,  edited by Gertrudis Van de Vijver|year=1991|publisher=Sringer|location=New York|isbn=978-9048141074|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqI68ZBMGk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dennett's taxonomy of current theories about intentionality ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in Chapter 10 of his book ''[[Intentional stance|The Intentional Stance]]''. Most, if not all, current theories on intentionality accept Brentano's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom. From this thesis the following positions emerge:
* intentional idiom is problematic for [[natural science|science]];
* intentional idiom is not problematic for science, which is divided into:
** [[Eliminative Materialism]];
** [[Epistemological realism|Realism]];
** Quinean double standard (see below) which is divided into:
*** adherence to Normative Principle (epistemology), which is divided into:
**** who makes an Assumption of Rationality;
**** who follows the [[Principle of charity|Principle of Charity]];
*** adherence to Projective Principle.

[[Roderick Chisholm]] (1956), [[G.E.M. Anscombe]] (1957), [[Peter Geach]] (1957), and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] (1964) all adhere to the former position, namely that intentional idiom is problematic and cannot be integrated with the natural sciences. Members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects, which may imply some kind of dualism (though this is debatable).

The latter position, which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences, is further divided into three standpoints:
* '''Eliminative materialism''', supported by [[W.V. Quine]] (1960) and Churchland (1981)
* '''Realism''', advocated by [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975), as well as Burge, Dretske, Kripke, and the early [[Hilary Putnam]]
* those who adhere to the '''Quinean double standard'''.

Proponents of the '''eliminative materialism''', understand intentional idiom, such as "belief", "desire", and the like, to be replaceable either with behavioristic language (e.g. Quine) or with the language of neuroscience (e.g. Churchland).

Holders of '''realism''' argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution. In other words, manuals for translating one language into another cannot be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects. Famously, Fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought. Dennett comments on this issue, Fodor "attempt[s] to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them (somehow) in the 'syntax' of a system of physically realized mental representations" (Dennett 1987, 345).

Those who adhere to the so-called '''Quinean double standard''' (namely that ''ontologically there is nothing intentional, but that the language of intentionality is indispensable''), accept Quine's thesis of the [[indeterminacy of translation|indeterminacy of radical translation]] and its implications, while the other positions so far mentioned do not. As Quine puts it, indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that "manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another" (Quine 1960, 27). Quine (1960) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1958) both comment on this intermediary position. One such implication would be that there is, in principle, no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system. In other words, the behavior (including speech dispositions) of any physical system, in theory, could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution. This category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality. Dennett, for example, argues in ''True Believers'' (1981) that intentional idiom (or "[[folk psychology]]") is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system, then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it. Dennett calls this predictive strategy the [[intentional stance]].

They are further divided into two theses:
* adherence to the '''Normative Principle'''
* adherence to the '''Projective Principle'''

Advocates of the former, the Normative Principle, argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances (Dennett 1987, 342). However, exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an '''Assumption of Rationality''' and those who adhere to the '''Principle of Charity'''. Dennett (1969, 1971, 1975), Cherniak (1981, 1986), and the more recent work of Putnam (1983) recommend the Assumption of Rationality, which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1967, 1973, 1974, 1985) and Lewis (1974) defend the Principle of Charity.

The latter is advocated by Grandy (1973) and Stich (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984), who maintain that attributions of intentional idioms to any physical system (e.g. humans, artifacts, non-human animals, etc.) should be the propositional attitude (e.g. "belief", "desire", etc.) that one would suppose one would have in the same circumstances (Dennett 1987, 343).

== Basic intentionality types according to Le Morvan ==
Working on the intentionality of vision, belief, and knowledge, Pierre Le Morvan (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pierre Le Morvan |year=2005 |title=Intentionality: Transparent, Translucent, And Opaque |journal=Journal of Philosophical Research |volume=30 |issue= |pages=283–302 |url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~lemorvan/JPR_Proof.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 |doi=10.5840/jpr20053039}}&lt;/ref&gt; has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs "transparent", "translucent", and "opaque" respectively. The threefold distinction may be explained as follows. Let's call the "intendum" what an intentional state is about, and the "intender" the subject who is in the intentional state. An intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions: (i) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well, and (ii) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum (i.e. if the intentional state is about a, and a = b, then the intentional state is about b as well). An intentional state is translucent if it satisfies (i) but not (ii). An intentional state is opaque if it satisfies neither (i) nor (ii).

== Mental states without intentionality &lt;!--'Anti-intentionalism (philosophy of mind)' redirects here--&gt;==
The claim that all mental states are intentional is called intentionalism, the contrary being &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''anti-intentionalism'''.

Some anti-intentionalism, such as that of [[Ned Block]], is based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or [[qualia]] is also a vital component of consciousness, and that it is not intentional. (The latter claim is itself disputed by [[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Tye |year=1995 |title=A Representational Theory of Pains and their Phenomenal Character |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=9 |quote=[T]he phenomenal character of my pain intuitively is something that is given to me via introspection of what I experience in having the pain. But what I experience is what my experience represents. So, phenomenal character is representational. |pages=223–39 |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/TYEART |accessdate=21 December 2012 |doi=10.2307/2214219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of anti-intentionalism associated with [[John Searle]] regards phenomenality itself as the "mark of the mental" and sidelines intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/#10 |title=Is intentionality exhibited by all mental phenomena? |date=Aug 31, 2010 |author=Pierre Jacob |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional, although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them. [[Robert K.C. Forman]] argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of [[mystical experience]] are '''pure consciousness events''' in which awareness exists, but has no object, is not awareness "of" anything.

=== Intentionality and self-consciousness ===
Several authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]]. Cedric Evans contributed greatly to the discussion with his "The Subject of Self-Consciousness" in 1970. He centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mentalstates.net/3-3-11.html |title=The Subject of Consciousness |year=1970 |author=C.O. Evans |publisher=Mental States |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishmael''',{{Efn|{{Hebrew Name|{{Hebrew|יִשְׁמָעֵאל}}|Yi'shma'el|"God hears"}}; {{lang-el|Ἰσμαήλ}} ''Ismaēl''; Classical/Qur'anic [[Arabic]]: إِسْمَٰعِيْل; Modern Arabic: إِسْمَاعِيْل ''ʾIsmāʿīl''; {{lang-la|Ismael}}}} a figure in the [[Tanakh]] and the [[Quran]], was [[Abraham]]'s first son according to [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Islam|Muslims]]. Ishmael was born to Abraham and [[Sarah]]'s handmaiden [[Hagar]] ([[Hagar in Islam|Hājar]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|16:3|NIV}}). According to the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account, he died at the age of 137 ({{bibleverse||Genesis|25:17|NIV}}).

The Book of Genesis and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael to be the ancestor of the [[Ishmaelites]] and patriarch of [[Qaydār]]. According to Muslim tradition, Ishmael the Patriarch and his mother Hagar are buried next to the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, Hamilton A.R. and Kramers, J.H. (1965).

==Etymology==
The name ''Yishma'el'' existed in "various ancient [[Semitic cultures]]",&lt;ref name="EoR-Ishmael"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fredrick E. Greenspahn |editor=Lindsay Jones |title=Encyclopedia of Religion |article=Ishmael |volume=7 |year=2005|orig-year=1987 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |location= |pages=4551–52 |quote=ISHMAEL, or, in Hebrew, Yishmaʿeʾl; eldest son of Abraham. Ishmael's mother was Hagar, an Egyptian slave girl whom Sarah gave to Abraham because of her own infertility; in accordance with Mesopotamian law, the offspring of such a union would be credited to Sarah (''Gn''. 16:2). The name ''Yishmaʿeʾl'' is known from various ancient Semitic cultures and means 'God has hearkened,' suggesting that a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise. Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen by Abraham and expelled with his mother at the instigation of Sarah, who wanted to ensure that Isaac would be Abraham's heir (''Gn''. 21). In the New Testament, Paul uses this incident to symbolize the relationship between Judaism, the older but now rejected tradition, and Christianity (''Gal''. 4:21–31). In the ''Genesis'' account, God blessed Ishmael, promising that he would be the founder of a great nation and a 'wild ass of a man' always at odds with others (''Gn''. 16:12). He is credited with twelve sons, described as 'princes according to their  tribes' (''Gn''. 25:16), representing perhaps an ancient confederacy. The Ishmaelites, vagrant traders closely related to the Midianites, were apparently regarded as his descendants. The fact that Ishmael's wife and mother are both said to have been Egyptian suggests close ties between the Ishmaelites and Egypt. According to ''Genesis'' 25:17, Ishmael lived to the age of 137. Islamic tradition tends to ascribe a larger role to Ishmael than does the Bible. He is considered a prophet and, according to certain theologians, the offspring whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice (although ''surah'' 37:99-111 of the Qur'an never names that son). Like his father Abraham, Ishmael too played an important role in making Mecca a religious center (2:127-129). Judaism has generally regarded him as wicked, although repentance is also ascribed to him. According to some rabbinic traditions, his two wives were Aisha and Fatima, whose names are the same as those of Muhammad's wife and daughter. Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Ishmael |isbn=9780028657400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including early [[Babylonia]]n and [[Minæan]].&lt;ref name="Catholic1913"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gigot|first=Francis|title=Ismael|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic%20Encyclopedia%20(1913)/Ismael|journal=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|volume= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[theophoric]] name translated literally as "[[El (god)|God]] (El) has hearkened", suggesting that "a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise".&lt;ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/&gt;

==Genesis narrative==
[[File:Pieter Pietersz. Lastman 001.jpg|thumb|The dismissal of Hagar, by [[Pieter Pietersz Lastman]].]]

''This is the account of Ishmael from {{bibleref2|Genesis|16,17,21,25|NIV|Genesis Chapters 16, 17, 21, 25}}''

===Birth===
In {{Bibleverse||Genesis|16|HE}}, the birth of Ishmael was planned by the Patriarch [[Abraham]]'s first wife, who at that time was known as [[Sarah|Sarai]]. She and her husband Abram (Abraham) sought a way to have children in order to fulfill the [[Abrahamic covenant]] that was established in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15|HE}}. Sarai was 75 years old and had yet to bear Abraham a child. She had the idea to offer her Egyptian handmaiden [[Hagar (biblical person)|Hagar]] to her husband, so that they could have a child by her. Abraham took Hagar as his wife, and conceived a child with her.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 16:3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagar began to show contempt for Sarah, who responded by treating her harshly. Hagar then fled into the desert region between Abraham's settlement and Shur. {{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:7-16|HE}} describes the naming of Ishmael, and God's promise to Hagar concerning Ishmael and his descendants. This occurred at the well of Beer-lahai-roi, where Hagar encountered an angel of God, who said to her "Behold, you are with child / And shall bear a son; / You shall call him Ishmael, / For the Lord has paid heed to your suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 16:11, NJPS.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham was blessed so that his descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth. God would make of Ishmael a great nation, because he was of the seed of Abraham. However, God told Hagar that her son would be a "wild ass (donkey) of a man" (Genesis 16:12), living in conflict with his relatives. When Ishmael was born, Abraham was 86 years old.

===Inheritance, rights and the first circumcision===
{{See also|Isaac#Hebrew Bible|l1=Account of Isaac in the Hebrew Bible}}
When he was 13 years old, Ishmael was circumcised at the same time as all other males in Abraham's household, becoming a part of the [[Brit milah|covenant]] in a mass circumcision. His father Abram, given the new name "Abraham," then 99, was circumcised along with the others ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}}).

At the time of the covenant, God informed Abraham that his wife Sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name Isaac. God told Abraham that He would establish his covenant through Isaac, and when Abraham inquired as to Ishmael's role, God answered that Ishmael has been blessed and that He "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation." ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}}). God also mentioned that "He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be over everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers."({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16|HE}}).

A year later, Ishmael's half-brother [[Isaac]] was born to Abraham by his first wife Sarah when she was 90 years old ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:17|NIV}}), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:11|NIV}}).

On the day of feasting during which Abraham celebrated the weaning of Isaac, Ishmael was "mocking" or "playing with" Isaac (the Hebrew word מְצַחֵֽק ''meṣaḥeq'' is ambiguous)&lt;ref name="Whedbee1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. William Whedbee|title=The Bible and the Comic Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=28 May 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49507-3|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarah asked Abraham to expel Ishmael and his mother, saying: "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/251469/Hagar "Hagar"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:2–6|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her demand was painful for Abraham, who loved Hagar and Ishmael. Abraham agreed only after God told him that "in Isaac your seed shall be called", and that God would "make a [[Ishmaelites|nation]] of the son of the bondwoman" Ishmael, since he was a descendant of Abraham ({{bibleverse||Genesis|21:11–13|NIV}}), God having previously told Abraham "I will establish My covenant with [Isaac]," while also making promises concerning the [[Ishmaelites|Ishmaelite]] nation ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|17:18–21|NASB}}).
[[File:Hagar and Ishmael in desert (Grigoriy Ugryumov).jpg|thumb|''Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert'', by [[Grigory Ugryumov]] (c. 1785).]]
At the age of 14, Ishmael was freed along with his mother. The Lord's covenant made clear Ishmael was not to inherit Abraham's house and that Isaac would be the seed of the covenant: "Take your son, [[Binding of Isaac|your only son]], whom you love and go to the region of Moriah." (Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|22:2–8|HE}})
Abraham gave Ishmael and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away. Hagar entered in the wilderness of [[Beer-sheba]] where the two soon ran out of water and Hagar, not wanting to witness the death of her son, set the boy some distance away from herself, and wept. "And God heard the voice of the lad" and sent his angel to tell Hagar, "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation." And God "opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water", from which she drew to save Ishmael's life and her own. "And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer." ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:14–21|HE}})

===Descendants===
{{main|Ishmaelites}}
After roaming the wilderness for some time, Ishmael and his mother settled in the [[Desert of Paran]], where he became an expert in [[archery]]. Eventually, his mother found him a wife from the land of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:17–21|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had twelve sons who each became tribal chiefs throughout the regions from [[Havilah]] to [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] (from [[Assyria]] to the border of Egypt).&lt;ref name="JewishEnc"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=277&amp;letter=I&amp;search=Ishmael "Ishmael"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; His sons were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|25:12–18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World views==
[[Historian]]s and academics in the fields of [[linguistics]] and [[source criticism]] believe that the stories of Ishmael belong to the three strata of J, or [[Jahwist|Yahwist source]], the P, or [[Priestly source]], and  the E, or [[Elohist source]] (See [[Documentary hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="Catholic1913"/&gt; For example, the narration in {{bibleverse|Genesis|16|NIV}} is of J type and the narration in {{bibleverse|Genesis|21:8–21|NIV}} is of E type.&lt;ref&gt;S.

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
Some [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Pre-Islamic]] poetry mentions Ishmael, his father [[Abraham]], and the sacrifice story, such as the Pre-Islamic poet "Umayyah Ibn Abi As-Salt", who said in one of his poems: بكره لم يكن ليصبر عنه أو يراه في معشر أقتال  ([The sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [Abraham] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).&lt;ref&gt;The Treasury of literature, Sect. 437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Beginning of History, Volume 3, Sect.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kashf Wa Al-Bayan, Vol. 11, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Zayd ibn Amr]]" was another Pre-Islamic figure who refused [[idolatry]] and preached [[monotheism]], claiming it was the original belief of their [Arabs] father Ishmael.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya|The Beginning and the End]] by [[Ibn Kathir]] – Vol. 3, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History by Ibn Khaldun, Vol, 2, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some of the tribes of Central West Arabia called themselves the "people of Abraham and the offspring of Ishmael", as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.&lt;ref&gt;The Signs of Prophethood, Section 18, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Collection of the Speeches of Arabs, volume 1, section 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Isaac#Jewish traditions|l1=Isaac in Jewish traditions}}
In Rabbinic [[Judaism]], Ishmael has generally been viewed as wicked, though repentant.&lt;ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/&gt; According to the Book of Genesis, in the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Isaac]] rather than Ishmael was the true heir of the Abrahamic tradition and covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Encyclopaedia Judaica | volume=10 | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Rabbinic traditions Ishmael is said to have had two wives; one of them named Aisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISHMAEL

The wife remained nameless, but we know this would not be for long. One suggestion in Pirqe de Rabbi Eliezer (The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer), from the eighth century, written probably under Islamic rule, is that Ishmael had two wives named Aisha and Fatima, which happen to be the names of Muhammad's wife and daughter, respectively (Pirqe R. El. 30). Rather than coincidence, this could have been a way of emphasizing the close affinity of Islamic peoples with the great prophet and founder. At all events, Ishmael (Isma'il) became the symbol, representative, and patriarch of the Arab peoples in general and, in virtue of his noble descent and Arabian origins, of Islamic peoples...|isbn=9781467443777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinical commentators in the [[Midrash]] [[Genesis Rabbah]] also say that Ishmael's mother Hagar was the Pharaoh's daughter, thereby making Ishmael the grandson of the Pharaoh. This could be why Genesis 17:20 refers to Ishmael as the father of 12 mighty princes. According to Genesis 21:21, Hagar married Ishmael to an Egyptian woman, and if Rabbinical commentators are correct about Hagar being the daughter of the Pharaoh, his marriage to a woman selected by the Pharaoh's daughter could explain how and why his sons became princes.

However, according to other Jewish commentators, Ishmael's mother Hagar is identified with [[Keturah]], the woman Abraham married after the death of Sarah, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar's personal name, and that "Hagar" was a descriptive label meaning "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2636/jewish/The-Return-of-Hagar.htm "The Return of Hagar"], commentary on [[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Parshah Chayei Sarah]], [[Chabad Lubavitch]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/chaye/sha.html "Who Was Ketura?"], [[Bar-Ilan University]]'s Parashat Hashavua Study Center, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm "Parshat Chayei Sarah"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113015839/http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}, ''Torah Insights'', [[Orthodox Union]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is discussed in the [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bereshit Rabbah]] 61:4.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by [[Rashi]], [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Gur Aryeh]], [[Keli Yakar]], and [[Obadiah of Bertinoro]].  Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki) argues that "Keturah" was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (Hebrew, ''ketoret''), and that she remained chaste (literally "tied her opening", with the verb ''tied'' in Aramaic being ''k-t-r'') from the time she was separated from Abraham.

It is also said that Sarah was motivated by Ishmael's sexually frivolous ways because of the reference to his "making merry" (Gen. 21:9), a translation of the Hebrew word "Mitzachek". This was developed into a reference to idolatry, sexual immorality or even murder; some rabbinic sources claim that Sarah worried that Ishmael would negatively influence Isaac, or that he would demand Isaac's inheritance on the grounds of being the firstborn. Regarding the word "Mitzachek" (again in Gen. 21:9) The Jewish Study Bible by [[Oxford University Press]] says this word in this particular context is associated with; "Playing is another pun on Isaac's name (cf. 17.17; 18.12; 19.14; 26.8). Ishmael was 'Isaacing', or 'taking Isaac's place'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Adele Berlin |author2=Marc Zvi Brettler |title=The Jewish Study Bible |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780195297515 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDuy3p5QvEYC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=isaacing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YJis0Ifu28&amp;sig=jIlZLzxfow_p98d6aKpbdtAf3WY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9K3dT6RckI3pAaaGiZAL&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isaacing 44] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also others take a more positive view, emphasizing Hagar's piety, noting that she was "the one who had sat by the well and besought him who is the life of the worlds, saying 'look upon my misery'".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;Jeffrey, David L., ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature'', Wm.

====Ishmael in the Quran====
Ishmael is mentioned over ten times in the [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/search.php?keyword=Ismail&amp;translator=3&amp;search=1|title=Search the word Ismail in the Quran  القران الكريم in English translation  by Shakir – Search Quran Koran Qur'an القران الكريم|website=Searchtruth.com|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/search.php?keyword=ishmael&amp;chapter=&amp;translator=4&amp;search=1&amp;start=0&amp;records_display=10&amp;search_word=all|title=Search  the word ishmael  in the Quran  القران الكريم in English translation  by Pickthal – Search Quran Koran Qur'an القران الكريم|website=Searchtruth.com|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; often alongside other [[patriarch]]s and [[prophet]]s of ancient times. Ishmael is mentioned together with [[Elisha]] and [[Dhul-Kifl]] as one of "the patiently enduring and righteous, whom God caused to enter into his mercy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|38|48|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]], Elisha, [[Jonah]] and Ishmael, that God gave each one "preference above the worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|86|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; These references to Ishmael are, in each case, part of a larger context in which other holy prophets are mentioned. In other chapters of the Quran, however, which date from the [[Medinan sura|Medina period]], Ishmael is mentioned closely with his father [[Abraham]]: Ishmael stands alongside Abraham in their attempt to set up the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|127|end=129|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Abraham thanks [[God]] for granting him Ishmael and [[Isaac]] in his old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|14|35|end=41|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishmael is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|136|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]]'s sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac", when testifying their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|133|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative of the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|100|end=107|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was Ishmael, [[Al-Tabari|Tabari]]&lt;ref&gt;"Isaac", ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', volume 4&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that it was Isaac. Most modern commentators, however, regard the son's identification as least important in a narrative which is given for its moral lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, C., "Ishmael", ''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ishmael in Muslim literature====
[[File:Abraham ready to sacrifice his son, Ishmael (top); Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod (bottom).jpg|thumb|Abraham sacrificing his son, Ishmael; and Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod. A miniature in the 16th-century manuscript ''Zubdat Al-Tawarikh''.]]

The commentaries on the [[Quran]] and the numerous collections of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' flesh out the Islamic perspective of Ishmael and detail what they describe as his integral part in setting up the [[Kaaba]]. According to [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], Ishmael was buried at the [[Al Hijr (Kaaba)|Hijr]] near the Kaaba, inside the [[Sacred Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'' Volume 4, ''Ismail''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic theology|Islamic belief]], Abraham had prayed to [[God]] for a son and God heard his prayer. [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] states that [[Sarah]] asked Abraham to marry her [[Egypt]]ian [[handmaiden]] [[Hagar]] because she herself was barren.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Hagar soon bore Ishmael, who was the first son of Abraham. God then instructed Abraham to take his wife Hagar and their baby Ishmael out in to the desert and to leave them there. He did so taking them to the location of the Kaaba's foundations (which now was in ruins) and as he turned away from Hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked "Why are you leaving us here?" to which Abraham didn't reply the first two times she asked. She then changed her question and asked "Did God command you to do this?" to which Abraham stopped, turned around, looked back and replied "Yes." and she responded "Then God will provide for us." Abraham then continued on his return journey back to Sarah. In the desert, the baby Ishmael cried with thirst.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went in a frantic search for water, which resulted in her running seven times between the [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa and Marwah]] hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan who she could trade with for water. Hagar, not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby, sat down and cried asking for God's help. God sent angel Gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did, she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface. Hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water forming the [[Zamzam well]]. Hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink. This spring became known to caravans that traveled through Arabia and Hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water. From her actions, the city of Mecca (originally Becca or Baca in Hebrew) grew, and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and Ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans. To commemorate the blessing of the Zamzam well which God gave to Hagar and Ishmael, Muslims run between the [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa and Marwah]] hills retracing Hagar’s steps on her search for water, during the rites of [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Abraham returned and visited Ishmael at various times throughout his life. At one time, according to a tradition of Muhammad, Abraham had arrived when his son was out and Abraham visited with Ishmael's wife. Abraham decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints Ishmael's wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was "change his threshold." When Ishmael arrived that night, he asked if they had had any visitors, and was informed by his wife of the man who had visited and what he said. Ishmael understood his father and explained to his wife that the visitor was his father and he had been instructed to divorce his wife and find a better one, which Ishmael did. Some time after this, Abraham returned to visit Ishmael and again Ishmael was out. Abraham talked with Ishmael's new wife and found her answers indicated faith in God and contentment with her husband. Abraham again had to leave before he saw his son, but left him the message to "keep his threshold." When Ishmael returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of Abraham’s visit. Ishmael told his wife who it was that had come to visit and that he approved of her and their marriage.

On one of his visits to [[Mecca]], [[Abraham]] is said to have asked his son to help him build the requested [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|127|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic traditions hold that the Kaaba was first built by [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and that Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba on the old foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Azraqi, ''Akhbar Makkah'', vol. 1, pp. 58–66&lt;/ref&gt; As Ishmael grew up in [[Arabia]], he is said to have become fluent in [[Arabic]]. In the genealogical trees that the early scholars drew,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicles'', Tabari, Vol I: ''From Creation to Flood''&lt;/ref&gt; Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Northern [[Arab]]s and Muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of the [[patriarch]] [[Adnan]]. Ishmael may also have been the ancestor of the Southern Arabs through his descendant [[Qahtan]].

===Christianity===
{{See also|Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in Christian tradition|Isaac#New Testament|l1=Hagar in Christian tradition|l2=Isaac in the New Testament}}
In the [[Epistle to the Galatians|book of Galatians]] (4:21–31), [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] uses the incident to symbolize the two covenants the old but fulfilled and new covenant which is universal by promise through Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/&gt; In Galatians 4:28–31,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Galatians|4:28–31|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagar is associated with the [[Mosaic Covenant|Sinai covenant]], while Sarah is associated with the [[Covenant theology|covenant of grace]] into which her son Isaac enters.&lt;ref name="EoC-Isaac"&gt;Encyclopedia of Christianity(Ed. John Bowden), Isaac&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===

[[Prince]] '''Ivane Javakhishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ივანე ჯავახიშვილი}}, 11 April 1876 – 18 November 1940) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian and a linguist whose voluminous works heavily influenced the [[Kartvelian studies|modern scholarship]] of the [[History of Georgia (country)|history]] and [[Culture of Georgia (country)|culture of Georgia]].  He was also one of the founding fathers of the [[Tbilisi State University]] (1918) and its [[Rector (academia)|rector]] from 1919 to 1926.

==Biography==

Prince Ivane Javakhishvili was born in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (then part of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]) to the aristocratic family of Prince Alexander Javakhishvili, who served as an educator at the Tbilisi Gymnasium.  Having graduated from the Faculty of [[Oriental Studies]] of the [[St. Petersburg University]] in 1899, he became a ''privat-docent'' of the Chair of [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and Georgian Philology at his alma mater.  From 1901 to 1902, he was a visiting scholar at the [[University of Berlin]].  In 1902, he accompanied his mentor, Academician [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr|Nicholas Marr]], to [[Mount Sinai]] where they studied medieval Georgian manuscripts.  After the first volumes of Javakhishvili's monumental, but yet unfinished, ''kartveli eris istoria'' (A History of the Georgian Nation) appeared between 1908 and 1914, the young scholar quickly established himself as a preeminent authority on Georgian and [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] history, Georgian law, paleography, diplomacy, music, drama and other subjects, producing landmark studies in these fields.&lt;ref&gt;Mikaberidze, Alexander (ed., 2007), [http://www.georgianbiography.com/bios/j/javakhishvili.htm Javakhishvili, Ivane]. ''Dictionary of Georgian National Biography''. Accessed 3 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early in 1918, he was instrumental in founding Georgia's first regular university in Tbilisi, thus realizing a long-time dream cherished by generations of Georgian intellectuals but consistently frustrated by the Imperial Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1962), ''A Modern History of Georgia'', p. 211. [[London]]: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tbilisi University (present-day [[Tbilisi State University|I. Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University]], TSU, which now bears his name), of which Javakhishvili became a professor and the head of the Department of the History of Georgia, rapidly assumed a dominant position in Georgia's educational life.  In 1919, Javakhishvili succeeded the noted chemist [[Petre Melikishvili]] as the second rector of the university: he served until June 1926, when, in the aftermath of [[anti-Soviet]] [[August Uprising]] of 1924, tolerance of non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectuals began to contract.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 223. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he was permitted to publish and teach, this eclipse probably saved his life, since his successor at the university, was among the victims of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Great Purge]] of 1936–7.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1962), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was forced to step down at TSU in 1938, but was soon appointed director of the Department of History at the [[National Museum of Georgia|State Museum of Georgia]] which he headed until his death in Tbilisi in 1940.  He was interred at the yard of the TSU.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Javakhishvili authored more than 170 works dealing with various aspects of Georgia's political, cultural, social and economic history.  Since the publication of its first edition in 1908, his main work, ''A History of the Georgian Nation'' (fully published between 1908 and 1949), has remained one of the most comprehensive and eloquent treatments of pre-modern Georgian history.  Regrettably, it has not been translated into any other language.  Several of Javakhishvili's most influential articles and books including ''A History of the Georgian Nation'' have been reprinted in his twelve-volume collected works from 1977 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Stephen H.

'''James Mavor''' (December 8, 1854 – October 31, 1925) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[economist]]. He served as a Professor of Political Economy of the [[University of Toronto]] from 1892 to 1923. His influence upon Canadian economic thought is traced to as late as the 1970s. He played a key role in resettling [[Doukhobor]] religious dissidents from the [[Russian Empire]] to Canada. He was also a noted arts promoter.

==Life and career==
Mavor was born in Stranraer, Scotland, to a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister and teacher James Mavor, and Mary Ann Taylor Bridie. He studied in [[Glasgow University]]. After that he taught for some time in a Glasgow college and read special courses in Glasgow University and [[Edinburgh University]]. He was also an editor for ''Scottish Art Review''.  He also became active in the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]], chairing its Scottish district.&lt;ref name="marwick"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marwick |first1=W. H. |title=Short History of Labour in Scotland |date=1967 |publisher=W &amp; R Chambers |location=Edinburgh |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, upon the recommendation of University of Toronto Professor [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]] who was leaving for [[Harvard University]], he took Ashley's chair of Political Economy and Constitutional History, moving to [[Toronto]] with his family (including daughter [[Dora Mavor Moore|Dora]] who would later become a major figure in Canada's theatre). After 1892, he spent most of his life in Toronto, leaving only for short trips.

In 1893, James Mavor was a founding member of the Toronto Chapter of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] Literary Society.

At the start, he caused turmoil when he stated Canada could not serve as the only source of wheat for the British Empire as general ideology of the Empire observed it. To avoid further misunderstanding, he took the economy of Russia as his major scientific specialization. As a professor he also researched the economies of Canada, China, Korea, and Japan.

In 1898 through 1899, he became a key figure in the Doukhobor immigration to Canada. His correspondent at the time was notable Russian scientist and major [[Anarchist]] ideologist [[Kropotkin]], at that time living in the UK, who proposed that Doukhobor peasantry, numbering several thousand people, be settled in Canada. Through several years that followed, he took a keen interest in the Doukhobor cause, siding with them in cases of conflict with Canadian authorities.

As an arts activist, Mavor helped organize several Canadian art venues, such as the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] and the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].

He published articles and statistics for the Canadian government regarding immigration, wheat production, and workers' healthcare compensation. In 1914, he published the first edition of his ''magnum opus'', ''An Economic History of Russia'', in two volumes. This publication earned him membership in the [[Royal Society of Canada]].

After over 30 years of teaching economy, he became professor emeritus and retired in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/fisher/collections/canadiana.html  Canadiana — Отдел Рукописей Университета Торонто]&lt;/ref&gt; After he left, the University of Toronto for some time discontinued the tradition of extensive Russian studies he and William Ashley founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history47.htm  What helped launch Slavic studies as a growth discipline at the University of Toronto?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820132510/http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history47.htm |date=2007-08-20 }} at University of Toronto web site&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at the age of 71 in Glasgow, Scotland, during a trip to relatives.

His grandson is actor [[Mavor Moore]], his great-granddaughters are actresses [[Charlotte Moore]] and [[Tedde Moore]], and his great-great-grandson is actor and music producer [[40 (record producer)|Noah "40" Shebib]].

'''John Chapman Ostlund''' (September 29, 1927 &amp;ndash; April 27, 2004) was a diversified businessman from [[Gillette, Wyoming]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], who served in the [[Wyoming State Senate]] from 1973 to 1978, when he resigned to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As the GOP nominee, he came within 1 percentage point of unseating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor]] [[Edgar Herschler]] of [[Kemmerer, Wyoming|Kemmerer]] in [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Lincoln County]] in western Wyoming. Ostlund lost his sight in 1985 because of complications from diabetes. Thereafter, he became an advocate of the blind and penned his memoirs to benefit the [[Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind]] in [[Smithtown, New York]].

==Early years, education, military==

Ostlund was the second son born to Axel William Ostlund (1891–1982) and the former Mary Spence "Polly" Roberts (1902–1980) in Gillette, the seat of [[Campbell County, Wyoming|Campbell County]] in northeastern Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index:http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he graduated from [[Campbell County High School (Gillette, Wyoming)|Campbell County High School]] and then entered [[Kemper Military School]] in [[Boonville, Missouri]], which closed in 2002. He received an appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], from Republican U.S. Senator [[Frank A. Barrett]] of Wyoming. He graduated in 1949 with the commission of ensign and served on the destroyer ''Meredith'' in the Mediterranean Sea. The diagnosis of diabetes required him to retire from the Navy in 1950. During a stay at St. Albans Naval Hospital on [[Long Island, New York]], he met the Navy nurse Ensign Mary Virginia Ryan (born 1928). On January 13, 1952, the couple wed in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]. They settled in his native Gillette.
&lt;ref name=obit&gt;http://www.stevensonandsons.com/Forsyth/2004%20Obits/Obit,%20Ostlund,%20John.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostlund and his brother, Axel R. "Bob" Ostlund, were involved in a multitude of business activities in Gillette: [[John Deere]] Farm Machinery, plumbing and heating, sheet metal, banking, and the construction and operation of motels and restaurants. Their interest also reached into manufacturing, real estate, investments, agri-business, and mineral leasing and exploration.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Political and community service==

Ostlund was chairman of the Campbell County Republican Party from 1961 to 1969. He then served for several years as a state Republican committeeman. In 1969, Governor [[Stanley K. Hathaway]] named Ostlund to the board of trustees of the [[University of Wyoming]] at [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]].  During his term, UW developed its Fine Arts Center.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1972, Ostlund unseated state Senator Richard A. Mader (1923–2001)&lt;ref&gt;http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi&lt;/ref&gt; of Gillette in the Republican primary to represent Campbell and neighboring [[Johnson County, Wyoming|Johnson County]], which was the site of a notorious [[range war]] in the early 1890s. He won the general election in the fall and was reelected in 1976. The 1970s were a time when Wyoming, and particularly Campbell County, were experiencing growth in mineral development. Ostlund, a conservative Republican, was chairman of the Senate Mines, Minerals and Industrial Development Committee and was involved in the development of the Wyoming Community Development Authority, the Coal Tax for Impact Assistance, and the School Foundation Program to finance capital facilities. Ostlund listed his most important accomplishment as the acquisition of the land for the "Camplex", the multi-activities center for Campbell County.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In the spring of 1978, Ostlund resigned from the state Senate to run for governor. In the primary, he polled 40,251 votes (58.9 percent) to defeat [[Gus Fleischli]], a [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]] native who was in the petroleum business in Cheyenne, who received 24,824 ballots (36.4 percent). In a mostly Democratic year nationally, Ostlund was then defeated in the general election by Herschler: 67,595 votes (49.1 percent) to 69,972 (50.9 percent). Four years earlier as the GOP nominee, trucking executive and former State Senator [[Dick Jones (Wyoming politician)|Dick Jones]] of [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]] in [[Park County, Wyoming|Park County]] received 56,645 (44.1 percent) to Herschler's 71,741 (55.9 percent). Ostlund hence ran 10,950 votes ahead of Jones, but Jones faced voters in a more heavily Democratic year nationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'', p. 1538&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 to 1995, the Ostlunds owned the historic [[Remount Ranch]] twenty-three miles west of the capital city of Cheyenne. During the early years, the ranch was a weekend home, but it was a full-time residence for the last eleven years until it was sold.&lt;ref name=remount&gt;Website about historic 
Remount Ranch of Wyoming:http://www.remountranch.com/historybody.html&lt;/ref&gt; The couple made extensive restorations to the property and hosted civic, educational, and social functions there. By 1985, Ostlund had gradually lost his sight but continued many community activities, including service on the board of the [[Wells Fargo]] Bank, the Cheyenne United Medical Center Foundation, the Governor’s Mansion Foundation and the acclaimed [[Old West Museum]] in Cheyenne.  He was also a member of Cheyenne [[Rotary International]] and the Cheyenne Young Men’s Literary Club,.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1995, the Ostlunds relocated to Cheyenne and sold Remount to the Bangert family, which returned it to his previous status as a working ranch.&lt;ref name=remount/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

In 2001, Ostlund published his autobiography, ''Quite a Life'', which he dedicated to his eight grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Bookfinder, {{ISBN|1-58783-003-5}}?9781587830037 ? 1-58783-003-5, publisher Elton-Wolf: http://www.bookfinder.com/author/john-c-ostlund/&lt;/ref&gt;  All proceeds from the sale of the book were donated to the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, the organization from which he obtained his two guide dogs. His most recent dog, Russ, died unexpectedly several weeks before Ostlund's own passing. Ostlund sometimes took his guide dogs into elementary school classrooms to demonstrate how he and the dogs worked as a team to assist him in maintaining his many activities. Despite his handicap, Ostlund maintained many private interests, including playing the piano.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Ostlund died at his home in Cheyenne. In addition to his wife and brother, he was survived by his eight children: Peg Ostlund of Cheyenne, John Ostlund, Jr., of [[Westminster, Colorado]]; Nancy Essery of [[San Diego, California]]; Tom Ostlund of Cheyenne, Karin Ostlund of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]; Patrick Ostlund of  [[Douglas, Wyoming]]; Jane Gebhart and Scott Ostlund, both of Gillette. A mass of Christian burial was delivered on May 3, 2004, at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in Gillette.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Justus of Tiberias''' was a [[Jew]]ish author and historian living in the second half of the 1st century AD.  Little is known about his life, except as told by his political and literary enemy [[Josephus|Josephus Flavius]]. &lt;ref&gt;Shaye J. D. Cohen, ''Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Development as a Historian'', pages 114-144 (Leiden: Brill, 1979). {{ISBN|0-391-04158-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Justus, the son of Pistus,&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, War p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Tiberias]], a highly [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Galilee|Galilean]] city and was a man of learning. He was close to the Tetrarch [[Agrippa II]] and became a leading citizen of his hometown. &lt;ref&gt;Joan Comay, ''Who's Who In Jewish History: After the Period of The Old Testament'', page 210 (David McKay Company Inc., 1974; revised version by Lavinia Cohn-Sherbok, Routledge, 1995). {{ISBN|0-415-26030-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] (66-73), he ran into conflict with Josephus, a Jewish leader in Galilee. When the Romans had reconquered Galilee, Justus sought sanctuary with the Tetrach Agrippa. [[Vespasian]], who led the Roman troops, demanded that Justus be put to death, but Agrippa spared him and merely imprisoned him. The [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] even appointed Justus as his secretary, but later dismissed him as unreliable.

Justus wrote a history of the war in which he blamed Josephus for the troubles of Galilee. He also portrayed his former master Agrippa in an unfavourable light, but did not publish the work until after Agrippa's death. Justus also wrote a chronicle of the Jewish people from Moses to Agrippa II. Both his works only survive in fragments.

Flavius Josephus, Justus' rival, criticized the Tiberian's account of the war and defended his own conduct in the ''Autobiography'', from whose polemical passages we derive most of what we know about Justus' life.

==Works==
As well as a history of the war, Justus also wrote a chronicle of the kings of Israel from the time of [[Moses]] to Agrippa II, which [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]] remarked failed to make any mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. &lt;ref&gt;[[James Carleton Paget]], ''Jews, Christians and Jewish Christians In Antiquity'', page 202, citing Photius' work ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheke]]'' 33 (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2010). {{ISBN|978-3-16-150312-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neither of his works has survived. &lt;ref&gt;Joan Comay, page 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kintu''' is a mythological figure who appears in a legend of the [[Buganda|Baganda]] of [[Uganda]] as a [[creation myth]]. According to this legend, Kintu was the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first person on earth]], the father of all people. 

Kintu was the first man who wandered alone in the plains of Baganda. He met a woman and her brother, who had come from the sky. The woman, Nnambi, took Kintu to meet her father, [[Ggulu]], in the sky. They married and had many children. Nnambi's brother was [[Walumbe]] ("Death"), and he brought [[death]] to Kintu and Nnambi, but their children continued to multiply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1906">'''Michael Curtis Ford''' is an American [[historical novel]]ist, writing novels about [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. He has worked variously as a laborer, a ski patrolman, a musician, a consultant, a banker, a Latin teacher, and a translator. He holds degrees in Economics and Linguistics and lives in [[Oregon]], where he and his wife [[homeschool]] their three children. He has also written numerous articles on ancient military themes.

Contrary to popular conception, he did not write the books: ''[[The Fire of Ares]]'', ''Birth of a Warrior'', and ''Legacy of Blood''. On his website he states- "regarding the subject matter of my 'next book', ''[[The Fire of Ares: Spartan Quest]]'': very sorry to disappoint, but that is not my next book! After some investigation, I have found that ''Fire of Ares'' is apparently a 'young adult'-level book written by a British author with a name disconcertingly similar to my own, Michael Ford."

'''Mula Mustafa Bašeskija''' ({{circa|1731}} – 18 August 1809) was an 18th-century [[Bosniak]] chronicler, diarist, poet, calligrapher and retired [[Jannisary]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.avlija.me/portreti/mula-mustafa-baseskija-sevki|title=Mula Mustafa Bašeskija – Ševki|publisher=Avlija|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chronicled the history and events in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]] and in the Ottoman Empire during his lifetime and is considered an important figure in the history of Sarajevo for preserving information that would have otherwise been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost/162271/mula-mustafa-baseskija-mnogo-vise-od-narodnog-pisara|title=Mula Mustafa Bašeskija, mnogo više od narodnog pisara|publisher=Radio Sarajevo|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Bašeskija was born into a poor [[Muslim]] [[Bosniak]] family in a [[Sarajevo]] [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] named after [[Mimar Sinan]]. Both his paternal grandfather Kadir and maternal grandfather Mehmed were [[Imam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.historija.ba/d/25-godisnjica-smrti-mula-mustafe-baseskije/|title=Godišnjica smrti Mula Mustafe Bašeskije|publisher=Historija|date=|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bašeskija lost his father Ahmed when he was a child. His mother Fatima remarried and died in 1772 of a stroke after a long illness. His uncle Topal Osman-aga died in [[Belgrade]] in 1760.

As a child Bašeskija attended [[mektab]] and later [[Madrasa|medresa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.camo.ch/baseskija.htm|title=MULA MUSTAFA BASESKIJA SEVKI|publisher=Camo|year=2006|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 1763 that he began [[scribe|scribing]] Bosnian history. During the 1760s he also owned a small shop underneath a clock tower in Sarajevo.

In his shop, in addition to clerical jobs, he taught students and other people in the [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] and [[Sharia law]]. In 1779, he wrote that he and few friends met once a week in a house, where, in addition to gathering and conversing for half an hour, were dedicated to reading books.

Bašeskija left Sarajevo on 1 July 1781 and moved with his family to the village [[Zgošća]] near [[Kakanj]], only to return to Sarajevo less than a year later in February 1782.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with most of Europe, experienced a resurgence of the [[Black Death]] plague in the 18th century. Bašeskija chronicled the lives of 4,000 of the dead, mostly adult [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DHDVf2ITy0C&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Sarajevo Under Siege: Anthropology in Wartime; Page 40|publisher=Google Books|year=2009|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Mula Mustafa Bašeskija added a collection of poems in the [[Bosnian language]] in one of his yearbooks, arguing that the Bosnian language is much richer than [[Arabic language|Arabic]], because there are 45 words for the verb "to go" in Bosnian.

Probably his best-known work is ''Ljetopis o Sarajevu'' ("Chronicle of Sarajevo"), in which he detailed not only his life and the lives of his family members, but the urban life in Sarajevo in its various aspects and events in Sarajevo and the [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnian province]] as a whole from 1746 to 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fW_-AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |title=The Influence Of Human Mobility In Muslim Societies; Pages 106–107|publisher=Google Books|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Bašeskija became ill in 1801 and died in the summer of 1809 aged about 77–78.

'''Pierre Emmanuel Vidal-Naquet''' ({{IPA-fr|vidal nakɛ|lang}}; 23 July 1930 – 29 July 2006) was a [[France|French]] [[historian]] who began teaching at the ''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]]'' (EHESS) in 1969.

Vidal-Naquet was a specialist in the study of [[Ancient Greece]], but was also interested (and deeply involved) in contemporary history, particularly the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62), during which he opposed the use of torture by the [[French Army]], as well as [[Jewish history]]. Having participated with [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Marie Domenach]] in the founding of the ''Groupe d'information sur les prisons'' (GIP), one of the first French [[new social movement]]s, he criticized [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]. Vidal-Naquet, who never abandoned his fascination with Antiquity, was also a supporter of [[:Category:Middle East peace efforts|Middle East peace efforts]].

==Biography==

Vidal-Naquet's family belonged to the [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] community rooted in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] ([[Carpentras]], [[Avignon]]). He was born in Paris, and he was raised in bourgeois,  [[Republicanism|Republican]] and [[laicité|secular]] environment. His father Lucien was a lawyer, of "[[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]]" temperament, who quickly entered the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in order to avoid exile. In June 1940, the family moved to [[Marseille]]. Arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on 15 May 1944, Vidal-Naquet's father was deported, along with his wife, in June 1944. They were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where they died. At 14 years old, Pierre Vidal-Naquet then hid in his grandmother's house in the [[Drôme]]. There, he read a lot, including the ''[[Iliad]]'', and came to know his cousin, the philosopher Jacques Brunschwig. He later learnt that the [[Nazi]]s had made "his father dance," something he would never forget.

After his studies at the [[lycée Carnot]] in Paris, he specialized in the history of [[Ancient Greece]], as well as in contemporary subjects such as the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962) and [[the Holocaust]]. He read [[Marc Bloch|Marc Bloch's]] ''Strange Defeat'', a book attempting to explain the causes of the defeat during the 1940 [[Battle of France]], which is one of the origins of his vocation as a historian. He discovered [[surrealism]] ([[André Breton]], [[René Char]] and also [[Antonin Artaud]]), and founded a review at 18 years old, along with [[Pierre Nora]], ''Imprudence''. The 1949 [[László Rajk|Rajk trial]] definitively took out his will to adhere to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).

Pierre Vidal-Naquet first taught history at [[Orléans|Orléans's]] high school (1955), before going to [[Caen|Caen's]] university (1956–60) and then [[Lille]] (1961–62). Reading [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], he would become a member of the "Paris School", originally composed of [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], [[Nicole Loraux]], [[Marcel Detienne]] and himself. Their work would renew approaches to the study of Ancient Greece.

He then worked at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (1962–64) and was named ''maître de conférences'' at the [[University of Lyon]] (1964–66). He was then named professor at the ''[[École pratique des hautes études]]'', which became the EHESS.

Vidal-Naquet co-authored several books with Jean-Pierre Vernant, with whom he was friends. However, although Vernant was a "comrade" of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), Vidal-Naquet never belonged to any political party, with the exception of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU), which he considered a "mere discussion circle."&lt;ref name="Le Dernier des dreyfusards"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060730.WWW000000033_le_dernier_des_dreyfusards.html “Le Dernier des dreyfusards”], article on Vidal-Naquet in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', September 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Vidal-Naquet was married and the father of three children. He was also officer of the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' and, in Greece, commander of the Phenix Order.

Pierre Vidal-Naquet was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1950 Vidal-Naquet declared to his future wife Genevive Railhac that "as an atheist, history is for me the only possible substitute for religion"." Oswyn Murray, Obituary: Pierre Vidal-Naquet, The Independent (London), August 4, 2006, Pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Pierre Vidal-Naquet defined himself as an "activist historian", and while pursuing his studies never ceased engaging in political struggles and taking part in political committees, etc. A member of the Comité Audin, along with Jérôme Lindon (editor of the [[Editions de Minuit|Minuit publishing house]]), he was one of the best known opponents of the use of torture by the French Army during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62). Along with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and 119 others, he signed the ''[[Manifesto of the 121]]'', a call for [[civil disobedience]] against the Algerian war. As an [[anti-colonialist]], Vidal-Naquet was opposed to [[Guy Mollet]]'s [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) reformist party because of Mollet's support of the [[First Indochina War]] and Algerian War.

He was also opposed to the [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967–74) in Greece. He supported peace efforts in the Middle East as well as the [[Europalestine]] group. He thus declared: "I consider [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] a criminal."&lt;ref name="Le Dernier des dreyfusards"/&gt;

With [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Marie Domenach]], on 8 February 1971 he signed the manifesto of the ''Groupe d'informations sur les prisons'', which, rather than speaking in the name of prisoners, aimed to give back to them the chance of speaking in their own voice.

Vidal-Naquet was also active in condemning denial of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395201 | title = Hilsenraths Other Genocide | author = [[Dagmar C. G. Lorenz]] | journal = [[Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual]] | year = 1990 | issue = 7 | page = footnote 20 | issn = 0741-8450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vidal-Naquet, who had answered or criticized Holocaust negationist [[Robert Faurisson]] in several of his works, once employed Faurisson as an example to illustrate "what the Armenian minorities might feel":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us imagine a negationist Robert Faurisson as a governmental minister, a Faurisson president of the Republic, a Faurisson general, a Faurisson ambassador, a Faurisson president of the Turkish Historical Commission and a member of the senate of the University of Istanbul, a Faurisson member of the United Nations, a Faurisson responding in the press each time the question of the Jews is raised. In brief, a state-sponsored Faurisson paired with an international Faurisson and, along with all that, a [[Mehmed Talat|Talaat]]-[[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] blessed, since 1943, with an official mausoleum in the country's capital.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal-Naquet, Pierre. ''The Jews: History, Memory, and the Present''. 1996, page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vidal-Naquet was one of the first scholars to deconstruct [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]], notably in ''The Assassins of Memory'' and ''Reflexions on Genocide''. He was also opposed to the 23 February 2005 [[French law on colonialism]] passed by the conservative [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), but which was finally repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] in the beginning of 2006. Vidal-Naquet also criticized the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] which prohibits revisionist discourse, claiming that the law shouldn't interfere in historical matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=632 Interview with Vidal-Naquet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515232532/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=632 |date=2006-05-15 }} on the [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH) website {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vidal-Naquet's arguments against legislation relating to historical studies is not, however, a door opened to revisionist speech. He once declared that he would rather name revisionists "negationists", and that he wouldn't engage with them for "simple and scientific reasons. An astronomer doesn't debate with an astrologer. I wouldn't discuss with someone who supports the idea that the moon is made of [[Roquefort]] ... it is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1990-06-07/1990-06-07-799024 “Au service du racisme”], in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 7 June 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While his analyses e.g. of [[Greek tragedy]] and the institution of the [[Athenian]] [[ephebia]] has been favourably received by many French intellectuals, they have been violently challenged elsewhere, particularly by [[Italy|Italian]] philologists who, like Vidal-Naquet himself, were favourably inclined towards a [[Marxist]] analysis. His structuralist approach has been called [[ahistorical]], his analyses of the texts as lacking in thoroughness and even manipulative, using categories like [[polysemy]] and [[ambiguity]] which his critics found do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincenzo Di Benedetto]], ''Il [[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Filottete]] e l'efebia secondo Vidal-Naquet'', in: ''Belfagor'' 33 (1978), p. 191-207; see also Vincenzo Di Benedetto, ''L'ambiguo nella tragedia greca: una categoria fuorviante'', in: ''[[Euripides|Euripide]] "[[Medea]]", introd. di V. Di Benedetto, trad. di [[Ester Cerbo|E. Cerbo]]'', Milan, 1997, p. 62-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regia Anglorum''' (A term used by early writers in Latin texts, meaning '''''Kingdoms of the English [people]'''''), or simply '''Regia''', is a [[Medieval reenactment]] organisation reenacting the life and times of the peoples who lived in and around the Islands of [[British Islands|Britain]] from the time of [[Alfred the Great]] to [[Richard the Lionheart]]. Its members portray Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman and British living history from the period before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/12/furthereducation The Historical Reenactor], The Guardian, February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The society has gained in popularity as a result of being featured in prominent television programmes such as ''[[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] on Beowulf'', ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[A History of Britain (TV series)|A History of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/television/2009/06/simon-schama-donne-historian New Statesman June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1986 by members formerly of [[The Vikings (reenactment)|The Norse Film and Pageant Society]] (which went on to become called ''the Vikings'') and has a large British membership. An [[unincorporated association]], it claims to be one of the largest [[Early Middle Ages]] re-enactment societies in the world. The organisation comprises a number of local groups, mostly within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://regia.org/members/grants.php Land Grants], Regia Anglorum, January, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Regia Anglorum is an Associate Sponsor of the British Museum, and is a founder member of the [[National Association of Re-enactment Societies|National Association of Re-enactment Societies (NAReS)]] and The Battlefields Trust.

==Reconstruction &amp; experimental archaeology==

===The Wychurst Project===
The most high-profile of Regia Anglorum's activities is the Wychurst Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110304012445/http://www.wychurst.com/ Wychurst Project, Archived, dated 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  On {{convert|3|acre|m2}} of [[Freehold (English law)|freeheld]] land in [[Kent]], the group built a full-scale replica of a defended manorial [[burgh]] and the flooded ring ditch and bank surmounted by 220 metres of palisade enclosing an acre of land. The centre of the burgh sits a Longhall, which at 60' × 30' × 30'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/10/british-architecture-regia-anglorum "Life in a Saxon hall"] ''The Guardian'' 10 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  (approx 20 × 10 × 10 metres) is by far the largest building of its kind in Britain. 

The site is used for educational purposes and is open for public visits on special occasions. Regia Anglorum say that the primary purpose of the settlement is to enable the group's members to experience the lifestyle of the period in a more complete way than ever before. The site's name, '''''Wychurst''''', is an Anglo-Saxon name meaning ''the village in the wood'', is situated in woods near to the [[Wildwood Discovery Park]] {{convert|60|mi|km}} from Central [[London]] near [[Canterbury]] in [[Kent]].

===Living history===
[[File:Regia Anglorum members, S.Elgin 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Living History portrayed by Regia Anglorum members in Illinois, USA]]
[[Living history]] encampments are a major feature of most re-enactment societies. A range of tented structures is erected at many Regia Anglorum events, and members demonstrate a variety of crafts and everyday activities in their historical context.

===Ships and sailing===
Regia Anglorum currently owns seven vessels. The biggest is a 50'-long vessel no longer sea-worthy. Next are three similar hulls measuring 47' by 9' in the beam. Drawing about 3', they are suitable for use on inland waters and at sea in coastal waters. A 35' wooden replica is currently in use and sees constant use by the members for events and filmwork. They also own and operate two 20' smallcraft, one a generic shape for European waters, the other a replica of the [[Gokstad ship#Grave goods|Gokstad Faering]] and that too is in constant use at events throughout the UK in the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://regia.org/fleet/fleet.php The Regia Fleet] Regia Anglorum, 18 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's vessels are often used at events and in films on both the big and small screen, including ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingships.co.uk Viking Ship Hire] Viking Ship Hire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
[[File:2016 Battle of Hastings Reenactment.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Regia Anglorum reenact the Battle of Hastings]]
Like most large reenactment groups, Regia Anglorum's activities include participation in local and national reenactment and reconstruction events such as the [[Battle of Hastings]]. A National Training Scheme exists to ensure authenticity and safety at these events.

Members of the society frequently  appear as extras in film and television, and members have appeared in hundreds of separate works to date, from serious documentaries such as National Geographic's series about the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], Michael Wood's "Beowulf", ''[[Blood of the Vikings]]'', ''[[1066: The Battle for Middle Earth]]'' and ''[[A History of Britain (TV series)|A History of Britain]]'' six separate appearances on ''[[Time Team]]'', the children's programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'' on four occasions to adverts and music videos.

Regia Anglorum also has a team of horse riders, called '''The Radfolc'''.

==Infrastructure==
The society funds its activities primarily through membership and events fees.  It also provides facilities for school visits at many of its events.  There are also teams and individuals who provide a school visitor service. Principally, their work mostly takes place in a Primary context under [[Key Stage 2|Key Stage 2 - "Invaders"]] but can also expand on the Battle of Hastings theme at the beginning of [[Key Stage 3]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">'''Sayf ibn Umar al-Usayyidi al-Tamimi''' ({{lang-ar|سيف بن عمر}}) was an early Islamic historian and compiler of reports who lived in [[Kufa]]. He wrote ''Kitāb al-futūh al-kabīr wa 'l-ridda'', which is [[al-Tabari]]'s main source for the [[Ridda wars]] and [[early Muslim conquests]]. It also contains important information about the structure of early Muslim armies and government. According to [[al-Dhahabi]], Sayf died during the reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]] (786-809).&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 9| pages = 102-103| last = Donner | first = Fred | title = Sayf B. ʿUmar | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| isbn = 90-04-10422-4| date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Little is known about Sayf, except that he lived in Kufa and belonged to the tribe of [[Banu Tamim]].&lt;ref name=EI2 /&gt;

== Reliability of his narrations ==


The reliability of his [[hadith]]s has long been contested.&lt;ref name=EI2 /&gt;

His narrations are said to be influenced by the tribal traditions of Banu Tamim.&lt;ref name=EI2 /&gt; However, he also collected accounts that highlight other tribes.&lt;ref name=EI2 /&gt;

=== Modern Shia views ===

[[Shia]] researcher Arzina Lalani suggests that Sayf is the first person who mentions [[Abdullah ibn Saba]] in his writings. His claim that a Yemeni Jew was allegedly a founder of Shia Islam, was picked on by [[al-Tabari]]. She states that his account of early Islamic history was heavily influenced by later [[Sunni]] historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0105.xml#obo-9780195390155-0105-bibItem-0001|title=Ghadir Khumm - Islamic Studies - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802170654/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0105.xml#obo-9780195390155-0105-bibItem-0001|archivedate=2017-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book called Abdullah bin Saba (عبدالله بن سبا) authored by Shia researcher Murtaza Askari the 12 the most popular Rijali (someone who knows about [[Ilm al-Rijal|Ilm al-Rijāl]]) scholars, believed Sayf was not a reliable transmitter of Hadith. They are as follows: [[Yahya bin Moein]], [[Al-Nasa'i]], [[Abu Dawood]], Ibn Sakan, [[Abu Hatim Muhammad ibn Idris al-Razi]] [[Ibn Hibban]], [[Al-Daraqutni]], [[Al-Hakim Nishapuri]], Firoozabadi,{{who2|date=August 2017}} [[Ibn Hajar al-%27Asqalani]], [[Al-Suyuti]], and Safi Al din.{{who2|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah bin Saba(عبدالله بن سبا), by Murtaza Askari{{quote needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been recorded in Tahdib al-Kamal, that Yahya bin Moein held this view.&lt;ref&gt;Tahdib al-Kamal, Volume 25 page 101{{verification needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The U.S. Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation.]]

The '''Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program'''&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt; is a report compiled by the bipartisan [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) about the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)'s Detention and Interrogation Program and its use of various forms of [[torture]] ("[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" in U.S. government communiqués) on detainees between 2001 and 2006 during the "[[War on Terror]]". The final report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with seven [[Democrat (United States)|Democrats]], one Independent, and one Republican voting in favor of publication and six Republicans voting in opposition.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-timeline-of-cia-interrogation-program-20141209-story.html#page=1 | title = The history of the CIA detention and interrogation program | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = December 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition Response"&gt;{{cite web

The 6,000-page report details actions by CIA officials and findings of the study of the Detention and Interrogation Program. On December 9, 2014—eight months after voting to release parts of the report—the SSCI released a 525-page portion that consisted of key findings and an executive summary of the full report. It took five years and $40 million to compile the report.&lt;ref name=GuardDec0914&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released | title = CIA's brutal and ineffective use of torture revealed in landmark report | author = [[Spencer Ackerman]] | date = December 9, 2014 | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = December 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rest of it remains [[Classified information|classified]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/03/298779799/senate-torture-report-takes-a-step-closer-to-becoming-public|title=Congress Clashes Over Release of CIA Torture Report|author=Lauren Hodges|date=December 8, 2014|publisher=NPR News|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardDec0814&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/top-senator-rejects-cia-torture-report-redactions-ahead-of-release|title=Top senator rejects CIA torture report redactions ahead of public release | author = [[Spencer Ackerman]] | date = August 5, 2014 | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Here's What Dianne Feinstein Said About the Torture Report | url = http://time.com/3625560/torture-report-heres-what-dianne-feinstein-said/ | publisher = [[Time Magazine]] | accessdate = December 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report details actions by CIA officials, including torturing prisoners, providing misleading or false information about classified CIA programs to the media, impeding government oversight and internal criticism, and mismanaging the program. It also revealed the existence of previously unknown detainees, that more detainees were subjected to harsher treatment than was previously disclosed, and that more forms of torture were used than previously disclosed. It concluded that torturing prisoners did not help acquire actionable intelligence or gain cooperation from detainees and that the program damaged the United States' international standing.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;

Some people, including CIA officials and U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], disputed the report's interpretations and said it provided an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the program. Others criticized the publishing of the report, citing its potential for damage to the U.S. and the contentious history of its development. Others, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and former Republican presidential nominee, [[John McCain]], praised the release of the report with the President stating "one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mufson |first=Steven |date=2014-12-09 |title=Obama, on new interrogations report: 'Some of the actions taken were contrary to our values' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/12/09/obama-on-new-interrogations-report-some-of-the-actions-taken-were-contrary-to-our-values/ |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=2015-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the report, a large number of individuals and organizations have called for the prosecution of the CIA officials who perpetrated, approved, or provided legal cover for the torture of detainees.&lt;ref name="HRW Roadmap"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/283564 |title=No More Excuses: A Roadmap to Justice for CIA Torture |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=hrw.org |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |access-date=2015-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Torture Fight Set Back by U.S. Failure to Prosecute, U.N.

== History ==

=== Impetus for the report ===
{{See also|2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction}}
[[File:Dianne Feinstein, official Senate photo 2.jpg|upright|thumb|Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) was the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 2009 to early 2015]]

California Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] said that the report was conducted after CIA [[Director of the National Clandestine Service]], [[Jose Rodriguez (intelligence officer)|Jose Rodriguez]], was found to have destroyed almost 100 video recordings of interrogations in 2005. The [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) believed that he was covering up illegal activities by the CIA, although the committee had initially been told by CIA officials that Rodriguez was not engaging in "destruction of evidence".&lt;ref name="GuardDec0814"/&gt; Rodriguez preemptively criticized the report in an [[op-ed]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on December 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=WaPoDec5&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/todays-cia-critics-once-urged-the-agency-to-do-anything-to-fight-al-qaeda/2014/12/05/ac418da2-7bda-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc_story.html|title=Today's CIA critics once urged the agency to do anything to fight al-Qaeda|author=Jose Rodriguez|authorlink=Jose Rodriguez (intelligence officer)|date=December 5, 2014|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the report ===

On March 5, 2009, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 14-1 to open an investigation into the CIA detention and interrogation program.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;  In August 2009, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] announced a parallel preliminary criminal investigation into the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques by CIA officials.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;  As a result of the Attorney General's investigation, the [[Republican (United States)|Republican]] minority on the SSCI concluded that many witnesses were unlikely to participate in the investigation for fear of criminal liability.&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;  Citing the Attorney General investigation as their reason, the Republican minority of the SSCI withdrew their participation from the investigation in September 2009.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;

The report was led by [[Daniel J. Jones]], and was prepared following a review of 6 million pages of documents, cables, emails, and other materials principally provided by the CIA.&lt;ref name="TheReportItself" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/senate-cia-torture_n_6285232.html|first=Ali |last=Watkins|title=Senate Report On CIA Torture Fails To Answer One Question: What Now?|publisher=Huffington Post|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNCost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-torture-report-cost-40-million/story?id=27505145|title=CIA Also Blamed for $40 Million Cost of Torture Report|author=JEFF ZELENY|publisher=ABC News|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional 9400 classified documents repeatedly requested by the SSCI were withheld by the [[White House]] under a claim of [[executive privilege]].&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost /&gt;  Despite the initial expectation that interviews would be used, no formal interviews or hearings were conducted in the preparation of the report.&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SusanCollinsStatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collins.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=af9451d7-9eab-41fa-a63f-71886cd65c52|author=Susan Collins|authorlink=Susan Collins|title=Sen.

The final report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with seven [[Democrat (United States)|Democrats]], one Independent ([[Angus King]]), and one Republican ([[Susan Collins]]) voting in favor of publication and six Republicans voting in opposition, and the published minority views of Senator [[Saxby Chambliss|Chambliss]] were joined by Senators [[Richard Burr|Burr]], [[Jim Risch|Risch]], [[Dan Coats|Coats]], [[Marco Rubio|Rubio]], and [[Tom Coburn|Coburn]].&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;  On April 3, 2014, the SSCI voted 11–3 to submit a revised version of the executive summary, findings, and recommendations of the report for declassification analysis in preparation for future public release.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;  After eight months, involving contentious negotiations about what details should remain classified,&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardDec0814 /&gt; the revised executive summary, findings, and recommendations were made public with some [[Sanitization (classified information)|redactions]] on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref name="LA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;

Information about the cooperation of foreign agencies with the CIA has been redacted from the report. The British chairman of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] stated they would request access to anything taken out of the report at the request of British agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30467471 |title=CIA report: MPs seek material on any UK 'torture' role |publisher=BBC |date=December 14, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sir-malcolm-rifkind-demands-details-of-uks-involvement-in-cia-interrogation-9923493.html |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind demands details of UK's involvement in CIA interrogation |author=Ben Tufft |newspaper=The Independent |date=December 14, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently with the public release, the six members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that voted against the report released their own 167-page report criticizing both the process and the conclusions of the report approved by the majority.&lt;ref name="Opposition Response" /&gt;

==== Panetta Review and CIA Hacking incident ====
{{see also|Panetta Review}}

On December 17, 2013, Sen. [[Mark Udall]] (D-CO) revealed the existence of a secret internal review conducted by the CIA that was consistent with the Senate's report but conflicted with the CIA's official response to the report.&lt;ref name=nytimes03072014&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/politics/behind-clash-between-cia-and-congress-a-secret-report-on-interrogations.html|title=Behind Clash Between C.I.A. and Congress, a Secret Report on Interrogations|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 7, 2014|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, CIA officials claimed that the Intelligence Committee had accessed review documents and removed them from CIA facilities in 2010 without CIA authorization.&lt;ref name=mcclatchy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/05/3976423/senate-staffers-slipped-secret.html|title=Senate staffers slipped secret CIA documents from agency's headquarters |date=March 5, 2014|newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]|publisher=[[McClatchy]] |first1=Sean |last1=Cockerham |first2=David |last2=Lightman |first3=James |last3=Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Sen.

# The CIA's use of its [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] was not an effective means of acquiring [[intelligence assessment|intelligence]] or gaining cooperation from detainees.
# The CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques rested on inaccurate claims of their effectiveness.
# The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others.
# The conditions of confinement for CIA detainees were harsher than the CIA had represented to policymakers and others.
# The CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), impeding a proper legal analysis of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
# The CIA has actively avoided or impeded congressional oversight of the program.
# The CIA impeded effective White House oversight and decision-making.
# The CIA's operation and management of the program complicated, and in some cases impeded, the national security missions of other [[United States Executive Branch|Executive Branch]] agencies.
# The CIA impeded oversight by the CIA's [[Office of Inspector General]].
# The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
# The CIA was unprepared as it began operating its Detention and Interrogation Program more than six months after being granted detention authorities.
# The CIA's management and operation of its Detention and Interrogation Program was deeply flawed throughout the program's duration, particularly so in 2002 and early 2003.
# Two contract psychologists devised the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and played a central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. By 2005, the CIA had overwhelmingly outsourced operations related to the program.
# CIA detainees were subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that had not been approved by the Department of Justice or had not been authorized by CIA Headquarters.
# The CIA did not conduct a comprehensive or accurate accounting of the number of individuals it detained, and held individuals who did not meet the legal standard for detention. The CIA's claims about the number of detainees held and subjected to its enhanced interrogation techniques were inaccurate.
# The CIA failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation techniques.
# The CIA rarely reprimanded or held personnel accountable for serious or significant violations, inappropriate activities, and systematic and individual management failures.
# The CIA marginalized and ignored numerous internal critiques, criticisms, and objections concerning the operation and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
# The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was inherently unsustainable and had effectively ended by 2006 due to unauthorized press disclosures, reduced cooperation from other nations, and legal and oversight concerns.
# The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States' standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs.

* A report by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] found that "they [had] never been in a facility where individuals were so [[sensory deprivation|sensory deprived]] i.e., constant [[white noise]], no talking, everyone in the dark, with the guards wearing a light on their head when they collected and escorted a detainee to an interrogation cell, detainees constantly being shackled to the wall or floor, and the starkness of each cell (concrete and bars).

==== Misleading information provided by the CIA ====
* The CIA's directors ([[George Tenet]], [[Porter Goss]] and [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]]) lied to members of the [[U.S. Congress]], the [[White House]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence]] about the program's effectiveness and the number of prisoners that the CIA held.&lt;ref name="New York Times1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazzetti|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Mazzetti|date=December 9, 2014|title=Senate Torture Report Condemns C.I.A.

* The CIA deliberately planted false stories with members of the media and claimed that the stories had been leaked.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="New York Times1" /&gt;
* The CIA had used [[waterboarding]] at locations where previously it claimed it had not (e.g. at the [[Salt Pit]]).&lt;ref name="New York Times1" /&gt;
* The CIA lied in official documents to government officials about the value of information extracted from prisoners subjected to torture (e.g. stating that information extracted from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed during torture had allowed for the capture of [[Riduan Isamuddin]]).&lt;ref name="Vox1" /&gt;
* Despite contrary statements made by the CIA's Director, Michael V. Hayden, the CIA did employ individuals who "had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault."&lt;ref name="Vox1" /&gt;
* The CIA provided false information to the Department of Justice's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] about the methods of interrogation it was using against prisoners.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Arit|date=December 9, 2014|title=The 10 Most Important Excerpts From the CIA Torture Report|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-09/the-most-important-excerpts-from-the-cia-torture-report|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CIA Deputy Director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], [[Philip Mudd]], deliberately lied to Congress about the program and stated that "We either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has implications beyond the media. [C]ongress reads it, cuts our authorities, mess up our budget."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg1" /&gt;
*The report found that the CIA held at least 119 detainees during the course of the interrogation program, more than the 98 previously reported to Congress.&lt;ref name="TheReportItself" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times2" /&gt;
*An email cited in the report and prepared by a subordinate indicates that CIA Director Michael Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 detainees would be reported.&lt;ref name="TheReportItself" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times2" /&gt;

==== Innocent people imprisoned by the CIA ====
At least 26 of the 119 prisoners (22%) held by the CIA were subsequently found by the CIA to have been improperly detained,&lt;ref name="TheReportItself" /&gt; many having also experienced torture.&lt;ref name="Vox1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashkenas|first=Jeremy|date=December 9, 2014|title=7 Key Points From the C.I.A.

==== Other ====
* The report noted a November 2001 memorandum circulated within the CIA by its attorneys titled "Hostile Interrogations: Legal Considerations for C.I.A. Officers". In it, the lawyers argued that prosecution for torture could be avoided if said torture "resulted in saving thousands of lives."&lt;ref name="NYT.Fault" /&gt;
* Some CIA personnel found the torture revolting and asked to be transferred from facilities where torture was being conducted. Some also questioned whether such activities could continue and were told that the senior officials in the CIA had approved these techniques.&lt;ref name="Vox1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times1" /&gt;
* The report suggests torture was the source of a false confession by [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]] linking [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]] that was cited in [[Colin Powell]]'s address to the UN in advance of the 2003 [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;{{rp|141}}&lt;ref name="IraqJustification"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volz |first=Dustin |date=December 9, 2014 |title=Torture Report Suggests Interrogation Supplied False Intelligence Used to Justify 2003 Invasion of Iraq |url=https://www.nationaljournal.com/defense/cia-torture-report-suggests-interrogation-supplied-false-intelligence-used-to-justify-2003-invasion-of-iraq-20141209 |journal=[[National Journal]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media Company]] |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The CIA kept incomplete records of their detainees, so it is unclear if 119 is a complete count.&lt;ref name="New York Times2" /&gt;

=== Contractors ===
Contractors that developed the "enhanced interrogation techniques" ([[Bruce Jessen|John "Bruce" Jessen]] and [[James Elmer Mitchell|James Mitchell]]), received {{USD}}81 million for their services, out of an original contract worth more than {{USD}}180 million. [[NBC News]] identified the contractors, who were referred to in the report via pseudonyms, as [[Mitchell, Jessen &amp; Associates]]. Jessen was  a senior psychologist at the Defense Department who taught [[special forces]] how to resist and endure torture ([[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]]).&lt;ref name=businessinsider&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brodwin|first1=Erin|last2=Friedman|first2=Lauren|title=Chilling Details About The Doctors Who Enabled The Cia Torture Program|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/doctors-scientists-in-cia-torture-report-2014-12|accessdate=December 12, 2014|publisher=Business Insider|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that neither man had prior knowledge of Al Qaeda, nor were they practised interrogators,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21636035-tawdry-record-facing-up-past-best-protection-future-shock-therapy CIA torture: Shock therapy], economist.com.&lt;/ref&gt; but they nevertheless "developed the list of enhanced interrogation techniques and personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using those techniques. The contractors also evaluated whether the detainees' psychological state allowed for continued use of the techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were interrogating or had interrogated."

The contractors developed a list of 20 forms of torture for use against detainees, which was cut down to 10 since some forms were considered too harsh. The list included waterboarding, sleep deprivation and stress positions.

According to the report, the Detention and Interrogation Program cost well over $300 million in non-personnel costs.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;{{rp|16}} This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain detention facilities, including two facilities costing millions of dollars that were never used, in part due to host country political concerns. "To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials."&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The report states that in 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; "the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year [[indemnification]] agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement."&lt;ref name=TheReportItself /&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Response from current officials===
President [[Barack Obama]] said the report had revealed a "troubling program" and that "We will rely on all elements of our national power, including the power and example of our founding ideals. That is why I have consistently supported the declassification of today's report. No nation is perfect. But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better."&lt;ref name="Fox News1" /&gt; The Obama administration consistently worked through [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Denis McDonough]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkJun2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|authorlink1=ConnieBruck|title=The Inside War: To expose torture, Dianne Feinstein fought the C.I.A.—and the White House.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war|accessdate=July 18, 2015|work=New Yorker|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) announced that they would not be pursuing bringing any charges against anyone who might have been involved in the use of torture, noting that they "did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination."&lt;ref name="DOJ Probe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/226603-justice-department-wont-reopen-torture-probes |title=DOJ won't reopen torture probe after CIA report |last1=Hattern |first1=Julian |date=December 10, 2014 |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Justice had launched two investigations overseen by [[John Durham (lawyer)|John Durham]] in 2009 that also did not result in charges.&lt;ref name="NPRLive"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/09/justice-cia-torture/20138065/ |title=Report Says CIA Misled Congress, White House On Interrogation Program  |last1=Peralta |first1=Eyder |date=December 9, 2014 |website=[[NPR]] |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the absence of charges has not been disclosed, but Mr. Durham did say that the full record of the possible evidence of criminal conduct and possible defenses that might be offered by any of those accused were contained in the pages of the Senate committee report that he was not going to release. Thus, it remains impossible for anyone to offer an independent evaluation of whether anyone involved was or was not guilty of criminal conduct. In response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] lawsuit seeking access to the full report, the Obama administration argued that the rationale for not releasing all the pages of the committee report was that "disclosing them could affect the candor of law enforcement deliberations about whether to bring criminal charges."&lt;ref name="DOJ FOIA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Savage |first=Charlie |authorlink=Charlie Savage |date=December 10, 2014 |title=U.S. Tells Court That Documents From Torture Investigation Should Remain Secret |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/us/politics/us-tells-court-that-documents-from-torture-investigation-should-remain-secret.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the apparent absence of those public deliberations, such a rationale seems almost incredibly obtuse, especially since, after the release of the Senate's report, several news outlets noted that "the only CIA employee connected to its interrogation program to go to prison" was [[John Kiriakou]], the whistle-blower who was "prosecuted for providing information to reporters."&lt;ref name="ABC Kiriakou"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Ross (journalist) |date=December 9, 2014 |title=Ex-CIA Operative Says Prison Was Punishment for Whistleblowing on Torture |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cia-operative-prison-punishment-whistleblowing-torture/story?id=27474359 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |location= |accessdate=December 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo Kiriakou"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levine |first=Sam |date=December 10, 2014 |title=The One Man Jailed For CIA Torture Tried To Expose It |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/cia-torture-prosecution_n_6298646.html |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Teju |authorlink=Teju Cole |date=January 9, 2015 |title=Unmournable bodies |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/unmournable-bodies |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |accessdate=January 12, 2015 |quote="The only person in prison for the C.I.A.'s abominable torture regime is John Kiriakou, the whistle-blower."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from former officials===
Three former CIA directors&amp;mdash;[[George Tenet]], [[Porter Goss]] and [[Michael V. Hayden]]&amp;mdash;as well as three former CIA deputy directors, wrote an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in response to the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee report. They criticized the report as "a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America after the 9/11 attacks." They said that the CIA's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al Qaeda operatives and the disruption of al Qaeda's efforts and also stated that, contrary to the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings, "there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody […] was essential to bringing bin Laden to justice." Additionally, they wrote that the CIA remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the DOJ; that the CIA did not mislead the DOJ, White House or Congress; and that the threat of a "'ticking time bomb' scenario" context was critical to understanding the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=George J.

[[John Yoo]], author of the [[Torture Memos]], criticized the report as a partisan attack on American intelligence agencies and defended his belief that the CIA was legally allowed to use interrogation techniques that did not cause injury.

Zeid called for accountability saying, "In all countries, if someone commits murder, they are prosecuted and jailed. If they commit [[rape]] or [[armed robbery]], they are prosecuted and jailed. If they order, enable or commit torture—recognized as a serious international crime—they cannot simply be granted immunity because of political expediency.

He was employed at various archival and historicist positions, especially in German-speaking countries. Until 1986 he performed a number of significant scientific and archival functions such as a researcher of the Institute for the History of Arabic-Islamic Science at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], a member of the Association of Austrian writers, and a corresponding member of the Jordanian Islamic Academy science. He died in Vienna in 2002.

==Biography==
Balić was born 26 August 1920 (although a few sources give 20 August 1920) in [[Mostar]], Bosnia and Herzegovina to a Muslim [[Bosniak]] family. In 1995, Balić received the [[Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf|title=Reply to a parliamentary question|language=German|page=977|trans-title=|format=pdf|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13163">"'''Thirty Days Hath September...'''" or "'''Thirty Days Has September...'''"&lt;ref name=dick/&gt; is a traditional verse [[mnemonic]] used to remember the number of [[day]]s in the [[month]]s of the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. It arose as an [[oral tradition]] and exists in many variants. It is currently earliest attested in English, but was and remains common throughout Europe as well.

==History==
{{hatnote|Further information: [[Roman calendar]] and its [[Julian reform|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reforms]]}}
The irregularity of the lengths of the months descends from the [[Roman calendar]], which came to be adopted throughout Europe and then worldwide. The months of Rome's original [[lunar calendar]] would have varied between 29 and 30 days, depending on observations of the [[phases of the moon]].&lt;ref name=mom14&gt;{{harvp|Mommsen|1894|loc=Vol. I, Ch. xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms credited to [[Romulus]] and [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] established a set year of twelve fixed months. Possibly under the influence of the [[Pythagoreans]] in southern Italy, Rome considered odd numbers more lucky and set the lengths of the new months to 29 and 31 days, apart from the last month [[Februarius|February]] and the [[intercalary month]] [[Mercedonius]].&lt;ref name=mom14/&gt; Its imperfect system and political manipulation of intercalation caused it to slip greatly out of alignment with the solar year,&lt;ref name=mom11&gt;{{harvp|Mommsen|1894|loc=Vol. V, Ch. xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was known to consist of ¼ of 1461 days (rather than 1460 days) by the time of [[Meton of Athens|Meton]] in the 5th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Rather than adopt a new system like the [[Egyptian calendar]], which had 12 months of 30 days each and a set, annual intercalary month of 5 days, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] aimed for [[Julian reform|his 46{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} reform]] to maintain as much continuity as possible with the old calendar.{{sfnp|Rüpke|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pThna2LDwDsC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}} Ultimately, Mercedonius was removed, the four existing 31-day months were maintained, February was left unchanged apart from leap years, and the needful additional ten days of the year were added to the 29-day months to make them either 30 or 31 days long.{{sfnp|Rüpke|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pThna2LDwDsC&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}

By the [[Renaissance]], the irregularity of the resulting system had inspired [[Latin poetry|Latin verses]] to remember the order of long and short months. The first known published form&lt;ref name=lucy&gt;{{citation |last=Ballew |first=Pat |contribution=On This Day in Math |contribution-url=http://pballew.blogspot.com/2015/09/on-this-day-in-math-september-1.html |url=http://pballew.blogspot.com/ |title=Pat's Blog |date=1 September 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in a 1488 edition of the Latin verses of [[Anianus (astronomer)|Anianus]]:&lt;ref name=annie&gt;{{citation |author=Anianus |title=Computus Metricus Manualis |location=Strasbourg }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Welsh author Roger Bryan discovered an older English form of the poem&lt;ref name=wales&gt;{{citation |last=Misstear |first=Rachael |contribution=Welsh Author Digs Deep to Find Medieval Origins of Thirty Days Hath Verse |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206080222/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2012/01/16/welsh-author-digs-deep-to-find-medieval-origins-of-thirty-days-hath-verse-91466-30128447 |date=16 January 2012 |title=Wales Online |location= |publisher=Media Wales }}.&lt;/ref&gt; written at the bottom of a page of [[saints' days]] for February within a Latin manuscript in the [[British Library]]'s [[Harleian manuscripts]].

The first published English version&lt;ref name=lucy/&gt;{{sfnp|Cryer|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QFJHqts9xXgC&amp;pg=PA271 "Thirty Days Has September"]}} appeared in [[Richard Grafton]]'s ''Abridgment of the Chronicles of England'' in 1562&lt;ref name=sue&gt;{{harvp|Grafton|1562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as "A Rule to Know How Many Dayes Euery Moneth in the Yere Hath":&lt;ref name=holly&gt;{{harvp|Holland|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7uOdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 64–5]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"September" and "November" have identical rhythm and rhyme and are thus poetically interchangeable.&lt;ref name=dick/&gt; The early versions tended to favour November and as late as 1891 it was being given as the more common form of the rhyme in some parts of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ganvoort |first=A.J. |contribution=Value of Music in Public Education |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA389 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA392 392] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA339 |title=The Ohio Educational Monthly and the National Teacher, ''Vol. XL, No. 8'' |date=August 1891 |editor=Samuel Findley |display-editors=0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is less common now and September variants have a long history as well. A manuscript copy of the verse from {{c.|1555}}&lt;ref&gt;Stevins MS.&lt;/ref&gt; runs:

{|
|-
| &lt;blockquote&gt;Thirty days hath September,&lt;br&gt;April, June, and November;&lt;br&gt;All the rest have thirty-one,&lt;br&gt;Excepting February alone,&lt;br&gt;And that has twenty-eight days clear&lt;br&gt;And twenty-nine in each leap year.{{sfnp|''OCDQ''|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zLDEH2TAvwUC&amp;pg=PT45 45]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|}

Another English version from before 1574 is found in a manuscript among the Mostyn Papers held at the [[National Library of Wales]] in [[Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref name=tto/&gt;&lt;ref name=wales/&gt;

Variants appear throughout Europe. The typical Italian form is&lt;ref name=i4d/&gt;

|-

==Legacy==
The various forms of the poem are usually considered a [[doggerel]] [[nursery rhyme]].&lt;ref name=holly/&gt; In the {{c.|1601}} [[academic drama]] ''[[The Return from Parnassus|Return from Parnassus]]'', Sir Raderic's overenthusiastic appreciation of its poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Anon.|1606|loc=[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t5fb5mg9m;view=1up;seq=75 Act III, sc. i]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is of a piece with his own low level of culture and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smeaton|1905|p=xxvi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has, however, also earned praise. It's been called "one of the most popular and oft-repeated verses in the English language"&lt;ref name=tto/&gt; and "probably the only sixteenth-century poem most ordinary citizens know by heart".&lt;ref name=holly/&gt; [[Groucho Marx]] claimed "My favorite poem is the one that starts 'Thirty Days Hath September...', because it actually means something."&lt;ref name=tto/&gt; On the other hand, the unhelpfulness of such an involved [[mnemonic]] has been mocked, as in the early 20th-century parody "Thirty days hath September{{nbsp}}/ But all the rest I can't remember"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=20 September 1924 |location=Cincinnati |p=6 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be taught in schools as children learn the calendar,&lt;ref name=dick&gt;{{citation |contribution=How Old is 'Thirty Days Has September...' |contribution-url=http://blog.dictionary.com/monthrhyme/ |title=Blog |url=http://blog.dictionary.com/ |publisher=Dictionary.com |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; although others employ the [[knuckle mnemonic]] instead.

"Thirty Days Hath September..." is also occasionally parodied or referenced in wider culture, such as the 1960 [[Burma-Shave]] [[jingle]] "Thirty days{{nbsp}}/ Hath September{{nbsp}}/ April{{nbsp}}/ June and the{{nbsp}}/ [[speeding|Speed offender]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Thirty Days |contribution-url=http://burma-shave.org/jingles/1960/thirty_days |title=Jingles |publisher=Burma-Shave.org |url=http://burma-shave.org/jingles/ |date=2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wolfgang Leopold Friedrich Franke''' ({{zh|c=傅吾康|p=Fù Wúkāng}}; 24 July 1912 – 6 September 2007) was a German [[Sinology|sinologist]] whose research focused on the history of the [[Ming dynasty]] and of the [[Nanyang (region)|Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia]]. He served as Chair of Sinology at the [[University of Hamburg]] for 27 years. His father [[Otto Franke (sinologist)|Otto Franke]] had set up the chair in 1910.

==Biography==
Wolfgang Franke was born in [[Hamburg]] on 24 July 1912, the fourth and youngest child of the prominent sinologist [[Otto Franke (sinologist)|Otto Franke]] and his wife Luise Niebuhr. He had a sister, as well as two brothers who died in their teens.&lt;ref name=liew&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liew |first=Foon Ming |title=Wolfgang Franke 1912–2007 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/014703708788762354 |journal=Ming Studies |year=2008 |doi=10.1179/014703708788762354 |issn=0147-037X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franke graduated from the Grunewald Gymnasium in [[Berlin]], and studied sinology at the [[University of Berlin]] from 1931 to 1934, but transferred in his final year to the [[University of Hamburg]]&lt;ref name=liew/&gt; where he studied under {{ill|Fritz Jäger|de|Fritz Jäger (Sinologe)}}. He received his doctorate degree in 1935, with a dissertation on the 1898 [[Hundred Days' Reform]] of [[Kang Youwei]].&lt;ref name="stumpfeldt"&gt;Hans Stumpfeldt: ''[http://www.stumpfeldt.de/cg.php Zur Geschichte der China von 1980 bis 2006. Eine Dokumentation der Hamburger Sinologischen Gesellschaft (HSG)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the military for a year, Franke left for China, arriving in [[Shanghai]] on 18 May 1937, just before the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt; From 1937 to 1945 he worked as a research assistant at the German Institute (''Deutschland-Institut'') in Beijing,&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;&lt;ref name="stumpfeldt"/&gt; thus avoided being drafted into the German Army during [[World War II]], during which many of his friends were killed.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt; In his autobiography, he writes that "I had the feelings of having lived here in my previous life and felt from the first day on at home."&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;

In 1941 Franke fell in love with Hu Junyin ({{zh|c=胡隽吟|w=Hu Chün-yin}}; 1910–1988), the daughter of a Chinese scholar who had studied in Germany. However, because of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Nuremberg Laws|prohibition]] of [[interracial marriage]], they did not marry until March 1945, near the end of World War II. They had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=li&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2012/11-27/4360438.shtml |title=“为中国着迷”的傅吾康:与胡隽吟结百年之好 |date=27 November 2012 |work=China News |language=zh |author=Li Xuetao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, he became a professor at [[Sichuan University]] and the private [[West China Union College]] in [[Chengdu]], teaching Ming history and German history. Two years later, he became a professor of German language at [[Peking University]].&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;&lt;ref name=li/&gt;

When peace was restored in post-war Germany, Franke returned to Hamburg with his family in 1950. He was appointed Chair of Sinology at the University of Hamburg, and was also Director of the Seminar for Language and Culture in China. He was the fourth holder of the Chair of Sinology and succeeded his father [[Otto Franke (sinologist)|Otto Franke]], who had set up the chair in 1910. He worked there until his retirement in 1977.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;&lt;ref name="stumpfeldt"/&gt;

After his wife died in 1988, Franke moved to [[Petaling Jaya]] near the [[University of Malaya]], where he had students and friends. He lived in Malaysia until his late eighties, when he moved to Berlin in May 2000 to live with his daughter. In his final years, when he could no longer travel, his daughter hired Chinese students to look after him, so that he could speak Chinese to someone.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt; He died in Berlin on 6 September 2007, at the age of 95.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;

==Publications==
Franke was internationally known as a China expert with research focuses on the Ming dynasty and history of the Chinese in Southeast Asia. He worked in various national and international committees on China and Asia studies and was a member of the university club of the University of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;&lt;ref name="stumpfeldt"/&gt;

Important works by Franke include:&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;
*''Das Jahrhundert der chinesischen Revolution 1851-1949'' München (1958). English translation: ''A Century of Chinese Revolution 1851–1949'', Oxford (1970).
*''The Reform and Abolition of the Traditional Chinese Examination System'', Harvard University Press, 1960.
*''China und das Abendland'' (1962). English translation: ''China and the West'' (1962).
*''An Introduction to the Sources of Ming History'' (1968). Chinese translation: 明代史籍彙考引言 (1970).
*''China-Handbuch'' (''China Handbook'') (1974).

He also wrote a two-volume autobiography ''Im Banne Chinas'' (''Under the Spell of China''; part 1: 1912–1950 and part 2: 1950–1998). In addition, from the mid-1960s onwards, he dealt intensively with the scholars in Southeast Asia and collected epigraphic material. The results of his research were published in English in several volumes for Malaysia 1983–87, Indonesia 1997 and Thailand 1998.&lt;ref name=liew/&gt;

The '''Y1C Problem''' or the '''Year 100 problem''' was a potential problem involving [[computers]] and [[computer systems]] in [[Taiwan]] in the night of 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinyin.info/news/2006/taiwans-y1c-problem/ Pinyin news » Taiwan’s Y1C problem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the [[Y2K]] problem faced by much of the world in the lead-up to 2000, the Y1C problem is a side effect of Taiwan's use of the [[Minguo calendar]] for official purposes. This calendar is based on the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 (year 1), so the year 2011 on the Western [[Gregorian calendar]] corresponds to year 100 on Taiwan's official calendar, which posed potential problems for any program that only treats years as two-digit values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://y100.dgbas.gov.tw/y100/faq/faq.asp Y1C problem FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313141209/http://y100.dgbas.gov.tw/y100/faq/faq.asp |date=March 13, 2010 }}, Minguo Year 100 Problem Service Web (Traditional Chinese), Retrieve at 2010-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reported problems==
As generally speaking only governmental offices used the official system, Y1C computer bug impact on the private sector was minimal. The potential to affect government systems was another matter.  However, a large number of governmental computers were already using a three-digit system for dates, with a zero being used as the first digit for years below 100 (Gregorian 2010 or earlier).

Some government documents such as driver's licenses already refer to years over 100; nothing more than minor glitches were reported.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Some [[iPhone]] users reported that their alarm tool failed to function on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2011/new/jan/2/today-life8.htm 百年蟲作怪 100年變00年]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|date=December 2014}}

==North Korea==
The [[North Korean calendar|North Korean (''Juche'') calendar]] was affected the same day as Taiwan's, as North Korea's calendar is also based on an event that happened in 1912 - the [[birthday of Kim Il-sung]].

'''Đào Duy Anh''' (25 April 1904 &amp;ndash; 1 April 1988) was a Vietnamese historian and lexicographer. He was one of the writers associated with the [[Nhan Van affair|Nhân Văn-Giai Phẩm movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Brocheux ''Ho Chi Minh: A Biography'' Page 162  2007  The critical spirit rubbed off on the official journals, and Nhan Van, for one, secured the support and collaboration of well-known writers: the scholar and romantic poet Phan Khoi, the lexicographer Dao Duy Anh, the philosopher Tran Duc Thao&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Abuza ''Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam'' Page 55 2001 "Leading dissidents, especially Dao Duy Anh, Tran Dan, Nguyen Manh Tuong, Le Dat, and Tran Duc Thao were forced ... elements participating in the Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair took a first step toward recognizing the errors and crimes of their "&lt;/ref&gt; He was the general editor of what was long regarded as the most scholarly dictionary of Vietnamese, the ''Pháp-Việt Từ điển''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence C.
