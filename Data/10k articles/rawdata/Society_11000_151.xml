      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8888">The '''Asega-bôk''', the name literally translating as "Book of the Judges", was part of the [[legal code]] for the [[Rüstringen|Rustringian]] [[Frisians]].{{sfn|Mallet|Blackwell|1847|p=48}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1838|p=lxi}} The oldest known manuscript version of it, the ''First Riustring Manuscript'' (now in [[Oldenburg]]) is, besides the oldest extant text in Frisian, one of the oldest remaining continental codes of Germanic law.

==History and background==
A codex containing a copy of the code, the First Riustring Manuscript, survives in the archives at [[Oldenburg]] (24, 1, Ab. 1).{{sfn|Bosworth|1848|p=63}}{{sfn|Giliberto|2007|p=130}} While [[Joseph Bosworth]] believed it to have been written somewhere between 1212 and 1250 A.D.,{{sfn|Bosworth|1838|p=lxi}} twentieth-century scholars date it ca. 1300,{{sfn|Johnston|1998|pp=197-198}} although some of the materials that it incorporates date to 1050.{{sfn|Jellema|1962|p=125}}  That version is the oldest surviving work written in [[Old Frisian]],{{sfn|Mallet|Blackwell|1847|p=48}} and one of the oldest surviving continental Germanic law codes (the [[Gulating|Gulating law]], possibly ca. 1150, may be older).{{sfn|Lear|1965}} The first modern scholarly edition was published in 1961 by [[Wybren Jan Buma]] {{harv|Buma|1961}} in Dutch;{{sfn|Jellema|1962}} a year later Buma, in cooperation with Germanic law scholar [[Wilhelm Ebel]], published an edition and translation in German {{harv|Buma|1963}}.{{sfn|Lear|1965}}{{sfn|Giliberto|2007|p=130}}

The term ''asega'' by itself is translated as "lawman" or "speaker of law", and refers to the Germanic tradition of having an orator recite law (which did not have to be written) in assembly, a practice attested in the Scandinavian [[Gutalagen]].{{sfn|Bethurum|1932|p=266}}

== Contents ==
One part of the book is the Old Frisian version of the ''[[Fifteen Signs before Doomsday]]''.  Buma observed that the Asega-bôk's version has a style, compared to that of other versions, that is particularly Frisian.  Although the list matches other versions, a conclusion was appended to it by its unknown author, who took multiple versions of the list as his or her source, in Buma's opinion, although relying mainly upon one.  [[Rolf Bremmer]] noted that the attribution of the list to Jerome in the Asega-bôk's version was copied from [[Pseudo-Bede]], and that the added conclusion is similar to [[Comestor]]'s ''Historia scholastica''.  The deduction that it was taken from Comestor is what pushes the 20th century dating of the Asega-bôk later than Bosworth's dating, given that Comestor died in 1178.{{sfn|Giliberto|2007|p=130&amp;ndash;131}}

The book comprises, in order: {{sfn|Johnston|1998|pp=197-198}}{{sfn|Munske|Århammar|2001|p=576}}
* two similar, but not identical, versions of ''The Prologue to the Statutes and Land Laws'' (supporting the hypothesis, made by Buma, that the book is a compilation of prior texts from multiple sources);{{sfn|Johnston|1998|pp=197-198}}
* the ''Seven Statutes'' and the ''Twenty-Four Land Laws'';
* the ''General Fine Register'', part 1 (of 2);
* the ''Riustring Fine Register'';
* the ''Wendar to the 17th Statute'' (''Wendar'' meaning exception);{{sfn|Munske|Århammar|2001|p=576}}
* the ''Elder Riustring Statutes'' (that are modified from the originals to include references to [[Charlemagne]] and the Frisians);{{sfn|Johnston|1998|pp=197-198}}
* the ''Younger Riustring Statutes'';
* two texts that begin ''Thet is ac friesk riucht'' ("This is also Frisian law");{{sfn|Munske|Århammar|2001|p=576}}
* the ''Fifteen Signs before Doomsday'', already mentioned;
* the ''Riustring Fines Concerning Crimes Against Clergymen'', part 1 (of 2);
* a list of the situations in which one is allowed to break into a church;
* the ''General Fine Register'', part 2 (of 2);
* a second group of texts that begin ''Thet is ac friesk riucht'';
* a list of coins and their values;
* an outline of the ecclesiastical penalties for murder of relatives;
* the ''Riustring Fines Concerning Crimes Against Clergymen'', part 2 (of 2);
* the ''Fines for Desecrating Church and Churchyard''; and
* the ''Riustring Synodal Laws''.

According to Johnston, this is one of a great many Frisian legal documents which have a secondary function: the promotion of the ideology of Frisian independence. He identifies three levels of ideology represented in those texts: "(1) the glorification of the concept of law in general, (2) the assertion of the idea of a Pan-Frisian law, (3) the propagation of the idea of Frisian independence and the promotion of Frisian unity against threats from outside".{{sfn|Johnston|1998|p=187}} The only text in the codex he deems exempt from such ideology is the ''Fifteen Signs before Doomsday''.{{sfn|Johnston|1998|pp=197-198}}

During the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]], there were allegations made about presidential candidate [[Lee Myung-bak]]'s relationship with a company called BBK. In 1999, Lee would meet Kim, with whom he established BBK and the LKE Bank. Their business enterprise went bankrupt less than a year later. Kim was investigated for alleged involvement in the massive embezzlement and for alleged stock price-manipulation. Kim initially stated that Lee had no involvement in the company, despite allegations of an affair between Lee, the candidate and his sister Kim, then a Los Angeles-based practicing attorney, though subsequently disbarred. Kim allegedly introduced Lee to her brother Kim, a former Merryl Lynch investment banker, meaning Lee's alleged mistress enlisted the aid of her brother in order to make money for, and together with, Lee who allegedly was desperate for campaign funds. Kim Hong-il of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office cleared Lee of any wrongdoing, based on Kim's testimony and Lee's denial that he had ever been associated with BBK. That would soon prove to be untrue, as it soon came to light that Lee, in public speeches by him, had publicly admitted that he was the owner of BBK: Three days before the election, an October 2000 video surfaced of Lee delivering a speech to an audience of students at [[Kwangwoon University]], in which he can be seen "bragging" that he had founded and directed BBK activities ("BBK? Yup, that's mine!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBK Video Clip Revives UNDP-GNP Tensions |url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2007121719058 |publisher=[[Dong-A Ilbo]] (English Edition) |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2007-12-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227105846/http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2007121719058| archivedate= 27 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days before the election, the [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]] appointed a [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea|prosecutor]] and charged him with the task of investigating the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special Counsel to Probe Lee Myung-bak |url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200712/200712180010.html |publisher=Digital [[Chosun Ilbo]] (English Edition) |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2007-12-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120222328/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200712/200712180010.html |archivedate=2008-01-20 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung Ho-young, as Special Prosecutor in charge of the investigation would soon declare Lee to be innocent of the accusations relating to the alleged fraud and the so-called BBK incident. Critics pointed out that the investigation appeared to have been compromised and that the prosecution may have felt intimidated, seeing as how it chose not to delve any further, likely figuring that Lee would be elected president. Even the fact that Lee was interviewed, rather than interrogated, is identical to the way Clinton was given kid glove treatment. That the particular type of establishment where the Lee interview took place was once known as a [[kisaeng]] house did not go well with the public once the news broke, as a kisaeng house refers to a high-end, brothel-like-restaurant establishment where female attendants/entertainers cater to men of power and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New South Korean Leader Cleared in Fraud Inquiry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/business/worldbusiness/21seoul.html |work=New York Times |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-05-07 |first=Choe |last=Sang-Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to public outcry, the special prosecutor's office announced that the initial interview location had been leaked to the media, so was changed at the last minute to a new location—the former kisaeng house, nestled in a secluded, remote location, away from the city, safe from prying eyes. They also declared that they had gone in fully prepared and had more than sufficient time to conduct the interview.&lt;ref name="moneytoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneytoday.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=200822112120990490&amp;outlink=1|title=고승덕, 친딸 "父 교육감 자격 없다" 발언 '해명'|publisher=moneytoday.co.kr|accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, prosecutors sought a 15-year sentence and a fine of 30&amp;nbsp;billion [[South Korean won|won]] for former BBK owner Kim on charges of stock manipulation and embezzlement. In the final hearing held at the Seoul Central District Court, the prosecutors said Kim, who founded and operated the boiler-room operation is suspected of crimes including embezzlement of W31.9&amp;nbsp;billion of investors' money, stock manipulation, and the forgery and execution of private documents but had shown no remorse nor repaid his debts.

Earlier, Kim Ki-dong, a prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, said, "This is a case in which an individual person has made a mockery of the Republic of Korea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=15-Year Sentence Sought for BBK Suspect |url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200804/200804110018.html |publisher=Digital [[Chosun Ilbo]] (English Edition) |date=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427054510/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200804/200804110018.html |archivedate=2008-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For spreading "false" rumors about Lee on the eve of the presidential election, the Seoul Central District Court convicted Kim of violating the nation's election law, handing down a one-year prison term. He was given another six months for document forgery to back his attacks on Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ComDevlab |url=http://www.segye.com/Articles/NEWS/SOCIETY/Article.asp?aid=20080704002341&amp;subctgl=subctg2= |title=법원 'BBK 허위 유포' 김경준 징역 1년6월 추가 – 세계를 밝히는 신문 – 세계일보 |publisher=Segye.com |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said in a statement that Kim had been changing the story with endless lies throughout the whole investigation process, making it extremely hard for them to draw up the protocol. He even denied their request to use a lie detector.

This, in fact, is a contradictory statement to the Attorneys-at-Law and attorney ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200804110104 |title=뉴스&amp;#93;-檢, 김경준씨 징역 15년-벌금 300억원 구형 |publisher=Donga.com |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Kim ended up asserting that President Lee had nothing to do with the BBK scandal and that he had hoped to avoid criminal liability by manipulating the prevailing circumstances in Korea at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jimin Hong|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20080628008014 |title=김경준 "국민·MB에 죄송" |publisher=seoul.co.kr |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim, who would later get convicted in Korea for his role in the incident and serve an eight-year sentence. Upon his release, he would later allege that Lee was indeed a part owner of BBK and as such had a major involvement in the BBK stock manipulation incident. Kim's allegation is that he lied under pressure from Lee, and as he thought that Lee, as his former partner in crime, would help him avoid being convicted. As turned out to be otherwise, Kim has held numerous news conferences alleging Lee's involvement in the BBK matter.

Some of the prosecutors who worked on the BBK case were promoted under Lee's presidency. Meanwhile, the US federal district court ruled that Kim was not subject to prosecution regarding BBK.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Subsequent to that, the very same prosecutors came under investigation and srcutiny for their alleged role in looking the other way, thereby helping to elect candidate Lee as president of South Korea.

According to [[WikiLeaks]], Yoo Chong-ha (유종하), the former co-chairman of Lee Myung-bak's presidential election campaign, had requested of Alexander Vershbow, the then American ambassador to South Korea, that the US authorities help delay the extradition of Kim to Korea asnaoight by the Korean government, in order that presidential hopeful Lee Myung-bak's election campaign might better control and effectively contain the controversy relating to Lee's alleged involvement in the BBK embezzlement scandal, there on the eve of the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|election season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/10/07SEOUL3225.html |title=07SEOUL3225, Kim's Extradition Case |accessdate=2011-12-17 |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks-kr.org/dokuwiki/07seoul3225 |title=US embassy cable - 김경준 송환 사건 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |publisher=Wiki Leaks Korea |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Min-yeong (민영) |last=Choi (최) |title="BBK 김경준 송환 미뤄달라" 이명박 후보 측 미국에 요청 |date=2011-09-03 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201109030259225&amp;code=910100 |work=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=2011-12-17 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yong-pil (용필) |last=Mun (문) |title=위키리크스 MB실체 폭로…"사실상 매국" 경악 |date=2011-09-05 |url=http://www.newsface.kr/news/news_view.htm?news_idx=2985 |work=Newsface |accessdate=2011-12-17 |language=Korean |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425062807/http://www.newsface.kr/news/news_view.htm?news_idx=2985 |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shin Myung''', the alleged writer of the ''fake letter'', returned to South Korea from the USA and turned himself in to the [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea|SPO]] on April 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Whan-woo |last=Yi |title=Key figure in forged BBK letter questioned |date=2012-04-03 |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/113_108290.html |work=Korea Times |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DAS==
[[다스 (기업)|DAS]] is a South Korean company involved in the BBK scandal. When allegations of fraud arose as part of the BBK matter, it was originally purported in late December 2011 that the owners of DAS were members of Lee Myung-bak's family, e.g., Lee Sang-Eun (이상은), one of Lee's older brothers, but not Lee himself. The Korean prosecutors at the time announced that Lee did not appear to be the owner of DAS, a position from which they now appear to be backtracking based on mounds of fresh evidence. As of early March of 2018,for instance, it has been alleged that Lee Myung-Bak is, and always has been, the true owner of DAS, which the Korean government itself owns a portion of, received as payment of inheritance taxes owed by Lee's family &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Se-yeol (세열) |last=Park (박) |title='MB 실소유' 논란 '다스'에 또 무슨 일이? |date=2011-12-23 |url=http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=20111223173335&amp;section=01 |work=Pressian |accessdate=2011-12-25 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;). To that end, the Korean prosecution has obtained testimony not only from Kim Baek-Joon, Lee Myung-Bak's decades-long confidant, private secretary, de facto butler and putative errand boy now turning state's evidence, but also from Lee Sang-Deuk, another older brother of Lee's who on Friday, 2 March 2018 testified that the seed money that went into the founding of DAS in the guise of proceeds from the sale of property in Seoul's posh Dogok-dong district, was not his own, but in fact that of his brother Lee Myung-Bak's, with the younger Lee being the actual owner of the Dogok-dong property. The legal implications concerning Lee Myung-Bak's alleged ownership of DAS is far-reaching and has thrown the whole of South Korea into turmoil. For irrespective of the corporate ownership structure of DAS on paper, Lee Myung-Bak would be the true beneficial owner of DAS, making the question of DAS' legal ownership less important than the fact that DAS, for all intents and purposes, has been and is the "alter ego" of Lee Myung-Bak's throughout all relevant periods, especially for the purposes of funneling overseas bribes. This further implicates the FCPA ("Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977") which allows the U.S. courts to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction if the proscribed act involves US persons natural or juridical. The latest details of allegations involving BBK, DAS, and Lee implicate Samsung's having bankrolled DAS' legal fees by remitting millions of dollars as payment in DAS' behalf to Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, and Feld, a prominent U.S. law firm representing DAS in a lawsuit brought againat it by Optional Ventures as plaintiff for alleged theft and conversion of funds belonging to Optional Ventures which Kim had embezzled as part of the BBK scandal. Samsung, as widely reported in the Korean press, is alleged to have funneled a substantial amount of money to Lee through said U.S. law firm, Akin Gump, with the aid and involvement of one or more of its overseas U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. law, that would constitute a bribery of a foreign official by U.S. persons, natural or juridical, if true. Lee Myung-Bak at the time was not merely a foreign official, but the sitting president of South Korea at the time:  Samsung's alleged payment of DAS' legal fees to, and through, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, and Feld means that everyone is on the hook, ranging from Lee Myung-Bak himself as the recipient of said bribes; to Akin, Gump, for functioning as the conduit as part, and in furtherance, of the conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the attendant conspiracy to violate United States law, which is a separate crime in and of itself; to Samsung and its subsidiaries through which the alleged payments were channeled; to even Lee Kun-Hee, Samsung's purportedly ailing chairman, for his alleged role in giving the greenlight on the paying of bribes (allegedly at least some of it) to Lee in the form of DAS' legal fees; to Korean-American attorney Suk Han Kim, then a partner with Akin, Gump and now with a different firm, for allegedly setting up the whole deal on behalf of Samsung and for the benefit of Lee Myung-Bak. Such FCPA woes are compounded by Samsung's alleged amounts paid to and through Akin, Gump in excess of the legal fees owed by DAS, suggesting there are likely additional U.S. law violations, e.g., money laundering and wire fraud, which are violations under the Stamp Act as provided in the United States Code. While the investigation by the Korean prosecutors into Lee's ownership of DAS and Samsung's alleged overseas bribery is still on-going, and though the focus by the local Korean prosecutors is on domestic Korean aspects only, it may be that there is now sufficient probable cause to warrant a grand jury hearing and an indictment to trigger a massive FCPA investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The '''Bashkirs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|ʃ|k|ɪər|z}}; {{lang-ba|Башҡорттар}}, ''Başqorttar'', {{IPA-all|bɑʂqʊrtˈtɑr}}; {{lang-ru|Башкиры}}, ''Baškiry'', {{IPA-ru|bɐʂˈkʲirɨ|pron}}) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group, indigenous to [[Bashkortostan]] and to the [[historical region]] of [[Badzhgard]], extending on both sides of the [[Ural Mountains]], in the area where [[Eastern Europe]] meets [[North Asia]]. Smaller communities of Bashkirs also live in the [[Republic of Tatarstan]], [[Perm Krai]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]], [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]], [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]], [[Kurgan Oblast]]s and other regions of [[Russia]], as well as in [[Kazakhstan]] and other countries.

Most Bashkirs speak the [[Bashkir language]], closely related to [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] languages which belongs to the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] branch of the [[Turkic languages]] and share cultural affinities with the broader [[Turkic peoples]]. In religion the Bashkirs are mainly [[Sunni Muslims]] of the [[Hanafi]] [[madhhab]].

== Ethnonym ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
There are many different theories regarding the etymology of the [[endonym]] ''Bashqort''.

* According to a [[folk etymology]]  mentioned by the 18th century ethnographers [[Vasily Tatishchev|V. N. Tatishchev]], P. I. Richkov, and [[Johann Gottlieb Georgi]], the word ''Bashqort'' originally meant "wolf leader" (i.e. ''bash'' "head" and ''qort'' "wolf").
* Historian V. S. Yumatov (1847) suggested the original meaning to be "beekeeper, beemaster".{{cn|date=August 2017}}
* Historian and ethnologist A. E. Alektorov (1885) suggested that ''Bashqort'' means "distinct nation".{{cn|date=August 2017}}
* The anthropologist R. M. Yusupov considers that ''Bashqort'' could have originally been an Iranian compound word meaning "wolf-children" or "descendants of heroes", i.e. ''bacha'' "descendant, child" and ''gurd'' "hero" or ''gurg'' "wolf".   The historian [[Constantin Zuckerman]] cites the archaeologist and historian [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]] (1872–1972) as identifying phonological similarities between the name of the Bashkir and that  of a little-known  [[Scythian]] tribe of the southern Urals: the ''Bušxk''' (or ''Bwsxk'' etc). However, this theory is rejected by both Zuckerman and historian [[Robert H. Hewsen|R. H. Hewsen]], who instead identifies the ''Bušxk'' with the [[Volga Bulgars]].&lt;ref name=Golden&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=3ZzXjdyK-CEC&amp;q=Bashkir#v=snippet&amp;q=Bashkir&amp;f=false Peter B. Golden, Haggai Ben-Shammai &amp; András Róna-Tas, The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives, Leiden/Boston, Brill, 2007, pp. 422–423.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Turkologist [[Nikolai Baskakov (linguist)|N. A. Baskakov]] believed that the word "Bashqort" consists of two parts: "''badz(a)''" – brother-in-law" and "''(o)gur''" and means "brothers-in-law of the [[Ugrians|Ugor]] [Magyars]".{{cn|date=August 2017}}
* According to an orientalist [[Douglas Morton Dunlop]], the ethnonym ''Bashqort'' comes from ''beshgur'' (or ''bashgur'') which means "''five tribes'' in the modern Bashkir language.{{cn|date=August 2017}}
* Ethnologist N. V. Bikbulatov suggests that the term originates from the name of a legendary [[Khazar]] warlord [[Bashgird]], who ruled an area centred on the [[Ural River|Jayıq]] river.
* The ethnologist R. G. Kuzeev derives the ethnonym from a compound of "''bash''" — "main, head" and "''qort''" — " clan, tribe".{{cn|date=August 2017}}
* A historian and linguist [[András Róna-Tas]] believes the ethonym "Bashkir" to be a [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] reflex of the Hungarian endonym ''[[Hungarian language|Magyar]]'' (or the [[Old Hungarian language|Old Hungarian]] ''Majer'').{{cn|date=August 2017}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bashkortostan}}
Links to extinct branches of [[Indo-Iranian peoples]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]] have been proposed by scholars since the early 20th century, while Russian linguist [[Eugene Helimski]] pronounces that this "extinct Indo-Iranian branch" must be regarded as the "[[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] population".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tib.eu/en/search/id/BLCP%3ACN051899464/The-southern-neighbours-of-Finno-Ugrians-Iranians/&lt;/ref&gt; A Bashkir scholar Salavat Gallyamov – citing a philologist Nikolai Dmitriev – indicates that [[Iranian language|Iranian]] influence on the Bashkir phonology can be assumed, supporting hypotheses that the Bashkir originally spoke an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eanews.ru/news/society/item123717/ Европейско-Азиатские Новости.

=== Middle ages ===
[[File:Mausoleum of Huseynbek.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum of Husseinbek of the 14th century in Bashkortostan]]
[[File:Mausoleum of Turahan.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum of Turakhan of the 15th century in Bashkortostan]]

The first report about the Bashkirs is found in the Chinese chronicles of the [[Sui dynasty]]: 45 tribes called by originators [[Tiele people]] are listed in the "[[Book of Sui]]" (636 AD) in "A Narration about a Tiele people", Bashkirs being mentioned among them. The Bashkirs are also mentioned in "[[Ashkharatsuyts]]" (7th century).

Starting from the 9th century, first written reports about Bashkirs by Arab and Persian authors began to appear. Sallam al-Tardzhuman (9th century); [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], [[Al-Masudi]], and [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] (10th century); [[Said Al-Andalusi]] and [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (12th century); [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and Qazvini (13th century); [[Al-Dimashqi (geographer)|Al-Dimashqi]] and [[Abu'l-Fida]] (14th century) wrote about Bashkirs.

The first written Arab source on the Bashkirs belongs to the traveler Sallam an at-Tardzhuman. About 840 he visited the country of the Bashkir and roughly described its borders. [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] (10th century) described Bashkirs as a people divided into two groups, one inhabiting the Southern Urals, the other living on the Danube plain near the boundaries of [[Byzantium]]. [[Ibn Rustah]], a contemporary of [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]], observed that Bashkirs were an independent people occupying territories on both sides of the [[Ural mountains]] ridge between [[Volga River|Volga]], [[Kama River|Kama]], and [[Tobol River]]s and upstream of the [[Ural River|Yaik river]].

The first ethnographic description of the Bashkir was made by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] — the ambassador of the Baghdad Caliph [[Al-Muqtadir]] to the governor of [[Volga Bulgaria]]. He visited the Bashkir lands in 922. The Bashkirs, according to Ibn Fadlan, were a warlike and powerful people, which he and his companions (a total of five thousand people, including military protection) "bewared... with the greatest threat". They were engaged in cattle breeding. Bashkirs worshipped twelve gods: winter, summer, rain, wind, trees, people, horses, water, night, day, death, heaven and earth, the one above all being the sky god. Apparently, Islam had already began its spread among the Bashkirs, as one of the ambassadors was a Muslim Bashkir. According to the testimony of Ibn Fadlan, the Bashkirs were [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], living on the southern slopes of the Urals, and occupying a vast territory up to the Volga. They were bordered by [[Pechenegs]] on the south-east, by [[Bulgars]] on the west, and by [[Oghuz Turks]] on the south.

The first European sources to mention the Bashkirs were the works of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpini|Joannes de Plano Carpini]] and [[William of Rubruck|William of Rubruquis]] (13th century).

By 1236, lands of Bashkortostan were incorporated into the empire of [[Genghis Khan]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, all of Bashkortostan was part of the [[Golden Horde]]. The brother of Batu-Khan, Sheibani, received the Bashkir lands to the east of the [[Ural Mountains]].

After the breakup of the [[Mongol Empire]], the Bashkirs were divided among the [[Nogai Horde]], the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Khanate of Sibir]], founded in the 15th century.

=== Early modern period ===
[[File:Башкирские казаки в Европе.jpg|thumb|230px|Bashkir riders]]
In the middle of the 16th century, Bashkirs joined the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Charters of [[Ivan the Terrible]] to Bashkir tribes became the basis of their contractual relationship with the tsar’s government. Primary documents pertaining to the Bashkirs during this period have been lost, although some are mentioned in the shezhere (family trees) of the Bashkir.

In the late 16th and early 19th centuries Bashkirs occupied the territory from the left bank of the [[Volga]] on the south-west to the riverheads of [[Tobol]] in the east, from the river [[Sylva River|Sylva]] in the north, to the middle stream of the Yaik in the south, in the Middle and Southern Urals, in Cis-Urals, including Volga territory and Trans-Urals.

[[File:Башкиры в Оренбурге.1913.jpg|thumb|Bashkirs in [[Orenburg]], at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War of 1812]], 1913]]

The Bashkirs participated in the [[Bashkir rebellion (1662–1664)|1662–64]], 1675–83 and [[Bashkir Uprising (1704–11)|1704–11]] rebellions. In 1676, the Bashkirs rebelled under a leader named Seyid Sadir or 'Seit Sadurov', and the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] had great difficulties in ending the rebellion. The Bashkirs rose again in 1707, under Aldar and Kûsyom, on account of ill-treatment by the Russian officials.

The [[Bashkir rebellion of 1735–1740|third insurrection]] occurred in 1735, at the time of the foundation of [[Orenburg]], and it lasted for six years. From at least the time of [[Peter the Great]] there had been talk of pushing southeast toward Persia and India. Ivan Kirillov drew up a plan to build a fort to be called Orenburg at [[Orsk]] at the confluence of the [[Or River]] and the [[Ural River]] southeast of the Urals where the Bashkir, Kalmyk and Kazakh lands join. Work was started at Orsk in 1735, but by 1743 '[[Orenburg]]' was moved about 250&amp;nbsp;km west to its present location. The next planned step was to build a fort on the [[Aral Sea]]. This would involve crossing the Bashkir country and then the lands of the [[Little jüz|Kazakh Lesser Horde]], some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission.

Kirillov's plan was approved on May 1, 1734 and he was placed in command. He was warned that this would provoke a Bashkir rebellion, but the warnings were ignored. He left Ufa with 2,500 men in 1735 and fighting started on the first of July. The war consisted of many small raids and complex troop movements, so it cannot be easily summarized. For example: In the spring of 1736 Kirillov burned 200 villages, killed 700 in battle and executed 158. An expedition of 773 men left Orenburg in November and lost 500 from cold and hunger. During, at Seiantusa the Bashkir planned to massacre sleeping Russians. The ambush failed. One thousand villagers, including women and children, were put to the sword and another 500 driven into a storehouse and burned to death. Raiding parties then went out and burned about 50 villages and killed another 2,000. Eight thousand Bashkirs attacked a Russian camp and killed 158, losing 40 killed and three prisoners who were promptly hanged. Rebellious Bashkirs raided loyal Bashkirs. Leaders who submitted were sometimes fined one horse per household and sometimes hanged.

Bashkirs fought on both sides (40% of 'Russian' troops in 1740). Numerous leaders rose and fell. The oddest was Karasakal or Blackbeard who pretended to have 82,000 men on the Aral Sea and had his followers proclaim him 'Khan of Bashkiria'. His nose had been partly cut off and he had only one ear. Such mutilations are standard Imperial punishments. The Kazakhs of the Little Horde intervened on the Russian side, then switched to the Bashkirs and then withdrew. Kirillov died of disease during the war and there were several changes of commander. All this was at the time of Empress [[Anna of Russia]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)]].

Although the history of the 1735 Bashkir War cannot be easily summarized, its results can be.
*The Russian Imperial goal of expansion into Central Asia was delayed to deal with the Bashkir problem.
*Bashkiria was pacified in 1735–1740.
*Orenburg was established.
*The southern side of Bashkiria was fenced off by the Orenburg Line of forts. It ran from [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] on the Volga east up the [[Samara River]] to its headwaters, crossed to the middle [[Ural River]] and followed it east and then north on the east side of the Urals and went east down the [[Uy River (Tobol basin)|Uy River]] to Ust-Uisk on the [[Tobol River]] where it connected to the ill-defined 'Siberian Line' along the forest-steppe boundary.
*In 1740 a report was made of Bashkir losses which gave: Killed: 16,893, Sent to Baltic regiments and fleet: 3,236, Women and children distributed (presumably as serfs): 8,382, Grand Total: 28,511. Fines: Horses: 12,283, Cattle and Sheep: 6,076, Money: 9,828 rubles. Villages destroyed: 696. As this was compiled from army reports it excludes losses from [[Irregular warfare|irregular raiding]], hunger, disease and cold. All this was from an estimated Bashkir population of 100,000.

Later, in 1774, the Bashkirs, under the leadership of [[Salawat Yulayev|Salavat Yulayev]], supported [[Pugachev's Rebellion]]. In 1786, the Bashkirs achieved tax-free status; and in 1798 Russia formed an [[Irregular military|irregular]] Bashkir army from among them. Residual land ownership disputes continued.

=== The establishment of the Republic of Bashkortostan ===

After the 1917 revolution are All-Bashkir Qoroltays (conventions) on which a decision on the need to create a national federal republic within Russia. As a result, 15 November 1917 Bashkir Regional (central) Shuro (Council) proclaims the establishment in areas with predominantly Bashkir population of Orenburg, Perm, Samara, Ufa provinces territorial and national autonomy [[Bashkurdistan]].

In December 1917, delegates to the All-Bashkir (constituent) Congress, representing the interests of the population edge of all nationalities, voted unanimously for the resolution (Farman #2) of the Bashkir regional Shuro the proclamation of national-territorial autonomy (of the republic) [[Bashkurdistan]]. The congress was formed the government of Bashkurdistan, the Pre-parliament – Kese-Qoroltay and other bodies of power and administration, and decisions were made on how to proceed.

In March 1919, based on the agreements of the Russian Government with the Bashkir Government was formed [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

October 11, 1990 the Supreme Council of the Republic was proclaimed the Declaration of State Sovereignty. March 31, 1992 [[Bashkortostan]] signed a federal agreement on the delimitation of powers and areas of jurisdiction between the authorities of the [[Russian Federation]] and the authorities of the sovereign republics in its composition and its Annex of the [[Republic of Bashkortostan]], which determined the nature of the contractual relations between the Republic of Bashkortostan and the Russian Federation.

[[File:Tug of war competition on Moscow Sabantuy of Moscow bashkirs.jpg|thumb|Bashkir [[Sabantuy]]]]
Regarding [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA haplogroups]] genetic studies have revealed that the dominant frequency for Bashkir males is for [[haplogroup R1b]] (R-M269 and R-M73) which is, on average, 47.6%. The Y-DNA haplogroup R-M269 (R1b1a2) is dominant among [[Origin_of_the_Basques|the Basques]] in western Europe. Following are the [[haplogroup R1a]] at the average frequency of 26,5%, and [[Haplogroup N-M231|haplogroup N1c]] at 17%. In lower frequencies were also found haplogroups [[Haplogroup J-M172|J2]], [[Haplogroup C-M130|C]], [[Haplogroup O-M175|O]], [[Haplogroup E-M96|E1b]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], [[Haplogroup L-M20|L]], [[Haplogroup N-M231|N1b]], [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]], [[Haplogroup T-M184|T]].&lt;ref name="lob"&gt;[http://ftp.anrb.ru/molgen/Lobov_AS.PDF Лобов А.

Despite the Bashkirs being Turkic peoples, the haplogroups R1b and R1a is mostly linked with [[Indo-Europeans]].

Most [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA haplogroups]] found in Bashkirs (60–65%) consist of the haplogroups [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G]], [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]], [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|С]], [[Haplogroup Z|Z]] and [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F]]; which are lineages characteristic  of East Eurasian populations.

According to the study Suslova et al. 2015: "''The Bashkirs appear close to Mongoloids in allele and haplotype distribution. However, Bashkirs cannot be labelled either as typical Mongoloids or as Caucasoids. Thus, Bashkirs possess some alleles and haplotypes frequent in Mongoloids, which supports the Turkic impact on Bashkir ethnogenesis, but also possess the AH 8.1 haplotype, which could evidence an ancient Caucasoid population that took part in their ethnic formation... Bashkirs showed no features of populations with a substantial Finno-Ugric component, for example Chuvashes or Russian Saami. This disputes the commonly held belief of a Finno-Ugric origin for Bashkirs...''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suslova|first1=T. A.|last2=Burmistrova|first2=A. L.|last3=Chernova|first3=M.

== Language ==
{{Main|Bashkir language}}
[[Bashkir language]] is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] of the [[Kypchak languages|Kypchak]] group. Main dialects: Southern, Eastern and North-Western.  Distributed in the territory of [[Historical Bashkortostan]].

The [[Russian Census (2010)|Russian census]] of 2010 recorded 1,152,404 Bashkir speakers in the [[Russian Federation]]. Bashkir language is native to 1 133 339 Bashkirs (71,7% of the total number of Bashkirs, reporting mother tongue). The [[Tatar language]] is called native 230 846 Bashkirs (14,6%). [[Russian language]] is native to 216 066 Bashkir (13,7%). Most Bashkirs are bilingual in Bashkir and [[Russian language|Russian]].

The [[Bashkir tribes]] in ancient times used the [[Old Turkic alphabet]]. After the adoption of [[Islam]], which began in the 10th century and lasted for several centuries, the Bashkirs began to use the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Since the mid-18th century begins the formation of the Bashkir national literature. In 1923, the approved Bashkir alphabet based on Arabic alphabet. In 1929 appears the Bashkir alphabet based on the [[Latin alphabet]] (yanalif). In 1940 introduced the alphabet based on [[Cyrillic alphabet]]. The modern Bashkir alphabet consists of 42 letters.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Bashkirs by federal subject 2010.svg|thumb|The area settled by the Bashkirs according to the national census of 2010.]]

The ethnic Bashkir population is estimated at roughly 2 million people (2009 [[SIL Ethnologue]]). The 2010 Russian census recorded 1,584,554 ethnic Bashkirs in [[Russia]], of which 1,172,287 Bashkirs live in [[Bashkortostan]] (29.5% of the total population of the republic).

== Culture ==
[[File:Holiday Bashkir national costume 52.jpg|thumb|200px|Bashkirs in traditional clothing, [[Ufa]], 2016]]
The Bashkirs traditionally practiced agriculture, cattle-rearing and bee-keeping. The half-nomadic Bashkirs wandered either the mountains or the steppes, herding cattle. Wild-hive beekeeping can be named as a separate component of the most ancient culture which is practiced in the same [[Burzyansky District]] near to the [[Kapova Cave]].

Traditional Bashkir dish [[Beşbarmaq|bishbarmaq]] is prepared from boiled meat and halma (the kind of noodles), sprinkled with herbs flavored with onions and some [[:wikt:ҡорот|qorot]] (young dry cheese). This is another notable feature of the Bashkir cuisine: dishes often served dairy products — rare party without qorot or [[:wikt:ҡаймаҡ|qaymaq]] (sour cream). Most of the dishes Bashkir cuisine is nutritious and easy to prepare.

A series of epic Bashkir works called [[Ural-batyr]] and [[Akbuzat]] keeps layers of ancient mythology and have parallels with the Epic of Gilgamesh, Rigveda, and Avesta. Their plots concern the struggle of heroes against demonic forces. A peculiarity of them is that events and ceremonies described there may reference a specific geographical place; the [[Shulgan-Tash]] cave and its vicinity.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In the pre-Islamic period the Bashkirs were followers of [[Tengrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shireen Hunter, Jeffrey L. Thomas, Alexander Melikishvili, "[https://books.google.ru/books?id=hVhHGJkfZDoC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=tengrism+of+Bashkirs&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tengrism%20of%20Bashkirs&amp;f=false Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security]", M.E.

Bashkirs began to convert to Islam in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Shirin Akiner, "[https://books.google.ru/books?id=LUe0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=islam+Bashkirs&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20Bashkirs&amp;f=false Islamic Peoples Of The Soviet Un]", Second edition, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Arab traveler [[Ibn Fadlan]] in 921 met some of the Bashkirs, who were Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Allen J.

On the territory of Bashkortostan preserved the burial place of the first Imam of Historical Bashkortostan — {{Interlanguage link multi|The mausoleum of Hussein-Bek|ru|3=Мавзолей Хусейн-бека}}, 14th-century building. In 1788 [[Catherine the Great]] established the "{{Interlanguage link multi|Orenburg Mohammedan Spiritual Assembly|ru|3=Центральное духовное управление мусульман России}}" in [[Ufa]], which was the first Muslim administrative center in Russia.

In yearly 1990s began the religious revival among the Bashkirs.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey E. Cole, "[https://books.google.ru/books?id=M9fDifnkMJMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=religion+of+Bashkirs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nGY4sEg8W5&amp;sig=7o25bCPvVPMWGtW2lki_TgoaGF0&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=religion%20of%20Bashkirs&amp;f=false Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia]", Greenwood publishing group&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Talgat Tadzhuddin]] there are more than 1,000 mosques in Bashkortostan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=38780 Интерфакс.

'''Canadians''' ({{lang-fr|Canadiens}}) are people identified with the country of [[Canada]]. This connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural. For most Canadians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being ''Canadian''.

Canada is a multilingual and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society home to people of many different ethnic, religious, and national origins, with the majority of the population made up of [[Old World]] [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants]] and their descendants. Following the initial period of [[New France|French]] and then the much larger [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]], different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages, and religions have combined to form the [[culture of Canada]], and thus a [[Canadian identity]]. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic, and economic neighbour—the [[United States]].

Canadian independence from the United Kingdom grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867. [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established with the passage of the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', the Canadian [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|''Citizenship Act'' of 1946]] took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the [[patriation]] of the constitution in 1982. [[Canadian nationality law|Canada's nationality law]] closely mirrored that of the [[United Kingdom]]. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to [[multilateralism]] and [[socioeconomic development]].

==Population==

As of 2010, Canadians make up only 0.5% of the [[World population|world's total population]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment – Greenhouse Gases (Greenhouse Gas Emissions per Person) |url=http://www4.hrsdc.gc.ca/.3ndic.1t.4r@-eng.jsp?iid=64|publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|year=2010|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development.{{sfn|Cornelius|Tsuda|Martin|Hollifield|2004|p=100}} Approximately 41% of current Canadians are first- or second-generation immigrants,&lt;ref name="immigrantclass"/&gt; and 20% of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country.{{sfn|Bybee|McCrae|2009|p=92}} [[Statistics Canada]] projects that, by 2031, nearly one-half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be [[Foreign born|foreign-born]] or have one foreign-born parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/cgi-bin/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=5126&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2|title=Projections of the Diversity of the Canadian Population|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=March 15, 2010|date= March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], according to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian Census]], numbered at 1,400,685 or 4.3% of the country's 33,476,688 population.&lt;ref name=firstnations&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Peoples in Canada: First Nations People, Métis, and Inuit|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-011-x/99-011-x2011001-eng.cfm|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
{{main article|Immigration to Canada}}
While the first contact with Europeans and indigenous peoples in Canada had occurred a century or more before, the first group of permanent settlers were the [[French people|French]], who founded the [[New France]] settlements, in present-day [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]; and [[Acadia]], in present-day [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], during the early part of the 17th century.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=15}}{{sfn|Griffiths|2005|p=4}}

Approximately 100 [[Irish Quebecers|Irish-born families]] would settle the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence Valley]] by 1700, assimilating into the ''Canadien'' population and culture.{{sfn|McGowan|1999}}{{sfn|Magocsi|1999|p=736ff}} During the 18th and 19th century; immigration westward (to the area known as [[Rupert's Land]]) was carried out by "[[Voyageurs]]"; French settlers working for the [[North West Company]]; and by [[British people|British]] settlers ([[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]]) representing the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], coupled with independent entrepreneurial woodsman called "[[Coureur des bois]]".{{sfn|Standford|2000|p=42}} This arrival of newcomers led to the creation of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], an ethnic group of mixed European and [[First Nations]] parentage.{{sfn|Borrows|2010|p=134}}

The British conquest of New France was preceded by a small number of [[Germans]] and [[Swedes]] who settled alongside the Scottish in [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]],{{sfn|Cameron|2004|p=5}} while some [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrated to the [[Colony of Newfoundland]].{{sfn|Powell|2005|pp=152, 154}} In the wake of the British [[Conquest of 1760]] and the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]], many families from the British colonies in [[New England]] moved over into Nova Scotia and other colonies in Canada, where the British made farmland available to British settlers on easy terms. More settlers arrived during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]], when approximately 60,000 [[United Empire Loyalist]]s fled to [[British North America]], a large portion of whom settled in [[New Brunswick]].{{sfn|Murrin|Johnson|McPherson|Fahs|2007|p=172}} After the [[War of 1812]], British (including British army regulars), Scottish, and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert's Land, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]].{{sfn|Feltes|1999|p=19}}

Between 1815 and 1850, some 800,000 immigrants came to the colonies of British North America, mainly from the [[British Isles]] as part of the [[Great Migration of Canada]].{{sfn|Harland-Jacobs|2007|p=177}} These new arrivals included some [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic-speaking]] [[Highland Scots]] displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]] to [[Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|Campey|2008|p=122}} The [[Irish Potato Famine]] of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to [[Prince Edward Island]] and the [[Province of Canada]], with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in [[Toronto]] in 1847 and 1848.{{sfn|McGowan|2009|p=97}}{{sfn|Elliott|2004|p=106}} Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans who arrived in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries are often referred to as [[Old Stock Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boberg|first1=Charles|title=The English Language in Canada: Status, History, and Comparative Analysis|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139491440|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/18/who-are-old-stock-canadians.html | title=Who are 'old stock Canadians'?

Beginning in the late 1850s, the immigration of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] into the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] and [[Colony of British Columbia]] peaked with the onset of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Hall|Hwang|2001|p=9}} The ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885|Chinese Immigration Act]]'' eventually placed a head tax on all Chinese immigrants, in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].{{sfn|Huang|2006|p=107}}

[[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]] is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when at least one biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen who was born in Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen).&lt;ref name=parent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizenship/rules/index.asp|title=Am I Canadian? |year=2014|publisher=Government of Canada Canada|accessdate= July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be granted to a [[permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]] who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements.&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-29/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I|title=Citizenship Act (R.S., 1985, c.

[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] is primarily a [[Western culture]], with influences by First Nations and other cultures. It is a product of its ethnicities, languages, religions, [[Politics of Canada|political]], and [[Law of Canada|legal system]](s). Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of [[Canadian art|art]], [[Canadian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Canadian literature|literature]], [[Canadian humour|humour]], and [[Music of Canada|music]].{{sfn|Kalman|2009|pp=4–7}} Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote [[multiculturalism]] rather than [[cultural assimilation]].{{sfn|DeRocco|Chabot|2008|p=13}} In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec culture]] distinct from English Canadian culture.{{sfn|Franklin|Baun|1995|p=61}} However, as a whole, Canada is a [[cultural mosaic]]: a collection of several regional, indigenous, and ethnic subcultures.{{sfn|English|2004|p=111}}{{sfn|Burgess|2005|p=31}}

Canadian government policies such as [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]]; [[Health care in Canada|publicly funded health care]]; [[Income taxes in Canada|higher and more progressive taxation]]; outlawing [[Capital punishment in Canada|capital punishment]]; strong efforts to eliminate [[poverty in Canada|poverty]]; strict [[Gun politics in Canada|gun control]];  and, most recently, legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] and [[Cannabis in Canada|cannabis]] are social indicators of Canada's political and [[Canadian values|cultural values]].{{sfn|Bricker|Wright|2005|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nanosresearch.com/sites/default/files/POLNAT-S15-T705.pdf |title=Exploring Canadian values |date=October 2016 |author=Nanos Research |accessdate= February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American media]] and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide.{{sfn|Blackwell|2005}} The [[Government of Canada]] has also influenced culture with programs, laws, and institutions. It has created [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporations]] to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to [[Canadian cultural protectionism|protect Canadian culture]] by setting legal minimums on [[Canadian content]].{{sfn|Armstrong|2010|p=144}}
[[File:Outside Union Station.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''Monument to Multiculturalism'' by Francesco Pirelli in [[Toronto]]; four identical sculptures are located in [[Buffalo City Local Municipality|Buffalo City]], [[Changchun]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Sydney]]]]

Canadian culture has historically been influenced by [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and traditions, especially [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Culture of France|French]], and by its own [[Indigenous peoples in Canada#Culture|indigenous cultures]]. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the [[Canadian identity]].&lt;ref name="pioneer lit"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/pioneers/pioneers3_e.html| title=Canada in the Making: Pioneers and Immigrants| publisher=The History Channel| date=August 25, 2005| accessdate=November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Nations played a critical part in the development of [[Former colonies and territories in Canada|European colonies in Canada]], particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the [[North American fur trade]].{{sfn|White|Findlay|1999|p=67}} The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large [[Francophone]] population under [[Canada under British Imperial control|British Imperial rule]], creating a need for compromise and accommodation.{{sfn|Dufour|1990|p=25}} The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking ''[[habitants]]'', guaranteeing through the ''[[Quebec Act]]'' of 1774 the right of the ''Canadiens'' to practise the Catholic faith and to use [[Law of France|French civil law]] (now [[Quebec law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original text of The Quebec Act of 1774|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/qa_1774.html|publisher=Canadiana (Library and Archives Canada)|date=2004 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' was designed to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="civil war"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/american-civil-war/|title=American Civil War and Canada |publisher=Historica Foundation|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|year=2003|accessdate=November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromises made by the [[Fathers of Confederation]] set Canadians on a path to [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]], and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.{{sfn|Vaillancourt|Coche|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=3}}

The [[Canadian Forces]] and overall civilian participation in the [[Military history of Canada during World War I|First World War]] and [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]] helped to foster [[Canadian nationalism]],{{sfn|Nersessian|2007}}&lt;ref name=CIC22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/chap-5.asp|title=Forging Our Legacy: Canadian Citizenship And Immigration, 1900–1977 – The growth of Canadian nationalism|publisher=Citizenship and Immigration Canada|year=2006|accessdate=January 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610200013/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/chap-5.asp|archivedate=June 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 1917 and 1944, [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription crisis']] highlighted the considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones.{{sfn|Linteau|Durocher|Robert|1983|p=522}} As a result of the First and Second World Wars, the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/LeagueofNation.htm |title=Canada and the League of Nations |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the gradual loosening of political ties to the United Kingdom and the modernization of Canadian immigration policies, 20th-century immigrants with [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], Caribbean and [[Ethnic groups in Asia|Asian]] nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.{{sfn|Bodvarsson|Van den Berg|2009|p=380}} The multiple-origins immigration pattern continues today, with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds.{{sfn|Prato|2009|p=50}}

[[Multiculturalism in Canada]] was adopted as the official policy of the government during the premiership of [[Pierre Trudeau]] in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Duncan|Ley|1993|p=205}} The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology, because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].{{sfn|Wayland|1997}} Multiculturalism is administered by the [[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada|Department of Citizenship and Immigration]] and reflected in the law through the ''[[Canadian Multiculturalism Act]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html|title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Being Part I of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'')|publisher=Electronic Frontier Canada|year=2008|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 27 of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-18.7/FullText.html|title=Canadian Multiculturalism Act (1985, c. 24 (4th Supp.)|date= 2010|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] reported that 67.3% of Canadians identify as being [[Christians]]; of this number, [[Catholicism|Catholics]] make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="religion2011"/&gt; The largest Protestant denomination is the [[United Church of Canada]] (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians); followed by [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglicans]] (5.0%), and [[Baptists]] (1.9%).&lt;ref name="religion2011"/&gt; About 23.9% of Canadians declare [[Irreligion|no religious]] affiliation, including [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Humanism|humanists]], and other groups.&lt;ref name="religion2011"/&gt; The remaining are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which is [[Islam]] (3.2%), followed by [[Hinduism]] (1.5%), [[Sikhism]] (1.4%), [[Buddhism]] (1.1%), and [[Judaism]] (1.0%).&lt;ref name="religion2011" /&gt;

Before the arrival of European colonists and explorers, First Nations followed a wide array of mostly [[Native American religion|animistic religions]].{{sfn|Tooker|1980|p=20}} During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], specifically [[Latin Rite]] [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]s, including a number of [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuits]] dedicated to converting indigenous peoples; an effort that eventually proved successful.{{sfn|Findling|Thackeray|2010|p=52}} The first large [[Protestantism|Protestant]] communities were formed in the [[Maritimes]] after the British conquest of New France, followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution.{{sfn|MacLeod|Poutanen|2004|p=23}} The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and southern European immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada.{{sfn|Powell|2005|pp=152, 154}} The settlement of the west brought significant [[Eastern Orthodox]] immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] immigrants from the United States.{{sfn|Martynowych|1991|p=28}}

The earliest documentation of [[Judaism in Canada|Jewish presence in Canada]] occurs in the 1754 British Army records from the [[French and Indian War]].{{sfn|Bloomberg|2004|p=255}} In 1760, General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]] attacked and won [[Montreal]] for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant [[Aaron Hart (businessman)|Aaron Hart]] who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry.{{sfn|Bloomberg|2004|p=255}} The [[Islam in Canada|Islamic]], [[Jainism in Canada|Jains]], [[Sikhism in Canada|Sikh]], [[Hinduism in Canada|Hindu]], and [[Buddhism in Canada|Buddhist]] communities—although small—are as old as the nation itself. The 1871 Canadian Census ([[Census in Canada|first "Canadian" national census]]) indicated thirteen Muslims among the populace,{{sfn|Coward|Kawamura|1979|p=95}} with approximately 5000 Sikh by 1908.{{sfn|Coward|Hinnells|Williams|2000|p=192}} The first Canadian [[mosque]] was constructed in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in Canada.{{sfn|Waugh|Abu-Laban|Qureshi|1991|p=15}} Buddhism first arrived in Canada when Japanese immigrated during the late 19th century.{{sfn|Bramadat|Seljak|2009|p=102}} The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built in [[Vancouver]] in 1905.{{sfn|Yamagishi|2010|p=17}} The influx of immigrants in the late 20th century, with [[Sri Lanka]]n, [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Indian people|Indian]] and Southeast Asian customs, has contributed to the recent expansion of the Jain, Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist communities.{{sfn|Naik|2003|p=32}}

A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] (the [[official language]]s) being the [[first language|mother tongues]] of approximately 56% and 21% of Canadians, respectively.&lt;ref name="Highlightsb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;TABID=1|title=Population by mother tongue and age groups (total), 2016 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2016 Census, just over 7.3&amp;nbsp;million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (1,227,680 first-language speakers), [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (501,680), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (458,850), [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (431,385), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (419,895), [[German language|German]] (384,040), and [[Italian language|Italian]] (375,645).&lt;ref name=Highlightsb/&gt; Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an [[Languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|indigenous language]]. About half this number (129,865) reported using an indigenous language on a daily basis.{{sfn|Gordon|2005}} Additionally, Canadians speak several [[sign languages]]; the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones, [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and [[Quebec Sign Language]] (LSQ),{{sfn|Kockaert|Steurs|2015|p=490}} as it is of [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[Plains Indian Sign Language|Plains Sign Talk]].{{sfn|Grimes|Grimes|2000}} There are only 47 speakers of the Inuit sign language [[Inuit Sign Language|Inuiuuk]].{{sfn|Schuit|Baker|Pfau|2011}}

English and French are recognized by the [[Constitution of Canada]] as official languages.&lt;ref name=Languages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/FullText.html|title=Official Languages Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.)) |work=Act current to 2016-08-29 and last amended on 2015-06-23.|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government services available in both languages.&lt;ref name=Languages/&gt; Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In [[Nunavut]], [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun language|Inuinnaqtun]] are official languages, alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langcom.nu.ca/nunavuts-official-languages|work=Office of the Languages Commissioner of Nunavut|title=Nunavut's Languages|accessdate=November 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904063908/http://www.langcom.nu.ca/nunavuts-official-languages|archivedate=September 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Northwest Territories]], the ''[[Official Languages Act (Northwest Territories)|Official Languages Act]]'' declares that there are eleven different languages: [[Dene Suline language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], English, French, [[Gwich'in language|Gwich'in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], [[Slavey language|South Slavey]], and [[Dogrib language|Tłįchǫ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multicultural media in Canada|Multicultural media]] are widely accessible across the country and offer specialty television channels, newspapers, and other publications in many minority languages.{{sfn|Ha|Ganahl|2006|page=62}}

In Canada, as elsewhere in the world of [[History of colonialism|European colonies]], the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, led to the development of [[Mixed language]]s.{{sfn|Winford|2003|p=183}} Languages like [[Michif language|Michif]], [[Chinook Jargon]], and [[Bungi creole]] tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language.{{sfn|Wurm|Muhlhausler|Tyron|1996|p=1491}} Plains Sign Talk—which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders—reached across Canada, the United States, and into Mexico.{{sfn|Pfau|Steinbach|Woll|2012|page= 540}}{{Clear}}

The production of hashish was prohibited in Lebanon in 1926, during the era of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Clarke1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Connell Clarke|title=Hashish!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hblBKeAE9rgC|year=1998|publisher=Red Eye Press|isbn=978-0-929349-05-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="étrangères1925"&gt;{{cite book|author=France.

'''Childhood in early modern Scotland''' includes all aspects of the lives of children, from birth to adulthood, between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century. This period corresponds to the [[early modern period]] in Europe, beginning with the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the beginning of [[Economic history of Scotland|industrialisation]] and the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the mid-eighteenth century.

Birth was a predominately female event, although fathers were often present or nearby to assert their paternity. Before the Reformation, baptism was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with [[godparent]]s, but in the [[Church of Scotland|reformed Kirk]] it was used to strengthening relationships between the child and the parents, particularly the father. Among the elite of Highland society, there was a system of [[fosterage]] that created similar links to those of godparenthood. It was common, particularly among richer families, to employ a [[wet-nurse]] to care for the child. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother.

For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service. Boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become [[Farm worker|agricultural servants]]. Girls might go into [[Domestic worker|domestic]] or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling. For the wealthy and sometimes for the very talented, they might move on to one of Scotland's universities. The [[Renaissance Humanist|Humanist]] concern with widening education that had become significant in the Renaissance was shared by Protestant reformers. Boys might attend the grammar schools or ordinary parish schools. There were also large number of unregulated "adventure schools". By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women, vied with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing and much lower literacy rates.

==Birth==

Although sources are limited, Scotland may have had a higher infant mortality rate than England,&lt;ref name="A. Lawrence 2008 p. 384"&gt;A.

Jones, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Oxford: Blackwell John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1405137401}}, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; where rates were higher than in many modern Third-World countries, with 160 children in 1,000 dying in their first year.&lt;ref&gt;A. Wear, ''Knowledge and Practice in English Medicine, 1550–1680'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521558271}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable concern over the safety of mother and child in birth.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.277&gt;E. Ewen, "The early modern family" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0199563691}}, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Although childbirth was a predominantly female event, with neighbours and midwives in support, the father was often present in or near the birthing chamber to assert or admit his paternity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hollander, "The name of the Father": baptism and the social construction of fatherhood in early modern Edinburgh", in E. Ewan and J. Nugent, ''Finding the Family in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), {{ISBN|0754660494}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], baptism was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with [[godparent]]s,&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.278&gt;E. Ewen, "The early modern family" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0199563691}}, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Church of Scotland|reformed Kirk]] godparents were abolished and it was used as a means of strengthening the "natural" relationships with the parents, particularly the father, who would have the primary responsibility for the moral and spiritual education of the child.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hollander, "The name of the Father": baptism and the social construction of fatherhood in early modern Edinburgh", in E. Ewan and J. Nugent, ''Finding the Family in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), {{ISBN|0754660494}}, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the elite of Highland society, there existed a system of [[fosterage]] that created similar links to godparenthood, with children being sent to the households of other major families to facilitate the creation of mutual bonds, and which continued into the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.278/&gt;

==Young children==

Following birth it was common, particularly among richer families, to employ a [[wet-nurse]] to care for the child, sometimes living in with the family.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.278/&gt; In late seventeenth century Edinburgh 6.8 per cent of families employed such a nurse and they were most common among wealthier middle-class households.&lt;ref&gt;R. O'Day, ''Women's Agency in Early Modern Britain and the American Colonies: Patriarchy, Partnership and Patronage'' (London: Pearson Education, 2007), {{ISBN|0582294630}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.277/&gt; The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, but it is not clear how widely these practices were adopted.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.278/&gt; After the Reformation, [[first communion]] probably served as a rite of puberty, marking the transition to sit beside adults at the kirk boards for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;M. Todd. ''The Culture of Protestantism in Early Modern Scotland'' (Yale University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0300092342}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Historians debate whether early modern individuals experienced a period of youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary so that they could build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.279/&gt; Lowland Scotland was part of the pattern of late marriage for both men and women (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower.&lt;ref name="A. Lawrence 2008 p. 384"/&gt; Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into [[Domestic worker|domestic]]&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.279&gt;E. Ewen, "The early modern family" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0199563691}}, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Farmworker|agricultural]] service.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, pp. 86–8.&lt;/ref&gt; For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling. For the wealthy and sometimes for the very talented, they might move on to one of Scotland's universities.&lt;ref name=Ewen2012p.279/&gt; It is clear that football was played by sixteenth-century schoolboys, and probably servants and apprentices, because of widespread attempts to ban it.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Hall, "'Only players'?: playtime, material culture and medieval childhood" in D. M. Hadley, K. A. Hemer, eds, ''Medieval Childhood: Archaeological Approaches'' (Oxbow Books, 2014), {{ISBN|1782977015}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance Humanist|Humanist]] concern with widening education that had become significant in the Renaissance was shared by Protestant reformers.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston, ''Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-521-89088-8}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For boys, in the burghs the old schools were maintained, with the song schools and a number of new foundations becoming reformed grammar schools or ordinary parish schools.

The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women, vied with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the [[catechism]] and even to be able to independently read the Bible, but most commentators, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. In the lower ranks of society, they benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys, often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent, from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Climate Central''' is a nonprofit news organization that analyzes and reports on [[climate science]]. Composed of scientists and science journalists, the organization conducts scientific research on climate change and energy issues, and produces multimedia content that is distributed via their [http://www.climatecentral.org website] and media partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/Climate-Central Scientists and journalists team up to get the climate story straight], [[Grist (magazine)|Gris]]t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/climate_central.php Columbia Journalism Review: A One-Stop Shop for Climate Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sej.org/publications/journalismmedia/new-journalism-science-initiatives-alter-how-news-is-shaped New Journalism-Science Initiatives Alter How News Is Shaped]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flowtv.org/?p=2372 Climate Change TV]&lt;/ref&gt; Climate Central has been featured in many prominent U.S. news sources, including the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, NBC Nightly News, CBS News, CNN, ABC News, Nightline, Time, National Public Radio, PBS, Scientific American, National Geographic, Science, and The Washington Post.

==History==

At an October 2005 conference sponsored by the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]] and held in Aspen, Colorado, more than a hundred scientists, policymakers, journalists, and leaders from business, religion and civil society identified the critical need for a central authoritative source for [[climate change]] information. A broad group of climate experts later confirmed this need during a November 2006 New York meeting convened by [[James Gustave Speth]], Dean of the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. At roughly the same time, in Palo Alto, California, [[The 11th Hour Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11thhourproject.org/partners |title=Grantees |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=11thhourproject.org |publisher=11th Hour Project |access-date=August 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; began organizing with the mission to popularize reliable information about [[Climate change mitigation|global warming solutions]], using the power of Silicon Valley scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors.

These meetings inspired the idea for Climate Central, which took shape early in 2008 with seed money from The Flora Family Foundation and development funds from 11th Hour Project. The founding board included [[Jane Lubchenco]], Steven Pacala and Wendy Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatecentral.org/about/people/#founding_board] Climate Central's Founding Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Central also sponsors classes for meteorologists and provides climate graphics to television stations. This has been credited in part for the increase in acceptance of climate change science among local forecasters and their willingness to share it in their broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink1=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |title=Some Good News on Climate: A Big Shift among TV Weathercasters |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to qualify as a member of the [[European Union]], '''[[Croatia]]''' has taken measures to combat '''corruption'''. The legal and institutional framework as well as government agencies are addressing the issue of corruption in a much larger scale, and the inter-agency cooperation for corruption prevention has also increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformation Index 2014|url=http://www.bti-project.org/|publisher=The Bertelsmann Foundation|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USKOK]] has  prosecuted 2,000 individuals and achieved a 95% conviction rate (2012), including former Prime Minister [[Ivo Sanader]].&lt;ref name=FP150807/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/research/files/Croatia%2520-%2520The%2520Price%2520of%2520Corruption%252C%2520Hrvoje%2520Kresic.pdf|title=CROATIA: THE PRICE OF CORRUPTION|last=Krešić|first=Hrvoje|date=|website=Reuters Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several civil servants in the Croatian Privatization Fund, the Zagreb land registry and the Zagreb taxation headquarters, among others, were arrested on charges of bribery. Moreover, several high-profile corruption cases have come to light, including investigations of a former defence minister and a former deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croatia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/croatia/show-all.aspx|website=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4993">The '''''Curadmír''''' or '''Champion's Portion'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Old Irish]] ''curad'' (genitive of ''caur''), "of a hero, champion, warrior"; ''mír'', "morsel, ration, portion" (''[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]'', Compact Edition, [[Royal Irish Academy]], 1990,  pp. 103, 465); modern Irish ''curadhmhír'' (James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', 1998, pp. 77-78)&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient custom referred to in [[early Irish literature]], whereby the warrior acknowledged as the bravest present at a feast was given precedence and awarded the choicest cut of meat. This was often disputed violently. The custom appears most often in the legends of the [[Ulster Cycle]]. It is parallelled by historical customs of the ancient [[Celt]]s of continental Europe, as recorded by classical writers.

==The Story of Mac Dá Tho's Pig==
The Ulster Cycle saga ''[[The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig|Scéla Mucce Meic Dá Thó]]'' ("The Story of Mac Dá Tho's Pig") features a dispute over the Champion's Portion between warriors of Ulster and Connacht who are guests at a feast in Leinster. They dispute it by boasting of their previous heroic deeds, and eventually the Connacht hero [[Cet mac Mágach]] is acknowledged as the bravest man present. Just as he is about to carve the pig, the Ulster hero [[Conall Cernach]] arrives, and his boasts force Cet to give way to him. But he claims that Conall would have had to give way to his brother Anlúan had he been there. Conall responds by tossing Cet Anlúan's freshly severed head. Conall carves the pig, but gives the Connachtmen such a small portion that battle breaks out between them.&lt;ref&gt;N. Kershaw Chadwick, [http://adminstaff.vassar.edu/sttaylor/MacDatho/ "''Scél Mucci mic Dathó''"], ''An Early Irish Reader'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fled Bricrenn==
Another Ulster Cycle saga which involves the ''Curadmír'' is ''[[Fled Bricrenn]]'' ("Bricriu's Feast"). The notorious troublemaker [[Bricriu]] invites the Ulstermen to a feast. Before it starts he visits three heroes, [[Cúchulainn]], Conall Cernach and [[Lóegaire Búadach]], privately, and advises each of them to claim the Champion's Portion, which at this feast includes not only a roast boar but also a cauldron of wine and a hundred cakes of wheat baked in honey. All three stand up to claim it, and fighting nearly breaks out. To avoid violence the Champion's Portion is shared out among the Ulstermen, and [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] and [[Medb]], king and queen of Connacht, and then [[Cú Roí]] of Munster, are asked to judge the dispute. A series of tests of skill and courage are set, and after each of them Cúchulainn is judged to have won, but Conall and Lóegaire refuse to accept the judgement, and the Champion's Portion goes unawarded. Then, when the three heroes are at [[Emain Macha]], they are visited by a giant churl who challenges them each in turn to behead him, and then allow him to behead them the following day. Lóegaire, Conall and Cúchulainn all behead the churl, who picks up his head and leaves, but Lóegaire and Conall are nowhere to be found when he returns the following day. Only Cúchulainn keeps his side of the bargain. He stretches out his neck for the axe, but the churl spares him in recognition of his courage and honour. He reveals himself as Cú Roí, and announces that the Champion's Portion is indisputably Cúchulainn's.&lt;ref&gt;George Henderson (ed. &amp; trans.), [http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/bricriu_henderson.pdf "''Fled Bricrend'' (The Feast of Bricriu)"], ''Irish Texts Society'' Vol 2, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical references==
[[Athenaeus]], quoting the lost work of the 1st/2nd century BC Greek historian and geographer [[Posidonius]], says that it was formerly the custom among the Celts for the hind quarter of pork to be claimed by the bravest man, and disputes over who this was would be settled by single combat to the death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophists'' [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0254&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide 4.40]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] also says that the Celts gave the best joints of meat to the most distinguished men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Historical Library'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA314,M1 5.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* In the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' comic book [[Slaine the King]], two warriors from Slaine's tribe fight over the hero's portion. Gwalchazad the Ram eventually stabs Dundan Skullsmasher with his knife.&lt;ref&gt;Slaine the King&lt;/ref&gt;
* A less violent quarrel over the hero's portion is featured in [[Asterix in Belgium]]. The two Belgian chiefs threaten to settle their differences with fists, until an equally large portion of meat is brought out.&lt;ref&gt;Asterix in Belgium&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
The migration rate accelerated during the period of 1979 to 1981, this marked the beginning of the civil unrest and the spread of political killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Richard C.|title=Causes of Salvadoran Migration to the United States|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1989|volume=79|issue=2|pages=183|doi=10.2307/215525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total impact of civil wars, dictatorships and socioeconomics drove over a million Salvadorans (both as immigrants and refugees) into the [[Salvadoran American|United States]]; [[Guatemala]] is the second country that hosts more Salvadorans behind the [[United States]], approximately 110,000 Salvadorans according to the national census of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/demografia-y-poblacion/42-demografiaypoblacion/207-infodemo2010|title=Institución|first=Super|last=User|website=Ine.gob.gt|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition small Salvadoran communities sprung up in [[Salvadoran Canadian|Canada]], [[Salvadoran Australian|Australia]], [[Belize]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Italy]], [[Taiwan]]  and [[Sweden]] since the migration trend began in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapa de las Migraciones Salvadoreñas|url=http://www.pnud.org.sv/2007/content/view/1184/122/|website=PNUD El Salvador|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 U.S. Census counted 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, up from 655,165 in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==
Out of the 6,408,111 people in El Salvador, 78% are Mestizo, 12% are of full European descent, 10% Indigenous, 0.8% Black, and 0.64% other.

===Mestizo Salvadorans===

[[File:5o. Feria del Jocote-San Lorenzo, Ahuachapán. (25771696524).jpg|thumb|Young Salvadoran women in [[Ahuachapan]]]]

78% of the population are [[mestizo]], having mixed indigenous and European ancestry.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as [[Afro-Salvadoran]], and the indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have an indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm EL SALVADOR Visa Application - Tourist Visas, Business Visas, Expedited Visas - El Salvador Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201052106/http://travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Salvadorans===

{{legend|#0047AB|Kingdom of the [[Pipil people]]}}
]]
According to the Salvadoran Government, about 10% of the population are of full or partial indigenous origin. The largest most dominant Native American groups in El Salvador are the [[Lenca people]], [[Maya peoples]]: ([[Poqomam people]]/[[Chorti people]]) and [[Pipil people]] followed by small enclaves of [[Cacaopera people]], [[Xinca people]], [[Alaguilac people]], [[Mixe people]], [[Mangue language]] people, as well as an [[Olmec]] past. ([[Pipil people|Pipil]], located in the west and central part of the country, and [[Lenca people|Lenca]], found east of the [[Lempa River]]). There are small populations of [[Cacaopera people]] in the [[Morazán Department]] and a few [[Ch'orti' people]] live in the department of [[Ahuachapán]], near the border of [[Guatemala]].

The number of indigenous people in El Salvador have been criticized by indigenous organizations and academics as too small and accuse the government of denying the existence of indigenous Salvadorans in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ayala|first1=Edgardo|title=Native People of El Salvador Finally Gain Recognition|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/05/native-people-of-el-salvador-finally-gain-recognition/|website=Ipsnews.net|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Salvadoran Indigenous Coordination Council (CCNIS) and CONCULTURA (National Council for Art and Culture at the Ministry of Education ), approximately 600,000 or 10 per cent of Salvadorian peoples are indigenous.&lt;ref name="El Salvador - Indigenous peoples"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Salvador - Indigenous peoples|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-2/|website=Minority rights groups international|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by historically high rates of old-world diseases, absorption into the mestizo population, as well as mass murder during the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]] (or ''La Matanza'') which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 [[peasants]] killed in a short period of time. Many authors note that since ''La Matanza'' the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/central_america/el_salvador/history/military_rule_1931-1979.htm|title=Jose Napoleon Duarte,Hernandez Martinez,Ungo,Matanza,Central American Common Market,CACM,urban middle class,Christian Democratic Party,powerful families,death squads,Organization of American States,PRUD,International Court Of Justice,urban center,rapid population growth|website=Countriesquest.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include [[Sonsonate]] (especially [[Izalco]], [[Nahuizalco]], and [[Santo Domingo, Sonsonate|Santo Domingo]]), [[Cacaopera]], and [[Panchimalco]], in the department of [[San Salvador Department|San Salvador]].&lt;ref name="El Salvador - Indigenous peoples"/&gt;

===White Salvadorans===

[[File:Spanish Conqueror.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] colonizers began settling in El Salvador and taking native wives, producing a high birth rate of mestizo children which make up today's modern Salvadoran population.]]
Some 12% of Salvadorans are [[White Latin American|white]]. This population is mostly made up of ethnically [[Spanish people]], while there are also Salvadorans of [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] descent. In northern departments like the [[Chalatenango Department]], it is well known that residents in the area are of pure Spanish descent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guzman|first1=John|title=Reflections Behind The Retina|date=2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=192|accessdate=27 May 2015}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; settling in the region that is now Chalatenango in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carondelet|url=http://nescribiente.blogspot.com/2010/08/carondelet.html|website=NCH Historias Multimedia|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of San Salvador, [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet]], ordered families from northern Spain ([[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]]) to settle the area to compensate for the lack of indigenous people to work the land; it is not uncommon to see people with blond hair, fair skin, and blue or green eyes in municipalities like [[Dulce Nombre de María]], [[La Palma, Chalatenango|La Palma]], and [[Cerro El Pital|El Pital]].

====Arab Salvadorans====

There is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zielger|first1=Matthew|title=El Salvador: Central American Palestine of the West?|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Art/2004/Apr-27/91857-el-salvador-central-american-palestine-of-the-west.ashx#axzz3EZpwYUKb|website=The Daily Star|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (especially from the area of [[Bethlehem]]), but also from Lebanon. [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Salvadorans of Palestinian descent]] numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanese Diaspora – Worldwide Geographical Distribution|url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution/|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small community of [[History of the Jews in El Salvador|Jews]] who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

===Pardo Salvadoran===

[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. [[Afro-Salvadoran]]s are the descendants of the African population that were enslaved and shipped to El Salvador to work in mines in specific regions of El Salvador. They have mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. Thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have   English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations of the Caribbean, but instead had older colonial African slaves that came straight from Africa. This is the reason why El Salvador is the only country in Central America not to have a caribbeanized culture, and instead preserved its classical Central America culture.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Prehistory==
The earliest evidence of inhabitants in present-day [[Lithuania]] dates back to 10,000 BC. Between 3000 and 2000 BC, the people of the [[Corded Ware culture]] spread over a vast region of eastern Europe, between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Vistula River]] in the West and the [[Moscow]]–[[Kursk]] line in the East. Merging with the [[indigenous peoples]], they gave rise to the [[Balts]], a distinct [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ethnic group whose descendants are the present-day [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian people|Latvian]] nations and the former [[Old Prussians]].

==Historical demographics==

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
:''See also: [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania#Demographics|Demographics]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania#Languages|Languages of Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Historical demography of Poland#Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)|Demographics of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''
[[File:Lithuanian language in the 16th century.png|thumb|250px|Area of the [[Lithuanian language]] in the 16th century]]
The [[name of Lithuania]] – ''Lithuanians'' – was first mentioned in 1009. Among its etymologies there are a derivation from the word ''Lietava'', for a small river, a possible derivation from a word [[leičiai]], but most probable is the name for union of Lithuanian ethnic tribes ('susilieti, lietis' means to unite and the word 'lietuva' means something which has been united).

The primary Lithuanian state, the Duchy of Lithuania, emerged in the territory of [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lietuva]], the ethnic homeland of Lithuanians. At the birth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL), ethnic Lithuanians made up about 70% of the population.&lt;ref name="Letukienė"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Letukienė|first1=Nijolė|last2=Gineika|first2=Petras|title=Istorija. Politologija: kurso santrauka istorijos egzaminui|publisher=Alma littera|location=Vilnius|year=2003|page=182.|language=lt}} Statistical numbers, probably accepted in historiography (the sources, their treatment, the procedure of counting is not discussed in this book) are given, according which in 1260 there were about 0.27 million Lithuanians of 0.4 million of a whole population; in percentage: 67,5%.&lt;/ref&gt; With the acquisition of new [[Ruthenia]]n territories, this proportion decreased to 50% and later to 30%. By the time of the largest expansion towards [[Kievan Rus']] lands, at the end of the 13th and during the 14th century, the territory of the GDL was about 800,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 10% was ethnically Lithuanian.&lt;ref name=wiemer&gt;Bjorn Wiemer, ''Dialect and language contacts on the territory of the Grand Duchy from the 15th century until 1939'', Kurt Braunmüller, Gisella Ferraresi, ''Aspects of multilingualism in European language history'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, {{ISBN|90-272-1922-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7KraXiQo_uIC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;vq=Grand+Duchy+of+Lithuania&amp;dq=demographics+%22Grand+Duchy+of+Lithuania%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.109; 125]&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic Lithuanian population is estimated to have been 420,000 out of 1.4 million in 1375 (the territory was about 700,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and 550,000 out of 3.8 million in 1490 (territory: 850,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Letukienė, N., Istorija. Politologija: kurso santrauka istorijos egzaminui, 2003, p. 182. There can be found also different numbers, for example: Kevin O'Connor, ''The history of the Baltic States'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, {{ISBN|0-313-32355-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=million+%22Grand+Duchy%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA17,M1 Google Print, p.17]. Here author estimates that there were 9 millions of inhabitants in GDL, and 1 million of them were ethnic Lithuanians by 1387.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruthenians were only nowadays Ukrainians and the whole Belarus including Smolensk and Mozhaisk Galindians were of Lithuanian ethnicity (belonging to the same family as Prussians or Latvians).{{Dubious|date=April 2012}} In addition to the Ruthenians and Lithuanians, other significant ethnic groups throughout GDL were [[Lithuanian Jews|Jews]] and [[Tatars]]. The combined population of Poland and GDL in 1493 is estimated as 7.5 million, of whom 3.25 million were Poles, 3.75 million Ruthenians and 0.5 million Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="Pogonowski"&gt;Based on 1493 population map (p.92) from [[Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski]], ''Poland a Historical Atlas'', Hippocrene Books, 1987, {{ISBN|0-88029-394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Union of Lublin]] Lithuanian Grand Duchy lost large part of lands to the Polish Crown (see [[Historical demography of Poland#Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth .281569–1795.29|demographics]] of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). An ethnic Lithuanian proportion being about 1/4 in GDL after the Union of Lublin was held till the [[Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|partitions]]. There was much devastation and population loss throughout the GDL in the mid and late 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Jarmo Kotilaine, ''Russia's foreign trade and economic expansion in the seventeenth century: windows on the world'', BRILL, 2005, {{ISBN|90-04-13896-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=57LnE5DO2rQC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=demographics+%22Grand+Duchy+of+Lithuania%22&amp;as_brr=3#PPA45,M1 Google Print, p.45]&lt;/ref&gt; including the ethnic Lithuanian population in [[Vilnius voivodeship]]. Besides devastation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} the Ruthenian population declined proportionally{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} after the territorial losses to the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1770 there were about 4.84 million inhabitants in GDL, of which the largest ethnic group were Ruthenians, about 1.39 million – Lithuanians.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref name="Letukienė"/&gt; The [[voivodeship]]s with a majority ethnic Lithuanian population were [[Vilnius voivodeship|Vilnius]], [[Trakai voivodeship|Trakai]] and [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitian]] voivodeships, and these three voivodeships comprised the political center of the state. In the southern angle of Trakai voivodeship and south-eastern part of Vilnius voivodeship there were also many Belarusians; in some of the south-eastern areas they were the major linguistic group.

The Ruthenian population formed a majority in GDL from the time of the GDL's expansion in the mid 14th century; and the adjective "Lithuanian", besides denoting ethnic Lithuanians, from early times denoted any inhabitant of GDL, including Slavs and Jews.

The [[Ruthenian language]], corresponding to today's [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], was then called [[Kievan Rus'|Russian]], and was used as one of the chancellery{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} languages by Lithuanian monarchs. However, there are fewer extant documents written in this language than those written in Latin and German from the time of [[Vytautas]]. Later, Ruthenian became the main language of documentation and writing. In the years that followed, it was the main language of government until the introduction of [[Polish language|Polish]] as the chancellery language of the Lithuanian–Polish Commonwealth in 1697; however there are also examples of documents written in Ruthenian from the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Zinkevičius"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://viduramziu.istorija.net/socium/zinkevicius1995.htm Lietuvos Didžiosios kunigaikštystės kanceliarinės slavų kalbos termino nusakymo problema] Z. Zinkevičius&lt;/ref&gt; The Lithuanian language was used orally in Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitian voivodeships, and by small numbers of people elsewhere. At the court of [[Zygmunt August]], the last king of the Duchy, both Polish and Lithuanian were spoken.&lt;ref name="Stone3"&gt;Daniel. Z Stone, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;vq=Lithuanian&amp;dq=%22official+language%22+Poland+Lithuania&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 A History of East Central Europe]'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Empire===
After the [[Partitions of Poland|Third Partition]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] on October 24, 1795, between the [[Russian empire|Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Austria]], the Commonwealth ceased to exist and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] became a part of the [[Russian empire]]. After the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] in 1861, the use of the Polish language noticeably increased in eastern Lithuania and western Belarus.&lt;ref name=wiemer/&gt; Many Lithuanians, living further east, were unable to receive the Lithuanian printed books smuggled into Lithuania by [[knygnešiai]] during the time of [[Lithuanian press ban|the ban on printing books]] in the Latin alphabet, and they switched to Polish. Although this also used the Latin alphabet, it was much less affected by the ban, because Polish was still used by the politically important class of the nobility, and also used predominantly in the biggest towns of Lithuania, and supported by the church.

===National Revival===
The [[Lithuanian National Revival]] had begun to intensify by the end of the 19th century, and the number of Lithuanian speakers and people identifying themselves as ethnic Lithuanians started to increase; but at the same time many Polish speaking Lithuanians, especially former ''[[szlachta]]'', cut themselves adrift from the Lithuanian nation. There were population losses due to several border changes, [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania|Soviet deportations]], [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|the Holocaust of the Lithuanian Jews]], and [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|German]] and [[Repatriation of Poles (1955–59)|Polish repatriations]] during and after [[World War II]]. After World War II, the ethnic Lithuanian population remained stable: 79.3% in 1959 to 83.5% in 2002. Lithuania's citizenship law and the [[Constitution of Lithuania|Constitution]] meet international and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] standards, guaranteeing universal human and civil rights.

==Ethnic composition==

{{Details|Ethnic minorities in Lithuania}}
[[Lithuanians]] are neither [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nor [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], although the union with [[Poland]], [[Germanic peoples|German]] and [[Russia]]n colonization and settlement left cultural and religious influences.

===After World War II===

Among the [[baltic states]], Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.4% of the population identified themselves as [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], 6.7% as [[Poles]], 6.3% as [[Russians]], 1.2% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.3% as members of other ethnic groups. 
[[File:Poles distribution in Lithuania, 2001 census.png|thumb|right|Number of [[Poles]] in Lithuania]]
[[File:Lithuanians in Lithuania by majority and minority by muncipality.png|thumb|right|Ethnic map of Lithuania]]
Poles are concentrated in the [[Vilnius Region]], the area controlled by Poland in the interwar period. There are especially large [[Poles in Lithuania|Polish communities]] in [[Vilnius district municipality]] (52% of the population) and [[Šalčininkai district municipality]] (77.8%). The [[Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania]], an ethnic minority political party, has strong influence in these areas and has representation in the [[Seimas]]. The party is most active in local politics and controls several municipal councils.

Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and lack strong political cohesion. The most prominent community lives in [[Visaginas]] (52%). Most of them are scientists who moved with their families from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] to work at the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]]. A number of ethnic Russians (mostly military) left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.

Another major change in the ethnic composition of Lithuania was the extermination of the [[Jew]]ish population during [[the Holocaust]]. Before [[World War II]] about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvaks]] and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, sometimes nicknamed Northern [[Jerusalem]], was about 30% Jewish. Almost all of these Jews were killed during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation, or later emigrated to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Now there are only about 4,000 Jews living in Lithuania.

== Citizenship ==
Lithuania's membership of the [[European Union]] has made Lithuanian citizenship all the more appealing. Lithuanian [[citizenship]] is theoretically easier (see court ruling notes below) to obtain than that of many other European countries—only one great-grandparent is necessary to become a Lithuanian citizen. Persons who held citizenship in the Republic of Lithuania prior to June 15, 1940, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren (provided that these persons did not repatriate) are eligible for Lithuanian citizenship [http://www.lithuanianembassy.ca/documents/Lithuanian%20citizenship%20information.pdf].
 
Lithuanian citizens are allowed to travel and work throughout the [[European Union]] without a visa or other restrictions.

===Dual citizenship ruled unconstitutional===

The Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled in November 2006 that a number of provisions of the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on citizenship are in conflict with the Lithuanian Constitution. In particular, the court ruled that a number of current provisions of the Citizenship Law implicitly or explicitly allowing dual citizenship are in conflict with the Constitution; such provisions amounted to the unconstitutional practice of making dual citizenship a common phenomenon rather than a rare exception. '''The provisions of the Citizenship Law announced unconstitutional are no longer valid and applicable to the extent stated by the Constitutional Court.'''

The Lithuanian Parliament amended the Citizenship Law substantially as a result of this court ruling, allowing dual Citizenship for children of at least one Lithuanian parent that are born abroad, but preventing Lithuanians from keeping their Lithuanian citizenship after obtaining citizenship of another country.

There are some special cases still permitting dual citizenship.  See [[Lithuanian nationality law]].

The [[Lithuanian language]] is the country's sole official language countrywide. It is the first language of almost 85% of population and is also spoken by 286,742 out of 443,514 non-Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;[http://osp.stat.gov.lt/documents/10180/217110/Gyv+pagal+i%C5%A1silavinima_ir_kalbu_mokejima.pdf Census 2011: GYVENTOJAI PAGAL IŠSILAVINIMĄ IR KALBŲ MOKĖJIMĄ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet era had imposed the official use of Russian, so most adult Lithuanians speak Russian as a second language, while the Polish population generally speaks Polish. Russians who immigrated after World War II speak Russian as their first language. The younger generation usually speaks English as their second language, while a substantial portion of the total population (37%) speak at least two foreign languages. According to census of 2011, 30% of the population can speak English.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;

Approximately 14,800 pupils started their 2012 school year in schools where the curriculum is conducted in Russian (down from 76,000 in 1991), and about 12,300 enrolled in Polish schools (compared to 11,400 in 1991 and 21,700 in 2001). There are also schools in the [[Belarusian language]], as well as in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://osp.stat.gov.lt/en/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?id=1243&amp;status=A General school pupils], Statistics Lithuania&lt;/ref&gt;

Some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime (symbolised by the [[Hill of Crosses]]).

In the first half of the 20th century, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant church had around 200,000 members, 9% of the total population, mostly Protestant Lithuanians from the former Memel Territory and Germans, but it has declined since 1945. Small Protestant communities are dispersed throughout the northern and western parts of the country. Believers and clergy suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation, with many killed, tortured or deported to Siberia. Various Protestant churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.2012693/k.AEBE/United_Methodists_evangelize_in_Lithuania_with_ads_brochures.htm |title=United Methodists evangelize in Lithuania with ads, brochures |publisher=Umc.org |date= 11 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4.1% are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], 0.8% are [[Old Believers]] (both mainly among the Russian minority), 0.8% are Protestant and 6.1% have [[irreligion|no religion]].

==Literacy and education==
{{Main article|Education in Lithuania}}
According to the 2011 census, only around 0.2% of the Lithuanian population aged 10 and over were illiterate, the majority of them in rural areas. The proportion is similar for males and females.&lt;ref name="EducationStats"&gt;Statistics Lithuania, 2011 Census, [http://www.osp.stat.gov.lt/en/web/guest/pranesimai-spaudai?eventId=1699 Population by educational attainment and command of languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

The general education system in Lithuania consists of primary, basic, secondary and tertiary education. Primary, basic and secondary (or high school) education is free of charge to all residents and is compulsory for pupils under 16 years of age.&lt;ref name="LowerSecondary"&gt;Ministry of Education and Science, Education, [http://www.smm.lt/web/en/education_1/lower-secondary-education Lower secondary education]&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-primary education is also available free of charge to 5-year-old or 6-year-old children but is not compulsory. Pre-primary schooling is attended by about 90% of pre-school age children in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education and Science, Education, [http://www.smm.lt/web/en/education_1/pre_school Pre-school education]&lt;/ref&gt; Primary, basic and secondary education in Lithuania is available to some ethnic minorities in their native languages, including Polish, Russian and Belarusian.

Primary schooling ({{lang-lt|pradinis ugdymas}}) is available to kids that have reached 7 years of age (or younger, should the parents so desire) and lasts four years. Primary school students are not assessed through a grade system, instead using oral or written feedback. Students begin studying their first foreign language in their second year of primary school.&lt;ref name="EducationSystem"&gt;Government of the Republic of Lithuania, The Official Gateway of Lithuania, [http://www.lietuva.lt/en/education_sience/education/education_system Education System]&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the 2011 census showed that 99.1% of the population aged 20 and older have attained at least primary education, while around 27,000 pupils started the first grade in 2012.&lt;ref name="EducCensus"&gt;Statistics Lithuania, 2011 Census, [http://www.osp.stat.gov.lt/documents/10180/217110/Population_educ_att_age_group_municipality.xls Population by educational attainment, age group and municipality]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic education ({{lang-lt|pagrindinis ugdymas}}) covers grades 5 to 10. It is provided by basic, secondary, youth, vocational schools and gymnasiums. After completing the 10th grade, the students must take the basic education achievement test in the Lithuanian language, mathematics, and an elective basic education achievement test in Mother Tongue (Belarusian, Polish, Russian or German).&lt;ref name="LowerSecondary" /&gt; In 2011, 90.9% of the population of Lithuania aged 20 or older had attained the basic level of education.&lt;ref name="EducCensus" /&gt;

Secondary education ({{lang-lt|vidurinis ugdymas}}) in Lithuania is optional and available to students who have attained basic education. It covers two years (11-12th grades in secondary schools and 3-4th grades in gymnasiums). At this level, students have the opportunity to adapt their study plans (subjects and study level) to their individual preferences.&lt;ref name="EducationSystem" /&gt; Secondary education is completed upon passing national [[matura]] examinations. Matura examinations consist of as many as six separate examinations of which two (Lithuanian Language and Literature and one elective subject) are required to attain the diploma. As of 2011, 78.2% of the population of Lithuania aged 20 or older had attained the secondary level of education, including secondary education provided by vocational schools.&lt;ref name="EducCensus" /&gt;

More than 60% of the graduates from secondary school every year choose to continue education at colleges and universities of the Lithuanian higher education system. As of 2013, there were 23 universities (including academies and business schools recognized as such) and 24 colleges operating in Lithuania. Vilnius University, founded in 1579, is the oldest and largest university in Lithuania. More than 48,000 students enrolled to all higher education programmes in Lithuania in 2011, including level I (professional bachelor and bachelor), level II (masters) and level III (doctorate) studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania, [http://www.smm.lt/uploads/documents/Teises_aktai/Lietuvos%20svietimas%20skaiciais%202012.%20Studijos.pdf Lietuvos švietimas skaičiais, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education in Lithuania is partly state-funded, with free-of-charge access to higher education constitutionally guaranteed to students deemed "good". There are also stipends available to the best students.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}
'''Dual diagnosis''' (also called '''co-occurring disorders''', '''COD''', or '''dual pathology''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report to Congress on the prevention and treatment of co-occurring substance abuse disorders and mental disorders |publisher=[[SAMHSA]] |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/reports/congress2002/chap1ucod.htm |date=November 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casas M. Trastornos duales. Vallejo Ruiloba J, Gastó Ferrer C (eds). Trastornos afectivos: ansiedad y depresión (2ª ed). Barcelona, Masson; 2000:890-899.&lt;/ref&gt; is the  condition of suffering from a [[mental illness]] and a [[comorbid]] [[substance abuse problem]].  There is considerable debate surrounding the appropriateness of using a single category for a [[heterogeneous]] group of individuals with complex needs and a varied range of problems. The concept can be used broadly, for example depression and alcoholism, or it can be restricted to specify severe mental illness (e.g. [[psychosis]], [[schizophrenia]]) and substance misuse disorder (e.g. [[cannabis abuse]]), or a person who has a milder mental illness and a drug dependency, such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and is [[opioid dependency|dependent on opioids]].  Diagnosing a primary psychiatric illness in substance abusers is challenging as drug abuse itself often induces psychiatric symptoms, thus making it necessary to differentiate between substance induced and pre-existing mental illness.

Those with co-occurring disorders face complex challenges.  They have increased rates of relapse, hospitalization, [[homelessness]], and [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]] infection compared to those with either mental or substance use disorders alone.&lt;ref name=senate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committe/391/soci/rep/pdf/rep02may06part1-e.pdf |title=Out of the Shadows at Last: Transforming Mental Health, Mental Illness and Addictions Services in Canada |author=Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science, and Technology |year=2006 |publisher= Government of Canada |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiating pre-existing and substance induced==
The identification of substance-induced versus independent psychiatric symptoms or disorders has important treatment implications and often constitutes a challenge in daily clinical practice. Similar patterns of comorbidity and risk factors in individuals with substance induced disorder and those with independent non-substance induced psychiatric symptoms suggest that the two conditions may share underlying etiologic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco 2012 p. 865-873.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness, which can make it difficult to differentiate between substance induced psychiatric syndromes and pre-existing mental health problems. More often than not psychiatric disorders among drug or alcohol abusers disappear with prolonged abstinence. Substance induced psychiatric symptoms can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or [[major depression|depression]] after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Abuse of [[hallucinogens]] can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and [[cannabis]] may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to [[dysthymia]]. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate sustained use of alcohol may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. A [[protracted withdrawal syndrome]] can also occur with psychiatric and other symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Among the currently prevalent medications, [[benzodiazepines]] are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective epidemiological studies do not support the hypotheses that comorbidity of substance use disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances.&lt;ref&gt;Frisher 2005 p. 847-850.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet emphasis is often on the effects of substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of [[neuronal]] plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.

Research instruments are also often insufficiently sensitive to discriminate between independent, true dual pathology, and substance-induced symptoms. Structured instruments, as Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener-GAIN-SS and Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV-PRISM,&lt;ref&gt;Hasin 2006 p. 689-696&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed to increase the diagnostic validity. While structured instruments can help organize diagnostic information, clinicians must still make judgments on the origin of symptoms.

==Prevalence==
Comorbidity of addictive disorders and other psychiatric disorders, i.e., dual disorders, is very common&lt;ref&gt;Adamson 2006 p. 164-170; Hasin et al, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a large body of literature has accumulated demonstrating that mental disorders are strongly associated with substance use disorders. The 2011 USA National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 17.5% of adults with a mental illness had a co-occurring substance use disorder; this works out to 7.98 million people.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA 2012"/&gt;  Estimates of co-occurring disorders in Canada are even higher, with an estimated 40-60% of adults with a severe and persistent mental illness experiencing a substance use disorder in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/adp-apd/bp_disorder-mp_concomitants/bp_concurrent_mental_health-eng.pdf |title=Best Practices: Concurrent Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders |author=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Kessler et al. in the United States attempting to assess the [[prevalence]] of dual diagnosis found that 47% of clients with schizophrenia had a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder was significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness than in those without a psychotic illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC |author2=McGonagle KA |author3=Zhao S |author4=Nelson CB |author5=Hughes M |author6=Eshleman S |author7=Wittchen HU |author8=Kendler KS  |year=1994 |title=Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders in the United States. Results from the National Comorbidity Survey |journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=8–19 |pmid=8279933 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1994.03950010008002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Regier DA |author2=Farmer ME |author3=Rae DS |author4=Locke BZ |author5=Keith SJ |author6=Judd LL |author7=Goodwin FK  |year=1990 |title=Comorbidity of mental disorders with alcohol and other drug abuse. Results from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=264 |issue=19 |pages=2511–18 |pmid=2232018 |doi=10.1001/jama.264.19.2511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study looked at the extent of substance misuse in a group of 187 chronically mentally ill patients living in the community. According to the clinician's ratings, around a third of the sample used [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[street drug]]s, or both during the six months before evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drake RE |author2=Wallach MA |year=1993 |title=Moderate drinking among people with severe mental illness |journal=Hospital &amp; Community Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=780–2 |pmid=8375841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further UK studies have shown slightly more moderate rates of substance misuse among mentally ill individuals. One study found that individuals suffering from schizophrenia showed just a 7% prevalence of problematic drug use in the year prior to being interviewed and 21% reported problematic use some time before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cantwell |first1=R |author2=Scottish Comorbidity Study Group |year=2003 |title=Substance use and schizophrenia: effects on symptoms, social functioning and service use |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=182 |issue=4 |pages=324–9 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/182/4/324 |pmid=12668408 |accessdate=26 February 2008 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.182.4.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright and colleagues identified individuals with psychotic illnesses who had been in contact with services in the London borough of [[Croydon]] over the previous 6 months. Cases of alcohol or substance misuse and dependence were identified through [[structured interview|standardized interviews]] with clients and keyworkers. Results showed that prevalence rates of dual diagnosis were 33% for the use of any substance, 20% for alcohol misuse only and 5% for drug misuse only.{{clarify|reason=Is this current use at the time of the study?|date=April 2013}} A lifetime history of any illicit drug use was observed in 35% of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright S |author2=Gournay K |author3=Glorney E |author4=Thornicroft G  |year=2000 |title=Dual diagnosis in the suburbs: prevalence, need, and in-patient service use |journal=[[Social Psychiatry &amp; Psychiatric Epidemiology]] |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=297–304 |pmid=11016524 |doi=10.1007/s001270050242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Substance use disorders can be confused with other psychiatric disorders. There are diagnoses for substance-induced mood disorders and substance-induced anxiety disorders and thus such overlap can be complicated. For this reason, the [[DSM-IV]] advises that diagnoses of primary [[psychiatric]] disorders not be made in the absence of [[sobriety]] (of duration sufficient to allow for any substance-induced [[Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome|post-acute-withdrawal]] symptoms to dissipate) up to 1 year.

==Treatment==
Only a small proportion of those with co-occurring disorders actually receive treatment for both disorders. Therefore, it was argued that a new approach is needed to enable clinicians, researchers and managers to offer adequate assessment and evidence-based treatments to patients with dual pathology, who cannot be adequately and efficiently managed by cross-referral between psychiatric and addiction services as currently configured and resourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weaver T, Madden P, Charles V ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Comorbidity of substance misuse and mental illness in community mental health and substance misuse services | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 183 | issue = | pages = 304–313 | doi=10.1192/bjp.183.4.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, it was estimated that only 12.4% of American adults with co-occurring disorders were receiving both mental health and addictions treatment.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k11MH_FindingsandDetTables/2K11MHFR/NSDUHmhfr2011.htm |title=Results from the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Mental Health Findings |author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2012 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clients with co-occurring disorders face challenges accessing treatment, as they may be excluded from mental health services if they admit to a substance abuse problem, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=senate/&gt;

There are multiple approaches to treating concurrent disorders.  Partial treatment involves treating only the disorder that is considered primary.  Sequential treatment involves treating the primary disorder first, and then treating the secondary disorder after the primary disorder has been stabilized.  Parallel treatment involves the client receiving mental health services from one provider, and addictions services from another.&lt;ref name=senate/&gt;

Integrated treatment involves a seamless blending of interventions into a single coherent treatment package developed with a consistent philosophy and approach among care providers.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drake RE Mueser KT Brunette MR McHugo GJ |year=2004 |title=A Review of Treatments for People with Severe Mental Illness and Co-Occurring Substance Use Disorders |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=360–374 |doi=10.2975/27.2004.360.374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Sciacca&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sciacca|first= K |year=2009 |title=Best Practices for Dual Diagnosis Treatment and Program Development: Co-occurring Mental Illness and Substance Disorders in Various Combinations|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21801032/BestPracticesForDualDiagnosisTreatment-ProgramDevelopment-Co-occurring-Mental-Illness-Substance-Disorders-Kathleen-Sciacca-2009|journal= The Praeger International Collection on Addictions, Editor, Angela Brown-Miller, Vol. 3, Chapter 9, Pgs. 161-188, Praeger, Westport, CT. London.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this approach, both disorders are considered primary.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA COCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//PHD1132/PHD1132.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081559/http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//PHD1132/PHD1132.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 October 2014 |title=Overarching Principles to Address the Needs of Persons with Co-Occurring Disorders |author=Center for Co-Occurring Disorders |year=2006 |publisher=Substance and Mental Health Services Administration |accessdate=5 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Integrated treatment can improve accessibility, service individualization, engagement in treatment, treatment compliance, mental health symptoms, and overall outcomes.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&amp;sectionid=1675010 |title=Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Substance Use Disorders, 2nd ed |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2006 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rush&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsa.ca/ceca/pdf/Main-reportFINALa.pdf |title=On the Intregation of Mental Health and Substance Use Services and Systems: Main Report |author=Rush B Fobb B Nadeau L Furlong A |year=2008 |publisher=Canadian Executive Council on Addictions |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States describes integrated treatment as being in the best interests or clients, programs, funders, and systems.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA COCE"/&gt;  Green suggested that treatment should be integrated, and a collaborative process between the treatment team and the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Green MD |title=Development of a Dual Disorders Program Methodology for Better Outcomes |journal=Psychiatric Times |date=19 March 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1390341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, recovery should to be viewed as a marathon rather than a sprint, and methods and outcome goals should be explicit.

Although many patients may reject medications as antithetical to substance-abuse recovery and side effects, they can be useful to reduce paranoia, anxiety, and craving.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Medications that have proven effective include opioid replacement therapies, such as lifelong maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine, to minimize risk of relapse, fatality, and legal trouble amongst opioid addicts, as well as helping with cravings, [[baclofen]] for alcoholics, opioid addicts, cocaine addicts, and amphetamine addicts, to help eliminate drug cravings, and [[clozapine]], the first atypical [[antipsychotic]], which appears to reduce illicit drug use amongst stimulant addicts. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Clozapine can cause respiratory arrest when combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids, so it is not recommended to use in these groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Theories of dual diagnosis==
There are a number of theories that explain the relationship between mental illness and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mueser KT |author2=Essock SM |author3=Drake RE |author4=Wolfe RS |author5=Frisman L  |year=2001 |title=Rural and urban differences in patients with a dual diagnosis |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=93–107 |pmid= 11278157 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(00)00065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causality===
The causality theory suggests that certain types of substance abuse may causally lead to mental illness.

===Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder===
One in four people who have a substance use disorder also have [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]],&lt;ref name="van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen | first1 = K. | last2 = van de Glind | first2 = G. | last3 = van den Brink | first3 = W. | last4 = Smit | first4 = F. | last5 = Crunelle | first5 = CL. | last6 = Swets | first6 = M. | last7 = Schoevers | first7 = RA. | title = Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in substance use disorder patients: a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis. | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 122 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 11–9 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.12.007 | PMID = 22209385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes the treatment of both conditions more difficult. ADHD is associated with an increased craving for drugs.&lt;ref name="Frodl-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Frodl | first1 = T. | title = Comorbidity of ADHD and Substance Use Disorder (SUD): a neuroimaging perspective. | journal = J Atten Disord | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–20 |date=Sep 2010 | doi = 10.1177/1087054710365054 | PMID = 20495160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having ADHD makes it more likely that an individual will initiate substance misuse at a younger age than their peers.&lt;ref name="Upadhyaya-2007"/&gt; They are also more likely to have a poorer outcome, such as longer time to remission, and increased psychiatric complications from substance misuse.&lt;ref name="Frodl-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upadhyaya-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Upadhyaya | first1 = HP. | title = Managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the presence of substance use disorder. | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 68 Suppl 11 | pages = 23–30 | year = 2007 | PMID = 18307378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While generally stimulant medications do not seem to worsen substance misuse, they are known to be abused in some cases. Psychosocial therapy and/or nonstimulant medications and extended release stimulants are ADHD treatment options that reduce these risks.&lt;ref name="Upadhyaya-2007"/&gt;

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Unlike ADHD, which significantly increases the risk of substance use disorder, autism spectrum disorder has the opposite effect of significantly reducing the risk of substance abuse. This is because introversion, inhibition and lack of sensation seeking personality traits, which are typical of autism spectrum disorder, protect against substance abuse and thus substance abuse levels are low in individuals who are on the  autism spectrum.&lt;ref name="Ramos-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ramos | first1 = M. | last2 = Boada | first2 = L. | last3 = Moreno | first3 = C. | last4 = Llorente | first4 = C. | last5 = Romo | first5 = J. | last6 = Parellada | first6 = M. | title = Attitude and risk of substance use in adolescents diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume =  133| issue =  2| pages =  535–40|date=Aug 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.07.022 | PMID = 23962420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain forms of substance abuse, especially alcohol abuse, can cause or worsen certain neuropsychological symptoms which are common to autism spectrum disorder, such as impaired [[social skills]] due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by [[alcohol abuse]] include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and [[theory of mind]] deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers.&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Uekermann J, Daum I |title=Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction?|journal=Addiction|volume=103|issue=5|pages=726–35|date=May 2008|pmid=18412750|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling===
The inclusion of behavioral addictions like pathological gambling must change our way of understanding and dealing with addictions. Pathological (disordered) gambling has commonalities in clinical expression, etiology, comorbidity, physiology and treatment with substance use disorders (DSM-5). A challenge is to understand the development of compulsivity at a neurochemical level not only for drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sellman D | year = 2009 | title = The 10 most important things known about addiction | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 6–13 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02673.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past exposure to psychiatric medications theory===
The past exposure theory suggests that [[Exposure to toxins|exposure]] to psychiatric medication alters neural [[synapses]], introducing an [[:wikt:imbalance|imbalance]] that was not previously present.  Discontinuation of the drug is expected to result in symptoms of psychiatric illness which resolve once the drug is restarted.&lt;ref name="robertwhitaker.org"&gt;http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Anatomy%20of%20an%20Epidemic.html&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that while it may appear that the medication is working, it is only treating a disorder caused by the medication itself.&lt;ref name="robertwhitaker.org"/&gt; New exposure to psychiatric medication may lead to heightened sensitivity to the effects of drugs and alcohol, which has a deteriorating effect on the patient.&lt;ref&gt;http://knowledgeisnecessity.blogspot.com/2010/11/supersensitivity-psychosis-evidence.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahrp.org/risks/biblio0100.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb05477.x | volume=81 | title=Neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis in patients with bipolar affective disorder | journal= [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | pages=437–440 | author=Steiner W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=232&amp;Itemid=37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-medication theory===
The [[self-medication]] theory suggests that people with severe mental illnesses misuse substances in order to relieve a specific set of symptoms and counter the negative side-effects of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic medication]].&lt;ref name=Khantzian&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khantzian EJ |year=1997 |title=The self-medication hypothesis of substance use disorders: a reconsideration and recent applications |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=231–44 |pmid=9385000 |doi=10.3109/10673229709030550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khantizan proposes that substances are not randomly chosen, but are specifically selected for their effects. For example, using stimulants such as [[nicotine]] or [[amphetamine]]s can be used to combat the [[sedation]] that can be caused by higher doses of certain types of antipsychotic medication.&lt;ref name=Khantzian/&gt; Conversely, some people taking medications with a [[stimulant]] effect such as the [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]] antidepressants Effexor ([[venlafaxine]]) or Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) may seek out [[benzodiazepines]] or [[opioid]] [[narcotics]] to counter the [[anxiety]] and [[insomnia]] that such medications sometimes evoke.

Some studies show that nicotine administration can be effective for reducing motor side-effects of antipsychotics, with both [[bradykinesia]]&lt;ref name=pmid12377405&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang YK, Nelson L, Kamaraju L, Wilson W, McEvoy JP |title=Nicotine decreases bradykinesia-rigidity in haloperidol-treated patients with schizophrenia |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=684–6 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12377405 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(02)00325-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (stiff muscles) and [[dyskinesia]]&lt;ref name=pmid15008806&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silvestri S, Negrete JC, Seeman MV, Shammi CM, Seeman P |title=Does nicotine affect D2 receptor upregulation?

===Alleviation of dysphoria theory===
The alleviation of [[dysphoria]] theory suggests that people with severe mental illness commonly have a negative [[self-image]], which makes them vulnerable to using [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] to alleviate these feelings. Despite the existence of a wide range of dysphoric feelings ([[anxiety]], depression, [[boredom]], and [[loneliness]]), the literature on self-reported reasons for use seems to lend support for the experience of these feelings being the primary motivator for drug and alcohol misuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pristach CA |author2=Smith CM |year=1996 |title=Self-reported effects of alcohol use on symptoms of schizophrenia |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=421–3 |pmid=8689377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple risk factor theory===
Another theory is that there may be shared risk factors that can lead to both substance abuse and mental illness. Mueser hypothesizes that these may include factors such as [[social isolation]], poverty, lack of structured daily activity, lack of adult role responsibility, living in areas with high drug availability, and association with people who already misuse drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, J.C. &amp; Helzer, J.E. 1991, "Syndromes of drug abuse and dependence", in Psychiatric Disorders in America: The Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study, L.N. Robins &amp; D.A. Regier, eds., Free Press, New York, pp. 116–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berman, S |author2=Noble, EP |year=1993 |title=Childhood antecedents of substance misuse |journal=[[Current Opinion in Psychiatry]] |volume=6 |pages=382–7 |doi=10.1097/00001504-199306000-00012 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence suggests that [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] life events, such as sexual [[abuse]], are associated with the development of psychiatric problems and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, S., Clancy, C., &amp; Crome, I. 2002, "Co-existing Problems of Mental Disorder and Substance Misuse (dual diagnosis). An Information Manual. Found at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk", Royal College of Psychiatrists' Research Unit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The supersensitivity theory===
The supersensitivity theory&lt;ref name=mueser_AB&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mueser KT |author2=Drake RE |author3=Wallach MA  |year=1998 |title=Dual diagnosis: a review of etiological theories |journal=[[Addictive Behaviors]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=717–34 |pmid=9801712 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(98)00073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that certain individuals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] life events.  These interact with stressful life events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance abuse may increase it, causing the individual to be more likely to experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances.  These individuals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.

Although there are limitations in the research studies conducted in this area, namely that most have focused primarily on schizophrenia, this theory provides an explanation of why relatively low levels of substance misuse often result in negative consequences for individuals with severe mental illness.&lt;ref name=mueser_AB/&gt;

==Avoiding categorical diagnosis==
Current nosological approach does not provide a framework for internal (sub-threshold symptoms) or external (comorbidity) heterogeneity of the different [[diagnostic]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;Szerman N, Martinez-Raga J, Peris L. et al. Rethinking Dual Disorders. Addictive Disorders &amp; Their Treatment. Epub ahead August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing "Neo-Kraepelinian" diagnostic system solely accounts for a categorical diagnosis, therefore not allowing for the possibility of dual diagnosis. There has been substantial criticism to the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV), due to problems of diagnostic overlap, lack of clear boundaries between normality and [[disease]], a failure to take into account findings from novel research and the lack of diagnostic stability over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zimmerman M, Chelminski I, Young D ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Does DSM-IV capture the dimensional nature of personality disorders? | url = | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1333–1339 | doi=10.4088/jcp.11m06974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The traditional method for treating patients suffering from dual diagnosis was a parallel treatment program.&lt;ref name=Drake_1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Robert E.|author2=Mercer-McFadden, Carolyn |author3=Mueser, Kim T. |author4=McHugo, Gregory J. |author5= Bond, Gary R. |title=Review of Integrated Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment for Patients With Dual Disorders|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|issue=4|pages=589–608|url=http://www.psycontent.com/content/n39l485nw88726p7/|accessdate=July 2013|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this format, patients received mental health services from one clinician while addressing their substance abuse with a separate clinician.&lt;ref name=Drake_1998/&gt; However, researchers found that parallel treatments were ineffective, suggesting a need to integrate the services addressing mental health with those addressing substance abuse.&lt;ref name=Drake_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Robert E.|author2=Mueser, Kim T.|title=Psychosocial Approaches to Dual Diagnosis|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|year=2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=105–118|url=http://www.psycontent.com/content/9w2u042h31831812/|accessdate=July 2013|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1980s, a number of initiatives began to combine mental health and substance abuse services in an attempt to meet this need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gorman|first=Christine|title=Bad Trips for the Doubly Troubled|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965144,00.html|accessdate=July 2013|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=3 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake_2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sciacca|first=K._1991|title=An Integrated Treatment Approach for Severely Mentally Ill Individuals with Substance Disorders|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17222783/An-Integrated-Treatment-Approach-for-Severely-Mentally-Ill-Individuals-With-Substance-Disorders-Kathleen-Sciacca|journal =New Directions For Mental Health Services, No. 50, Summer 1991, Chapter 6: Jossey-Bass, Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs worked to shift the method of treatment for substance abuse from a confrontational approach to a supportive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sciacca|first=Kathleen|title=Invited response "On Co-Occurring Addictive and Mental Disorders; A Brief History of the Origins of Dual Diagnosis Treatment and Program Development"|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/16684317/On-Cooccurring-Addictive-Mental-Disorders-a-Brief-History-Kathleen-Sciacca|journal=[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]] |date=July 1996|volume=66|issue=3|accessdate=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also introduced new methods to motivate clients and worked with them to develop long-term goals for their care.&lt;ref name=Drake_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Robert E.|last2=Essock|first2=Susan M.|last3=Shaner|first3=Andrew|last4=Carey|first4=Kate B.|last5=Minkoff|first5=Kenneth|last6=Kola|first6=Lenore|last7=Lynde|first7=David|last8=Osher|first8=Fred C.|last9=Clark|first9=Robin E.|last10=Rickards|first10=Lawrence|title=Implementing Dual Diagnosis Services for Clients With Severe Mental Illness|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=1 April 2001|volume=54|issue=1|pages=469–476|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.52.4.469|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=85734&amp;link_type=googlescholarrelated|accessdate=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the studies conducted by these initiatives did not have control groups, their results were promising and became the basis for more rigorous efforts to study and develop models of integrated treatment.&lt;ref name=Drake_2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sciacca|first1=Kathleen|last2=Thompson|first2=Christina M.|title=Program Development and Integrated Treatment Across Systems for Dual Diagnosis: Mental Illness, Drug Addiction And Alcoholism, MIDAA|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17223077/Program-Development-and-Integrated-Treatment-Across-Systems-for-Dual-Diagnosis-Kathleen-Sciacca|journal=Journal of Mental Health Administration|volume=23|issue=3|pages=288–297|date=Summer 1996|doi=10.1007/bf02522303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Austin Burke''' or '''Burk''' (September 13, 1839 &amp;ndash; September 24, 1928), was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[state treasurer]] of [[Louisiana]] following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Burke later fled to [[Honduras]] after it was discovered that there were misappropriations of state treasury funds. While in Honduras Burke became a major land owner and held government positions within Honduras' nationalized railway systems. He remained an exile until his death nearly four decades later.

==Early life and career==
[[File:BurkeCavalry12201863.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] document noting Burke's transfer to quartermaster]]Burke, by his own account, was of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent and born in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. He used the name "Burk" until after the Civil War. Burk's initial career started with the railroads. At the age of thirteen he was employed as a railroad telegraph operator in [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]]. By the age of seventeen, he had been promoted to a division superintendent.&lt;ref name=dies&gt;{{Citation | title = Maj. A. Burke dies in Honduras at 89 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date = 25 September 1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] found Burke working for a railroad in [[Texas]]. On October 7, 1861 he was commissioned as a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] officer into Debray's Mounted Battalion. His knowledge of transportation logistics gained through his years of railroad experience resulted in his temporary transfer to Texas' Office of Field Transportation in March 1863. By December of that year the transfer was permanent. Major E.A. Burk commanded the Houston Battalion,Texas Infantry of 145 men.  By war's end Burke had reached the rank of major with a duty assignment as Quartermaster and Chief Inspector of Field Transportation, District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Clement | last = Hill | editor-last = Scott | editor-first = Robert |  title = The war of the rebellion: A compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies | volume = 53 | place = Washington D.

In [[Galveston]] he initially found work as telegraph operator and then as a manager of a cotton factorage.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; He later teamed up with another former Confederate officer, H. B. Stoddart, and formed the import export firm, Stoddart &amp; Burk. The firm primarily exported cotton and imported liquor. In January 1869, the firm faced [[tax evasion]] charges from failure to pay federal taxes due on the imported alcohol. The charges against Burke were eventually dismissed, but the litigation left the firm and Burke in bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = U.

==New Orleans==
Burke next appears in [[New Orleans]] in May 1869. At this point Burke added an "e" to his last name; prior to his arrival in New Orleans, Burke signed his name without an "e". Burke may have been trying to establish a new life in New Orleans and the minor name change may have helped him avoid Galveston creditors and distance himself from the alcohol tax scandal. Throughout his life, Burke also quoted different years of birth. Burke arrived in New Orleans during a commercial convention. He informed local New Orleanians, that he was in town to attend the convention and he was from the engineering firm of Stoddart &amp; Burke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = O'Connor | editor-first = Thomas |  title = History of the fire department of New Orleans | place = New Orleans | year = 1895 | page = 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke, at first, found odd jobs in New Orleans, but eventually landed a position as a freight agent with the New Orleans, Jackson &amp; Great Northern Railroad.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; In December 1869, Burke cut all his ties with Galveston, by tendering his resignation as chief engineer of the Galveston Fire Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = City council | newspaper = The ''Galveston Daily News''  | date = 8 December 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 the New Orleans, Jackson &amp; Great Northern Railroad was reorganized as the New Orleans, St. Louis &amp; Chicago Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Lloyd J. | last = Mercer |  title = E.H.

[[File:North face of Battle of Liberty Place Monument.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Major Burke's name inscribed in the north face of the Battle of Liberty Place Monument in [[New Orleans]]]]In his newly adopted city Burke developed a friendship with [[Louis A. Wiltz]], at the time, a politically ambitious banker.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; Burke became deeply involved within Democratic Conservative political circles in New Orleans. In 1872, Burke ran as the Democratic nominee for the city council position of Administrator of Improvements. The nomination of an independent candidate split the conservative vote allowing a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to win the post.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{Cite book | last = Coleman | first = William | title = Historical sketch book and guide to New Orleans and environs, with map | publisher = W.H.

In September 1874 Burke was one of the key figures in the minor [[coup d'état]], known as the [[Battle of Liberty Place]]. During the coup most of the Republican state leaders were routed from office. Burke was appointed State Registrar of Voters by the insurgency leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/09/17/94114252.pdf "The Louisiana outrages: Nature of the calm in New Orleans,"] The New York Times, September 17, 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgency only lasted three days. The arrival of federal troops restored the previous administration. Nevertheless, tensions within the city of New Orleans remained high for weeks. In October, at a New Orleans intersection, Burke attempted to assault the then Governor [[William Pitt Kellogg]]. The altercation escalated into an exchange of pistol fire between the two. Although no one was injured, the attack resulted in the arrest of Burke. At the governor's request, as a sign of peace, Burke was eventually released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Personal encounter between Gov. Kellogg and Major Burke – No blood shed | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 30 October 1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that same year Burke again ran for Administrator of Improvements. This time he won.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kendall | first = John | title = History of New Orleans | publisher = The Lewis Publishing Company | year = 1922 | location = Chicago | page = 378 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Louisiana/New_Orleans/_Texts/KENHNO/home.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Burke guided [[Francis T. Nicholls]] in his election campaign for governor.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; The results of this election were in dispute, with both sides claiming victory and accusing the other side of voter fraud.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = E.

Burke then went to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to take part in the so-called [[Compromise of 1877]]; which confirmed a win for the Republican presidential candidate, a win for Louisiana's Democratic governor candidate, and guaranteed removal of federal troops from Louisiana. The Compromise also ratified Burke's friend, Wiltz, as the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]]. This accomplishment earned Burke much political clout.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref name=reunion&gt;{{Cite book | last = Woodward | first = C.

In 1878, Burke ran for the office of state treasurer and had an easy victory. It became apparent to both Burke and Wiltz that Governor Nicholls aims did not coincide with theirs. The two then began to influence party delegates towards their goals. Because of the rift, Nicholls decided not to seek a second term. Delegates were also persuaded to extend the current term of the state treasurer's office from four to six years and to give the [[Louisiana State Lottery Company|Louisiana Lottery]] a state charter for 25 years. The Democratic convention ended with Wiltz being the nominee for governor. In the election of 1879 voters elected Wiltz governor, ratified the extended term of the state treasurer's office, and confirmed the 25-year state charter for the Louisiana Lottery.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt; The Louisiana Lottery would prove to be a lightning rod for controversy in the coming years.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | authorlink = C.

==Politics, journalism, and defending honor==
One of the major critics of the Louisiana Lottery was Henry J. Hearsey, the editor of the ''New Orleans Democrat''. Burke and Charles T. Howard, spokesperson and the ''ipso facto'' power within the Louisiana Lottery, conspired to financially undermine the ''Democrat''. At the time the ''Democrat'' had an abundance of state scrip, earned through state printing contracts. For the most part, the ''Democrat'' used this scrip as cash to pay its bills and suppliers. In 1879 Howard brought suit in federal court questioning the use of state scrip in payment of state debts. The court ruled that the scrip had no legal value. The ''Democrat'', unable to satisfy its creditors and facing bankruptcy, was sold to a consortium, consisting of Burke, Howard, and others. Hearsey left the ''Democrat'' to become the editor-publisher of the New Orleans ''Daily States''. After the purchase was finalized a second judicial ruling reversed the first decision restoring the value of state scrip. Burke later assumed control of the ''Democrat'' as its managing editor.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = A noted lottery man dead | newspaper=The New York Times | date = 1 June 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad blood between both Burke and Hearsey resulted in a challenge to a duel from Hearsey. On January 25, 1880 both men faced off and exchanged pistol fire. At the conclusion of the duel, neither man was wounded and both considered their honor to be intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Editors on the field of honor | newspaper=The New York Times | date = 28 January 1880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881 Burke bought out his partners and became the sole owner of the ''Democrat''. On December 4 of that same year, Burke bought the New Orleans ''Times''. He then combined the two newspapers into the ''[[The Times-Picayune#History|Times-Democrat]]''.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; Burke's newspaper was used to advocate his view of the New South.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; The ''[[The Times-Picayune#History|Daily Picayune]]'' was also highly critical of Burke and his cronies. One stinging article in 1882 accused Burke of improprieties with the treasury funds. Incensed, Burke challenged the editor of the ''Daily Picayune'', C. Harrison Parker, to a duel. Since Parker was challenged, dueling etiquette allowed Parker to select the dueling weapon of choice; Parker chose rifles, but on the actual day of the duel he rethought his decision and chose pistols. Parker was a better shot than Burke's previous opponent and succeeded in seriously wounding Burke in his right thigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Chivalrous Southrons | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 8 June 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cotton Centennial==
[[File:CottonCentennialCentralBuildingKendall.jpg|left|thumb|450px|Central Building of the [[World Cotton Centennial]]]]In 1882 the National Cotton Planters Association proposed the idea of a "[[World Cotton Centennial]]". The organization called on New Orleans and other southern cities to bid for the honor of hosting the event. The proposal was not well received by southern cities still recovering from the aftermath of the Civil War. In order to stir up more publicity for the idea the National Cotton Planters Association in 1883 succeeded in having Senator [[Augustus Hill Garland]] of Arkansas introduce a bill in the US Senate to encourage the holding of a World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884. This bill was approved by both houses of Congress.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt; With public sentiment improving, a committee was formed. Commissioners and alternate commissioners from several states were to be appointed by the President. A governing body of thirteen directors was provided, six of whom were named by the President on the recommendation of the association and seven by him on that of a majority of the subscribers in the city in which the event was sponsored. With the future of the event becoming more of a reality, funding within the city of New Orleans started to grow. Burke's newspaper, the ''Times-Democrat'' was the first to pledge $5,000 towards the exposition. When $325,000 in pledges had been achieved the committee directors offered Burke the position of the exposition's director-general with a salary of $25,000. Burke initially refused, stating that his duties as both a newspaper editor and state treasurer would not allow enough time. Burke finally accepted when the committee directors appealed to his southern pride by hinting that they might have to include in their search — a Northerner. He refused the salary of $25,000, but accepted a salary of only $10,000 a year, which he directed should be invested in exhibition stock, to be later presented to the [[Louisiana State University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Burke, once in command, proceeded to expand the idea of a merely local or even national exhibition into one which should embrace the entire world. With less than the needed funding, he began the erection of a building costing $325,000. While meeting much opposition to his plans, Burke, nevertheless forged ahead.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Franklin C. Morehead, the perennial president of the National Cotton Planters Association and editor-publisher of its official chronicle, the ''Planters Journal'', was appointed to travel and interest state governments, manufacturing firms and foreign countries.&lt;ref name=staging/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Burke went to Washington in May, 1884, and succeeded in having a bill in Congress passed loaning $1,000,000, to be paid from the receipts of the exposition, if there were any surplus over expenses. The sum of $100,000 was also granted to the exposition fund by the Louisiana Legislature, for Congress had tied up its loan by a restrictive clause making the fund available only when $500,000 had been raised from other sources. Finally by August, 1884, a total of one million and a half was in sight. Of this amount $5,000 was to be given to each state and territory to be expended under the direction of its governor by a commission nominated by him and appointed by the President of the United States. These state exhibits thus came to be the strongest feature of the entire exhibition. The space allotted in advance for these state exhibits was soon found to be inadequate for the elaborate displays which resulted from the momentum given to this feature by the $5,000 appropriation, and it became necessary to erect a second building as large as the first. The publicity from the exposition propelled Burke into a second term as state treasurer in the election of 1884. With great fanfare the exposition opened on December 16, 1884.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Despite the generous donation from Congress, cost overruns and an aura of funding misappropriations contributed to the financial failure of the exposition. Burke, foreseeing the inevitable, resigned his directorship three weeks before the enterprise was forced to an early closing on June 2, 1885.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=major&gt;{{Cite journal | authorlink = James F. Vivian  | title = Major E. A.

==Honduras and treasury scandal==
Honduras was one of three [[Central America]]n countries to exhibit at the exposition. While their display was modest in comparison to others, their exhibit was highlighted by a personal visit to the exposition by Honduran President [[Luis Bográn]]. During this visit Bográn's host was Burke. Bográn was impressed by Burke's personality. The two became fast friends. Bográn was looking for someone to market the wealth of natural resources Honduras had to offer the world. Burke envisioned New Orleans as being the primary importing port for all of Central America's exports. In 1886 as an inducement to Burke, Bográn offered two large mining concessions along the [[Jalan River|Jalán]] and [[Guayape River|Guayape]] rivers in return for Burke's promise to help build an industrial school in [[Tegucigalpa]], Honduras' capital city. Burke accepted and visited Honduras at least twice between 1886 and 1888.&lt;ref name=major/&gt; In 1888 a reform-minded opposition succeeded in defeating Burke. The time Burke had used in connection with his position as state treasurer was now applied to develop his mining ventures. In 1889 Burke undertook a trip to London to secure financing for a modern mining operation. While in London his successor, William Henry Pipes, discovered significant discrepancies in amount of funds available in the state treasury. Burke was considered a primary suspect of this embezzlement. From London, Burke denied these allegations and stated he intended to return to New Orleans to confront his accusers. After reviewing the evidence on hand, a grand jury handed down nineteen indictments against Burke. The evidence indicated that Burke had failed to destroy state bonds which had been redeemed and issued additional baby bonds without authorization.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Major Burke indicted | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 24 November 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Burke's Bondsmen sued | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 13 May 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources place the amount of missing treasury funds anywhere from $64,000 to $2 million.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Louisiana's stolen bonds | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 27 October 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early December, Burke decided not to return to New Orleans and was later personally welcomed by President Bográn to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Burke did not come empty-handed; he had succeeded in acquiring financing of $8 million for his mining venture. Arresting Burke was not an issue, because Honduras had not yet formalized a set of extradition treaties with the U.S.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;[[File:BabyBondLA.jpg|right|thumb|450px|[[Louisiana]] baby bond with Burke's signature in violet]]

Burke's financial fortunes did not appear to fare well in Honduras. Burke had to contend with a number of financial panics in both [[London]] and [[Paris]] which caused investors to back out.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = The Barings in trouble | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 16 November 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also challenged with inclement weather and regime changes. In November 1893 Burke supported the losing side in a series of military skirmishes against [[Policarpo Bonilla]]. Burke and [[Domingo Vásquez]] had to flee to neighboring [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Fired at an American steamer | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 7 November 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Burke came to terms with Bonilla and returned. During this same period of political upheaval, the opponents of the Louisiana Lottery succeeded in getting Congress to outlaw the interstate transportation of lottery tickets or lottery advertisements. The U.S. Supreme Court then affirmed that position.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = The lottery killed | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 5 February 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of shutting down, the Louisiana Lottery decided to transfer its operations from New Orleans to Honduras.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Going to Honduras | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 18 January 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known, if Burke had any influence in steering the Louisiana Lottery to move to Honduras.

In June 1904, Burke accepted a position as the assistant superintendent and auditor of the Honduras Interoceanic Railway, one of the government's nationalized railroads. He held this position till August 1906. From 1912 to 1926, Burke held various positions within the National Railway of Honduras, also known as El [[Ferrocarril Nacional de Honduras]], another nationalized railroad.&lt;ref name=major/&gt; In February 1926 Burke's associates back in New Orleans succeeded in nullifying all of his indictments. Even though Burke was vindicated, he decided to remain in Honduras.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Old indictments quashed | newspaper = [[Reading Eagle]]  | date = 5 February 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Burke was on hand to greet [[Charles Lindbergh]] who was on a goodwill flight through Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Put Lindbergh to flight | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 6 January 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not Burke's first encounter with a famous aviator. In 1919, Burke had unknowingly hired local Lisandro Garay as a driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Valenzuela | first = Jose R.  | title = De la adversidad a la gloria: Una biografía de Lisandro Garay | place = [[Tegucigalpa]] | publisher = Guaymuras | year = 2003 | page = 45 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=_88YWED0RMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=De+la+adversidad+a+la+gloria:+una+biograf%C3%ADa+de+Lisandro+Garay#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 9789992628287  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garay would later become famous as an aviator in his own right, picking up the moniker — the "Honduran Lindbergh."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = 'Honduran Lindbergh' now American | newspaper = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)]]  | date = 8 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and division of estate==
Burke died on September 24, 1928 at the Hotel Ritz in Tegucigalpa.&lt;ref name=dies/&gt;&lt;ref name=major/&gt;  He was predeceased by his wife Susan Elizabeth (Gaines) by more than a decade. She died July 21, 1916.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Obituary notes | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 18 August 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's only son, and only child, Lindsey, died in the [[Congo Free State]] more than two decades before Burke. In 1895, Lindsey had volunteered for service in the ''[[Force Publique]]'' in the Congo Free State, where he was commissioned as a lieutenant. About a year later, he was killed when he and three other officers were leading a contingent of fifty men to suppress an uprising of African natives. The men scattered, when natives ambushed their party; Lindsey, with the other three officers, fought until they were hacked down and slashed to pieces.&lt;ref name=major/&gt; Burke bequeathed half of his property to the government of Honduras, the remainder to relatives in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Louisianian left half estate to Honduras; Self-exiled treasurer lived there 40 years | newspaper=The New York Times  | date = 22 October 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of measures taken by the Honduran government, Burke's heirs in the U.S. received nothing.&lt;ref name=major/&gt;

Development before birth, including [[gametogenesis]], [[embryogenesis]], and [[fetal development]], is the process of body development from the [[gamete]]s are formed to eventually combine into a [[zygote]] to when the fully developed organism exits the [[uterus]]. Epigenetic processes are vital to fetal development due to the need to differentiate from a single cell to a variety of cell types that are arranged in such a way to produce cohesive tissues, organs, and systems.

[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] modifications such as [[methylation]] of CpGs (a dinucleotide composed of a 2'-deoxycytosine and a 2' deoxyguanosine) and [[histone]] tail modifications allow [[Regulation of gene expression|activation or repression]] of certain [[Gene|genes]] within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], in order to create cell memory either in favor of using a gene or not using a gene. These modifications can either originate from the parental [[DNA]], or can be added to the gene by various [[Protein|proteins]] and can contribute to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Processes that alter the epigenetic profile of a gene include production of activating or repressing [[Protein complex|protein complexes]], usage of [[Non-coding RNA|non-coding RNAs]] to guide proteins capable of modification, and the proliferation of a signal by having protein complexes attract either another protein complex or more DNA in order to modify other locations in the gene.

==Epigenetic Definitions==

[[Gene expression]] refers to the [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] of a gene but the [[RNA]] produced does not necessarily have to encode a protein product.  Transcription may produce so called noncoding RNA products such as [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] and [[regulatory RNA]].  Repression may refer to the decrease in transcription of a gene or inhibition of a protein.  Proteins are often inhibited by binding the active site or causing a [[conformational change]] so that the active site can no longer bind. By making these alterations, proteins, like [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]], may bind DNA less or some protein may be inhibited so that it becomes a block in a [[signaling cascade]] and certain genes will then not be induced to be expressed. Repression can occur pre- or post-transcriptionally. [[Methylation|Methylating]] the DNA or the modifying the histones that the DNA wraps around is one example that commonly leads to repression.  Pre-transcriptional repression can also occur by altering the proteins that allow transcription to occur, namely the [[polymerase]] complex.  Proteins can sit on the DNA strand and serve as a kind of block to polymerase proteins, halting them from transcribing.  Post-transcriptional repression generally refers to the degradation of the RNA product or binding the RNA with proteins so that it cannot be translated or carry out its function.

[[DNA methylation]] in humans and most other mammals refers to the methylation of a CpG. Methylation of these [[Cytosine|cytosines]] are common in DNA, and in sufficient numbers can prevent proteins from attaching to the DNA by obscuring the domain binding site's matching DNA to the protein. Regions in which cytosines prior to [[Guanine|guanines]] are clustered and highly unmethylated are called [[Cpg islands|CpG islands]], and often serve as [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], or transcription start sites.

Histone modifications are modifications made to the [[amino acid]] residues in the tails of the histones that either restrict the histone's ability to bind to DNA or boost the histone's ability to bind to DNA. Histone modifications also act as sites for proteins to attach, which then further alter the gene's expression. Two common histone modifications are [[acetylation]] and methylation. Acetylation is when a protein adds an [[acetyl group]] to a [[lysine]] in a histone tail in order to restrict the ability of the histone to bind to DNA. This acetylation is commonly found on lysine 9 of histone 3, notated as H3K9ac. This results in the DNA being more open to transcription, due to the decreased binding to the histone. Methylation, meanwhile, is when a protein adds a methyl group to a lysine in a histone tail, although more than one methyl group can be added at a time. Two sites for histone methylation are common in current studies: trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 ([[H3K4me3]]), which causes activation, and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3, which causes repression (H3K27me3).

Cis acting elements refer to mechanisms that act on the same [[chromosome]] they come from, usually either in the same region from which they were produced or a region very close to this origin region. For example, a long non-coding RNA that is produced at one location silences the same or a different location on the same chromosome. Trans acting elements, however, are gene products from one location that act on a different chromosome, either the other in a chromosomal pair, or on a different chromosome from a separate chromosome pair. An example of this is a long non coding RNA from Hox gene C silences Hox gene D on a different chromosome, from a different chromosomal pair.

==Hox Gene Regulation==

[[Hox gene|Hox genes]] are genes in humans that regulate body plan development. Humans have four sets of Hox genes, numbering 39 genes altogether, all of which aid in the differentiation of cells by location. Hox genes are activated early in the [[Human embryogenesis|development of the embryo]], in order to plan the development of the differing structures of the body. They also show colinearity with the body plan, meaning that the order of the Hox genes is similar to the expression levels of the Hox genes on the anterior-posterior axis. This colinearity allows for a spatial and temporal activation of genes in order to produce a proper body structure.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"&gt;Rinn, John L. et al. (2007), [http://farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/publications/2007/Rinn.pdf "Functional Demarcation of Active and Silent Chromatin Domains in Human Hox Loci by Noncoding RNAs."] Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.022.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hox genes are regulated using a variety of epigenetic mechanisms, including the use of [[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]] such as [[HOTAIR]], the [[Trithorax-group proteins|Trithorax]] (TrxG) group of proteins, and the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] (PcG) group of proteins.

===PcG and TrxG Genes' Role in Hox Gene Regulation===

The PcG and TrxG genes that produce protein complexes responsible for continuing the activation and the repression patterns in the Hox genes initially formed by the maternal factors. PcG genes are responsible for repressing [[chromatin]] in Hox clusters meant to be inactivated in the differentiated cell. PcG proteins repress genes by forming polycomb repressive complexes, such as [[PRC1]] and [[PRC2]]. PRC2 complexes repress by trimethylating histone 3 at lysine 27 through histone [[methyltransferases]] [[EZH2|Ezh2]] and [[EZH1|Ezh1]]. PRC2 is rectruited by many elements, including CpG islands.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; PRC1, meanwhile, [[ubiquitinates]] H2AK119 using Ring1A/B's [[E3 ligase]] activity, causing stalling of [[RNA polymerase II]]. Furthermore, Ring1B, a member of the PRC1 complex, also represses Hox genes with Me118, Mph2, and RYBP by compacting the chromatin into higher-order structures.&lt;ref&gt;Eskeland, R. et al. (2010), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132514/#R48 "Ring1B Compacts Chromatin Structure and Represses Gene Expression Independent of Histone Ubiquitination."] Molecular Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.02.032&lt;/ref&gt; TrxG genes, meanwhile, are responsible for activating genes by trimethylating lysine 4 of the histone H3 tail. Genes with similar transcriptional marks tend to cluster together in distinct structures. In bivalent domains, both of these marks are present, indicating genes that are silenced but can be rapidly activated when necessary.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

===The Role of ncRNAs in Hox Gene Regulation===

231 ncRNAs are present in the four Hox [[Gene cassette|gene cassettes]]. Similarly to the Hox protein-coding genes, the ncRNAs show differential expression according to the cell's location on the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal axes. These lncRNAs can act either on the set of genes which they are present in, or can act on a separate gene set within the Hox genes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wang, Kevin C. et al. (2011) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670758/ "Long Noncoding RNA Programs Active Chromatin Domain to Coordinate Homeotic Gene Activation."] Nature. doi: 10.1038/nature09819&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HOTTIP]] is a long non-coding RNA that assists in regulating the HoxA genes. It is produced from the 5' end of the HoxA gene cassette, and activates HoxA genes. Loops within the chromosome bring HOTTIP closer to its targets; this allows HOTTIP to bind to [[WDR5]]/MLL protein complexes to aid in trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

HOTAIR is a long non-coding RNA that assists in regulating the HoxD genes. It is produced in the HoxC cassette, near the divide between expressed and unexpressed genes, and represses HoxD genes. HOTAIR acts by attaching to [[SUZ12|Suz12]] in the PRC2 complex, and then guides this complex to the genes to be repressed. PRC2 then trimethylates the lysine 27 of histone 3, repressing the gene of interest.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

==Barr body formation==
In female humans, [[Barr body|Barr bodies]] are defined as the condensed and inactivated [[X chromosome|X-chromosome]] that is found in every cell of the adult.  Because females have two nearly identical X chromosomes, one of them must be silenced so that the expression levels of the genes on the X-chromosome are of the proper dosage. Thus, males and females have the same level of X-chromosome expression, despite being born with one X for males and two for females. This is also why individuals with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], a disease in which more than two sex chromosomes are present in the body, have fewer symptoms than individuals with other types of [[aneuploidy]], which are often fatal before birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20033637 "Klinefelter Syndrome."] - Mayo Clinic. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of Xist===

[[X-inactivation|Inactivation]] of one of the X chromosomes is initiated by a long non coding RNA called [[XIST|Xist]]. This lncRNA is expressed on the same chromosome it represses, known as working in cis.  Recent research has shown that a repeat element in the RNA of Xist causes PRC2 to bind to the RNA. Another part of the RNA binds to the X-chromosome positioning PRC2 such that it can methylate various regions on the X-chromosome. This methylation causes other factors like [[Histone deacetylase|histone deacetylases]] (HDACs) to bind to the chromosome and propagate [[heterochromatin]] formation, even into active gene regions. This heterochromatin greatly reduces, if not completely silences gene expression of the Barr body. Xist will be continuously created to maintain a condensed and silenced Barr body.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Engreitz, J.M. et al. (2013), [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6147/1237973 "The Xist lncRNA Exploits Three-Dimensional Genome Architecture to Spread Across the X Chromosome."] Science. doi: 10.1126/science.1237973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random early X-chromosome inactivation===

In embryonic development, when the zygote is still composed of just a few cells, each cell of the zygote will randomly chose an X-chromosome to condense and silence. From then on, the [[Daughter cell|daughter cells]] of that cell will always silence the same X-chromosome as the parent cell it propagated from. This creates what is known as the “mosaic effect,” in which differential X-chromosome expression creates differing [[Genotype|genotypes]] throughout a single organism. This may or may not be evident in females, depending on how the genes of the X-chromosomes affect [[phenotype]]. If the [[Allele|alleles]] for a gene are identical on both X-chromosomes, then you will see no difference between the cells that chose one X over the other. If the alleles are different for, say, fur color, then you may see patches of one color and patches of the other color. In [[Calico cat|calico cats]] the mosaic pattern of X inactivation is easily seen because a gene affecting coat color is carried on the X, resulting in patches of color on the coat. The mosaic pattern of X inactivation may also determine how penetrant a disease is, if the disease allele is present on one X-chromosome and not the other. The organism may have few cells in which the diseased allele has not been condensed, leading to little expression of the disease allele. This is referred to as skewed X-chromosome inactivation.

==Imprinting==
[[Genomic imprinting|Imprinting]] is defined as the differential expression of paternal and maternal alleles of a gene, due to epigenetic marks introduced onto the chromosome during the production of [[egg]] and [[sperm]]. These marks usually lead to differential expression of the specific sets of genes from the maternal and paternal chromosomes. Imprinting is carried out through many epigenetic mechanisms like methylation, histone modifications, rearrangement of higher order chromatin structure, non-coding RNAs, and interfering RNAs.

===Goals and Functions of Imprinting===

A single evolutionary purpose of imprinting is still unknown, since the mechanisms and effects seem to be so diverse. One hypothesis states that imprinting occurs in order to carry out the evolutionary goal of the parent, that being the differential partition of resources. The male seeks to provide maximum resources for his offspring so that his genes may be passed on successfully to the next generation, whereas the female must partition resources between all her offspring, and so must limit resources given.&lt;ref&gt;Barlowl, D., Barolomei, M. (2014), [http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/6/2/a018382.full "Genomic Imprinting in Mammals."] Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a018382&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis states that imprinting may help protect the female from ovarian [[trophoblastic disease]] and [[parthenogenesis]]. Trophoblastic disease occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg with no nucleus and a cancer-like mass forms in the [[placenta]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Jeffrey L., M.D. [http://www.womenscancercenter.com/info/types/mole.html "Trophoblastic Disease."] Women's Cancer Center: Ovarian Cancer. N.p., 2007. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Parthenogenesis occurs when an unfertilized egg develops into a fully functional organism that is genetically identical to the parent, who is female in the case of animals or both sexes, in the case of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Parthenogenesis/ "Parthenogenesis."] Bio-Medicine. N.p., 2012. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not occur naturally in mammals.  In most animals, especially mammals, uniparental inheritance of chromosomes is often lethal or results in developmental abnormalities, sometimes physically but often cognitively. Other hypotheses point to the function of imprinting as a way of establishing the proper amount of expression or functional [[Ploidy|haploidy]], much like silencing the extra X-chromosome in females (see section on Barr bodies). Imprinting may help in the differentiation of cells by silencing [[pluripotency]] genes or other developmental genes. Supporting this hypothesis, imprinted genes have been shown to differ in their expression between tissue types in the same organism, pointing to divergent outcomes as a result of developmental events during embryogenesis. Regardless of whether there is a single purpose for imprinting, numerous studies have shown that a normal and functional organism cannot be made without the various imprinting mechanisms.

===Igf2 and H19===

In mammals, imprinted genes are often clustered in the genome, probably because they share transcriptional regulators or regulatory regions that impact the expression of multiple genes. It is easier for a lncRNA to silence multiple genes if they are closer together, making silencing more efficient. In some cases, when a gene is transcribed it overlaps another region nearby or opposite (antisense) to it, often silencing it. In the case of the Ifg2 and [[H19 (gene)|H19]] genes, [[CTCF]], a transcriptional repressor protein, is involved. CTCF binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR region but not the methylated paternal ICR region. ICR is a shared control region of Ifg2 and H19 that, when deleted, results in the loss of imprinting of these genes. CTCF then binds another region of the chromosome, creating a loop where Igf2 is blocked from transcription, but H19 is not, resulting in the maternal chromosome expressing H19 but not Igf2. CTCF has been shown to directly interact with Suz12, a subunit of PRC2, in order to silence the Ifg2 promoter region through hypermethylation. Conversely, the paternal H19 promoter is highly methylated during embryogenesis so that Ifg2 will not be silenced. Should CTCF fail to bind, H19 on the maternal chromosome has reduced expression and Igf2 is not silenced properly, resulting in biallelic expression. Mice have homologues of these genes, but silence them in a different way, where biallelic expression occurs and then [[antisense RNA]] is used to silence one of the genes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Hallgrimsson, Benedikt, Ph.D.; Hall, Brian K., Ph.D.. Epigenetics: Linking Genotype and Phenotype in Development and Evolution. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011. Ebook Library. Web. 09 May. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igf2r and Airn===

Airn is an lncRNA used to silence Igf2r and other surrounding genes. In the mechanism to silence Igf2r, the transcription of the lncRNA Airn silences the expression of Igf2r, as opposed to an active repression mechanism. Airn is the antisense gene of Ifg2r, so if Airn is being transcribed, the transcriptional machinery may cover a part of or the entire promoter region of Igf2r, so RNA polymerase cannot bind to the promoter region of Igf2r in order to initiate transcription.  This mechanism is very efficient in that Igf2r is silenced by transcription of Airn, while the RNA product silences other genes near Igf2r.  The imprinting mechanisms described above work on the chromosome that the Airn lncRNA is produced, but there are many other imprinted genes that work to silence genes on other chromosomes or to silence the similar allele(s) on the opposing chromosome of the same pair. Some imprinted genes code for regulatory RNA elements such as lncRNA, [[small nucleolar RNA]], and [[MicroRNA|micro RNA]], so the expression of these genes results in the silencing of some other gene.

From these examples, researchers have seen similar patterns in [[developmental genetics]]. It is imperative that many genes are silenced at the right time so that cells can maintain their identity and expressional integrity. Failure to do so often leads to symptoms such as cognitive abnormalities, if not fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Latos, P.A. et al. (2012), [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1469.full?sid=e463183f-a61a-4825-a712-4b7ace47b7a5 "Airn Transcriptional Overlap, but not its lncRNA products, induces imprinted Ifg2r silencing."] Science. doi: 10.1126/science.1228110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of PRC2==
PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) is a complex of proteins that repress chromatin by histone methylation and by working to recruit other proteins that help further the repression of chromatin. The structure of this complex and group of mechanisms used by this complex are highly conserved across various [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] species. Very few species have duplicates of these complexes in the genome beyond PRC1 and PRC2.&lt;ref&gt;Mozgova, I., Köhler, C. and Hennig, L. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25687468 "Keeping the gate closed: functions of the polycomb repressive complex PRC2 in development."] The Plant Journal. doi: 10.1111/tpj.12828&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components and Repressive Functions===

PRC2 is a multi-protein complex composed of four major subunits (E2H1/2, SUZ12, EED, and RbAp46/48) and three variable subunits ([[AEBP2]], [[JARID2]], and PCLs).  The three variable subunits are used for catalysis of enzymatic reactions or binding to specific regions, not for repression of genes or chromatin. Similar to a [[zinc finger]], AEBP2 docks onto the major grooves of DNA to assist in binding.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio, C. et al. (2012), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482686/ "Molecular architecture of human polycomb repressive complex 2."] eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.00005&lt;/ref&gt; PRC2 is usually recruited by other proteins or lncRNa and then catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 tails (H3K27me3. This methylation is thought to cause repression by steric hindrance of RNA polymerase II. Even though the polymerase is not prevented from binding, the polymerase, after beginning transcription, will pause at H3K27me3 marks. The short transcript produced by the pausing of the polymerase often recruits regulatory complexes, like PRC2. Thus, PRC2 represses by two mechanisms: by directly altering the structure of the chromatin through methylation or by binding of transcripts.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Differential Behavior Due to Phosphorylation===

PRC2 has been shown in many experiments to be necessary for the proper [[Organogenesis|formation of organs]], starting with the maintenance of cellular differentiation and silencing of pluripotency genes.  The exact mechanism in early embryogenesis that induces cells to differentiate is still unclear, but this mechanism has been closely linked to [[protein kinase A]] (PKA). Since the PRC2 complex has sites able to be phosphorylated and has differentiated behavior based on the level of phosphorylation, a logical hypothesis can be made that PKA affects PRC2 behavior and may phosphorylate PRC2, activating the protein and starting the methylation cascade that silences genes.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamizu, K. et al. (2012), [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590912001154 "Protein Kinase A Determines Timing of Early Differentiation through Epigenetic Regulation with G9a."] Cell Stem Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.022&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Cell Differentiation===

Experimentally, PRC2 has been shown to be highly enriched at the Hox genes and near developmental gene regulators, resulting in their methylation. Some time after the second or third cleavage event, PRC2 begins to bind to these developmental genes, even though they have the markers for highly active genes like H3K9me3. This has been described as the “leaking” of PRC2 binding. Variable binding will cause some genes to be silenced before others, causing differentiation, but this is likely regulated by the organism. What causes the specificity of cell differentiation is still unknown but some hypotheses say it largely has to do with the cell environment and the “awareness” of the cells to each other, considering all cells in this stage contain identical genomes at this point. The maintained cell lines after this differentiation event are largely dependent on PRC2. Without it, pluripotency genes will still be active, causing the cells to be unstable and reversion back to a [[stem cell]]-like stage where the cell would have to undergo differentiation again in order to return to its normal state. Properly differentiated cells have silenced pluripotency genes.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Margueron, R., Reinberg, D. (2011) [http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA247530231&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=txshracd2598&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=10e5be1f5ca2336527e2f163605143c6 "The Polycomb complex PRC2 and its mark in life."] Nature doi: 10.1038/nature09784&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binding Specificity Due to Recruitment by lncRNA===

Although PRC2 seems to have a very simple mechanism and works on many genes and chromosomes across the genome, it often has very specific binding regions and has been observed to localize to specific genes to cause their repression. Recent research shows that it probably does this through the binding of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Xist and Hox genes have both been studied extensively and display this mechanism very well. The lncRNA that the complex binds does not necessarily need to hybridize to the target region in order to silence it, as evidenced by the PRC2-lncRNA complex working on regions other than the region from which this complex was produced. However, the three-dimensional configuration of the RNA often gives the complex specific localization to regions where the RNA is created to bind.

===Maintenance of Chromosome Condensation===

PRC2 is also highly associated with [[Intergenic region|intergenic regions]], subtelomeric regions, and long-terminal repeat [[transposons]]. PRC2 acts to create heterochromatin in these regions through similar mechanisms to the mechanism used to repress genes. Heterochromatin formation is imperative in these regions in order to regulate gene expression, maintain chromatin shape, prevent degradation of the chromosome, and reduce the event of transposon “hopping” or spontaneous recombination.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Thus, PRC2 is not only essential to the initiation of differentiation in development, but also for maintaining heterochromatin in all cell stages and for silencing genes and chromosome regions that would undo the cell differentiation that had already occurred or negatively affect the survival of the cell or the organism as a whole.

==Role of lncRNAs==

Long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs, are RNA transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II that are not translated but participate in the regulation of gene expression. Long non-coding RNAs are used in various epigenetic processes in development, including the regulation of Hox genes, as well as in the creation of Barr bodies.

===lncRNAs in Hox Gene Regulation===

In Hox genes, long non-coding RNAs allow for communication between different Hox genes and different sets of Hox genes in order to coordinate body plan in the cell. One example of a long non-coding RNA that coordinates between Hox gene sets is HOTAIR, which is an RNA transcript produced in the HoxC cassette that represses transcription of a large number of genes in the HoxD cassette. Thus, HOTAIR regulates the HoxD genes from the HoxC genes in order to coordinate transcription of the Hox genes.&lt;ref&gt;Rinn, John L. et al. (2007), [http://farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/publications/2007/Rinn.pdf "Functional Demarcation of Active and Silent Chromatin Domains in Human Hox Loci by Noncoding RNAs."] Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.022&lt;/ref&gt;

===lncRNAs in Barr Body Creation===

In human cells with more than one X chromosome, two long non-coding RNAs are produced: [[Tsix]] is produced by one X chromosome, and Xist is produced by all of the other X chromosomes. Tsix is a long non-coding RNA that prevents repression of an X chromosome, while Xist is a long non-coding RNA that acts to repress and condense an entire X chromosome. The actions of Xist serve to create a Barr body in the cell.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Paraspeckle Formation===

Neat1 is an lncRNA which assists in forming the structure of nuclear structures known as [[Paraspeckle|paraspeckles]]: nuclear bodies which contain RNA-binding proteins.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Nakagawa, S. et al. (2014), [http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/23/4618.long "The lncRNA Neat1 is required for corpus luteum formation and the establishment of pregnancy in a subpopulation of mice."] Development. doi: 10.1242/dev.110544&lt;/ref&gt; They control gene expression in the nucleus by retaining RNA in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] that would otherwise alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, A.H., Lamond, A.I. (2010), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2890200 "Paraspeckles."] Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a000687&lt;/ref&gt; Paraspeckles form a significant portion of the [[corpus luteum]] of the [[ovary]]; in [[NEAT1|Neat1]] impaired mice, corpus luteum formation is highly dysfunctional, causing ovarian defects and lowered [[progesterone]] levels resulting in a lack of pregnancy in Neat1 deficient mice. Neat1 assists in regulation of luteal genes by preventing the protein [[SFPQ|Sfpq]] from inhibiting [[NR5A1|Nr5a1]] and Sp1, allowing luteal genes to be regularly transcribed. Neat1 is regulated by histone deacetylases.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Neuronal Differentiation===

[[Evf-2|Evf2]] is a lncRNA that acts in [[forebrain]] neuronal differentiation during embryonic development.  Evf2 is transcribed from an ultraconserved region, or a region that is very highly conserved among most [[vertebrate]] species, within the region from [[DLX5|Dlx5]] to [[DLX6|Dlx6]]. This region is a target for SHH, a highly important regulator of [[central nervous system]] development. Evf2, when transcribed, recruits Dlx and [[MECP2|Mecp2]] through cis and trans-acting mechanisms to the Dlx5/6 region in the ventral forebrain, causing [[GABAergic]] interneurons in the [[hippocampus]] to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, Jianchi, Chunming Bi, Brian S. Clark, Rina Mady, Palak Shah, and Jhumku D. Kohtz. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1475760/ "The Evf-2 Noncoding RNA Is Transcribed from the Dlx-5/6 Ultraconserved Region and Functions as a Dlx-2 Transcriptional Coactivator."] Genes &amp; Development. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Evf2 acts by forming a complex with [[DLX4|Dlx4]] that increases Dlx4 transcription activation ability and stability.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Roberts T.C., Morris, K.V., and Wood, M.J.A. (2014), [http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1652/20130507 "The role of long non-coding RNAs in neurodevelopment, brain function and neurological disease."] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2013.0507&lt;/ref&gt;

Malat1, another neurological lncRNA, causes increased synaptic function and greater amounts of dendrite development. Increases of Malat1 increase neuronal density, while decreases of Malat1 decrease neuronal density. Malat1 acts by regulating the expression levels of Nlgn1 and SynCAM1 which are important genes in synapse formation.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Igf2r Regulation===

The lncRNA Airn is an lncRNA that regulates Igf2r expression. Igf2r is a gene which expresses a receptor for [[insulin-like growth factor 2]], and assists in [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] enzyme transport, activation of [[Growth factor|growth factors]], and degradation of insulin-like growth factor 2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3482 "Genes and Mapped Phenotypes."] National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; This lncRNA is an RNA modified by imprinting, leading to Airn expression in the paternal allele, but not in the maternal allele. Airn acts by cis-acting silencing of the Igf2r region through overlapping the Igf2r gene through the antisense transcript encoded by Airn. Airn is silenced in the maternal allele through Igf2r transcription. In the brain, however, Igf2r alleles are both expressed due to Airn mediation being repressed in neuronal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Guibert, S., Weber, M. (2013), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587238 "Functions of DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation in Mammalian Development. Epigenetics and Development."] doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-416027-9.00002-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of BRD4==

Bromodomain protein 4, or [[BRD4]], is a protein which binds to acetylated tails of histones H3 and H4 to aid active gene transcription by decompaction using the [[bromodomain]] with the assistance of the acetylated K5 on H4. BRD4 is a member of the BET protein family, which includes other bromodomain-containing proteins and their homologues in other species. BRD4 is a protein which functions in both gene activation and repression in [[cell cycle]] control and [[DNA replication]]. BRD4 functions by binding to the acetylated tails and then attaching to other proteins, allowing those proteins to 
either activate or repress the histones next to BRD4.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, S.Y., Chiang, C.M. (2007), [http://m.jbc.org/content/282/18/13141.full "The Double Bromodomain-containing Chromatin Adaptor Brd4 and Transcriptional Regulation."] The Journal of Biological Chemistry. doi: 10.1074/jbc.R700001200&lt;/ref&gt;

BRD4 aids in early cell development by activating pluripotent genes through interacting with [[Oct-4|Oct4]] and recruiting [[P-TEFb]] (positive transcription elongation factor). By occupying pluripotent genes and X-chromosome inactivation lncRNAs in their regulatory regions, BRD4 enhances activation of these DNA regions. BRD4 enhances this activation by recruiting P-TEFb; if either BRD4 or P-TEFb is not functional, pluripotent gene transcription is blocked, and the cell differentiates into a neuroectodermal cell.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Wu, T. et al. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375790 "The BET Family Member BRD4 Interacts with OCT4 and Regulates Pluripotency Gene Expression."] Stem Cell Reports. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.01.012&lt;/ref&gt;

BRD4 can act as epigenetic bookmarking throughout the cell cycle, including after transcription, due to its association with P-TEFb, allowing BRD4 to enhance RNAPII.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

BRD4 also assists in the hyperacetylation of histones in the [[Pronucleus|sperm nucleus]]. Histone hyperacetylation, the addition of acetyl groups to lysines on the amino tails of histones in an amount much larger than normal, is believed to assist in histone removal from the sperm nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J.M. et al. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25691659 "Characterization of BRD4 during Mammalian Postmeiotic Sperm Development.] Molecular and Cellular Biology. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01328-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental Diseases Caused by Epigenetic Dysfunction==

Examples of diseases caused by epigenetic dysfunction in development include:

*[[Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome|Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome]], caused by abnormal methylation in the maternal ICE region, causing Igf2 overexpression. Symptoms include accelerated growth, abnormal growth (hemihyperplasia), abdominal wall defects, [[macroglossia]], [[hypoglycemia]], kidney abnormalities, and large abdominal organs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome "Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome."] Genetics Home Reference. US National Library of Medicine, Apr. 2008. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Russell-Silver syndrome|Russell-Silver Syndrome]], caused by abnormal lack of methylation in the paternal ICE region, causing Igf2 repression. Symptoms include [[low birth weight]], [[failure to thrive]], hypoglycemia, distinctive head shape, abnormal growth, [[clinodactyly]], and digestive issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/russell-silver-syndrome "Russel Silver Syndrome."] Genetics Home Reference. US National Library of Medicine, Apr. 2008. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Prader–Willi syndrome|Prader-Willi Syndrome]], caused by missing paternal expression of the region which [[UBE3A]] expression inhibits. Symptoms include [[hypotonia]], feeding difficulties, delayed development, poor growth, [[hyperphagia]], [[obesity]], [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], intellectual impairment, delayed or incomplete puberty, behavioral issues, sleep abnormalities, and distinctive features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/prader-willi-syndrome "Prader Willi Syndrome."] Genetics Home Reference. US National Library of Medicine, Apr. 2008. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Angelman syndrome|Angelman Syndrome]], caused by loss of UBE3A expression in the maternal allele. Symptoms include delayed development, intellectual disability, [[ataxia]], [[speech impairment]], [[epilepsy]], [[microcephaly]], hyperactivity, excitable demeanor, [[scoliosis]], and difficulty sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/angelman-syndrome "Angelman Syndrome."] Genetics Home Reference. US National Library of Medicine, Apr. 2008. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alpha-thalassemia|Alpha thalassemia X-linked syndrome]], which can be caused by hypomethylation in certain repeat sequences. Symptoms include delayed development, hypotonia, distinctive facial features, and reduced [[hemoglobin]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alpha-thalassemia-x-linked-intellectual-disability-syndrome "Alpha Thalassemia X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome."] Genetics Home Reference. US National Library of Medicine, Apr. 2008. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[ICF Syndrome|ICF syndrome]], caused by a [[mutation]] in the DNA methyltransferase 3b gene or DNA hypomethylation, which causes lack of DNA methylation. Symptoms include intellectual impairment and alpha thalassemia.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, G. [http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/epigenetic-diseases-and-their-causes-and-symptoms-37397 "Epigenetic Diseases and Their Causes and Symptoms."] Nature.com. Nature Publishing Group, 2004. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cancerous stem cell|Cancerous stem cells]], caused by misregulation of polycomb proteins that often lead to blocking or activating developmental genes at the wrong time.  [[Tumor suppressor gene|Tumor suppressor genes]] may be silenced and undifferentiated cells proliferate an increased rate.&lt;ref&gt;Richly, H., Aloia, L., and Di Croce, L.

*There are many diseases that have been closely linked to Hox gene malfunctions, caused by genetic and epigenetic factors such as sequence mutations, overexpression, underexpression, and others.  These diseases often involve missing or extra body parts like [[extra fingers]], missing bones, missing auditory organs, limb deformations, etc.  Some Hox gene defects have even been shown to cause early cancers. A full list of which genes cause which diseases can be seen in the reference "Human Hox gene disorders" by Quinonez.&lt;ref&gt;Quinonez, S.C., Innis, J.W.

The '''Hassane''' is a name for the traditionally dominant warrior [[tribe]]s of the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]]-[[Moorish]] areas of present-day [[Mauritania]], southern [[Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]]. Although lines were blurred by intermarriage and tribal re-affiliation, the Hassane were considered descendants of the [[Arab]] [[Maqil]] tribe [[Beni Hassan]] (hence the name). They held power over [[Sanhadja]] [[Berber people|Berber]]-descended [[zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] (religious) and [[znaga]] (servant) tribes, extracting from these the [[horma]] tax in exchange for armed protection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041030112857/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+mr0050%29] &lt;/ref&gt; 

Occasionally, such as in the case of the important [[Reguibat]] tribe, [[Zawāyā]] Berber groups would rise to Hassane status by growing in power and prestige and taking up armed raiding; they would then often [[Arabization|Arabize]] culturally to fit the prevailing image of Hassane tribes as "original" Arabs.

A good example of a Hassane tribe is the [[Río de Oro]]-centered [[Oulad Delim]], which is considered as among the purest descendants of the Beni Hassan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18828">[[File:Lead Paint - cracking and flaking.jpg|thumb|mini|Lead paint on a porch in 2018]]
'''[[Lead-based paint]]''' was widely used in the United States, because of its durability. The United States banned the manufacture of lead-based house paint in 1978 due to health concerns.

[[Lead]] has long been considered to be a harmful environmental pollutant. Cited cases of lead poisoning date back to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lah |first=Katarina |url=http://www.toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/History+of+Lead+Use |title=History of Lead Use |website=Toxipedia |publisher=Institute of Neurotoxicology &amp; Neurological Disorders |location=Seattle, WA |date=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, paint manufacturer [[Sherwin-Williams]] reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint "poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors."&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066401898;view=1up;seq=110 |title=Dangers of White Lead |last1=Guenther |first1=Richard |date=1904-02-24 |website=[[Hathitrust]] |publisher=Sherwin Williams Co. |accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Congress|Congress]] banned the use of lead-based paint in residential structures and environments in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;United States. Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. {{uspl|91|695}}. Approved 1971-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] followed with implementing regulations, effective in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. "Lead-Containing Paint and Certain Consumer Products Bearing Lead-Containing Paint." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|42|44199}}, 1977-09-01. {{uscfr|16|1303}}. Bans residential lead-based paint manufactured after February 27, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional regulations regarding lead abatement, testing and related issues have been issued by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

Much of the government's response to the lead public health problems in the 1970s can be credited to the work of epidemiologist and pediatrician [[Philip J. Landrigan]], who conducted detailed studies of lead poisoning near lead refineries, as well as the effects of lead in [[gasoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Do Chemicals Affect Our Health? Philip Landrigan tracks how dangers like the WTC can cause problems like ADD. |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/may/25-how-much-do-chemicals-affect-our-health |date=May 2008 |website=Discover |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Louis Wade Sullivan]], called lead the "number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." Humans are exposed to lead in many ways. These can be through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/lead/learn-about-lead#lead |title=Learn about Lead  |publisher=EPA |date=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/homes/hip-lead.html |title=Lead-Based Paint - Remodeling Your Home? |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airborne lead enters the body by breathing or swallowing lead particles or dust once it has settled. Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead |title=About Lead-based Paint |publisher=US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) |location=Washington, D.C. |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint. Some homes built as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]’s (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics monitors blood lead levels in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Experts use a new level based on the U.S. population of children ages 1-5 years who are in the top 2.5% of children when tested for lead in their blood (when compared to children who are exposed to more lead than most children). Currently that is 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Overview ==
===Definition===
The U.S. government defines "lead-based paint" as any "paint, surface coating that contains lead equal to or exceeding one milligram per square centimeter (1.0 mg/cm2) or 0.5% by weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcwatch.com/archives/council15/15-721.htm |title=Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Control Amendment Act of 2004, Bill 15-721 |publisher=Dcwatch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have adopted this or similar definitions of "lead-based paint." These definitions are used to enforce regulations that apply to certain activities conducted in housing constructed prior to 1978, such as abatement, or the permanent elimination of a "lead-based paint hazard."

The U.S. government and many states have regulations regarding lead-based paint. Many of them apply to evaluating a property for lead-based paint. There are two different testing procedures that are similar but yield different information. Lead-based paint inspections will evaluate all painted surfaces in a complex to determine where lead-based paint, if any, is present. The procedures for lead inspections is outlined in the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) Guidelines, Chapter 7, 1997 Revision. The other testing is a lead-based paint risk assessment. In this testing, only deteriorated painted surfaces are tested and dust wipe samples are collected. This information will help the risk assessor determine if there are any ''lead hazards''. Many property owners decided to get a combination of both tests to determine where the lead-based paint is present and what hazards are present as well. Risk assessments are outlined in the HUD Guidelines, Chapter 5. In addition, if a child is poisoned in a property, the owner may be required to perform abatement (permanent elimination of the lead hazard).

===The Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Regulation===
In 1996, the Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Regulation was enacted.{{By whom|date=April 2017}} It requires owners of pre-1978 "target housing" to disclose to potential buyers or renters all known information about the presence of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards in the property.  It requires that the potential buyer or tenant be given the lead information pamphlet, "Protect Your Family From Lead In Your Home," or other EPA-approved pamphlet as well as a specific disclosure statement. The option of whether to test for the presence of lead-based paint is left to the owner, so long as a decision not to test is disclosed.

===Renovation, Repair and Painting===
The EPA issued a new regulation called 'Renovation, Repair and Painting' (RRP) regarding the renovation of residential housing and child-occupied buildings built before 1978 on April 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=RRP Overview &amp; Contractor Certification| url=http://www.greenedu.com/epa-lead-rrp-overview/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule (Federal Register: July 15, 2009 (Volume 74, Number 134)) became effective April 22, 2010. Under the rule, [[General contractor|contractors]] performing renovation, repair and painting projects that disturb lead-based coatings (including lead paint, shellac or varnish) in child-occupied facilities built before 1978 must be certified and must follow specific work practices to prevent lead contamination. EPA’s RRP rule impacts many construction trades, including [[general contractor]]s and special trade contractors, [[House painter and decorator|painters]], [[plumber]]s, [[Carpentry|carpenters]], [[glazier]]s, wood floor refinishers and [[electrician]]s. Activities performed by all of these trades can disturb lead-based paint and have the potential to create hazardous lead dust. For most individuals, eight hours of training is required. However, individuals who have successfully completed renovation courses developed by HUD or EPA, or an abatement worker or supervisor course accredited by EPA or an authorized State or Tribal program, can become certified renovators by taking a four-hour EPA-accredited renovator refresher training.

The RRP rule is controversial, primarily due to the increased cost remodelers incur as a result of having to set up dust containment apparatuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Held |first=Tom |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/91440959.html |title=Citing cost, contractors fight new lead paint rules |publisher=Jsonline.com |date=2010-04-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sealing off doorways and [[HVAC]] ducts with plastic. Various national trade associations have been very vocal in their opposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testudoonline.com/content/window-and-door-dealers-voice-opposition-expanded-lead-law |title=Window and Door Dealers Voice Opposition to Expanded Lead Law |publisher=TestudoOnline.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; some going so far as to sue the EPA. Though the EPA considered expanding the rule to require contractors to pass a third-party dust wipe clearance exam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testudoonline.com/node/20 |title=Opinions on 'Dust Wipe' Clearance Testing Vary |publisher=TestudoOnline.com |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; these revisions were rejected in July, 2011.

Although the rule was not fully implemented until April 2010, certain elements were required before, and others required attention well before April 2010. 

* Before April 2009, contractors that disturb paint in homes, residential buildings, schools and child care facilities built prior to 1978 had to provide lead hazard information prior to the start of the job to building owners, occupants, and to the families of children using the facilities by distributing EPA’s new Renovate Right brochure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/renovaterightbrochure.pdf |title=Lead |publisher=EPA |date=2012-11-14}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of April 2009, trainers could begin to apply to EPA or an EPA-approved state for accreditation, and, once approved, contractors and construction trade workers could begin to take the training to become certified.
* Beginning October 2009, firms could apply for EPA or state certification.
* Beginning April 2010, all businesses engaged in renovation, repair or painting activities in homes, residential buildings, schools and child care facilities built prior to 1978 must be certified, use certified workers, and follow specific lead-safe work practices to prevent lead contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/sbcomplianceguide.pdf |title=Lead |publisher=EPA |date=2012-11-14}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State action against the lead paint industry==
The state of [[Rhode Island]] filed a [[nuisance|public nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] in 1999 (''State of Rhode Island v. Lead Industries Association'') to force the former manufacturers of lead paint to pay for the cleanup of current lead hazards in Rhode Island.  After a trial that ended in a [[hung jury]] in 2002, the state refiled the case.  In February 2006, the jury decided in favor of the state and said that [[Sherwin-Williams]], NL Industries and Millennium Holdings would have to pay for the clean-up of lead paint in the state. On July 1, 2008, the Rhode Island Supreme Court in a landmark decision overturned the verdict,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.ri.gov/supreme/pdf-files/Corrected%20Version%20State%20v.%20Lead%20Paint%20Industries%20Assoc.,%20Inc..pdf&lt;/ref&gt; dismissing the case stating that "the State of Rhode Island 'cannot allege' facts sufficient to state a claim for common law [[nuisance|public nuisance]] against lead pigment manufacturers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuisancelaw.com/court-decisions/rhode-island-supreme-court-2008 Thomas R. Bender: "State of Rhode Island v. Lead Industries Association"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921031631/http://www.nuisancelaw.com/court-decisions/rhode-island-supreme-court-2008 |date=2008-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Missouri Supreme Court]] and the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/courts/supreme/a-73-05.doc.html |title=Law Library &amp;#124; camlaw.rutgers.edu |publisher=Lawlibrary.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also rejected the use of the public nuisance theory in lead paint lawsuits, leaving Ohio and California as the only two remaining public nuisance cases.

The [[California Supreme Court]] has reviewed the [[contingency fee]] agreement between the municipalities and private counsel.

==Real estate maintenance and renovation==
{{Advert section|date=April 2017}}
{{Section howto|date=April 2017}}
Humans can be poisoned during unsafe renovations or repainting jobs on housing that has lead paint.  Therefore, homeowners are encouraged to carefully stabilize any deteriorated (peeling, chipping, cracking, etc.) paint in a lead-safe manner. More than 250,000 children in the United States have significantly harmful levels of lead in their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ |title=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no safe level of exposure.

Working in a lead-safe manner means avoiding dry [[sanding]], dry scraping, removing paint by torching/burning, the use of [[heat gun]]s over 1100°F, machine-sanding or grinding without [[HEPA]] filtered dust collection or HEPA-filtered vacuum. These methods are now prohibited by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) because they have been proved to create significant levels of lead dust during remodeling, renovation and painting. They must be avoided, especially in properties where children under age six reside. Adult workers using unsafe work practices or improper protective gear may also become lead-poisoned.

There are specialized paint strippers for use with lead paint such as "Lead-Out" paint stripper, "Strip-Tox", "Lead-X", and others. Some of these specialized strippers render lead non-hazardous decreasing the risks associated with lead paint removal.

HUD requires a dust test for "clearance" at the end of any remodeling or repainting job be performed by a third-party professional who is independent of the entity performing the work.  

Lead evaluations of paint are usually performed by a field testing method known as [[X-Ray fluorescence]] (XRF) using equipment such as the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] Innov-X LBP4000, RMD LPA-1, or the Thermo Scientific's Niton.  XRF is the preferred method because it is not destructive and a reading is usually obtained in about 4&amp;ndash;8 seconds with a 95% accuracy at the 2-sigma level.

Instruments of this sort have an inconclusive range, and when a reading falls in this range (range is different for each instrument and model), a paint chip may be taken and sent for laboratory analysis.  Testing for lead in dust, water, and air also require laboratory analysis.  Commercially available lead test kits are often used to test for the presence of lead, but they are not reliable and not authorized by HUD to be used in determining if a property is lead-based-paint free.

The home's year of construction can be a clue as to the likelihood that lead is present in its paint.  As of April 2011, 87% of homes built before 1940 contain at least some lead paint, homes built between 1940 and 1960 have a 69% chance of containing such paint, homes built between 1960 and 1978 have a 24% chance of containing lead paint, while homes built after 1978 are unlikely to have lead-based paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/steps.pdf |title=Steps to Lead Safe Renovation, Repair and Painting |date=October 2011 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-740-K-11-001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control performs regular studies of housing-based health hazards in the U.S.

==Europe==
Advertising company [[JCDecaux]] launched its ''"Cyclocity"'' programs initially in [[:de:Citybike Wien|Vienna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplying Self Service Bikes|url=http://www.jcdecaux.com/partners/supplying-self-service-bikes|website=JCDecaux|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria in 2003 and in [[Vélo'v|Lyon]], France in 2005. The company also started programs in other cities in Europe such as [[Velib|Paris]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and [[Kazan]], as well as cities outside of Europe, such as [[Brisbane]], Australia. Payment for using the bikes is done with [[smart card]]s.

Competitor [[Clear Channel]], then operating as Adshel, opened the first example of this in Rennes in 1997, and has several other sites including [[Oslo Bysykkel|Oslo]], Stockholm, [[Sandnes]] and [[Trondheim]], most generally similar to that offered by their competitor.

A different financial model called [[bicing]] is used in [[Barcelona]], which is paid for by car owners parking on public streets and not by advertising – which is contracted to JCDecaux in some places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adshel.com/content.aspx?ID=31&amp;ParentID=27&amp;MicrositeID=0&amp;Page=1 Adshel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117011636/http://www.adshel.com/content.aspx?ID=31&amp;ParentID=27&amp;MicrositeID=0&amp;Page=1 |date=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
In 2001, the city of [[Vienna]] implemented a first version of a bike sharing system following the example of Copenhagen. Unfortunately, ''Viennabike'' failed and its shortcomings were fixed in the second implementation called [[:de:Citybike Wien|Citybike Wien]], which started 2003. It is operated by [[:de:Gewista|Gewista]] and comprises 1500 bikes distributed to 121 stations with 3097 slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citybikewien.at/en/about-citybike/press/143-2015-year-in-review|title=2015 Year in Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=1 August 2016|author=Citybike Wien}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, more than 1 million trips and more than 100,000 new registrations were recorded. There is no fee for the first rental hour, additional hours are charged starting with €1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://citybikewien.at/en/fees|title=Fees – Citybike Wien|website=citybikewien.at|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|Line of bikes at a Villo! station]]
The [[Villo!]] system was launched in Brussels in 2009, and is operated by JCDecaux. It's the company's second biggest [[JCDecaux#Bicycle Rental Systems|bicycle rental system]] after Paris in terms of quantity.{{clarify|quantity of what? Bikes? Stations? Hires?|date=February 2017}} At the beginning of April 2015, it had 4115 bikes across 346 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Villo! bike sharing relieves public transport in Brussels (Belgium)|url=http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/villo-bike-sharing-relieves-public-transport-brussels-belgium|accessdate=14 July 2016|publisher=Eltis|date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Antwerp]], a bike system called Velo went public in 2011. It is operated by [[Clear Channel]] and registered {{val|2558657}} journeys in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.velo-antwerpen.be/nl/blog/velo-antwerpen-in-cijfers |title=VELO ANTWERPEN IN CIJFERS |author=Velo Antwerpen |date=27 August 2014 |website=Velo Antwerpen |access-date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
[[Burgas]] is the first Bulgarian city to introduce a public rent-a-bike system. The scheme is called VeloBurgas and has 10 access points with 120 bikes in operation. The rent-a-bike system works with cards, SMS, and POS. Prices range from 0.50 to 1 lev per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gotoburgas.com/en/index/static/31 |title=Go To Burgas: Cycling |author=Go To Burgas |date=5 November 2015 |website=Go To Burgas |access-date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
[[File:New Public Buses in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus in the afternoon.jpg|thumb|Public bicycles in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus]]
Bike in Action operates in the greater Nicosia area, similar to programmes employed in various cities of Cyprus. Bicycles can be found at stations in all participating municipalities (Agios Dometios, [[Aglandjia]], Dali, Engomi, Latsia, Pallouriotissa, [[Strovolos]]) and returned after their use at any station. Bike in Action includes more than 310 bikes distributed in 27 full automated [[Smoove]] stations, which cover the wide Nicosia area. All the rental stations are connected with the banking system and access to the bikes can be obtained with the use of a credit card.&lt;ref name="Η Λευκωσία καλωσόρισε έναν νέο, υγιεινό τρόπο μετακίνησης στην πόλη"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bike-sharing-gr.blogspot.com/search/label/%CE%94%CE%95%CE%A0%CE%9B%7ctitle=BikeSharing.gr%7cwork=bike-sharing-gr.blogspot.com|title=ένα blog για τα Συστήματα Αυτόματης Μίσθωσης Ποδηλάτων ...και οτιδήποτε αφορά το Ποδήλατο!

=== Czech Republic ===
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Rekola NTK.jpg|thumb|[[Rekola]] bikes in [[Prague]], Czech Republic]]
The most widespread bike sharing system is called [[Rekola]]. It started operating in Prague in 2013. In 2018, it was operating in 8 Czech cities (Prague, [[Brno]], [[Ostrava]], [[České Budějovice]], [[Liberec]], [[Frýdek-Místek]], [[Teplice]] and [[Olomouc]]) with more than 1000 pink bikes. There are also two smaller providers in Prague: HomePort&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prahakola.cz/|title=Homeport - systém automatické půjčovny kol|last=|first=|date=|website=Český bikesharing v Praze|language=cs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with docking stations in [[Karlín]] district and Velonet in [[Prague 4]] and Brno.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://praha.velonet.cz/|title=Velonet Praha|website=praha.velonet.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Following earlier bike-sharing systems, Denmark introduced the first ''next generation'' bike-sharing system in 1991 in [[Farsø]].&lt;ref name="velo2009"&gt;{{citation | first = Paul | last = DeMaio

Riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special locking bike stands, and the riders then had unlimited use of the bike within a specified 'city bike zone'.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  The fine for not returning a bicycle or leaving the bike-sharing zone was strictly enforced by [[Police of Denmark|the police]].  The founders hoped to completely finance the programme by selling advertising space on the bicycles.  This funding source quickly proved to be insufficient, and the city of Copenhagen took over the administration of the programme, funding most of the programme costs through appropriations from city revenues.  Since it was free to the user, there is no return on the capital invested by the municipality, and a considerable amount of public funds was constantly used to keep the system in service.  In 2013 a new version was expected to be introduced but the municipality of Copenhagen temporarily withdrew its support and there were no free bicycles for most of 2013.&lt;ref name="goby"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.copenhagenize.com/2012/10/goodbye-bycyklen.html

[[Copenhagen]] was among the first cities in the world to have a free bike scheme called ''[[Copenhagen City Bikes|City Bikes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BICYCLE CULTURE|url=http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/bicycle-culture/|website=The Official Website of Denmark|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was paid by advertising on the bikes.

In late 2013, Copenhagen started a new program with electric bikes. The first phase of this program, with 1860 bikes and 105 docking stations, is to be completed in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bach |first1=Ursula |title=The New Bike Share System is a Perfect Fit for Copenhagen |url=http://gobike.com/cities/denmark/copenhagen-1/ |accessdate=1 December 2015 |publisher=Go Bike |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208135042/http://gobike.com/cities/denmark/copenhagen-1/ |archivedate=8 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Vélo'v station 5002 - Place des Compagnons de la chanson.jpg|thumb|[[Vélo'v]] in [[Lyon]]]]
[[File:Velibvelo1.jpg|thumb|[[Velib']] bicycle station in Paris]]
In 1974, the French city of [[La Rochelle]] launched a free bike-sharing programme, [[Vélos Jaunes]] (Yellow Bikes), featuring unisex bicycles which were free to take and use. In terms of public usage and acceptance, it is regarded today as one of the first truly successful bike-sharing programmes. The programme continues today, albeit in modified form (rental charges apply after the first two hours, and personal identification is required for all bike rentals).

[[File:Place de la République (Paris), réaménagement, 2012-04-05 39.jpg|thumb|The [[Vélib']] in Paris is the largest system outside China{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}]]
French cities offering a bicycle sharing system include [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Nice]], [[Toulouse]], [[Rennes]], [[Rouen]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Orléans]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nantes]], [[Lille]], [[Dunkirk]], [[Strasbourg]], Clermont-Ferrand, Avignon, Saint-Étienne, Chalon sur Saône, Belfort, Lorient, Annemasse, Valence, and Aix-en-Provence.

The launch of [[Velo'v]] in [[Lyon]], France in 2005 was an effort to improve on the disappointing performance of the traditional municipal public bike-sharing model. In an attempt to improve upon the results of the discontinued ''Bikeabout'' program at the University of Portsmouth, ''Velo'v'' utilised "smart" technology to reduce theft, user damage, and vandalism. Considered to be a city less than friendly to cyclists prior to 2005, the ''Velo'v'' programme is credited with stimulating an increase of 500% in bicycle trips within the city, a quarter of which used the bike sharing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrobike.net/index.php?s=file_download&amp;id=16 |title="The Bike-sharing Phenomenon – The History of Bike-sharing", Paul DeMaio |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Carbusters]]'' magazine No. 36, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A resurgence in bike sharing programmes is attributed by many to the launching in 2007 of Paris's [[Vélib']], a network of 18,000 specially designed bicycles distributed among 1,230 stations throughout Paris. Vélib', inspired by Lyon's seminal ''Vélo'v'' project, is now considered the second largest bike-sharing system of its kind in the world. 80 percent of Vélib's original 20,600 bicycles have been destroyed or stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Erlanger, Steven and De La Baume, Maïa, ''French Ideal of Bicycle-Sharing Meets Reality'', The New York Times, 30 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some Vélib' cycles have been found in Eastern Europe and North Africa, while others have been dumped in the [[Seine]] River, hung from lampposts, or abandoned on the roadside in various states of disrepair, forcing the City of Paris to reimburse the programme operator an estimated $2&amp;nbsp;million per year for excess costs under its contractual agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Erlanger, Steven and De La Baume, Maia, ''French Ideal of Bicycle-Sharing Meets Reality'', The New York Times, 30 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has bike-sharing programmes in many cities, including [[Aachen]], [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] (StadtRAD Hamburg), [[Karlsruhe]], [[Kassel]] (Konrad), [[Mainz]] (MVGmeinRad), [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]]. The station-based system Metropolradruhr is located in the [[Ruhr Area]].
Bike-sharing stations are also located in over 50 ICE railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eturbonews.com/31673/germany-ranks-third-globally-quality-infrastructure "Germany ranks third globally for quality infrastructure – eTurboNews.com"] "For those that prefer exercise and the ultimate green way to get around on two wheels, Germany even features the "Call a Bike" program in eight cities and at over 40 train stations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/index.php?id=401&amp; |title=Call a Bike: Überblick |work=callabike-interaktiv.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826231125/https://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/index.php?id=401&amp; |archivedate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In November 2010, [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] launched EasyBike, which includes one hundred bicycles that are distributed in eight rental stations throughout the town. The method of operation is similar to other such systems in Europe. Residents can obtain a special electronic subscriber card from the Municipality, which gives them access to bicycles and occasional users can use their credit card to rent a bicycle.&lt;ref name="Ορθοπεταλιές ενάντια στη ρύπανση και την ακρίβεια"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/society/arthro/80388/orthopetalies-enadia-sti-rupansi-kai-tin-akriveia|title=ΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΑ : Ορθοπεταλιές ενάντια στη ρύπανση και την ακρίβεια ''SOCIETY: Orthopedics against pollution and precision''|work=newsbeast.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also gives users the ability to obtain a code and gain access to bicycles through an IVR automated system by using their credit card. EasyBike bike sharing system is developed by Brainbox under a [[Smoove]] license, which is the first Greek company to implement a bike sharing project in Greece.&lt;ref name="Κέρκυρα: Σύστημα αυτόματης ενοικίασης ποδηλάτων"&gt;[http://www.naftemporiki.gr/localnews/story.asp?id=1901990 Κέρκυρα: Σύστημα αυτόματης ενοικίασης ποδηλάτων ''Corfu: Bicycle rental system'']{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other programmes similar to bicycle sharing systems, which are not automated. The first, running from early 2010, is in the northern suburb of [[Nea Erithréa, Greece|Nea Erithréa]], in [[Attica]], while the second is that of the [[Nafpaktos|Municipality of Nafpaktos]], which has been in operation since mid June 2010. In these programmes, the residents rent the bike directly from the municipality. In the programme implemented in Nea Erithréa, bicycles are rented for one week to six months, on condition that the user must submit to the municipality 75 euros as a guarantee. In Nafpaktos, bicycles are rented for up to two months for free.&lt;ref name="Ενοικιαζόμενες ορθοπεταλιές"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=1&amp;artid=4592683|title=Ενοικιαζόμενες ορθοπεταλιές ''(The Municipalities of Eritrea, Corfu and Nafpaktos rent bikes to their citizens)''|author=Τα Νέα Οnline|date=6 September 2010|work=Τα Νέα Οnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Iraklio|municipality of Heraklion]] in Crete purchased 100 bicycles from the bike-sharing company Brainbox, the developer of EasyBike&lt;ref name="EasyBike στον Δήμο Ηρακλείου"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easybike.gr/el/bikesharing-news/116-easybike-dimos-irakleiou-kritis |title=100 ποδήλατα EasyBike στον Δήμο Ηρακλείου ''100 EasyBike bikes in the Municipality of Heraklion''|author=George Voulgaroudis |work=easybike.gr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025202646/http://www.easybike.gr/el/bikesharing-news/116-easybike-dimos-irakleiou-kritis |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; system while free distribution of bicycles from the municipality had already started from April 2010.&lt;ref name="Ηράκλειο"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citybranding.gr/2010/04/blog-post_22.html|title=Ηράκλειο : Δωρεάν διάθεση ποδηλάτων για χρήση στη παραλιακή λεωφόρο : Πόλεις και Πολιτικές ''Heraklion: Free use of bicycles for use on the coastal avenue: Cities and Policies''|work=citybranding.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a non-automated system was introduced at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], in Salonica, Northern Greece. It presents 60 public bikes available for the University community. The system has no electronic rental stations and the delivery and return of the bikes is made by students working part-time on the project.&lt;ref name="Το Πρώτο Σύστημα Κοινόχρηστων Ποδηλάτων στο Α.Π.Θ."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.auth.gr/news/wordpress/?p=30696 |title=Το Πρώτο Σύστημα Κοινόχρηστων Ποδηλάτων στο Α.Π.Θ.

In 1965, the group [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] painted fifty bicycles white and scattered them unlocked in downtown [[Amsterdam]] for everyone to use freely.&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt; The bicycles were both taken by people, and impounded by the authorities, as a city ordinance forbade leaving unlocked bikes in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How bike-sharing conquered the world|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21732701-two-wheeled-journey-anarchist-provocation-high-stakes-capitalism-how|website=The Economist|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zee|first1=Renate van der|title=Story of cities #30: how this Amsterdam inventor gave bike-sharing to the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/26/story-cities-amsterdam-bike-share-scheme|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1997, a pilot project for a public share system, based on the UK's ''Grippa'' racks was established in [[Rotterdam]], for use by commuters, but it was terminated the following year due to poor functionality of the electronic bike racks.&lt;ref name="DeM"/&gt;

The Netherlands has a single nationwide bike sharing program, called "OV-fiets", which means 'public transport bike'.&lt;ref&gt;"Cycling in the Netherlands"(PDF)(page 48). Rijkswaterstaat (Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management)&lt;/ref&gt; The system has 8500 bikes in 252 locations, mainly train stations, all over the country. Membership is required (annual fee €0.01, €3.85 per rental day) and can be combined with an [[OV-chipkaart]]. The program, which started on a small scale in 2003, has enjoyed a steadily increasing popularity with over 1.53&amp;nbsp;million rides registered in 2014. The nature of the Dutch bike sharing program differs from that of programs in other countries partly because the already high bike ownership of the population. Its interconnection with the public transport network allows it to fill the need of people who also want to continue traveling by bike from the station of their destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.nsjaarverslag.nl/FbContent.ashx/pub_1000/downloads/annual-report-2014.pdf|website=Bouwen aanaantrekkelijk OV|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a ''Green Bike Scheme'' bike sharing programme was initiated in [[Cambridge]], United Kingdom, using a fleet of some 300 bicycles. The overwhelming majority of the fleet were stolen or missing within a year of the programme's introduction, and the Green Bike Scheme was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1717314.ece |title=Sailing through the lights, riding for a fall &amp;#124;28 Apr 2007, accessed 26 Nov 2008 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pilgrim Tom |url=https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/you-remember-cambridge-green-bike-12472055 |title=Do you remember the last time Cambridge had an 'Uber for bikes' scheme? |publisher=cambridge-news.co.uk |date=2018-01-18 |accessdate=2018-12-03 |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elliott Chris |url=https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/history/quirky-pedal-power-could-only-13096553 |title=Quirky pedal power that could only happen in Cambridge |publisher=cambridge-news.co.uk |date=2018-01-18 |accessdate=2018-12-03 |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to overcome losses from theft, the next innovation adopted by bike sharing programmes was the use of so-called '[[smart cards|smart technology]]'.

==== Bikes Belong (Dem/Rep Conventions), 2008 ====
In 2007, [[Bikes Belong]] (now known as PeopleForBikes), an advocacy group financed by major bicycle manufacturers worked with city officials, local advocates, and the healthcare firm [[Humana]] to bring bikesharing to the Republican and Democratic 2008 conventions.  Called "Freewheelin!" the program offered 1,000 bicycles at 12 stations throughout the downtowns of the host cities, [[Denver]] and [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Minneapolis/St. Paul]], over the five days of each convention. Bikes Belong's stated goal was to provide a proof-of-concept that large-scale bicycle sharing that was exploding in European cities could work in U.S. cities and provide a valuable addition to the transportation mix. The program was popular among conventioneers, and helped the city of Denver to create a narrative around the "green" attributes of the convention. Both Denver and Minneapolis successfully pursued permanent bikesharing systems, with Denver [[B-cycle]] launching on 22 April 2010 as the first of its scale in the U.S., followed by Minneapolis' NiceRide system launching on 10 June 2010.&lt;ref name="Bicycle Retailer"&gt;{{cite news |title=PeopleForBikes plans Friday webinar on proposed tariffs |url=https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2018/07/26/peopleforbikes-plans-friday-webinar-proposed-tariffs#.W3TFGthKjOQ |accessdate=16 August 2018 |publisher=Bicycle Retailer |date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boston, MA====
In 2007, [[Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas M. Menino]] and Director of Bicycle Programs, Nicole Freedman, decided to bring bike sharing to the Boston area.  The [[Metropolitan Area Planning Council]], the regional planning agency for the metro-Boston region of 101 cities and towns, joined the effort.  Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville also participated. 
[[File:Hubway bike Center Drive CP jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Boston]] [[Hubway]] bike]]
On 28 July 2011, [[Boston]] launched its 60-station, 600-bike [[Hubway]] system, sponsored by the shoe manufacturer [[New Balance]] and funded in part by a $3&amp;nbsp;million grant from the Federal Transit Administration. The contract to operate was awarded to [[Alta Bicycle Share]]  and the equipment provider was [[PBSC Urban Solutions]]. Bicycle-sharing was greeted with a mix of excitement and skepticism. In its first two and a half months, Hubway recorded 100,000 station-to-station rides. After recording 140,000 trips in four months, Boston's European-style bicycle-sharing system expanded outside city limits, planting stations across [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]].  Hubway has over 100 stations throughout the Greater Boston area.

In spring of 2018 Motivate the operator of Hubway changed sponsors from Hubway to the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]] and officially changed the name of the bike share program to Blue Bikes Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hubway is changing its name to Blue Bikes - The Boston Globe |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/03/07/hubway-changing-its-name-blue-bikes/ixOzaTK6y4jrNkMnRpz06J/story.html |website=BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portland, OR====
One of the first community bicycle projects in the United States was started in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1994 by civic and environmental activists Tom O'Keefe, Joe Keating and Steve Gunther. It took the approach of simply releasing a number of bicycles to the streets for unrestricted use. While Portland's ''Yellow Bike Project'' was successful in terms of publicity, it proved unsustainable due to theft and vandalism of the bicycles. The ''Yellow Bike Project'' was eventually terminated, and replaced with the ''Create A Commuter'' (CAC) program, which provides free secondhand bicycles to certain preselected low-income and disadvantaged people who need a bicycle to get to work or attend job training courses,&lt;ref&gt;Law, Steve, ''People in Need Offered Free Bikes'', The Portland Tribune, 20 January 2011: Originally, CAC handed out free bicycles to any low-income applicant; this was changed after many of the CAC bicycles began appearing for resale in classified advertisements.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall of 2009, the [[University of California, Irvine]] introduced its Zotwheels automated bike share program. Students and university employees may sign up for a Zotwheels membership card at an annual cost of $40, which enables the user to check out a bike from any bike station located throughout campus for a maximum of three hours and drop it off at any other station. A$200 charge is imposed for a lost, stolen, or severely damaged bike. Bicycle availability and station operational status may be determined using an interactive map. Revenues from membership fees are sufficient to offset only a small fraction of the total operating costs of the program; all remaining manufacture, installation, maintenance, and implementation costs of the Zotwheels systems and the bicycles themselves are borne by UCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parking.uci.edu/zotwheels/about.cfm |title='&amp;#39;About Zotwheels: Funding'&amp;#39; |publisher=Parking.uci.edu |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zotwheels was developed as a collaboration between the UCI Parking and Transportation Services, [[The Collegiate Bicycle Company]], CSL Ltd, and Miles Data Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Zotwheels|url=https://www.parking.uci.edu/zotwheels/about.cfm|website=Zotwheels|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====San Lorenzo====
On November 2016 San Lorenzo launched ''Biciudad'', a free-to-use Bike Sharing System of the city of San Lorenzo. This is a system of Free Public Transport launched by the San Lorenzo Government to achieve the reduction of the use of motor vehicles and enhance other means of non-motorized transport such as walking, or the bike itself.

The Biciudad Bike Sharing System is expanding along with the construction of a circuit of exclusive lanes for bicycles across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biciudad.info/|title=Biciudad ('Biciudad es un Sistema de Bicicletas Públicas de la ciudad de San Lorenzo' / ''Biciudad is a System of Public Bicycles in the city of San Lorenzo'')|first=|last=Official web|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Lihong. (2015).

In 2014, students from Peking University created a company called ofo and initialize the fourth generation bike sharing system in their campus. In 2017, a number of private competing [[Mobile app|app]]-based dockless bike-sharing programs have started to appear in numerous cities across China.

Short rides are rewarded credits and longer rides subtract credits once the bikes have been re-docked. Shanghai planned to expand to 3,500 Bicycle Hot Spots throughout the entire city by 2010. Two years after the World Expo, Shanghai's bicycle sharing programme has been mostly limited to the [[Minhang District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bike-sharing.blogspot.com/ The Bike-sharing Blog].

Furthermore, the bicycle sharing system captured modal share from bus transit, walking, autos and taxis. Another key finding in this study suggests that car ownership may not reduce the likelihood of bikesharing use. In fact, members of the Hangzhou system exhibited a higher rate of auto ownership in comparison to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen |first=Susan |author2=Zhang, H., Martin, E., and S.

[[Melbourne Bike Share|Melbourne Bike Share (MBS)]], the first municipal bicycle share system in Australia, was launched in [[Melbourne]] in June 2010.  It started with 10 stations.  Usage has been lower than expected and has required ongoing public subsidy.

Ridership doubled when $5 helmets were offered for sale from vending machines.  Currently the MBS uses 500 cycles at about 50 stations around Melbourne's central business district.&lt;ref name="MOR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/citycycle-wont-follow-melbournes-5-helmet-lead-20110808-1ii05.html|title=CityCycle won't follow Melbourne's $5 helmet lead|newspaper=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916094256/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/citycycle-wont-follow-melbournes-5-helmet-lead-20110808-1ii05.html|archivedate=16 September 2011|first=Tony|last=Moore|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===

In both [[Auckland]] and [[Christchurch]], Nextbike provide some limited cycle sharing facilities; plans are in hand to expand these. The [[NZ Transport Agency|New Zealand Transport Agency]] is working with Auckland Transport and the Christchurch City Council respectively to investigate cycle sharing schemes for each city, and independently a private consortium proposes to have a scheme in place in Auckland during 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2017/05/22/bike-share-auckland/ "A bike to share in Auckland", 22 May 2017, in greaterauckland.org.nz] Accessed 13 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gesture]]s are a form of [[nonverbal communication]] in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of [[speech]] or together and in parallel with spoken words.&lt;ref name=Kendon&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=2004|title=Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-83525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gestures include movement of the [[hand]]s, [[face]],  or other parts of the [[Human body|body]]. Physical non-verbal communication such as purely [[Emotional expression|expressive]] displays, [[proxemics]], or displays of [[joint attention]] differ from gestures, which communicate specific messages.&lt;ref name=Kendon/&gt; Gestures are culture-specific and can convey very different meanings in different social or cultural settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|last2=Collett|first2=Peter|last3=Marsh|first3=Peter|last4=O'Shaughnessy|first4=Marie|year=1979|title=Gestures, Their Origins and Distribution|location=London|publisher=Cape|isbn=0-224-01570-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gesture is distinct from [[sign language]]. Although some gestures, such as the ubiquitous act of pointing, differ little from one place to another, most gestures do not have invariable or universal meanings but connote specific meanings in particular cultures. A single emblematic gesture can have very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.&lt;ref name=HumanGesture&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=1994|chapter=Human gestures|editor=K.R. Gibson and T. Ingold|title=Tools, Language and Cognition in Human Evolution|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes links to pages that discuss particular gestures, as well as short descriptions of some gestures that do not have their own page. Not included are the specialized gestures, calls, and signals used by referees and umpires in various organized [[sport]]s. [[Police officer]]s also make gestures when [[directing traffic]]. [[Mime]] is an art form in which the performer utilizes gestures to convey a story. [[Charades]] is a game of gestures.

[[File:OK Sign.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Okay sign]]

* [[OK (gesture)|A-ok or Okay]], made by connecting the [[thumb]] and [[forefinger]] in a circle and holding the other fingers straight, usually signal the word ''okay''.  In USA this gesture is considered by some as "white power" hate symbol, though it is unclear whether it is used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered obscene in [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and [[Iran]], being similar to the Western extended middle finger with the back of the hand towards the recipient; similarly, the hand shape in [[American Sign Language]] when made with the other three fingers slightly separated with particular movement and palm orientation can turn into an obscene sign.  It is also an insult in parts of Europe, to imply the rudeness or arrogance of the recipient, often used when driving (though thumb and index finger separated to infer "small male member").
* [[Abhayamudra]] is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[mudra]] or gesture of reassurance and safety.
* [[Apology hand gesture]] is a [[Hindu]] custom to apologize in the form of a hand gesture with the right hand when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (which are considered as a manifestation of the goddess of knowledge [[Saraswati]]), money (which is considered as a manifestation of the goddess of wealth [[Lakshmi]]) or another person's leg. The offending person first touches the object with the fingertips and then the forehead and/or chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Bruyn |first1=Pippa |last2=Bain|first2=Keith|last3=Allardice|first3=David|last4=Joshi|first4=Shonar|title=Frommer's India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qG-9cwHOcCIC |accessdate=26 April 2013|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-64580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Beckoning sign]]. In North America or Northern Europe a beckoning sign is made with the index finger sticking out of the clenched fist, palm facing the gesturer. The finger moves repeatedly towards the gesturer (in a hook) as to draw something nearer. It has the general meaning of "come here".&lt;ref name=McNeill&gt;{{Cite book|last=McNeill|first=David|year=1992|title=Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal About Thought|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Africa (i.e the [[Maghreb]]), calling someone is done using the full hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Strubbe|first1=Kevin|first2=Liesbeth|last2=Hobert|year=2009|title=Etiquette in Het Buitenland |location=Leuven|publisher=Van Halewijck}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several Asian and European countries, a beckoning sign is made with a scratching motion with all four fingers and with the palm down.&lt;ref name=Imai&gt;{{cite web

* [[Hand of benediction]] and blessing. The benediction gesture (or benedictio Latina gesture) is a raised right hand with the ring finger and [[little finger]] touching the palm, while the middle and index fingers remain raised. Taken from Ancient Roman iconography for speaking (an example is the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] where the emperor Augustus assumes the pose of an orator in addressing his troops), often called the ''benediction'' gesture, is used by the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[clergy]] to perform [[blessing]]s with the [[sign of the cross]]; however Christians keep the thumb raised&amp;nbsp;— the three raised fingers (index, middle, and thumb) are frequently allegorically interpreted as representing the three Persons of the [[Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Monuments of the Early Church |last=Lowrie |first=Walter |place=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand's shape is said to partially spell the name of [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1LIPFk6oFVkC&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;ots=GNGu0e_hCi&amp;dq=sign%20of%20benediction%20greek%20ix%20xc&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=sign%20of%20benediction%20greek%20ix%20xc&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities]: Being a Continuation of the ''Dictionary of the Bible'', Volume 1'' William George Smith and Samuel Cheetham, London, John Murray, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blah-blah. The fingers are kept straight and together, held horizontal or upwards, while the thumb points downwards. The fingers and thumb then snap together repeatedly to suggest a mouth talking. The gesture can be used to indicate that someone talks too much, gossips, is saying nothing of any consequence, or is boring.&lt;ref name=FGuide/&gt;
* Check, please. This gesture, used to mean that a dinner patron wishes to pay the bill and depart, is executed by touching the index finger and thumb together and "writing" a [[Tick (checkmark)|checkmark]], circle, or wavy line (as if signing one's name) in the air.&lt;ref name=FGuide&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=Nancy |first2=Melissa |last2=Wagner |year=2003|title=Field Guide to Gestures: How to Identify and Interpret Virtually Every Gesture Known to Man |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Quirk Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:To signal for the bill in Japan, although not widely used by younger people, both hands are raised, with the two index fingers forming an "X". This is to signal the 'end' of a meal which is called "Shime ({{lang|ja|〆(しめ)}})" in Japanese. The crossed fingers represent this sign resembling an "X".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okwave.com/ja/culturezine/psychological_analyses/777/777|title=なぜ、指でＸを作ることがお会計のジェスチャーなの？ - OKWave.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chinese number gestures]] are a method of using one hand to signify the [[natural number]]s one through ten.
*[[Clenched fist]] is used as a gesture of defiance or solidarity. Facing the signer, it threatens physical violence (i.e., "a thumping").
[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Kennedy's gesture seen here with [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]
* Clinton thumb. The gesture dubbed the "Clinton thumb" after one of its most famous users, [[Bill Clinton]], is used by politicians to provide emphasis in speeches. This gesture has the thumb leaning against the thumb-side portion of the index finger, which is part of a closed fist, or slightly projecting from the fist. An emphatic, it does not exhibit the anger of the clenched fist or pointing finger, and so is thought to be less threatening.&lt;ref name="Mankiewicz"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mankiewicz|first=Josh|date=7 November 2006|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15609023 |title=For politicians, the gesture's the thing: 'The Clinton thumb' has become a bipartisan weapon in Washington|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gesture was likely adopted by Clinton from [[John F. Kennedy]], who can be seen using it in many speeches and images from his political career.&lt;ref name="Mankiewicz" /&gt;
* [[Crossed fingers]] are used to [[Superstition|superstitiously]] wish for good luck or to nullify a promise.
* Cuckoo sign, touched or screw loose. In North America, making a circling motion of the index finger at the ear or temple signifies that the person "has a screw loose", i.e. is speaking nonsense or is crazy.&lt;ref name=Imai/&gt;&lt;ref name=FGuide/&gt;
* Cuckold's horns are traditionally placed behind an unwitting man (the [[cuckold]]) to insult him and represent that his wife is unfaithful. It is made with the index and middle fingers spread by a person standing behind the one being insulted. The "symbolism has been forgotten but the insult remains" in modern culture as ''bunny ears''.&lt;ref name="strange"&gt;[http://www.strangehistory.net/2014/05/16/cuckolds-horns/ The Cuckold's Horns], Beach Combing, May 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dap greeting]] is a form fist-to-fist [[handshake]] popularized in Western cultures since the 1970s, related to the fist bump.
* [[Dele Alli|Dele Alli Goggles]] is a modern gesture from 2018 made by linking a hand's thumb to ring finger and little finger to middle finger to make goggle like symbol. Can be used mockingly or to show superiority.
* [[Eyelid pull]], where one forefinger is used to pull the lower eyelid further down, and signifies alertness

* {{anchor|Fig sign}}[[Fig sign]] is a gesture made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers, or, rarely, the middle and ring fingers, forming the fist so that the thumb partly pokes out. In some areas of the world, the gesture is considered a good luck charm; in others (including Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Russia, Serbia and Turkey among others), it is considered an obscene gesture. The precise origin of the gesture is unknown, but many historians speculate that it refers to a penis penetrating the [[Mons pubis|female genitalia]] (to which [[The Finger]] also refers). In [[ancient Greece]], this gesture was a fertility and good luck charm designed to ward off evil.

*[[Ogham]]: There is direct evidence for the existence of a system of ogham hand signals. The ogam tract ''[[In Lebor Ogaim]]''  mentions two forms of finger spelling; ''cossogam'' ('foot-ogham') and ''sronogam'' ('nose-ogham'). ''Cossogam'' involves putting the fingers to the right or left of the shinbone for the first or second ''aicmi'', and across it diagonally or straight for the third or fourth ''aicmi''. One finger is used for the first letter, two for the second, and so on. ''Sronogam'' involves the same procedure with the ridge of the nose. Placing the finger straight across the shinbone or nose for the fourth aicme mimics the later, manuscript form of the letters. Another alphabet, ''basogam'' ('palm-ogham') is mentioned which seems to involve striking the hand in various ways against wood. Probably the angle of the hand indicated the aicme while the number of strikes indicated the letter. The inclusion of these alphabets in the Tract shows that a connection between the ogham letters and fingers was still known at the time the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'' was written in the Middle Ages. Further evidence of the possible use of ogham hand gestures comes in the form of various literary references to finger signs. Plummer (1910 p cxvi) cites several works which mention the use of finger signs, including the ''Life of [[Saint Brendan]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2061">The '''Lodha Muslim''' are a tribal or [[Adivasi]] community found in the state of [[West Bengal]] in [[India]]. They are [[Muslim]] converts from the [[Hindu]] [[Lodha people|Lodha]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 415-424&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The exact circumstances of the conversion of the Lodha Muslims to [[Islam]] remains shrouded in mystery, but the conversion process was gradual, and the community still preserve many of their pre-Islamic customs. They are found mainly in the [[Midnapore District]], in particular in the villages of Madhya Hingli, Uttar Rani Chak, Gamatub, Maniktala, Laldighi, Chapbasan, Sodhpur and Piyada. .&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 415-424&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The traditional occupation of the Lodha was hunting and gathering, in particular catching of snakes and toads, and then selling their skins. They are no longer hunters and gatherers, and community has now taken up the occupation as locksmiths. A small number are also marginal farmers, but their holdings are incredibly small. The bulk of the community are now wage labourers, with a steady immigration to the city of [[Kolkata]].

The Lodha are strictly endogamous community, and prefer to marry close kin. They are residentially segregated, live in their own quarters within the villages they reside. Each settlement contains a jati panchayat or caste council, which maintains social control, and resolves any intra community dispute. The community are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s and  have customs similar to other [[Bengali Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 415-424&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Madagascar}}
The '''Merina Kingdom''', or '''Kingdom of Madagascar''', officially the '''Kingdom of Imerina''' ({{circa}}1540–1897) was a [[Pre-colonial African kingdoms|pre-colonial state]] off the coast of [[Southeast Africa]] that, by the 19th century, dominated most of what is now [[Madagascar]]. It spread outward from '''Imerina''', the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] region primarily inhabited by the [[Merina people|Merina]] [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group]] with a spiritual capital at [[Ambohimanga]] and a political capital {{convert|24|km}} west at [[Antananarivo]], currently the seat of government for the modern state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a [[List of Imerina monarchs|long line of hereditary Merina royalty]] originating with [[Andriamanelo]], who is traditionally credited with founding Imerina in 1540.

==History==

===Hova-Vazimba conflict===
[[File:Imerina countryside riziere rice paddies Madagascar.jpg|thumb|alt=colorful rice paddies cover rolling hills|Andriamanelo waged war against the Vazimba in an effort to expel them from the highlands.]]
Madagascar's central highlands were first inhabited between 200 BCE–300 CE by the island's earliest settlers,&lt;ref name = prehistory&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crowley | first = B.E. | title = A refined chronology of prehistoric Madagascar and the demise of the megafauna | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 19–20 | pages = 2591–2603 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.06.030|bibcode = 2010QSRv...29.2591C }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vazimba]], who appear to have arrived by [[pirogue]] from southeastern [[Borneo]] to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests.{{sfn|Dahl|1991|p=72}} By the 15th century the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] people from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands&lt;ref name="Campbell 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | title = The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750–1810 | journal = The International Journal of African Historical Studies | volume = 26 | issue = 1 |pages = 111–148 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.2307/219188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings and queens.{{sfn|Ranaivoson|2005|p=35}} The two peoples coexisted peacefully for several generations and are known to have intermarried. In this way, a reigning Vazimba queen (alternately given in the oral histories as [[Rafohy]] or [[Rangita]]) married a Hova man named Manelobe. Their oldest son, [[Andriamanelo]] (1540–1575), broke this tradition by launching a largely successful war to subjugate the surrounding Vazimba communities and force them to either submit to Hova dominance and assimilate, or flee.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=142}}

Andriamanelo was succeeded by his son [[Ralambo]] (1575–1612), whose many enduring and significant political and cultural achievements earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history.&lt;ref name=Ark2&gt;{{Cite web|last=Buyers |first=Christopher |title=The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty: Imerina 2 |url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wcscsZk3?url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bloch|1971|p=17}} Ralambo was the first to assign the name of Imerina ("Land of the [[Merina people]]") to the central highland territories where he ruled.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140&amp;ndash;154}}  Ralambo expanded and defended the Kingdom of Imerina through a combination of diplomacy and successful military action aided by the procurement of the first firearms in Imerina by way of trade with kingdoms on the coast. {{Sfn|de la Vaissière|Abinal|1885|pp=63&amp;ndash;71}} Imposing a [[Tax per head|capitation tax]] for the first time (the ''vadin-aina'', or "price of secure life"), he was able to establish the first standing Merina royal army{{Sfn|Kent|1968|pp=517&amp;ndash;546}} and established units of blacksmiths and silversmiths to equip them.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} He famously repelled an attempted invasion by an army of the powerful western coastal [[Betsimisaraka people]].{{Sfn|Kent|1968|pp=517&amp;ndash;546}} According to oral history, the wild [[zebu]] cattle that roamed the Highlands were first domesticated for food in Imerina under the reign of Ralambo,{{Sfn|Bloch|1985|pp=631&amp;ndash;646}}{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&amp;ndash;142}} and he introduced the practice and design of cattle pen construction,{{Sfn|Bloch|1985|pp=631-646}} as well as the traditional ceremony of the ''fandroana'' (the "Royal Bath"),{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} to celebrate his culinary discovery.{{Sfn|de la Vaissière|Abinal|1885|pp=285&amp;ndash;290}}

Upon succeeding his father, [[Andrianjaka]] (1612-1630) led a successful military campaign to capture the final major Vazimba stronghold in the highlands on the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Analamanga|hill of Analamanga]]. There he established the fortified compound (''rova'') that would form the heart of his new capital city of [[Antananarivo]].  Upon his orders, the first structures within this fortified compound (known as the [[Rova of Antananarivo]]) were constructed: several traditional royal houses were built, and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed. These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance, ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995. Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder, materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina.
&lt;!--
===Establishing the Merina identity===

--&gt;

===Expansion of sovereignty===
Political life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave-hunting incursions into Imerina.

===Division and civil war===
King [[Andriamasinavalona]] quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. He extended the borders of the kingdom to their largest historical extent prior to the kingdom's fragmentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Reunification===
[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|left|King Andrianampoinimerina (ca. 1787–1810)]]
It was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King [[Andrianjafy]] of [[Ambohimanga]] (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule.

===Kingdom of Madagascar===
[[File:Ranavalona III of Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranavalona III]] was the last monarch of Madagascar.]]
This objective was largely completed under his son, [[Radama I]], who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo.

The 33-year reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]], the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Her son and heir, King [[Radama II]], signed the unpopular [[Lambert Charter]] giving French entrepreneur [[Joseph-François Lambert]] exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the [[andriana|aristocracy]], however, and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]  had the King strangled in a ''[[coup d'état]]''. This aristocratic revolution saw [[Rasoherina]], the [[queen dowager]], placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a [[constitutional monarchy]] that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, [[Ranavalona II]], converted the nation to Christianity and had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen [[Ranavalona III]], acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to [[Réunion Island]] and later [[French Algeria]] following [[French Madagascar|French colonisation]] of the island in 1896.

===French colonisation===
{{main|Franco-Hova Wars}}
[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur à Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 and 24 May 1895.]]
Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, [[French Third Republic|France]] invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the [[First Madagascar expedition|First Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' referring to the ''[[andriana]]''). At the war’s end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats [[Berlin Conference|partitioning the African continent]] worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over [[Heligoland]] to the [[German Empire]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.

In 1895, a French [[flying column|flying-column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city’s defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French [[Protectorate|protection]] as the [[Malagasy Protectorate]] and in 1897 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.{{Sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=142}}

==Geography==

===Spatial organization===
[[File:Map of sacred hills of Imerina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=map showing villages of highland Madagascar around Antananarivo|Sacred hills of Imerina]]
Andriamanelo established the first fortified ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|rova]]'' (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora. This fortified palace bore specific features - ''[[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|hadivory]]'' (dry moats), ''hadifetsy'' (defensive trenches) and ''vavahady'' (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier) - that rendered the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks.{{Sfn|de la Vassière|Abinal|1885|p=62}}

Andrianjaka's policies and tactics highlighted and increased the separation between the king and his subjects. He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2005|p=120}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}

Andrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]] at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka.&lt;ref name="Ark2"/&gt; These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when [[Andrianampoinimerina]] redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.{{Sfn|Administration coloniale|1898|p=895}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}

Under Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (''toko''): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest.  Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people.{{Sfn|Campbell|2012|p=500}}

==Social organization==

===Caste system===
Andriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.{{Sfn|Miller|Rowlands|1989|p=143}} From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140&amp;ndash;154}} The first sub-divisions of the ''[[andriana]]'' noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&amp;ndash;142}}

Andrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).&lt;ref name = Piolet&gt;Piolet (1895), pp. 209&amp;ndash;210&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|small sacred house]] on top of his tomb.  Future [[Merina]] sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}

===Religion===
{{main|Malagasy mythology}}
Andriamanelo is credited with introducing [[astrology]] (''sikidy'') in Imerina.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers.{{Sfn|Radimilahy|1993|pp=478-483}}

[[File:Sampy talisman idol Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=boar tusks and metal trinkets fastened with twine to a cluster of wooden dowels|Each ''sampy'' was fashioned from diverse components.]]
Under Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the ''[[sampy]]'', traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ''ody'' had long occupied an important place among many [[ethnic groups of Madagascar]], but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful ''sampy'' called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified&amp;mdash;complete with a distinct personality&amp;mdash;and offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy&amp;mdash;twelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology&amp;mdash;and transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.{{Sfn|Graeber|2007|pp=35&amp;ndash;38}}  Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against [[Sakalava]] marauders.{{Sfn|de la Vaissière|Abinal|1885|pp=63&amp;ndash;71}} The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&amp;ndash;142}} These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the ''sampin'andriana'': the "Royal Sampy") which were all in the possession of the king.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&amp;ndash;142}} These royal sampy, including ''Kelimalaza'', continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen [[Ranavalona II]] upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|p=118}}

Also beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual ''fandroana'' festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&amp;ndash;70}} Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an "orgy") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&amp;ndash;70}} On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to [[Anointing|anoint]] the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.{{Sfn|de la Vaissière|Abinal|1885|pp=285&amp;ndash;290}} Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar. The [[confit]] would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=29}}

===Customs===
The marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry&amp;mdash;meat from the hindquarters of a sheep&amp;mdash;which he believed to be the tastiest portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kent | first = R.K. | title = Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 517&amp;ndash;546 | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700009026 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic [[piastre]], sums of money and other gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandidier |first=Guillaume |title=Le mariage à Madagascar |journal=Bulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris |volume=4 |pages=9&amp;ndash;46 |year=1913 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515034605/http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 |archivedate=May 15, 2010 |doi=10.3406/bmsap.1913.8571 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andriamanelo's son Ralambo is credited with introducing the tradition of polygamy in Imerina.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} He also introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}

According to oral history, the institution of lengthy formal mourning periods for deceased sovereigns in Imerina may also have begun with the death of Andrianjaka. He was succeeded by his son, [[Andriantsitakatrandriana]].&lt;ref name = Piolet/&gt;

==Political organization==
[[File:Besakana traditional Merina andriana house Rova Antananarivo Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Large wooden rectangular house with steeply peaked roof in thatch|Besakana, Andrianjaka's residence at the [[Rova of Antananarivo]]]]
The line of succession in Imerina used a system called ''fanjakana arindra'' ("organized government"),{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}} which was established by the Vazimba noblewomen who raised Andriamanelo, founder of Imerina. While the Vazimba had historically tended to favor rule by queens, the Hova favored male heirs, and the marriage between Andriamanelo's Vazimba and Hova parents had produced two sons and a daughter. To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.{{Sfn|Kus|1982|pp=47-62}} This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}}  Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line.&lt;ref name="iarivo"&gt;{{Cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}

Imerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora. The capital was shifted by his son Ralambo to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby.&lt;ref name=Ark2/&gt; Andrianjaka moved his capital from Ambohidrabiby to [[Ambohimanga]] upon ascending to the throne around 1610&lt;ref name="iarivo"/&gt; or 1612.&lt;ref name="Ark2"/&gt; The Besakana, Masoandrotsiroa and Fitomiandalana houses at the Rova of Antananarivo were preserved and maintained over the centuries by successive generations of Merina sovereigns, imbuing the structures with deep symbolic and spiritual meaning. As Andrianjaka's residence, the Besakana was particularly significant: the original building was torn down and reconstructed in the same design by [[Andriamasinavalona]] around 1680, and again by Andrianampoinimerina in 1800, each of whom inhabited the building in turn as their personal residence. King [[Radama I]] likewise inhabited the building for much of his time at the Rova,{{Sfn|Frémigacci|1999|p=427}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}} and in 1820 he designated the building as the first site to house what came to be known as the [[Education in Madagascar|Palace School]], the first formal European-style school in Imerina.{{Sfn|Ralibera|1993|p=196}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}} Sovereigns were enthroned in this building and their mortal remains were displayed here before burial,{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|pp=241-242}} rendering Besakana "the official state room for civil affairs... regarded as the throne of the kingdom."{{Sfn|Featherman|1888|p=}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}

===Defense===
The early Merina fighters under the first king of Imerina were equipped with iron-tipped spears, an innovation credited to Andriamanelo himself, who may have been the first among the Hova to use smithed iron in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Madatana |title=Alasora: Royaume d'Andriamanelo et terre des Velondraiamandreny |publisher=www.madatana.com |year=2011 |url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |accessdate=November 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xfc6eB32?url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |archivedate=April 3, 2011 |language=French |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice system===
Andrianjaka imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the [[trial by ordeal]]: rather than administering ''[[tangena]]'' poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1970), p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and trade==
Andriamanelo was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora.{{Sfn|Rafidinarivo|2009|p=84}} Under Andrianjaka, the plains surrounding Antananarivo were gradually transformed into vast, surplus-producing rice paddies.&lt;ref name="Souverains"&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; This feat was accomplished by mobilizing large numbers of his able-bodied subjects to construct dikes that enabled the redirection of rainwater for controlled flooding of planted areas.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|pp=47-48}}

Andrianjaka was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms to aid in the pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 guns and three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}

===Technology===
Andriamanelo is traditionally credited with discovering the technique of silversmithing, iron smithing and the construction and use of [[pirogue]]s.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} While these technologies were not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in [[Imerina]] to make wide-scale use of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Madatana |title=Alasora: Royaume d'Andriamanelo et terre des Velondraiamandreny |publisher=www.madatana.com |year=2011 |url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |accessdate=November 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xfc6eB32?url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |archivedate=April 3, 2011 |language=French |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 13th century [[Common Era|BC]], the Kingdom of [[Colchis]] was formed as a result of the increasing consolidation of the tribes inhabiting the region, which covered modern western Georgia. The endonym ''Margali'' (მარგალი) is presumably reflected in the Greek ''Manraloi'' (Μάνραλοι), recorded as a people of Colchis by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century BC.

By the mid-3rd century, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of Lazica (or [[Lazica|Egrisi]] in Georgian sources). In the 5th century, the first Christian king [[Gubazes I of Lazica]] declared [[Christianity]] as a [[state religion]] of Lazica. Locals began to have closer contact with the Greeks and acquired various [[Culture of Greece|Hellenic]] cultural traits, including in some cases the language. From 542 to 562, Lazica was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires, culminating in the [[Lazic War]]. Emperor [[Heraclius]]'s offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arabs]] in the second half of the 7th century.

In the 7th century Lazica fell to the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Muslim conquest]], however in the 8th century combined Lazic and [[Abasgoi|Abasgian]] forces successfully repelled the Arab occupation. In 780 Lazica was incorporated to [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] as a result of dynastic succession, the latter led the unification of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century. The nobility and clergy of Lazica switched from the Hellenic ecclesiastic tradition to the Georgian, and Georgian became the language of culture and education. After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Mingrelia was an autonomous principality within the [[Kingdom of Imereti]], until being annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in the 19th century.[[File:Merr Zuther Del'. Interview between Omer Pacha &amp; A Mingrelian lady. Head quarters choloni. Laurence Oliphant.

An episode of the [[Crimean War]].]]
In several censuses under the Russian Empire and the early [[Soviet Union]], Megrelians were considered a separate group, largely because at the time of the annexation Samegrelo was politically separate from eastern Georgia, the historical political and cultural centers of the Medieval Georgian Kingdoms. They were, reclassified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. Currently, most Megrelians identify themselves as a subgroup of the Georgian nation and have preserved many characteristic cultural features -  including the Megrelian language - that date back to the pre-Christian [[Colchis|Colchian]] era.

The first President of an independent Georgia, [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] (1939–1993), was a Megrelian.&lt;ref name="McCauley, Martin 1900. pg. 1"&gt;McCauley, Martin. Who's who in Russia since 1900. Psychology Press, 1997: pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, after the violent coup d'état of December 21, 1991 - January 6, 1992, Samegrelo became the centre of a [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]], which ended with the defeat of Gamsakhurdia's supporters.

Approximately 180,000-200,000 people of Georgian and Megrelian provenance have been expelled from Abkhazia as a result of the [[Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]] in the early 1990s and the ensuing [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of Georgians]] in this separatist region.

'''Moscow City Day''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: День города Москвы) is an official event in [[Moscow]] that honors the city's founding. Moscow traditionally celebrates during the first weekend in September. The celebration involves free cultural events, a parade and evening fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s.mos.ru/common/upload/353-pp_9_avgusta_2011_g.pdf|title=Перечень праздничных, памятных дней, дней проведения торжественных и иных мероприятий, к которым на территории города обеспечивается праздничное и тематическое оформление|publisher=Официальный сайт Мэра Москвы|accessdate=2018-09-02|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntv.ru/cards/2061/|title=День города: как и где отмечать праздник|website=Ntv.ru|accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Moscow City Day was on January 1, 1847, celebrating Moscow's 700th anniversary. At the end of prayers held in the [[Chudov Monastery]], the bells in the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] sounded. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1947, this time during Soviet rule. According to a mandate of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], a special medal was awarded to almost 1.7 million Soviet citizens. In 1997, the 850th anniversary of Moscow was celebrated. 

Moscow Day was introduced as an annual event in 1986 by President [[Boris Yeltsin]], who served as Secretary of the Moscow City Committee at the time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web|url=&lt;/nowiki&gt;https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/europe/russia/moscow/city-events/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==
About 1,000 different events and activities are held during the holiday, including parades, fairs, street entertainment, sports contests, and live music concerts. 67 Moscow museums offer free admission. Over 170 free walking and bicycle tours are organised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.russiaeguide.com/moscow-city-day/|title=Moscow City Day Russia E-guide|website=Russiaeguide.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/travel/2017/08/26/how-to-celebrate-moscow-city-day-like-a-local_828752|title=How to celebrate Moscow City Day like a local|first=Anna|last=Sorokina|date=26 August 2017|website=Rbth.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/best-of-moscow-party-on-down-at-city-day-55246|title=Best of Moscow: City Day Celebrations|website=Themoscowtimes.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.russiaeguide.com/moscow-city-day/|title=Moscow City Day - Russia E-guide|date=2014-09-01|work=Russia E-guide|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Parade===
The celebrations begin with a procession along [[Tverskaya Street]] and finishes at the [[Kremlin]]. Tverskaya traditionally transforms into a pedestrian zone. The parade usually includes various national academic and military marching bands, and occasionally the participants of the [[Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo]], which takes place earlier in the month.

===Concerts===
Evening concerts usually take place in large areas such as [[Red Square]], [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] and [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manezhnaya Square]]. Classical music concerts are also held at city parks such as [[Kolomenskoye]], Tsaritsyno and [[Sokolniki Park|Sokolniki]]. The [[Patriarch Ponds]] annually hosts a unique concert-on-water. Concerts range from rising independent artists to international performers and urban classical orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-travel.com/blog/moscow-city-day/|title=The Moscow City Day - Russia Travel|date=29 June 2015|website=Russia-travel.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tours of Moscow===
Dozens of Moscow museums offer free admission on this day and historical tours are organised over the holiday weekend. 

===Mass event===
A traditional mass event is held at [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in the [[Khamovniki District]]. The event features amusement rides, games and competitions.

The center is well known for the public non-commercial open-air events on historical, sociourbanistic and natural subjects, which feature comments of the leading experts in these fields like [[Valentin Yanin]], [[Andrey Zaliznyak]], [[Natalia Dushkina]], [[Alexey Muratov]], [[Maria Makogonova]] and others.

The central idea of Moskultprog is to present recent and interesting urban studies with the help of their authors as guides. Moskultprog's events are commonly known as ''progulki'' (walks) and normally attract around 150-200 people, for their character they are sometimes described as the "biggest scientific seminar in the world".

Since 2007 Sergey Nikitin and Moskultprog are realizing [[Moscow]] Velonight (''Московская Велоночь'', ''Velonotte Mosca'', a sort of open-air night lecture with hundreds of  followers by bike. In 2010 Moskultprog plans to present the first Italian edition of Velonight -  [http://www.velonotte.blogspot.com Velonotte Roma 2010], dedicated to the contemporary architecture and sociourbanistic development of [[Rome]].

Moskultprog also produces architecture and urbanistic exhibitions, among them - "Elements of Tverskaya" ([[Arch Moscow]]-2008), "Leonidov 2" (for the 1st edition of the [[Moscow Architecture Biennale]]), demonstrating recently discovered work of [[Ivan Leonidov]].

{{Unreferenced|date=September 2012}}The '''Okandé''' are a people of north-eastern [[Gabon]] who belong to the Mèmbè  language group (Okandè, Apindzi, Simba, Vové, Tsogho, Evia and Kotakota). Their language overlaps that of the Apindzi and the Simba about 80/86% according to professor Van Der Veen. Their estimated population of 2,000 persons (in 2003) live in the [[Lope Department|Lopé]] region  in [[Ogooué-Ivindo Province|Ogooué-Ivindo]]. The Mwiri, a male initiation institution, still plays an important role in the traditional social and religious life of the Okandé.

While their history is little known today, the archives do speak of them. The Okandè, fierce conservators of their environment, through their initiation rites, (Douwa, Diyandzi, Ghétolè, Bwété, Mwiri) were formerly dubbed the "kings of the Ogooué, the vainquishers of the rapids", better known than the [[Adouma]] and the [[Sisiwu]], have taught their traditions, such as navigation of the Ogooué, [[okuyi|okouyi]] dancing, Mvudi, Bodi, Mboudi, Mouiri, Ndjèmbè and others) to the Galois, Enènga, Aduma, Mbangwè and Sisiwu. Seasoned canoers, the Okandè helped the explorer  [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] and his successors up the Ogooué to its source towards the end of the 18th century. They were longtime slave traders; the Adouma came down the Ogooué to the Lopé to sell them slaves, and in turn the Okandé brought them in [[pirogues]] specially adapted to the rocks and rivers of the Ogooué to sell them to the Enènga of [[Lambaréné]].

Only the Okandè and the Kotakota (derived from the Apinzi of the Ogooué) of [[Ndjolé]], or, rarely, the Enènga, attempted the Ogooué in its most complex stretch, from [[Lambaréné]] to [[Booué]], which the Galois and Enènga called "Orèmbo Okandè", or the river of the Okandè. The Okandè named the river the Ogooué,  and also, between Lambaréné and Booué, many watercourses, islets, rapids and so on bear names given to them by the piroguiers of the Okandè, such as Talaghougha, Abanga, Offoué, Okano, Lélédi, Ivindo, Booué, Ngomo, and Ashouka. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The banks of the Okandé are covered in virgin forests interrupted at lengthy intervals by clearings where the Akellas have established small villages, very useful to travelers for the purchase of provisions.[[Hippopotamus]]es abound in the Okandé. Beyond Samiketa the riverbanks get much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lL4WAQAAIAAJ |via=Google Books, University of California |page=60|year=1876|work=Le Cosmos; revue des sciences et de leurs applications |volume=39|title=Voyages en Afrique de Monsieur le docteur Lenz|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Racial antisemitism''' is a form of [[antisemitism]] or prejudice against [[Jews]] based on the belief that Jews are a racial or ethnic group, rather than prejudice against [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is based on the premise that Jews constitute a distinctive [[Race (human classification)|race]] or ethnic group, whose traits or characteristics are in some way abhorrent or inherently inferior or otherwise different to that of the rest of society. The abhorrence may be expressed in the form of stereotypes  or caricatures. Racial antisemitism may present Jews, as a group, as being a threat in some way to the values or safety of society. Racial antisemitism could be seen as worse than religious antisemitism because for religious antisemites conversion was an option and once converted the 'Jew' was gone.  With racial antisemitism a Jew could not get rid of their Jewishness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roots of Hate|last=Brustein|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=173|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving  behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]] and the ''[[Haskalah]]'' (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews, and the influx of Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe, soon led to the newer, and often more virulent, racist antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171|title=Antisemitism in History: Racial Antisemitism, 1875–1945|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[Scientific racism]], the ideology that genetics played a role in group behavior and characteristics, was highly respected and accepted as fact between the years of 1870 and 1940. It was not only antisemites that believed in race science but highly educated Jews, among others, as well. This acceptance of race science made it possible for antisemites to clothe their hatred of Jews in scientific theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roots of Hate|last=Brustein|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=95–96|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logic of racial antisemitism was extended in [[Nazi Germany]], where racial antisemitic ideas were turned into law, which looked at the "blood" or ethnicity  of a person, and  not their current religious affiliations, and their fate would be determined purely on that basis. When added to its views on the Jewish racial traits which the Nazi pseudoscience devised, led to the [[Holocaust]] as a way of eradicating conjured up "Jewish traits" from the world.

==''Limpieza de sangre''==
Racial antisemitism has existed alongside religious antisemitism since the [[Middle Ages]], if not earlier.  In [[Spain]] even before the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Expulsion]] of 1492, [[Sephardi|Spanish Jews]] who [[religious conversion|converted]] to [[Catholicism]] (''[[conversos]]'' in Spanish), and their descendants, were called [[New Christians]]. They were frequently accused of lapsing to their former religious practices ("[[Crypto-Jews]]"). To isolate ''conversos'', the Spanish nobility developed an ideology of "[[cleanliness of blood]]". The ''conversos'' were called "New Christians" to indicate their inferior status in society. That ideology was a form of racism, as in the past there were no grades of Christianity and a convert had equal standing. Cleanliness of blood was an issue of ancestry, not of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1449,&lt;ref name="Chami"&gt;[http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html Estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre], Pablo A. Chami.&lt;/ref&gt; where an anti-''converso'' riot lead to ''conversos'' being banned from most official positions. Initially these statutes were condemned by the monarchy and the Church. However, the New Christians came to be hounded and persecuted by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] after 1478, the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] after 1536, the [[Peruvian Inquisition]] after 1570 and the [[Mexican Inquisition]] after 1571, as well as the Inquisition in Colombia after 1610.

==Concept of a "semitic race"==
{{main|Semitic people}}
[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A stylised [[T and O map]], depicting Asia as the home of the descendants of Shem (Sem). Africa is ascribed to Ham and Europe to Japheth]]
In [[Medieval]] Europe, all [[Asian people]]s were thought of as descendants of Shem. By the 19th century, the term Semitic was confined to the ethnic groups who have historically spoken Semitic languages or had origins in the Fertile Crescent, as the Jews in Europe did. These peoples were often considered to be a distinct [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. However, some antisemitic racial theorists of the time argued that the Semitic peoples arose from the blurring of distinctions between previously separate races. This supposed process was referred to as [[semiticization]] by the race-theorist [[Arthur de Gobineau]]. 

Gobineau himself did not consider the Semites (decedents of Shem) to be of a lesser race.  He broke people up into three races: white, black, and yellow.  The Semites, like the Aryans (and Hamites)  came from Asia and were white. Over time each of the groups had mixed with black blood.  The Aryans had stayed pure longer and it was not until more recent times that they had mixed.  It was this mixing of races that would lead to man's downfall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roots of Hate|last=Brustein|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=101|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This idea of racial "confusion" was taken up by the Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007123|title=Alfred Rosenberg|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by the Nazis to perpetuate the idea that the Jews were going to destroy Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The term semiticization was first used by Gobineau to label the blurring of racial distinctions that, in his view, had occurred in the [[Middle East]]. Gobineau had an [[essentialist]] model of race based on the three distinct racial groups, though he had no clear account of how this division arose. When these races mixed this caused "[[degeneration]]". Since the point at which these three supposed races met was in the Middle East, Gobineau argued that the process of mixing and diluting races occurred there, and that Semitic peoples embodied this "confused" racial identity.

This concept suited the interests of [[antisemitism|antisemites]], since it provided a theoretical model to rationalise [[racialised]] [[antisemitism]]. Variations of the theory are to be found in the writings of many antisemites in the late 19th century. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue Alfred Rosenberg developed a variant of the theory in his writings, arguing that Jewish people were not a "real" race. According to Rosenberg, their evolution came about from the mixing of pre-existing races rather than from [[natural selection]]. The theory of semiticization was typically associated with other longstanding racist fears about the dilution of racial difference through [[miscegenation]], manifested in negative images of [[mulattos]] and other mixed groups.

== Rise ==

Modern European antisemitism has its origins in 19th century theories—now mostly considered as [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]], but then accepted as credible—that said that the Semitic peoples, including the Jews, are entirely different from the [[Aryan]], or [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], populations, and that they would not be able to assimilate. In this view, Jews are not opposed on account of their [[religion]], but on account of their supposed hereditary or genetic [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial characteristics]]: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, low cunning, and especially lack of [[patriotism]]. Later, [[Nazi propaganda]] also dwelt on supposed physical differences, such as the shape of the "[[Jewish nose]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/story3.htm|title=How to Tell a Jew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/education/lessonplan/english/antisemitism/antisemitism.htm|title=Education - Lesson Plan: Antisemitism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/lesson_plans/antisemitism_january27.asp|title=Antisemitic Caricature: 'The Jewish Nose is Wide at the End and Looks like the Number Six '}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/522_jews_and_their_noses.htm|title= Jews and their noses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial antisemitic legislation==
[[Image:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|A chart use to explain the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, which used a pseudo-scientific racial basis for discrimination against Jews]]

In Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations and marriage between any Aryan and Jew (such relations under Nazi ideology was a crime punishable under the race laws as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial pollution"), and made it that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens of their own country (their official title became "subject of the state"). This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., to vote. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them having any influence in politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] ([[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]]), [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].

[[Rape]] is a major issue in [[Afghanistan]]. It is a crime which can be legally prosecuted within the nation. In Islam, sexual violation is regarded as a violation of moral and divine law. It is considered a serious crime in the religion of Islam. A number of human rights organizations have criticized the country's rape laws and their enforcement.

==Definition==

'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] usually involving [[sexual intercourse]] or other forms of [[sexual penetration]] perpetrated against a person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, [[coercion]], [[Abusive power and control|abuse of authority]] or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent. This can include one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an [[intellectual disability]] or is below the legal [[age of consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42495/9241545615_eng.pdf;jsessionid=155D5A9E7DEEDAC770F6812C015C6BC7?sequence=1 | title=World report on violence and health | publisher=World Health Organization | year=2002 | location=Geneva | isbn=92 4 154561 5 | editors=[[Etienne G. Krug]], [[Linda L. Dahlberg]], James A. Mercy, Anthony B. Zwi and Rafael Lozano |accessdate=22 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rape. dictionary.reference.com. April 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''rape'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''sexual assault.''

==Prevalence==

Rape in Afghanistan is largely under-reported. In many cases, the victim is punished under Muslim law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/world/un-finds-alarmingly-high-levels-of-violence-against-women.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Violence against women in Afghanistan reached record levels in 2013, according to the [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]] (AIHRC). Women are respected for their virginity, and it is rare for a man to marry a rape victim. Even if the woman gets pregnant, it is uncommon for the rapist to marry her. Thus a woman is now punished for being "impure". The authorities treat such cases as adultery. Even if the woman is not punished, she remains rejected by society as "dishonorable" (badnaam in [[Pashto]]), while the rapist is not considered dishonored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undispatch.com/no-justice-for-rape-victims-in-afghanistan/|title=No Justice for Rape Victims in Afghanistan |date=26 July 2013|work=UN Dispatch |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghan Law==
Rape in the country is a crime which can be legally prosecuted but does not currently have any laws that directly address and protect rape victims or at risk groups. Just the opposite in fact. Afghanistan passed the Shia Family Law in 2009 under Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]], [[NATO]], Canada, United States, Germany and other nations have come forward expressing concern over the oppressive nature of the law. The [[Shia Family law]] takes away women's rights within a marriage and specifies that Shia women must submit to their husband's demands. It even specifies that they must have sex with their husbands at least once every four days except in the case of illness. The law will only apply to Shia women, which totals around 6 million. The argument in favor of this law is that it is an improvement upon the customary regional law imposed previously. With the support of the conservative and political elite, Afghan courts have taken, and continue to take, action in efforts to remove, lessen, or limit women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/defense-sharia-law-12545|title=In Defense of Sharia Law|first=Akhilesh|last=Pillalamarri|work=[[The National Interest]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Available Statistics and Stigma==
Rape in [[Afghanistan]] is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of [[honor killings]] perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country. Women also undertake many smaller personal risks to their social status and daily life:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/02/143057341/for-afghan-women-rape-law-offers-little-protection|title=For Afghan Women, Rape Law Offers Little Protection|publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[All Things Considered]] | author=Lawrence, Quil |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be [[punishable by death]]. Furthermore, they can be forced by their families to marry their rapist which is especially likely if the woman becomes pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/world/asia/woman-jailed-in-afghanistan-on-charges-of-forced-adultery-is-released.html|title=Woman Jailed in Afghanistan on Charges Of ‘Forced Adultery’ Is Released|first=|last=[[Reuters]]|date=14 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the Middle East, including Afghanistan, rape victims are more stigmatized than the rapists. Women who are raped can and are often be punished. While their male counterparts rarely face jail time when accused of rape. Women are often punished as "fornicators" under the [[zina]], the part of Islamic law that has to do with unlawful sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/ruling%20zina.htm | title=The Islamic Ruling Concerning the Criminal Act of Zina | publisher=Mission Islam | accessdate=April 22, 2018 | author=Bilal Dannoun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often persuaded to marry their rapist in hopes of restoring honor to her family. This is also done so the rapist can avoid facing charges. Thus putting women in the, very often dangerous position, of either marrying the man who raped and attacked them or facing honor crimes, possibly murder, at the hands of their own family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/12/06/we-have-promises-world/womens-rights-afghanistan|title=“We Have the Promises of the World” - Women’s Rights in Afghanistan |author=Rachel Reid et al |date=6 December 2009|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Afghanistan made international news in regard to the story of a woman who was raped by a man, jailed for adultery, gave birth to a child in jail, and was then subsequently pardoned by then president [[Hamid Karzai]], as international interest and outrage grew. And in the end of her whole ordeal, societal pressure and her families pressure she was forced to marry the man who raped her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/07/asia/afghanistan-gulnaz-rape-marriage/|title=An Afghan nightmare: Forced to marry your rapist |first=Nick Paton |last=Walsh | authorlink = Nick Paton Walsh|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=April 8, 2015 |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honor killings and 160 cases of rape, but the number for both honor killings and rapes is estimated to be much higher and unreported, especially in the more rural areas. In 2013, in [[eastern Ghazni]], a man attacked a woman and attempted to rape her, and as a result the relatives of the woman killed both the woman and the man in an honor killing. In Afghanistan, crimes such as adultery, rape and trafficking are often conflated with each other, and it is generally not acceptable for a woman and a man to be alone together (unless married or related), and if this happens the response can be very violent:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0215/p04s01-wosc.html|title=Afghan Parliament debates chaperones for women|date=15 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=[[Christian Science Monitor]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; an Afghan medical doctor and his female patient were attacked by an angry mob who threw stones at them after the two were discovered in his private examining room without a chaperon. Recently, the security forces have been also alleged to rape children in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/asia/afghan-doctor-is-killed.html|title=Mob Attacks Afghan Doctor and Female Patient|first=Rod|last=Nordland|date=13 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan ==
During the [[Afghan-Soviet war]] the Soviet forces abducted Afghan women while flying in the country in search of [[mujahideen]]. In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including [[Laghman Province|Laghman]] and [[Kama District|Kama]]. Soviet soldiers as well as [[KhAD]] agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of [[Darulaman|Darul Aman]] and [[Khair Khana]], near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7b69p12h&amp;brand=ucpress|title=The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982|last=Kakar|first=M. Hassan|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=9780520208933|location=|pages=|quote=While military operations in the country were going on, women were abducted. While flying in the country in search of mujahideen, helicopters would land in fields where women were spotted. While Afghan women do mainly domestic chores, they also work in fields assisting their husbands or performing tasks by themselves. The women were now exposed to the Soviets, who kidnapped them with helicopters. By November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama. In the city of Kabul, too, the Soviets kidnapped women, taking them away in tanks and other vehicles, especially after dark. Such incidents happened mainly in the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons. At times such acts were committed even during the day. KhAD agents also did the same. Small groups of them would pick up young women in the streets, apparently to question them but in reality to satisfy their lust: in the name of security, they had the power to commit excesses.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were taken and raped by Soviet soldiers were considered 'dishonoured' by their families if they returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The War Chronicles: From Flintlocks to Machine Guns|last=|first=|publisher=Fair Winds|year=|isbn=9781616734046|location=|pages=393|quote=A final weapon of terror the Soviets used against the mujahideen was the abduction of Afghan women. Soldiers flying in helicopters would scan for women working in the fields in the absence of their men, land, and take the women captive. Soviet soldiers in the city of Kabul would also steal young women. The object was rape, although sometimes the women were killed, as well. The women who returned home were often considered dishonored for life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Afghan Taliban ==
In 2015, [[Amnesty International]] reported that the [[Afghan Taliban]] had engaged in mass murder and gang rapes of Afghan civilian women and children in Kunduz.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/afghanistan-harrowing-accounts-emerge-of-the-talibans-reign-of-terror-in-kunduz/|title=Afghanistan: Harrowing accounts emerge of the Taliban's reign of terror in Kunduz|last=|first=|date=1 October 2015 |website=|publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban fighters killed and raped female relatives of police commanders and soldiers. The Taliban also raped and killed [[midwives]] who they accused of providing forbidden reproductive health services to women in the city.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One female human rights activist described the situation:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''When the Taliban asserted their control over Kunduz, they claimed to be bringing law and order and Shari’a to the city. But everything they’ve done has violated both. I don’t know who can rescue us from this situation.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Reactions==

In 2013, [[Fereshta Kazemi]] played the leading role in ''The Icy Sun'', one of the first films to deal openly with rape in Afghanistan. [[NBC News]] said that her "film breaks new ground for Afghanistan, where victims of rape can be forced to marry their attackers to preserve their families' honor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Mandy|title=Ultimate taboo: Actress takes on rape in Afghanistan|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/25/17087773-ultimate-taboo-actress-takes-on-rape-in-afghanistan?lite|publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=25 February 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092551/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/25/17087773-ultimate-taboo-actress-takes-on-rape-in-afghanistan?lite | archivedate= March 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert James Cindrich''' (born September 22, 1943) is a former [[United States federal judge|United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]] and a former federal judicial nominee to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].

== Early life and education ==

Born in [[Washington, Pennsylvania|Washington]], [[Pennsylvania]], Cindrich earned an [[Bachelor of Arts|Artium Baccalaureus]] degree from [[Wittenberg University]] in 1965 and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] magna cum laude from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]] in 1968. After law school, Cindrich clerked for [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] Judge [[Ruggero Aldisert]] from 1968 until 1969.&lt;ref name="uscourts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pawd.uscourts.gov/Documents/General/history.htm#CINDRICH|title=History of Western District of Pennsylvania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career prior to becoming a judge ==

After a stint as a [[United States Army Reserve]] specialist from 1968 until 1971, Cindrich worked for [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], Pennsylvania as an assistant public defender from 1969 until 1970 and as an assistant district attorney from 1970 until 1972. Cindrich shifted to private legal practice from 1972 until 1978. Cindrich served as the [[United States Attorney]] for the Western District of Pennsylvania from 1978 until 1981, when he again returned to private legal practice until being appointed to the federal bench.&lt;ref name="uscourts" /&gt; While Cindrich was in private practice, he hired future Third Circuit Judge [[Thomas Hardiman]] as an associate at his firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/06235/715557-85.stm|title=Judge Hardiman considered for federal appeals post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal judicial service ==

On August 12, 1994, President Clinton nominated Cindrich to become a judge for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]]. The [[United States Senate]] unanimously confirmed Cindrich in a voice vote on October 6, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/cindrich-robert-j.|title=Cindrich, Robert J. - Federal Judicial Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomination to the Third Circuit ==

On February 9, 2000, President Clinton nominated Cindrich for a seat on the Third Circuit, to replace [[Timothy K. Lewis]], who had resigned at age 44 to work in private practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton6.nara.gov/2000/02/2000-02-09-president-clinton-nominates-four-to-the-federal-bench.html President Clinton Nominates Robert J. Cindrich, Kent R. Markus, John Antoon II, and Phyllis J. Hamilton to the Federal Bench], ''The White House - Office of the Press Secretary'' (February 9, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; With Republicans in control of the Senate in the final year of Clinton's presidency, however, Cindrich's nomination languished, never receiving a hearing before the [[United States Senate Judiciary Committee]]. Cindrich's nomination to the Third Circuit was terminated with the end of Clinton's presidency. In 2001, President Bush nominated [[D. Brooks Smith]] to the Third Circuit seat to which Cindrich had been nominated. Smith was confirmed by the Senate the following year.

== Resignation and life after being a judge ==

On January 5, 2004, Cindrich announced that he would resign as district judge on January 30, 2004 to become chief legal counsel to the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], effective February 1, 2004. Cindrich said he was quitting in part for financial reasons, noting that his lifetime salary offered no survivor's benefit for his wife. "If death takes me early, she is stuck," he told the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] in an article that appeared on January 6, 2004. "She gets zero. In the private sector, by federal law, every pension must contain a survivor's benefit." Cindrich said he also was frustrated by strict sentencing guidelines that he believed removed discretion from judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16626604_ITM|title=Apps - Access My Library - Gale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When the law provides a result that is repugnant, we must still follow the law," Cindrich told the Associated Press in a story that appeared in its feed on February 2, 2004. "And you can only do that so many times before you start to wonder, 'How many more times am I going to put my name on this sentence that I don't believe in?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.november.org/dissentingopinions/Betterpay.html|title=Dissenting Opinions: More Judges Leaving Bench for Better Pay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spanish name|Oseguera|González}}
'''Rubén Oseguera González''' ({{IPA-es|ruˈβen ose'ɣera ɣon'sales}}; born 14 February 1990), commonly referred to by his alias '''El Menchito''' ({{IPA-es|men'tʃito}}), is a U.S.-born Mexican suspected [[drug lord]] and former high-ranking leader of the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (CJNG), a criminal group based in [[Jalisco]]. He is the son of [[Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes]] (alias "El Mencho"), Mexico's most-wanted man. Under his father, he allegedly worked as the CJNG's second-in-command and managed international drug trafficking operations.

He was first arrested in January 2014 in Jalisco, but was released in October for lack of evidence and re-arrested immediately as he walked out of prison. He was then released again in December after a judge considered the evidence against him as insufficient. In June 2015, Oseguera González was arrested again, released a month later, and re-arrested as his release order was made official. He is imprisoned at Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 13, a maximum-security prison in [[Oaxaca]].

==Early life and career==
Rubén Oseguera González was born on 14 February 1990, in [[San Francisco County]], California.&lt;ref name="XLIuj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="demenchito" /&gt; He also holds [[Mexican nationality law|Mexican citizenship]].&lt;ref name="HjQM1" /&gt; He has several aliases, including "Rubén Garibay González", "El Junior", "El Rubencito", "El Rojo", "El Niño", and "El Menchito".&lt;ref name="qwCin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMlz0" /&gt; His last nickname is a [[Spanish nouns#Diminutives, augmentatives and suffixes|diminutive]] of his father's nickname El Mencho, which comes from the [[Phonology#Derivation and definitions|phonetic derivation]] of his name Nemesio.&lt;ref name="demenchito" /&gt; His mother, [[Rosalinda González Valencia]], is the sister of [[Abigael González Valencia]], a former leader of the [[Milenio Cartel]] and [[Los Cuinis]].&lt;ref name="familiares" /&gt; His father, [[Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes]] (alias "El Mencho"), is the leader of the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted men.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt; Oseguera González has two sisters, Jessica Johana and Laisha.&lt;ref name="ctOhr" /&gt;

According to Mexican government sources, Oseguera González acted as the CJNG's second-in-command, just below his father.&lt;ref name="XzF68" /&gt; He was allegedly responsible for managing the CJNG's operations in buying and selling narcotics from South America to Mexico.&lt;ref name="ekm4k" /&gt; He was also accused of coordinating stolen gasoline sales in [[Jalisco]], leading a group of hitmen who killed people who refused to work with the CJNG, overseeing a line of hitmen responsible for protecting CJNG's turf in Jalisco and [[Colima]] from rival gangs like the [[Knights Templar Cartel]] and [[Los Zetas]], and managing the CJNG's financial assets.&lt;ref name="yPmWp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EQ1yP" /&gt;

==2014 arrest==
Since 2013, Mexican authorities were investigating a public telephone booth line and two cellphones linked with high-ranking leaders of the CJNG. According to intelligence reports, one of the mobile lines received a call from the public booth line from a neighborhood Jardines Universidad in [[Zapopan|Zapopan, Jalisco]], prompting an investigation. The [[Mexican Army]] asked the [[Criminal Investigation Agency (Mexico)|Criminal Investigation Agency]] (AIC) branch of the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Office of the General Prosecutor]] (PGR) to investigate the neighborhood and the two mobile lines more closely. The Army began to dispatch [[Undercover operation|undercover]] agents to monitor the neighborhood. On the evening of 29 January 2014, one of the mobile phones was located through [[geolocation]] at a neighborhood in Zapopan before it went out of service. The Army and the Navy decided to send a [[Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales|Special Forces]] unit from [[Mexico City]] to Zapopan to investigate the incident.&lt;ref name="elnorte" /&gt;

At 3:30&amp;nbsp;am. CT on 30 January, the Special Forces unit raided a residence in neighborhood Patria Universidad and discovered Oseguera González sleeping there.&lt;ref name="elnorte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rVyAK" /&gt; As the authorities took down the doors, Oseguera González woke up from the loud noise and jumped from his bed, ran to his backyard, and climbed the back wall to reach his neighbor's property. However, the Special Forces unit successfully surrounded the premises and reduced Oseguera González's escape options. He eventually submitted and was arrested in his neighbor's backyard. Two of his henchmen surrendered at the door without resisting arrest. Two others, who were renting a nearby house, fled on foot but were arrested too.&lt;ref name="elnorte" /&gt; Oseguera González reportedly offered the officers who detained him around [[Mexican peso|MXN]]$17&amp;nbsp;million to let him go.&lt;ref name="al9En" /&gt; Authorities confirmed that they confiscated between MXN$10 to $16&amp;nbsp;million and USD$500,000 at the crime scene, as well as 4 assault rifles, 9 handguns, a grenade, and several rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name="eiIjA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="7QD5m" /&gt; Former Attorney General of Mexico [[Jesús Murillo Karam]] confirmed to the press that no gunshots were fired in the operation.&lt;ref name="qleZB" /&gt;

Oseguera González was flown that day to Mexico City and taken to the [[SEIDO]], Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave his statement and was interrogated by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="SbCuD" /&gt; Government sources confirmed that he had no pending formal investigations or arrest warrants issued against him in Jalisco.&lt;ref name="QD9pU" /&gt; On 1 February, Oseguera González was taken to [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] (also known as "Altiplano"), a maximum-security prison in [[Almoloya de Juárez]], [[State of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="8eGS7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C1OVu" /&gt; Authorities confirmed that he was arrested because of pending charges of money laundering, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of weapons of military-exclusive use.&lt;ref name="t9pP0" /&gt; Oseguera González pleaded not guilty and claimed that he worked in construction and was a car salesperson since he was 16 years old. He also claimed that he inherited properties from his mother after she bought them when he was younger and put them under his name.&lt;ref name="9nnUl" /&gt; 

In response to the military operation that resulted in Oseguera González's arrest, CJNG gunmen hijacked three buses and set them on fire throughout the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]]. No deaths or injuries were reported. The U.S. consulate in Guadalajara sent a warning to U.S. citizens in the city and asked them not to travel in the southern part of the urban area, including the main roads leading to the [[Guadalajara International Airport]].&lt;ref name="XNNtm" /&gt; Once the attacks concluded, the Mexican government asked civilians to remain calm and resume their daily activities.&lt;ref name="jltl5" /&gt; Authorities stated that they would remain on alert throughout the Guadalajara area for other violent responses from organized crime.&lt;ref name="bH219" /&gt;

===Releases===
On 16 October 2014, Oseguera González was released from Altiplano,&lt;ref name="ODBbv" /&gt; but he was re-arrested immediately as he walked out of prison by members of the AIC. He was released because a judge from the State of Mexico absolved him from the following crimes: illegal possession of firearms, having weapons of military-exclusive use, use of resources from illicit origins, and crimes against public health. Once in custody, he was then taken to the SEIDO installations and imprisoned there for two months while the PGR worked on getting his jurisdiction to open a trial against him. On 18 December, he was sent to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2]] (also known as "Puente Grande"), a maximum-security prison in Jalisco.&lt;ref name="e9b7C" /&gt;&lt;ref name="julio24horas" /&gt; 

On 26 December, Oseguera González was released from prison again after a judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence against him for the charges of drug trafficking, overseeing the CJNG's financial operations, and leading a group of hitmen.{{efn|Another source states that a judge ordered his release on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref name="julio24horas" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="PuZO7" /&gt;

==2015 arrest==
On 23 June 2015, Oseguera González was arrested again by the Mexican Army and the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]] in the Lomas de Altamira neighborhood in Zapopan, Jalisco, this time along with his brother-in-law [[Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez]].&lt;ref name="edmLj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JVXiE" /&gt; The operation lasted about 20 minutes and no shots were fired. The officers entered the private neighborhood in several vehicles at around 2:15&amp;nbsp;am. CT and subdued the entrance guard. They then shot the security cameras with paintball guns to obscure them, destroyed several others, and asked the guard to cut the electricity power in the vicinity. As they were in the entrance booth of the neighborhood, the telephone ran but none of them answered. The guard was then asked to kneel down while the officers entered the neighborhood and apprehended Oseguera González, who was inside a vehicle with Rodríguez Castillo. Authorities confiscated several weapons, including 2 customized [[AR-15 variant|AR-15]] assault rifles engraved with the insignias "CJNG 02 JR" and "Menchito".&lt;ref name="IrrVO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VNQMo" /&gt;

According to government sources, Oseguera González was trying keep a low profile and had undergone a [[Rhinoplasty|nose surgery]] to alter his identity.{{efn|Another source stated that it was unclear if Oseguera González had done the surgery to alter his appearance.&lt;ref name="Z3H93" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="6gW1h" /&gt; He travelled without bodyguards to avoid attracting attention from law enforcement.&lt;ref name="1o0gZ" /&gt; The government officially confirmed his identity through DNA and physical tests, and photo evidence.&lt;ref name="cd0U8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fe4uq" /&gt;

At the time of his arrest, he was wanted for organized crime involvement, using resources from illicit origins (money laundering), and kidnapping. The government alleged that when Oseguera González was released from prison the year before, he rejoined the CJNG and began managing their international drug trafficking operations. Once in custody, he was sent to Mexico City and transferred to the SEIDO installations, where he gave his formal declaration.&lt;ref name="S7hRh" /&gt; As Oseguera González arrived at the SEIDO via helicopter, a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] Federal Police helicopter with snipers guarded the premises.&lt;ref name="EmiaE" /&gt;

On 27 June, a federal judge in [[Toluca]] issued an arrest warrant for Oseguera González. He was then transferred to Altiplano prison.&lt;ref name="nx9yf" /&gt; Oseguera González's defense argued that their client was detained on illegal grounds because some of the charges he was arrested for were absolved by a judge before, thus causing [[double jeopardy]]. The PGR countered this argument by saying that the judge's actions did not mean an absolute resolution from the charges imposed.&lt;ref name="AbrKH" /&gt;

===Release and re-arrest===
On 1 July 2015, a federal judge from the State of Mexico ordered Oseguera González's release after concluding that the evidence against him was insufficient and that his [[due process]] had been violated.&lt;ref name="BZbrx" /&gt; The judge stated that when Oseguera González was arrested in June, the officers did not have an arrest warrant against him and entered his private property without legal authorization. He also stated that the detainee was in custody for 9 hours and [[Right to counsel|without a lawyer]] before he was sent to the justice department. When the judge considered that authorities had failed to prove that Oseguera González was involved in organized crime, he was released. This was the third time he had been released in less than a year.&lt;ref name="julio24horas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JRvmA" /&gt; However, as Oseguera González was walked out of Altiplano, he was re-arrested by the PGR, who had a pending arrest warrant against him.&lt;ref name="pJwHQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KZnt4" /&gt; According to government sources, he was wanted for organized crime involvement and for participating in the disappearance of two individuals in [[Tepalcatepec|Tepalcatepec, Michoacán]]. He was sent again to the SEIDO installations by helicopter and escorted by an armed Blackhawk helicopter.&lt;ref name="julio24horas" /&gt;

On 3 July, a federal court approved the PGR's request to keep Oseguera González under a 40-day preventative detention while authorities work on gathering more evidence against the defense. The request was carried out as part of an investigation by the SEIDO against Oseguera González for his alleged participation in kidnapping.&lt;ref name="cMVPW" /&gt; Oseguera González's defense, however, responded by issuing a [[Recurso de amparo|writ of amparo]] in hopes of preventing their client from being detained without charges being filed.&lt;ref name="y9rUO" /&gt; A judge denied the defense's request to remove their client's preventative detention on 16 July.&lt;ref name="EosLT" /&gt; 

On 12 August, a federal judge approved the PGR's request to extend Oseguera González's preventative detention for 40 additional days in order to allow authorities to continue working on gathering evidence against the defense.&lt;ref name="7pKC6" /&gt; Later that day, the PGR decided to remove his preventative detention after considering that they had found enough evidence against him. On 13 August, he was issued an arrest warrant and transferred to Altiplano prison on organized crime and bribery charges. The kidnapping charges were suspended.&lt;ref name="ESoYP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="98jGn" /&gt; Oseguera González was also investigated for his alleged participation in the murder of four people at a restaurant in Zapopan in 17 May 2013.&lt;ref name="vtwi5" /&gt; According to the detainees, Oseguera González planned the attack.&lt;ref name="B2Ara" /&gt;

==Imprisonment and legal status==
On 28 August 2015, a federal court issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera González and charged him with illegal possession of firearms, using ammunition of exclusive military use, having five weapons of exclusive military use, and organized crime involvement.{{efn|A detainee in possession of at least five weapons of exclusive use from the Mexican Armed Forces is charged with ''acopio de armas''.&lt;ref name="cwt2H" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="VnNtL" /&gt; In October, Oseguera González was transferred from Altiplano to [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3]] (also known as "Noreste") in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. He issued a writ of amparo after claiming that he endured mistreatment and torture.&lt;ref name="familiares" /&gt; That same month, the PGR opened another case and issued another arrest warrant to charge Oseguera González for acting as the CJNG's second-in-command and ordering homicides against rival drug members. They also stated that he was responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments. The evidence presented to the court consisted of intelligence reports gathered by law enforcement and lawyers.&lt;ref name="2M3XF" /&gt; On 4 November, a federal court charged Oseguera González with drug trafficking along with five other suspected CJNG members.&lt;ref name="bUwcf" /&gt;

Oseguera González issued another writ of amparo in early 2016 to request a transfer back to Altiplano. In February 2016, however, he was transferred to [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3|Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 13]] in [[Miahuatlán de Porfirio Díaz|Miahuatlán de Porfirio Díaz, Oaxaca]]. His defense responded by preparing a writ of amparo for the supposed violations against their client.&lt;ref name="vDlLV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dv1Xx" /&gt; On 30 June, the PGR via a federal judge in Toluca issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera González and charged him with illegal possession of firearms, using ammunition of military-exclusive weapons, being in possession of at least five military-exclusive weapons, and organized crime involvement.&lt;ref name="n6IAz" /&gt; 

On 22 August, the writ of amparo for mistreatment and torture issued months before was struck down by a judge after he spoke with the prison staff, who denied their involvement in such violations.&lt;ref name="FTv2G" /&gt; On 10 November, a judge approved Oseguera González's request to receive a [[conjugal visit]]. The defendant claimed that he was limited by the prison staff from speaking to his lawyers in the past. The judge did not comment on this matter.&lt;ref name="hWHNm" /&gt;

On 21 February, a court approved Oseguera González's writ of amparo and invalidated his formal imprisonment for organized crime charges. The judge concluded that the charges had several flaws and the evidence presented was insufficient. According to the court, Oseguera González's organized crime charges were based on the testimonies of two Federal Police officers, who described to investigators that he was part of the leadership structure of the CJNG. The judge did not consider this evidence sufficient because the police did not establish how or where they got this information.&lt;ref name="5g7Uy" /&gt; 

The PGR submitted the weapons seized during Oseguera González's arrests, and a cap with the insignias of the CJNG that Oseguera González had in his possession when he was taken into custody, as evidence of his alleged involvement in organized crime. They also mentioned his biological relationship with his father and the fact that two alleged members of the CJNG told investigators that Oseguera González worked below him as evidence. The judge did not agree that the weapons and the cap proved Oseguera González's militancy in the CJNG. The judge also dismissed the two testimonies of the alleged CJNG members because they gave conflicting assertions when investigators showed them a picture of Oseguera González and asked them to identify him.&lt;ref name="aU23o" /&gt; Oseguera González was not released from prison because he had four additional pending charges that were not invalidated by the court.&lt;ref name="0PPat" /&gt;

== Extradition process ==
On 3 February 2017, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera González. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) stated that he had been involved in importing and distributing narcotics from Mexico to the U.S. since 2011. The DEA stated that Oseguera González had several other aliases, including "Rubencito", "El Rojo", "El Ruso", and "El Niño". According to the report, the [[United States Department of Justice]] was going to seize all of Oseguera González assets in the U.S. that were a result of his drug proceeds. With the arrest warrant, the U.S. government could formally request his [[extradition]] to the U.S.&lt;ref name="Drb6r" /&gt;

On 16 October 2018, the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], and Justice announced a joint law enforcement measure against the CJNG, and publicized previously sealed indictments charging Oseguera González. The report stated that between 2007 and February 2017, Oseguera González was responsible for importing and distributing narcotics in the U.S. from Mexico, and of using firearms during and to retaliate for his alleged drug trafficking activities. The U.S. government confirmed that the extradition of Oseguera González was pending.&lt;ref name="aK2Rm" /&gt;

{{Serbs}}
The '''Serbs''' ({{lang-sr|Срби}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Srbi}}, {{IPA-sh|sr̩̂bi|pron}}) are a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[ethnic group]] that [[ethnogenesis|formed]] in the [[Balkans]].  The majority of Serbs inhabit the [[nation state]] of [[Serbia]] (with a minority in disputed [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo]]), as well as [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. They form significant minorities in [[Serbs in Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Serbs in Slovenia|Slovenia]]. There is a large [[Serb diaspora]] in [[Western Europe]], and outside [[Europe]] there are significant communities in [[North America]] and [[Australia]].

The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of [[Southeast Europe]]. They are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] by religion. The Serbian language is official in Serbia, co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro.

==Ethnology==

The modern identity of Serbs is rooted in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and traditions. In the 19th century, the [[Serbian national identity]] was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires. Three elements, together with the legacy of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], the [[Serbian language]], and [[Kosovo Myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ana S.

The origin of the [[ethnonym]] is unclear (see [[Names of the Serbs and Serbia]]).

{{main article|History of the Serbs|History of Serbia}}

===Medieval period===
[[File:Loza nemanjica.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Nemanjić dynasty]] members, most important dynasty of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]]]]
Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26–41}} Up until the late 560s their activity was raiding, crossing from the Danube, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine ''[[foederati]]'' colonies.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|Živković|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|Živković|2002|p=187}} The numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}; {{harvnb|Ćorović|2001|loc="Балканска култура у доба сеобе Словена"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the early medieval [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] is recorded in the 10th-century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', which describes the Serbs as a people living in [[Dalmatia (theme)|Roman Dalmatia]], subordinate to the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|pp=153–155}}

Numerous small Serbian states were created, chiefly under [[Vlastimirović dynasty|Vlastimorović]] and [[Vojislavljević dynasty|Vojislavjević]] dynasties, located in modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Serbia]]. With the decline of the Serbian state of [[Duklja]] in the late 11th century, "[[Grand Principality of Serbia|Raška]]" separated from it and replaced it as the most powerful Serbian state.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=533}} Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] (r. 1169–96) conquered the neighbouring territories of [[Kosovo]], [[Duklja]] and [[Zachlumia]]. The [[Nemanjić dynasty]] ruled over Serbia until the 14th century. Nemanja's older son, [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanjić]], became Serbia's first recognized king, while his younger son, Rastko, founded the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in the year 1219, and became known as [[Saint Sava]] after his death.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=20}}

Over the next 140 years, Serbia expanded its borders, from numerous minor principalities, reaching to a unified [[Serbian Empire]]. Its cultural model remained Byzantine, despite political ambitions directed against the empire. The medieval power and influence of Serbia culminated in the reign of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stefan Dušan]], who ruled the state from 1331 until his death in 1355. Ruling as Emperor from 1346, his territory included [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], northern Greece, Montenegro, and almost all of modern [[Albania]].{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=21}} When Dušan died, his son [[Stephen Uroš V of Serbia|Stephen Uroš V]] became Emperor.{{sfn|Cox|2002|pp=23–24}}

With [[Turkish people|Turkish]] invaders beginning their conquest of the Balkans in the 1350s, a major conflict ensued between them and the Serbs, the first major battle was the [[Battle of Maritsa]] (1371),{{sfn|Cox|2002|pp=23–24}} in which the Serbs were defeated.{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=5}} With the death of two important Serb leaders in the battle, and with the death of Stephen Uroš that same year, the [[Serbian Empire]] broke up into several small Serbian domains.{{sfn|Cox|2002|pp=23–24}} These states were ruled by feudal lords, with Zeta controlled by the [[Balšić noble family|Balšić family]], Raška, [[Kosovo]] and northern Macedonia held by the [[Branković family]] and [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]] holding today's [[Central Serbia]] and a portion of Kosovo.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=27}} Hrebeljanović was subsequently accepted as the titular leader of the Serbs because he was married to a member of the Nemanjić dynasty.{{sfn|Cox|2002|pp=23–24}} In 1389, the Serbs faced the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] on the plain of [[Kosovo Polje]], near the town of [[Pristina]].{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=5}} Both Lazar and [[Sultan]] [[Murad I]] were killed in the fighting.{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=7–8}} The battle most likely ended in a stalemate, and Serbia did not fall to the Turks until 1459.{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=7–8}}

===Early modern period===
The Serbs had taken an active part in the wars fought in the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire, and also organized uprisings; because of this, they suffered persecution and their territories were devastated – major migrations from Serbia into Habsburg territory ensued.{{sfn|Ágoston|Masters|2009|pp=518–519}} After allied Christian forces [[Battle of Buda (1686)|had captured Buda]] from the Ottoman Empire in 1686 during the [[Great Turkish War]], Serbs from [[Pannonian Plain]] (present-day [[Hungary]], [[Slavonia]] region in present-day [[Croatia]], [[Bačka]] and [[Banat]] regions in present-day [[Serbia]]) joined the troops of the Habsburg Monarchy as separate units known as [[Serbian Militia]].&lt;ref name=Gavrilovic-7&gt;{{Citation |last= Gavrilović |first= Slavko |title= Zbornik Matice Srpske za Istoriju |url= http://www.maticasrpska.org.rs/casopisi/istorija_74.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= 21 December 2011 |volume= 74 |year= 2006 |publisher= [[Matica Srpska]], Department of Social Sciences, Proceedings i History |location= Novi Sad |language= Serbian |page= 7 |chapter= Isaija Đaković |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110916135844/http://www.maticasrpska.org.rs/casopisi/istorija_74.pdf |archivedate= 16 September 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs, as volunteers, massively joined the Austrian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Janićijević |first= Jovan |title= Kulturna riznica Srbije |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MQAoAAAAMAAJ |year= 1996 |publisher= IDEA |location=  |language= Serbian |page= 70 |quote= Велики или Бечки рат Аустрије против Турске, у којем су Срби, као добровољци, масовно учествовали на аустријској страни |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102074805/https://books.google.com/books?id=MQAoAAAAMAAJ |archivedate= 2 January 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1688, [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|the Habsburg army took Belgrade]] and entered the territory of present-day [[Central Serbia]]. [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] called Serbian Patriarch [[Arsenije III Čarnojević]] to raise arms against the Turks; the Patriarch accepted and returned to the liberated Peć. As Serbia fell under Habsburg control, Leopold I granted Arsenije nobility and the title of duke. In early November, Arsenije III met with Habsburg commander-in-chief, [[General Enea Silvio Piccolomini]] in [[Prizren]]; after this talk he sent a note to all Serb bishops to come to him and collaborate only with Habsburg forces.

A [[Great Migrations of the Serbs|large migration of Serbs]] to Habsburg lands was undertaken by Patriarch Arsenije III.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983|p=145}} The large community of Serbs concentrated in Banat, southern Hungary and the Military Frontier included merchants and craftsmen in the cities, but mainly refugees that were peasants.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983|p=145}}

The [[Serbian Revolution]] for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cz7pbGvCqhwC&amp;dq=serbian+revolution+1804-1815 |isbn=978-3643106117 |page=144|title=Empires and Peninsulas: Southeastern Europe Between Karlowitz and the Peace of Adrianople, 1699-1829 |year=2010 |last1=Mitev |first1=Plamen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution comprised two separate uprisings which gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire that eventually evolved towards full independence (1835–1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2498513|last1 = MacKenzie|first1 = David|title = Reviewed work: Knezevina Srbija (1830-1839)., Rados Ljusic|journal = Slavic Review|volume = 47|issue = 2|pages = 362–363|year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|author=Misha Glenny|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/g/glenny-balkans.html|title=The Balkans Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804–1999|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415232528/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/g/glenny-balkans.html|archivedate=15 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Serbian Uprising]], led by Duke [[Karađorđe Petrović]], Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country.

===Modern period===
In the early 1830s Serbia gained autonomy and its borders were recognized, with [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia|Miloš Obrenović]] being recognized as its ruler. The last Ottoman troops withdrew from Serbia in 1867, although Serbia's independence was not recognized internationally until the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Ágoston|Masters|2009|pp=518–519}}
 [[File:Gavrilo Princip, cell, headshot.jpg|thumb|[[Gavrilo Princip]], who [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], which triggered the start of [[World War I]].]]
Serbia fought in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13, which forced the Ottomans out of the Balkans and doubled the territory and population of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. In 1914, a young [[Bosnian Serb]] student named [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], which directly contributed to the outbreak of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=542}} In the fighting that ensued, Serbia was invaded by [[Austria-Hungary]]. Despite being outnumbered, the Serbs subsequently defeated the Austro-Hungarians at the [[Battle of Cer]], which marked the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory over the [[Central Powers]] in the war.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=94}} Further victories at the battles of [[Battle of Kolubara|Kolubara]] and the [[Battle of the Drina|Drina]] meant that Serbia remained unconquered as the war entered its second year. However, an invasion by the forces of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] overwhelmed the Serbs in the winter of 1915, and a subsequent withdrawal by the [[Serbian Army]] through Albania took the lives of more than 240,000 Serbs. Serb forces spent the remaining years of the war fighting on the [[Salonika Front]] in Greece, before liberating Serbia from Austro-Hungarian occupation in November 1918.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=542–543}}
[[File:Logor Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Stone Flower (sculpture)|Stone Flower]], a monument dedicated to the victims, including mostly Serbs, of [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]]]
Serbs subsequently formed the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] with other [[South Slavic peoples]]. The country was later renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and was led from 1921 to 1934 by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] of the Serbian [[Karađorđević dynasty]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=544}} During [[World War II]], Yugoslavia was invaded by the [[Axis powers]] in April 1941. The country was subsequently divided into many pieces, with Serbia being directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=545}} Serbs in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) experienced persecution at the hands of the Croatian ultra-nationalist, fascist [[Ustaše]], who attempted to exterminate the Serb population in death camps. More than half a million Serbs were killed in the territory of Yugoslavia during World War II. Serbs in occupied Yugoslavia subsequently formed a resistance movement known as the [[Chetniks|Yugoslav Army in the Homeland]], or the Chetniks. The Chetniks had the official support of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] until 1943, when Allied support shifted to the Communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]], a multi-ethnic force, formed in 1941, which also had a large majority of Serbs in its ranks in the first two years of war. Later, after the fall of Italy (September 1943), other ethnic groups joined Partisans in larger numbers.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=545}}

At the end of the war, the Partisans, led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], emerged victorious. Yugoslavia subsequently became a Communist state. Tito died in 1980, and his death saw [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] plunge into economic turmoil.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=546–553}} Yugoslavia [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|disintegrated]] in the early 1990s, and a [[Yugoslav Wars|series of wars]] resulted in the creation of five new states. The heaviest fighting occurred in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], whose Serb populations rebelled and declared independence. The [[Croatian War of Independence|war]] in Croatia ended in August 1995, with a Croatian military offensive known as [[Operation Storm]] crushing the [[Croatian Serb]] rebellion and causing as many as 200,000 Serbs to flee the country. The [[Bosnian War]] ended that same year, with the [[Dayton Agreement]] dividing the country along ethnic lines. In 1998–99, a [[Kosovo War|conflict]] in Kosovo between the Yugoslav Army and Albanians seeking independence erupted into full-out war, resulting in a 78-day-long [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign]] which effectively drove Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=558–562}} Subsequently, more than 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians fled the province.{{sfn|Gall|2000}} On 5 October 2000, Yugoslav [[President of Serbia and Montenegro|President]] [[Slobodan Milosević]] was overthrown in a bloodless revolt after he refused to admit defeat in the [[Yugoslavian general election, 2000|2000 Yugoslav general election]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=225}}

==Demographics==
There are nearly 8 million Serbs living in their autochthonous region of [[Western Balkans]]. In Serbia (the [[nation state]]), around 6 million people identify themselves as Serbs, and constitute about 83% of the population. More than a million live in [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (predominantly in [[Republika Srpska]]), where they are one of the three [[Nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent ethnic groups]]. The ethnic communities in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegro]] number some 186,000 and 178,000 people, respectively, while another estimated 146,000 still inhabit the disputed area of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Smaller minorities exist in [[Serbs in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Serbs of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], some 36,000 and 39,000 people, respectively.

Outside of Western Balkans, Serbs are an officially recognized minority in [[Serbs in Romania|Romania]] (18,000), [[Serbs in Hungary|Hungary]] (7,000), [[Serbs in Albania|Albania]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Serbs of Slovakia|Slovakia]]. There is a large diaspora in Western Europe, particularly in [[Serbs in Germany|Germany]], [[Serbs in Austria|Austria]], [[Immigration from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Serbs in France|France]], and [[Swedish Serbs|Sweden]]. Outside Europe, there are significant Serb communities in the [[Serbian American|United States]], [[Serbian Canadians|Canada]], [[Serbian Australian|Australia]], [[South America]] and [[Southern Africa]].

===Diaspora===
 {{Main article|Serb diaspora}} [[File:World Map of Serbian Diaspora.png|thumb|Geographical distribution of the diaspora]]
There are over 2 million Serbs in [[diaspora]] throughout the world, although some sources put that figure as high as 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biz – Vesti – Srbi za poslom idu i na kraj sveta|publisher=B92|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=605046|accessdate=2014-04-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213053823/http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=605046|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a large diaspora is mainly a consequence of either economic or political ([[coercion]] or expulsions) reasons. There were several waves of Serb emigration:

* The first wave took place since the end of 19th century and lasted until [[World War II]] and was caused by economic reasons; particularly large numbers of Serbs (mainly from peripheral ethnic areas such as [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]]) emigrated to the United States.
* The second wave took place after the end of [[World War II]]. At this time, members of royalist [[Chetniks]] and other political opponents of communist regime fled the country mainly going overseas ([[United States]] and [[Australia]]) and, to a lesser degree, [[United Kingdom]].
* The third wave, and by far the largest wave, was economic emigration started in the 1960s when several Western European countries signed bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia allowing the recruitment of industrial workers to those countries, and lasted until the end of the 1980s. Main destinations were [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Sweden]]. That generation of diaspora is collectively known as ''gastarbajteri'', after German ''[[gastarbeiter]]'' ("guest-worker"), since most of the emigrants headed for German-speaking countries.
* The most recent emigration took place during the 1990s, and was caused by both political and economic reasons. The [[Yugoslav wars]] caused many Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to leave their countries in the first half of the 1990s. The [[Sanctions against Serbia|economic sanctions]] imposed on Serbia caused an economic collapse with an estimated 300,000 people leaving Serbia during that period, 20% of which had a higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|title=Serbia seeks to fill the '90s brain-drainage gap|publisher=EMG.rs|date=5 September 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529021627/http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregled-rs.com/article.php?pid=208&amp;id=19625&amp;lang=en|title=Survey S&amp;M 1/2003|publisher=Yugoslav Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian is an official language in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and is a recognized minority language in Montenegro (although spoken by a plurality of population), Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Older forms of literary Serbian are [[Church Slavonic]] of the Serbian recension, which is still used for ecclesiastical purposes, and [[Slavonic-Serbian]]—a mixture of Serbian, [[Church Slavonic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] used from mid-18th century to the first decades of the 19th century.

==Culture==
[[Literature of Serbia|Literature]], [[icon]] painting, music and dance and medieval architecture are the artistic forms for which Serbia is best known. Traditional [[Art of Serbia|Serbian visual art]] (specifically [[fresco]]es, and to some extent [[icon]]s), as well as ecclesiastical architecture, are highly reflective of Byzantine traditions, with some Mediterranean and Western influence.

In modern times (since the 19th century) Serbs also have a noteworthy [[classical music]] and works of philosophy.{{sfn|Cox|2002|pp=11–12}}  Notable philosophers include [[Branislav Petronijević]], [[Radomir Konstantinović]], [[Ksenija Atanasijević]], [[Nikola Milošević (politician)|Nikola Milošević]], [[Mihailo Marković]], [[Svetozar Marković]], [[Mihailo Đurić]].

During the 12th and 13th centuries, many icons, wall paintings and manuscript miniatures came into existence, as many Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches such as those at [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]], [[Sopoćani]], [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Visoki Dečani]] were built.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=12}} The architecture of some of these monasteries is world-famous.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=20}} During the same period [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO]] protected [[Stećak]] monumental medieval tombstones were built.

Since the mid-1800s, Serbia has produced many famous painters who are representative of general European artistic trends.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=12}} One of the most prominent of these was [[Paja Jovanović]], who painted massive canvases on historical themes such as the [[Great Serb Migrations]]. Painter [[Uroš Predić]] was also very prominent in the field of Serbian art, painting the ''[[Kosovo Maiden]]'', which was completed in 1919.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=69}} While Jovanović and Predić were both [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painters, artist [[Đura Jakšić]] was an accomplished [[Romanticist]].

===Literature===
{{Main article|Serbian literature}}

Most literature written by early Serbs was about religious themes. Various [[gospel]]s, [[psalters]], [[menologies]], [[hagiographies]], and essays and sermons of the founders of the Serbian Orthodox Church were written. At the end of the 12th century, two of the most important pieces of Serbian medieval literature were created– the [[Miroslav Gospels]] and the [[Vukan Gospels]], which combined handwritten Biblical texts with painted initials and small pictures.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=20}} Notable [[Baroque]]-influenced authors were [[Andrija Zmajević]], [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]], [[Jovan Rajić]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and others. [[Dositej Obradović]] was the most prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while the most notable Classicist writer was [[Jovan Sterija Popović]], although his works also contained elements of Romanticism. Modern Serbian literature began with [[Vuk Karadžić]]'s collections of [[folk songs]] in the 19th century, and the writings of [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Njegoš]] and [[Branko Radičević]]. The first prominent representative of Serbian literature in the 20th century was [[Jovan Skerlić]], who wrote in pre–World War I [[Belgrade]] and helped introduce Serbian writers to literary modernism. The most important Serbian writer in the [[inter-war period]] was [[Miloš Crnjanski]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=565–567}}

The first Serb authors who appeared after World War II were [[Mihailo Lalić]] and [[Dobrica Ćosić]].{{sfn|Bédé|Edgerton|1980|p=734}} Having become the cultural center of the region, other notable post-war Yugoslav authors such as [[Ivo Andrić]] and [[Meša Selimović]], a Bosnian Croat and Bosniak respectively, were assimilated to Serbian culture, and both identified as Serbs.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=565–567}} Andrić went on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1961.{{sfn|Bédé|Edgerton|1980|p=734}} [[Danilo Kiš]], another popular Serbian writer, was known for writing ''[[A Tomb for Boris Davidovich]]'', as well as several acclaimed novels.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=–565–567}} Amongst contemporary Serbian writers, [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]] stands out as being the most critically acclaimed, with his novels ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'', ''Landscape Painted with Tea'' and ''The Inner Side of the Wind'' bringing him international recognition. Highly revered in Europe and in [[South America]], Pavić is considered one of the most intriguing writers from the beginning of the 21st century.{{sfn|Sollars|Jennings|2008|p=604}}

===Education and science===
Many Serbs have contributed to the field of science and technology. [[Serbian American]] scientist, inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and electrical engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] is regarded as one of the most important inventors in history. He is renowned for his contributions to the discipline of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Physicist and physical chemist [[Mihajlo Pupin]] is best known for his landmark theory of modern electrical filters as well as for his numerous patents, while [[Milutin Milanković]] is best known for his theory of long-term [[climate change]] caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun, now known as [[Milankovitch cycles]].{{sfn|''Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia''}} [[Mihailo Petrović]] is known for having contributed significantly to differential equations and phenomenology, as well as inventing one of the first prototypes of an analog computer.

===Names===
{{Main article|Serbian naming customs}} &lt;!-- Popular names --&gt;
There are several different layers of Serbian names. Serbian given names largely originate from [[Slavic names|Slavic roots]]:
e.g., [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]], [[Bojan]], [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]], [[Zoran]], [[Dragan]], [[Milan (given name)|Milan]], [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]], [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]], [[Slobodan]], [[Dušan]], [[Milica]], [[Nevena]], [[Vesna (name)|Vesna]], [[Radmila]]. Other names are of Christian origin, originating from the bible ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], through Greek), such as [[Lazar (name)|Lazar]], [[Mihailo]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Ilija (given name)|Ilija]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], [[Ivana]]. Along similar lines of non-Slavic Christian names are [[Greeks|Greek]] ones such as: [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Nikola]], [[Aleksandar]], [[Philip (name)|Filip]], [[Đorđe]], [[Andrej]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]], while those of [[Latin]] origin include: [[Marko (given name)|Marko]], [[Anthony (given name)|Antonije]], [[Srđan]], [[Marina (given name)|Marina]], [[Petar]], [[Paul (name)|Pavle]], [[Natalia (given name)|Natalija]], [[Igor (given name)|Igor]] (through Russian).

Most Serbian surnames are paternal, maternal, occupational or derived from personal traits. It is estimated that over two thirds of all Serbian surnames have the suffix ''[[-ić]]'' (-ић) ({{IPA-sh|itɕ|}}), a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname [[Petrović]] means the "son of Petar" (from a male progenitor, the root is extended with possessive ''-ov'' or ''-ev''). Due to limited use of international typewriters and unicode computer encoding, the suffix may be simplified to ''-ic'', historically transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch'' in foreign languages. Other common surname suffixes found among Serbian surnames are ''-&lt;u&gt;ov&lt;/u&gt;'', ''-&lt;u&gt;ev&lt;/u&gt;'', ''-&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;'' and ''-&lt;u&gt;ski&lt;/u&gt;'' (without ''-ić'') which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov.  Other, less common suffices are ''-alj/olj/elj'', ''-ija'', ''-ica'', ''-ar/ac/an''. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are [[Jovanović]], [[Petrović]], [[Nikolić]], [[Marković]], [[Đorđević]], [[Stojanović]], [[Ilić]], [[Stanković]], [[Pavlović]] and [[Milošević]].&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{cite web |author=Tanjug |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |title=Srbija, zemlja Milice i Dragana : Društvo : POLITIKA |publisher=Politika.rs |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616001236/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbs are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]]. The autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], established in 1219, is led by a [[List of heads of the Serbian Orthodox Church|Patriarch]], and consists of three archbishoprics, six metropolitanates and thirty-one eparchies, having around 10 million adherents. Followers of the church form the largest religious group in Serbia and Montenegro, and the second-largest in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. The church has an archbishopric in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and dioceses in Western Europe, North America and Australia.{{sfn|Cvetković|2012|p=130}}

The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically largely based on Orthodox Christianity and on the Serbian Church in particular, to the extent of the claims that those who are not its faithful are not Serbs. The conversion of the South Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], the split between the Greek East and the Catholic West. After the Schism, those who lived under the Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. Some ethnologists consider that the distinct Serb and Croat identities relate to religion rather than ethnicity. With the arrival of the [[Ottoman Empire]], some Serbs converted to [[Islam]]. This was particularly, but not wholly, the case in [[Ottoman Bosnia|Bosnia]]. Since the second half of the 19th century, some Serbs converted to Protestantism,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} while historically some Serbs were Catholics (especially in [[Dalmatia]]; e.g. [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]).&lt;ref name="Hidden"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Christian Promitzer |author2=Klaus-Jürgen Hermanik |author3=Eduard Staudinger |last-author-amp=yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbwXKXeCGPIC&amp;pg=PA183 |title=(Hidden) Minorities: Language and Ethnic Identity Between Central Europe and the Balkans |publisher=The Lit Verlag in 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102074805/https://books.google.com/books?id=nbwXKXeCGPIC&amp;pg=PA183 |archivedate=2 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of Serbs remain predominantly Serbian Orthodox Christians.

===Symbols===
{{see also|National symbols of Serbia}}

Among the most notable national and ethnic symbols are the [[flag of Serbia]] and the [[coat of arms of Serbia]]. The flag consists of a red-blue-white [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]], rooted in [[Pan-Slavism]], and has been used since the 19th century. Apart from being the national flag, it is also used officially in [[Republika Srpska]] (by Bosnian Serbs) and as the official ethnic [[Flag of Serbs of Croatia|flag of Croatian Serbs]]. The coat of arms, which includes both the [[Serbian eagle]] and [[Serbian cross]], has also been officially used since the 19th century, its elements dating back to the Middle Ages, showing Byzantine and Christian heritage. These symbols are used by various Serb organisations, political parties and institutions. The [[Three-finger salute (Serbian)|Three-finger salute]], also called the "Serb salute", is a popular expression for ethnic Serbs and Serbia, originally expressing [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodoxy]] and today simply being a symbol for ethnic Serbs and the Serbian nation, made by extending the thumb, index, and middle fingers of one or both hands.

The tradition is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity.&lt;ref name=EB70&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;pg=PA70|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|pages=70–|id=GGKEY:ES2RY3RRUDS|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102074805/https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;pg=PA70|archivedate=2 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn [[feast day]].&lt;ref name="Celia Jaes Falicov 1991 219"/&gt;
*Serbs have [[Serbian Christmas traditions|their own customs regarding Christmas]], which includes the sacral tree, the ''[[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]]'', a young oak.
*On Orthodox [[Easter]], Serbs have the tradition of [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture|Slavic Egg decorating]].

Serbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Despite this, it has evolved and achieved its own culinary identity. Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and feast days, i.e., ''[[slava]]''.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, [[Turkish coffee]] is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer [[bread and salt]] to guests, and also ''[[slatko]]'' (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include ''[[kajmak]]'' (a dairy product similar to [[clotted cream]]), ''[[proja]]'' (cornbread), ''[[kačamak]]'' (corn-flour porridge), and ''[[gibanica]]'' (cheese and kajmak pie). [[Ćevapčići]], caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the [[national dish]] of Serbia.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}}

[[Slivovitz#Serbia|Šljivovica]] (Slivovitz) is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is the national fruit.

== History and development  ==
The sex robot has evolved from sex doll precursors that stem back as far as the 17th century, during which Dutch sailors created hand sewn masturbation puppets made of cloth, leather, and old clothes. Many scholars consider this creation to be the direct predecessor of modern sex dolls. Much of the inspiration for creating the modern sex doll came from mannequin-based art created by [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dali]]. Man Ray claimed that [[surrealists]], including himself and Dali, infused their work with eroticism and personally "violated" their mannequins. For example, Dali’s ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'' centered on a female mannequin whose half undressed body was crawling with live snails.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Julie. A (Straight, Male) History of Sex Dolls. The Atlantic , 6 Aug. 2014, https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/a-straight-male-history-of-dolls/375623/.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, sex dolls were first advertised in pornographic magazines and became available for purchase via mail. These sex dolls were inflatable with air; consisting of penetration areas at the mouth, vagina, and anus. However, due to their inflatable nature, these dolls were subject to deterioration and were not sustainable for constant use. By the 1970’s, materials such as latex and silicone were widely used in the manufacturing of sex dolls to facilitate enhanced durability and a greater resemblance to a human.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Anthony. ''The Sex Doll: A History''. McFarland, 2010. p 31. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4794-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The realism of sex robots greatly accelerated in the late 1990s. In 1997, Matt McMullen began constructing lifelike, tin-cure silicon mannequins called [[RealDoll]]s that were ‘realistic, posable, and life-sized’. McMullen received much criticism about the anatomical correctness of his mannequins; using this as motivation to create a more enhanced version. In 2009, McMullen switched to using platinum material, instead of tin-cure silicon, to further enhance the durability and lifelike nature of the doll. Consequently, all other sex doll manufacturers have followed suit. Many manufacturers, including McMullen, believed that companionship is a critical part of the sex bot dynamic and that incorporating AI into them is the next step.&lt;ref&gt;Leclercq, Cy. AI Sex Dolls Are Just around the Corner. The Next Web , 2018, thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/25/ai-sex-dolls-just-around-corner/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Matt McMullen Interview for The Sex Robots Are Coming.” 4 Press, Channel Four Television Corporation, 14 Nov. 2017, www.channel4.com/info/press/news/matt-mcmullen-interview-for-the-sexbots-are-coming.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, various new models have been constructed to hold conversations, remember important facts, and express various emotions. One such model is "Harmony", created by Matt McMullen, which is customizable by using a mobile app, where users can choose from "thousands of possible combinations of looks, clothes, personalities and voices to make your perfect companion".&lt;ref&gt;Your Perfect Companion in the Palm of Your Hands. Realbotix, 2018, realbotix.com/Harmony.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are millions of people out there who, for one reason or another, cannot establish good relationships." He estimates that this will take place by the mid-21st century.&lt;ref name="James2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/sex-robots-278791?rm=eu|title='I believe that it will become perfectly normal for people to have sex with robots'|last=James|first=Jacob|date=23 October 2014|work=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=7 September 2016|location=US edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototypes are being created that imitate human warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/2084051/robot-sex-doll-sex-brothel-paris-cost/|title=What is a robot sex doll, how much do they cost and what is the sex robot brothel in Paris?|date=2018-02-08|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[MIT Press]] published the first book on this topic, ''Robot Sex'', with a preliminary approach to the several challenges this field represent for human beings and societies.

There are ongoing attempts to make sex dolls [[Social relation|socially interactive]]. In 2010, a sex doll called [[Roxxxy]] that had the capacity to play back pre-recorded speech cues was demonstrated at a trade show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/sex-robot-roxxxy-looking-for-action/|title=Sex robot Roxxxy looking for action|last=Hornyak|first=Tim|date=11 January 2010|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Matt McMullen, the creator of the [[RealDoll]] stated that he intended to create sex dolls with the capacity to hold conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Staff writer |title=Sex dolls that talk back |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/technology/robotica-sex-robot-realdoll.html|date=11 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexbots with a male design may be referred to as ''malebots''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mlot | first = Stephanie | title = Everything you always wanted to know about sex robots | url = https://www.geek.com/tech/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-sex-robots-1706373/ | work = [[Geek.com]] | date = 7 July 2017|access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''manbots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Matyszczyk | first =  Chris | title = Ashley Madison used fembots?

In 2017, Matt McMullen created a sex doll called "Harmony" which has the capability of learning about the preferences, wants, and desires of the owner. Furthermore, Harmony can smile, blink and frown in a nearly humanlike fashion. She can hold a conversation with you, tell jokes, remember your food preferences, and the names of your siblings. The cost of Harmony is said to be roughly $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Maras, Marie-Helen, and Lauren R. Shapiro. "CHILD SEX DOLLS AND ROBOTS: MORE THAN JUST AN UNCANNY VALLEY."

He subsequently added a different colored wig and changed her personality by using the app on his handheld device that controls the robot. He named this sex doll ‘Solana’ and considers it to be the sister of Harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Trout , Christopher. “There’s a New Sex Robot in Town: Say Hello to Solana.” Engadget , [[Oath Tech Network]], 10 Jan. 2018, www.engadget.com/2018/01/10/there-s-a-new-sex-robot-in-town-say-hello-to-solana/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
In September 2015, Kathleen Richardson of [[De Montfort University]] and Erik Billing of the [[University of Skövde]] created the ''{{vanchor|Campaign Against Sex Robots}}'', calling for a [[Ban (law)|ban]] on the creation of anthropomorphic sex robots.&lt;ref name="bbc-sexrobots"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118482|title=Intelligent machines: Call for a ban on robots designed as sex toys |date=15 September 2015|access-date=7 September 2016|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other articles:

In September 2015, the Japanese company [[Softbank|SoftBank]], the makers of the ''[[Pepper (robot)|Pepper]]'' robot, included a ban on robot sex.

[[Noel Sharkey]] Aimee van Wynsberghe and Eleanor Hancock of the [[Foundation for Responsible Robotics]] released a consultation report presenting a summary of the issues and various opinions about what could be society's intimate association with robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sharkey | first1 = Noel | last2 = van Wynsberghe | first2 = Aimee | last3 = Robbins | first3 = Scott | last4 = Hancock | first4 = Eleanor | author-link1 = Noel Sharkey | title = Our sexual future with robots | url = https://responsiblerobotics.org/2017/07/05/frr-report-our-sexual-future-with-robots/ | publisher = [[Foundation for Responsible Robotics]] | location = The Hague, Netherlands | year = 2017 }} [http://responsiblerobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FRR-Consultation-Report-Our-Sexual-Future-with-robots_Final.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708003203/http://responsiblerobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FRR-Consultation-Report-Our-Sexual-Future-with-robots_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report includes an examination of how such robots could be employed as a sexual therapy tool for rapists or paedophiles. Sharkey warns that this could be "problematic" in terms of sex dolls resembling children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wakefield | first = Jane | title = Call for a ban on child sex robots | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40428976 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 5 July 2017 | access-date = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable speculation about this technology coming from experts in the fields of philosophy, sociology, and the natural sciences. Scholars such as Chandrshekhar Shrivastava believe that sex robots will facilitate "social isolation" and that sexual relations with robots will "desensitize humans to intimacy and empathy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shrivastava, Chandrshekhar. “Close Encounter: Rise of the Sex Robots.” Infotrac Newsstand, Athena Information Solutions Pvt. Ltd., 10 Aug. 2017, go.galegroup.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=msu_main&amp;id=GALE|A500225399&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Chauntelle Tibbals, "Nothing can replace the joy, sorrow, passion, and pain of an actual, unpredictable human interaction." Kathleen Richardson, the director of the campaign against sex robots,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson , Kathleen. Campaign Against Sex Robots, Sept. 2015, campaignagainstsexrobots.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; firmly believes that we should "start cultivating better relations between each other and leave sex robots to the dustbin of bad ideas". She further argues that only when interacting with another human can we experience our humanity and our identity, as opposed to interacting with a robot.&lt;ref&gt;Spitznagel, Eric. "The Sex Robots Are Coming." Men's Health, June 2016, p. 144. Academic OneFile, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A460469860/AONE?u=msu_main&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=93301ef8&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sex robots that have been created, as of 2018, primarily resemble women with exaggerated characteristics. Kathleen Richardson argues that these sex robots facilitate a powerful attitude towards women's bodies as commodities, and promote a non-empathetic interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Kathleen. “Sex Robot Matters: Slavery, the Prostituted, and the Rights of Machines.” IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 7 June 2016, ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/document/7484884/.&lt;/ref&gt; Experts argue that improving the gender diversity of those involved in developing this sex technology could help reduce possible harm, such as the objectification of women.&lt;ref&gt;“Interactions between Humans and Robots May Eventually Include Sex.” Let’s Talk about Sex Robots, Macmillan Publishers Limited , 10 July 2017, www-nature-com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/news/let-s-talk-about-sex-robots-1.22276.&lt;/ref&gt; In Barcelona, a sex doll brothel allows men to act out their fantasies where they can choose from a selection of flexible silicone dolls and request that they be dressed in whatever outfit the man prefers. Many scholars, including Kathleen Richardson, argue that this ‘reinforces the idea that women are property’, rather than human-beings with free will.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars such as Robert Sparrow argue that the creation of realistic female sex robots, with the ability to refuse consent, further facilitates a [[rape culture]]. He believes that sex with these robots represents the 'rape of a woman' and may increase the rate of rape in society, while also facilitating a general ‘disrespect for women’ in society.&lt;ref&gt;Sparrow, R. Int J of Soc Robotics (2017) 9: 465. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/10.1007/s12369-017-0413-z&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a sex robot called 'Frigid Farah', where its personality is described as 'reserved and shy', has caught the attention of several scholars. The manufacturer claimed that if "you touched her in a private area, more than likely, she will not be too appreciative of your advance". Many scholars view this as indulging rape fantasies and facilitating a rape culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legislation==
The Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots (CREEPER) Act, sponsored by [[Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.]], was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on 13 June 2018. The bill would amend the federal obscenity statute, {{usc|18|1462}} to criminalize importation and transportation for interstate commerce any "anatomically-correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr4655/text|title=H.R. 4655: CREEPER Act of 2017|publisher=govtrack}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Goodlatte]] stated that "these dolls create a real risk of reinforcing pedophilic behavior and they desensitize the user causing him to engage in sicker and sicker behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailywire.com/news/31832/creeper-act-congress-ban-child-sex-robots-james-barrett|title='CREEPER ACT': Congress To Ban Child Sex Robots|author=Barrett, James|date=14 June 2018|publisher=Daily Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and the United Kingdom already have such bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://donovan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/donovan-introduces-creeper-act-ban-child-sex-dolls|title=Donovan Introduces "CREEPER Act" to Ban Child Sex Dolls|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==
Proponents of sex robots believe that sex robots have the potential to provide a valuable service for people who are elderly or disabled and provide them with emotional support say, for example, when the spouse of an elderly person dies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, scholars such as Hojjat Abdollahi argue that these robots can act as "robot companions" that aid elderly people with dementia or depression. After conducting a study on many elderly patients, it was found that elderly individuals were interested in having a robot as their companion and their interest did not decay over time. He further explains that these patients established meaningful rapport with the robot companion and that they greatly valued the presence of the robot.&lt;ref&gt;Abdollahi, Hojjat, et al. A Pilot Study on Using an Intelligent Life-like Robot as a Companion for Elderly Individuals with Dementia and Depression. Humanoid Robotics , Nov. 2017, ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/document/8246925/.&lt;/ref&gt; The robot companion ‘Paro’, created by Takanori Shibata, has been used since 2009 as a therapeutic machine for the elderly suffering with dementia as well as those suffering from depression and anxiety. Paro is designed to respond to touch, remember faces, and learn certain actions that promote a favorable reaction in the patient. Although Paro was not designed to be a sex robot specifically, Paro is an example of how intelligent machines could become a suitable therapeutic option.&lt;ref&gt;Korn, Oliver, et al. Social Robots. A Workshop on the Past, the Present and the Future of Digital Companions. Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, 2017, affective-lab.org/social-robots-a-workshop/&lt;/ref&gt; New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has suggested that sex robots could solve the problem of [[inceldom]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2018/05/02/trending-is-the-robot-in-lost-in-space-hot-or-not/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical discussion==
The ''First International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots'' was held in [[Funchal, Madeira]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cie.acm.org/events/1st-international-congress-love-and-sex-robots/|title=1st International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots|website=cie.acm.org|publisher=Computers in Entertainment: Association for Computing Machinery|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was coordinated by Professor Adrian Cheok and Dr. David Levy. The main discussion revolved around the debate of where we draw the line with regard to cyber love and relationships and what the future of love and sex with robots has in store. Additional topics of discussion during the conference included humanoid robots, robot emotions, roboethics, and philosophical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Love and Sex with Robots, Advances in Computer Entertainment, 2014 loverobots.mixedrealitylab.org/#topics.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 a second conference scheduled for November 2015 in [[Malaysia]] was declared illegal by the Malaysian [[Inspector-general of police#Malaysia|Inspector-General of Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Tarrence|title=IGP declares ‘Sex with Robots’ conference illegal|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=13 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183656/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/|archive-date=2017-09-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reese|first=Hope |title=Academic conference on 'Love and Sex with Robots' abruptly cancelled after being declared illegal|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/academic-conference-on-love-and-sex-with-robots-abruptly-cancelled-after-being-declared-illegal/|work=[[TechRepublic]]|date=21 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hale-Stern|first=Kaila|title=The annual Love and Sex With Robots Conference has been canceled|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-annual-love-and-sex-with-robots-conference-has-been-1738032832|work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=Gawker Media|date=22 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was eventually held in December 2016 chaired by [[Kate Devlin|Dr. Kate Devlin]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loveandsexwithrobots.org/|title=Third International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots: London, 19-20 Dec 2017 | website = loveandsexwithrobots.org | publisher = Love and Sex with Robots Committee | accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin also founded the UK's first ever [[sex tech]] [[hackathon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Tech Hack II |url=http://goldsmiths.tech/sex|website=Hacksmiths|publisher=Goldsmiths Tech Society|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; also held in 2016 at Goldsmiths.

In 2016, a discussion of these issues was held at the 12th [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] TC9 Human Choice &amp; Computers Conference, entitled "Technology and Intimacy: Choice or Coercion?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Dean | first= Jon |title= First ever conference in to sex robots to ask the big questions |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/worlds-first-ever-conference-sex-8771592 |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date= 5 September 2016|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Cheshire|first=Tom |url=http://news.sky.com/story/can-sex-robots-replace-relationships-with-human-beings-10568346|title=Can 'Sex Robots' replace human relationships?|date=7 September 2016|work=[[Sky News]]|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was coordinated by Dr. David Kreps from Salford University. The overall aim of the conference was to 'scrutinize the journey from impersonal monolithic technology towards the intimate intertwining of devices and the self'. A prospective outlook on how these technologies will evolve was closely examined. Some of the main themes discussed during the conference were intimacy, personalization, material culture, and sexual relationships with robots.&lt;ref&gt;“Technology and Intimacy: Choice or Coercion?” HCC12 , Ifip, 2016, hcc12.net/cfp/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, the 13th [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] TC9 Human Choice &amp; Computers Conference "This Changes Everything" will be held in Poznan, Poland. The conference will be led and directed by David Kreps, Kai Kimppa, Louise Leenen, and Charles Ess. The discussion will be focused on the societal and ethical implications posed by artificial intelligence, privacy concerns, and how such technologies have significantly shifted computational strategies and altered the world we live in.&lt;ref&gt;13th IFIP TC9 Human Choice and Computers Conference: ‘This Changes Everything.’”HCC13, IFIP, 2018, hcc13.net/call-for-papers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Intimacy with robots, artificial intelligence, and other human-constructed items are saturated in the media landscape. They provoke questions about what is love, why people crave the need for affection, and challenge pre-existing beliefs of what it means to be human.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Wiseman, Eva. “Sex, Love and Robots: Is This the End of Intimacy?” ''The Guardian'', Guardian Media Group, 13 Dec. 2015, www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/13/sex-love-and-robots-the-end-of-intimacy. DOA: February 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published in 1886, the novel ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' centers around a fictionalized Edison, who creates a female robot for his lonely patron. While the robot's beauty is apparent, the robot lacks the emotional capabilities to fulfill that hole in his heart.&lt;ref&gt;De Fren, Allison. “The Anatomical Gaze in Tomorrow's Eve.” ''Science Fiction Studies'', vol. 36, no. 2, 2009, pp. 235–265. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40649958.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' questions common notions about consciousness. A sentient robot is created with a violent outcome, rebelling against her creators. Throughout the story, ''Ex Machina'' appeals to empathize with the robot as a victim of a man with a [[god complex]]. Responding to the protagonist's uncertainty about her fate if she does not live up to her creator's standards, the robot, Ava, responds "Why is it up to anyone?" about whether or not she lives. This questions the audience's underlying belief about whether or not a robot is entitled to a free life like other conscious beings.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Alex, director. Ex Machina. Universal Studios, 2015. DOA February 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[Lars and the Real Girl]]'' explores the idea of a romantic attachment to artificial human-like items. Ultimately, the film concludes with the protagonist "murdering" his sex doll lover in a river: emphasizing the projection of one's idealized lover onto an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

{{broader|Banlieue}}

The word ''banlieue'', which is French for "suburb," does not necessarily refer to an environment of social disenfranchisement.  Indeed, there exist many wealthy suburbs, such as  [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (the wealthiest [[Communes of France|commune]] of France) and [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] outside Paris.  Nevertheless, the term ''banlieues'' has often been used to describe troubled suburban communities—those with high [[unemployment]], high [[crime rate]]s, and frequently, a high proportion of [[Demographics of France|residents of foreign origin]] mainly from [[African immigration to France|former French African]] colonies and therefore [[Berbers in France|Berbers]], [[Blacks in France|Blacks]], and [[Arabs in France|Arabs]].
&lt;!--
This article only discusses these difficult suburbs, such as many found in the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] northeast of Paris, or [[Vaulx-en-Velin]] near [[Lyon]].  REMOVED; a section could be made, why not, on Neuilly-sur-Seine, etc. It would provide interesting contrast, and if the article gets too big, it can be divided.

==Historical context==

===Rebuilding of France after World War II===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
The destruction of [[World War II]], coupled with an increase in the country's population (due both to immigration and natural increase) left France with a severe housing shortage.  During the 1950s, [[shantytown]]s (''bidonvilles'') developed on the outskirts of major cities.  During the winter of 1954, popular priest [[Abbé Pierre]] urged the government to work on behalf of the country's large [[homelessness|homeless population]].  To relieve the shortage, and end the practice of illegal [[squatting]] in public places, the governments of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] and early [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republics]] began the construction of huge [[housing project]]s.  These included the ''[[New town|villes nouvelles]]'' ("New towns") of [[Sarcelles]], [[Cergy-Pontoise]], [[Marne-la-Vallée]] and [[Sénart]].  These were financed in part by the [[Marshall Plan]], and organized through [[planned economy|central planning]], fixing industrial objectives to meet (''[[Dirigisme]]'').  The ''villes nouvelles'' owe much to [[Le Corbusier]]'s architectural theories, which had been decried before the war.

During the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'', a period of economic growth which lasted from the war's end until the [[1973 oil crisis]], and was accompanied by the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], the French state and industrials encouraged immigration of young workers from the former [[French colonial empire|colonies]], mostly [[Maghrebis in France|from the Maghreb]] (both [[Berbers in France|Berbers]] and [[Arabs in France|Arabs]]), to help fill labor shortages.
[[File:Le Grand Mail de la Paillade.jpg|thumb|The Grand Mail de la Paillade in the Mosson Quarter of Montpellier was built in the early 1960s. View from the summit of Tour d'Assas.]]
In 1962, upon the conclusion of the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian War]] 900,000 ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'' (the European ''colons'' in Algeria, but also Maghrebi Jews) were repatriated to France, as well as most of the 91,000 [[Harki]]s (native Algerians who fought with the French army during the war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/pied-noir.htm|title=Pied-Noir - LookLex Encyclopaedia|first=Tore|last=Kjeilen|website=lexicorient.com|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- please provide sources for numbers --&gt; The latter were put in [[internment camp]]s, while the pieds-noirs settled mainly in the south of France. For example, the city of [[Montpellier]] experienced population growth of 94% between 1954 and 1975 (97,501 to 191,354).&lt;ref&gt;Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques&lt;/ref&gt; Harkis were not officially given permission to migrate, but some French military officers helped facilitate their migration to France in order to save them from certain reprisals in Algeria.  After being freed from the internment camps, many harkis went on to live alongside other Algerian and Maghrebi (both Berbers and Arabs) immigrants in shantytowns. In 1963, 43% of French Algerians lived in shantytowns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cndp.fr/Tice/Teledoc/dossiers/dossier_gone.htm Le Gone du Chaâba] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010217152409/http://www.cndp.fr/Tice/Teledoc/dossiers/dossier_gone.htm |date=2001-02-17 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azouz Begag]], Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities in the government of former Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]), has written an autobiographic novel, ''[[Le Gone du Chaâba]]'', describing his experience living in a shantytown on the outskirts of [[Lyon]].

===Model of urban development===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
The vast new apartment blocks, or flats, were at first chiefly inhabited by members of the middle class. As the housing situation improved, most middle-class residents moved to better houses and immigrants left the shantytowns for the blocks. The blocks are termed "[[HLM]]" — ''habitation à loyer modéré'' ("moderated rent flats"), and districts of blocks are termed ''cités'' (housing estates). You can see some Parisian housing estates here: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/31090725@N08/sets/72157607880274493/].  A popular urban planning concept at this time, popularized by [[Le Corbusier]], a Swiss architect, was to separate areas of towns or cities according to several functions: living center (blocks), commercial center and working center, with the centers being connected by buses. This led to the isolation of the living centers, with two consequences:

* There was little activity at night and on Sunday, aggravated by the fact that bus transit to the central cities was limited;
* When unemployment started to rise in the late 1970s, the children did not see anybody working, as the working center was far away; in the 1990s, a lot of school-age children never saw their parents going to work, and never saw anyone working.

This model became increasingly contested; in the 1990s there were a number of demolitions of housing facilities in "inhumane" areas.

Some towns refused to build social buildings, leaving the poor further concentrated in certain towns which placed no or few restrictions on the construction of [[Public housing in France|social housing]].  An example is the city of Paris: when old buildings were destroyed, only office and high-rent apartment buildings were constructed in their place, preventing the poor from settling in those neighborhoods.  Most were forced to live in the northern suburbs (chiefly in the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] and [[Val d'oise]] departments).  In ''The Global City'' (2001), [[Saskia Sassen]] has analyzed the relationship between a new economic model and the shape of modern cities.  The public services offered (number of police officers, post offices, etc.) did not follow the tremendous increase of the population in these areas.  This phenomenon has been termed "[[ghetto]]isation."

The 13 December 2000 "[[SRU law]]" (''loi de solidarité et renouvellement urbain'', "solidarity and urban renewal act"), required that [[commune (France)|commune]]s devote at least 20% of their housing capacity to social housing.  Many locally elected officials opposed the law, which sought to relieve residential segregation that had developed as a consequence of the earlier, uneven construction of the ''cités''.  In the wealthy Parisian suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], of which [[President of France|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] served as mayor from 1983–2002, less than 2.5% of its housing stock meets the social-housing criteria.  After the 2005 riots, the government announced that it would enforce the SRU law more strictly, although it would accommodate local circumstances such as the absence of land on which social housing could be built.

==Social context==

===Confrontation of cultures===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
The children of immigrants often feel torn between the culture of their parents and the culture they have grown up in. Many may feel themselves fully belonging to neither one.

A typical illustration of this is the use by some members of the French media of the words "second-generation from immigration" (''deuxième génération issue de l'immigration'', opposed to "just arrived", ''primo-arrivants''){{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. If a child is born in France, they are not an immigrant, so the expression "second-generation immigrants" is a [[misnomer]]. According to anti-racist associations such as [[SOS Racisme]], this reflects the ambiguity of the administration, who consider these people to be both French and foreign at the same time{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. Children of immigrants also complain about the use of the term "integration" (''intégration''): the integration in the society (i.e. the acceptance of the laws and customs of the adoptive country) is a necessity for a foreigner; but for someone that has been born and raised in the country, it is improper to ask them to "integrate" into it{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.

===Established policies of racial discrimination and of segregation===
{{Original research section|date=October 2008}}
[[File:Rioting after Nicolas Sarkozy's election, Place de la Bastille, Paris - 20070508-04.jpg|thumb|Place de la Bastille, Paris, following [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s election on May 8, 2007]]
Perhaps the main reason for the alienation perceived among the younger generations in the poorest French suburbs is the perceived [[racism]], both casual and [[Institutional racism|institutional]]. In this particular regard, France has long had a problem with dealing with both its present and its historical memory, especially with respect to [[French colonial empire|its colonial past]] and [[German occupation of France during World War II|its role during World War II]]—especially significant, for instance, is the lack of attention around the [[Paris massacre of 1961#Events|Paris massacre of 1961]] and the still ongoing controversy surrounding the number of victims therein, an amount which as recently as ten years ago was still officially recognized as below 50 although most independent accounts place it by the hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/algerians.htm |title=Nazi collaborator was chief of Police in Paris when 200 Algerians were killed |publisher=Fantompowa.net |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1604970.stm | work=BBC News | title=Paris marks Algerian protest 'massacre' | date=October 17, 2001 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0397/9703036.htm |title=WRMEA &amp;#124; Telling the truth for more than 30 years - A 1961 Massacre of Algerians in Paris When the Media Failed the Test |publisher=Washington-report.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/history/documents/2._gordon_world_reactions_to_the_1961_paris_pogrom.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615091406/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/history/documents/2._gordon_world_reactions_to_the_1961_paris_pogrom.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-15 |title=World Reactions to the 1961 Paris Pogrom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative majority, stating that the positive consequences of [[colonization]] must be taught to students, created a wide uproar, including among many university teachers outraged by what they have called a mark of "[[Historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]", and an infringement on the legal principle of [[academic freedom]].

Today, children of immigrants claim that they frequently encounter economic segregation or [[racism]]:{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} they have problems getting a job, or finding an apartment, or even entering a [[nightclub]], because of their names or skin color. The association [[SOS Racisme]], which has close ties to the [[French Socialist Party]], has claimed to have found experimental proof of such racism:
* When responding to job offers with identical [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]s, except for name and address, to the same companies; CVs with African names received far fewer positive answers than CVs with typical French names;
* They filmed the entrance to selected nightclubs and observed discriminatory acts;
* They found widespread use of abbreviations such as "BBR," short for ''Bleu Blanc Rouge'' ("Blue White Red," the colors of the [[Flag of France|French flag]]), referring to ethnic Frenchmen and "NBBR" (''Non Bleu Blanc Rouge'' - non-French) indicating the use of race in employers' databases;
* They found that discrimination is more widespread for those with college degrees than for those without;
* They found that French laws which make discrimination in employment illegal are rarely enforced, and that even when they are, punishment tends to be nominal.

The [[politically correct]] term for those discriminated against is "visible minority" (''minorité visible''), due to the fact that the segregation applies to any visible feature (color of skin, dress, name) and is not related to the ethnic group itself.

In some neighborhoods in the ''banlieue'', unemployment exceeded 40% in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  One explanation for this is that the general level of education in these areas is well below the national average, which, in a context where it is difficult to find jobs requiring little or no qualifications, is bound to generate high unemployment. According to the BBC, the unemployment rate for university graduates of French origin is 5%; this can be compared to the unemployment rate of 26.5% for university graduates of North African origin. According to the BBC, the inability of educated people who happen to be nonwhite to obtain employment and the connection to documented racism have left many feeling that they face dim prospects regardless of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4399748.stm French Muslims face job discrimination] ''BBC News''. Wednesday, 2 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

French law restricts the access to most civil service jobs (''[[French Civil Service|fonction publique]]'') for people who do not have  french nationality, though there are exceptions to this: some highly qualified positions (e.g. public research and higher education) are open regardless of citizenship, while some positions (e.g. defense and law enforcement) are open only to French citizens. Some sensitive positions (e.g. defense and the nuclear industry) may be difficult to obtain for people with close ties to "problem countries". Finally, not all public jobs fall into the civil service, and restrictions generally do not apply to non-civil service public positions.

Residents of the ''banlieues'' frequently complain that they are subject to [[racial profiling]] by the police ("face features offense", ''délit de faciès''). "Identity Controls" — unannounced places where police demand identity papers from whomever they choose are extremely unpopular and seen as unbefitting a free society. Witnesses to these identity controls confirm that only nonwhites are commonly asked for their papers. The use of identity controls contributes to widespread distrust of police in the ''banlieues''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040414043202/http://www.maincourante.eu.org/article.php3?id_article=48 Délit de faciès] 14 septembre 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5004897 Economic Despair, Racism Drive French Riots] ''NPR'' November 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=332914|title=Libération - Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308052228/http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=332914|archivedate=8 March 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that French police are effectively immune to the law, especially with regard to offenses committed against nonwhites, has also helped to fuel anger against them in the ''banlieue''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' has written that "Justice is at a special tariff for police officers: they are never seriously punished."&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', "La France des 'bavures'", 18 April 2000, www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2000/04/18/la-france-des-bavures_3617227_1819218.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as one in which an eight-month suspended sentence was given to two police officers for manslaughter by asphyxiation against a black man have contributed to the belief that the police are unaccountable to the citizens who employ them. In April 2005, [[Amnesty International]] released a report that suggested that the French judicial system tacitly supports racially motivated violence by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=77668|title=Abonnement Le Monde|website=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur21/010/2005/en/ France: The search for justice: Victims of police brutality at the Paris press conference] [[Amnesty International]] 6 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur21/001/2005/en/|title=France: The search for justice : The effective impunity of law enforcement officers in cases of shootings, deaths in custody or torture and ill-treatment - Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some in the right and especially the [[far-right]], such as [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], claim that youth from the ''banlieues'' enjoy ''de facto'' immunity from prosecution and that most of them should be either sent back to the country of their origin or stripped of their French citizenship. They claim that the police and the prosecution are ordered by the government to be lenient, so as not to attract the wrath of left-wing and pro-immigration organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-11-16/2005-11-16-817950|title=La surenchère de Jean-Marie Le Pen - l'Humanite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic context==

===Income===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
As in every country, some areas have a very high unemployment rate. As the social security, unemployment and other welfare system benefits are not indefinite, and are predicated upon having had a job at one point, families with no paid income do not benefit from the usually generous French social security system. In addition, the amount and duration are based on length of employment and the specific employment contract, further disadvantaging the unskilled immigrants in the banlieues. Welfare benefits include housing benefits and ''allocations familiales'' (welfare benefits for children). The sum that is paid to a non-working family is similar to that which one would receive working at a minimum wage part-time job. In France, there is a minimum salary called the [[Minimum wage|SMIC]]: ''salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance''. This is the minimal interprofessional wage which follows the economic growth of the country [http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F2300.xhtml]. It is illegal to hire someone for less than it. In 2005, the SMIC was 8.86 [[Euro|EUR]] per hour, 1,217.88 EUR per month for a full-time job.

===Housing costs===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
If a family has fewer than three children, it will usually receive financial aid in the form of [[Aide Personnalisée au Logement]] (APL), personalised accommodation help), which is calculated according to the aggregate revenue of the household, and can account for as much as a third or even a half of the rent amount. If the family has three or more children it is not eligible for APL, but receives ''allocation familiales'' (family allowance), the amount of which depends on both the revenue of the household and the number of children, but it is not linear (the difference in the allocation between three and four children is higher than that between five and six, for example). The money is paid to the household, not individually. The housing projects are not rent-free, but are relatively inexpensive, and there tends to be an abundance of cheap rental accommodation in the ''zones sensibles'' ([[sensitive urban zone]]).

===Health care costs===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
In France, the costs of seeing a doctor and obtaining medicine are at least partially refunded by the government, with the proportion varying between 30% and 100%. Low-income families receive CMU (''[[Couverture maladie universelle]]'' - universal health allowance), a law voted in 1997 by [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government, meaning that not only 100% of the cost of medical expenses is paid for, but also that it is not necessary to pay up front for service. The CMU, however, only applies to very poor families. Those in higher income brackets must pay initially and then apply for reimbursement.

===Education costs===
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
Education is compulsory to age 16. After this age, school is optional and is carried out in the lycée ([[high school]]) in preparation for the ''[[baccalauréat]]'', an academic degree. Entrance to both the ''college'' ([[middle school]]) and ''lycée'' are based upon a "sectorisation" system (called ''carte scolaire''), which assigns students to schools geographically. However, one can attend a different public high school through other means, including following a special course of study (such as studying a less-commonly learned language, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). As in many countries, the quality of education offered by different public high schools varies. Some parents chose to send their children to private high schools for a small cost, most of them also receiving funding from government through a contract of association with the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]] (around 2,2 millions students in 2007), other forms of private education (simple contract, outside contract and education at home) being really marginal.

Higher education is divided into three different categories: Universities, which are public; ''[[Grandes écoles]]'' which are public or private, and further study in a lycée towards a ''Brevet de Technicien Supérieur''. Entrance to all is based upon the completion of the ''baccalauréat''. Universities are the only ones which are allowed to deliver the title of [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]], hence [[PhD]]s, medical doctors and dentists are all educated at ''universities''. Also, ''universities'' are not free, with fees ranging from [[€]]100 to €600 and social security payments (€200) may be demanded for students who are older than 20. This may be a lot for some students, although those from poor families are exempt from paying fees and social security.

Entrance to the ''grandes écoles'' is earned through a national contest after the equivalent of two years of further study at a university. Costing between nothing and €6,000 annually, they enjoy a very good reputation amongst employers. On the other hand, public universities also give good education and graduates from universities have a reputation for being well-educated and well-trained, but there are significant differences between curricula, with some (such as medical schools) being highly selective and possessing a strong reputation, while some others are overcrowded and may not offer good job prospects. Given the large number of students that graduate annually, it can be challenging for a new graduates from a university to get a job without additional qualifications.

Student housing is generally inexpensive, ranging from €70 to €200 per month. However, students from poor backgrounds may have their rent paid for by the government, along with a monthly grant with which to buy food and books.

As in other countries, the quality of education received, and the peer group to which one belongs, can depend upon the school the child attends. In the ''zones sensibles'', students may struggle to see the opportunities offered to them by the French education system. In addition, the teachers at these schools are frequently the least experienced, as those with more experience may avoid working in the 'zones sensibles' if possible. This can affect the quality of education that low-income students receive. To counter these effects, the French government established a system known as "ZEP" ("zones of priority education"), with incentives for teachers to work in the zones, as well as increased government funding. The ZEP system, though, was criticized by the right-wing government which took power in 2002; in 2005, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], as head of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], the leading right-wing party, proposed a total reform of the system, which he deems insufficient{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.

The family background of low-income students can be critical to their success. In poorer areas, parents are often uneducated, and many women, in particular, are illiterate. In addition, families may be plagued by instability as caregivers may be obliged to work far away from home. To these concerns may be added motivational problems: some youth in the ''banlieues'', perceiving French society to be biased against them{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, may see little point in obtaining a French education.

==Welfare==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
Social policies implemented by the French government since 1981  include: minimal income for [[social insertion]] (''[[revenu minimum d'insertion]]'', RMI), universal health insurance (''[[couverture maladie universelle]]'') and housing allowances (subsidies for home councils in case of [[HLM]], or direct help with the rent in the case of the personalised accommodation help, ''[[aide personnalisée au logement]]'', APL), help for the children (''[[Caisse d'allocations familiales]]''). The results of this policies are still debated.

Right-wing parties have criticized this policy on several points:
* When all assistance is added up, total income from government sources is not far from the minimal legal income (''[[Salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance]]'', [[Smic]]);{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} there is therefore limited incentive to seek paid employment. (Critics of this perspective have noted that it implies a shortage of willing workers, which has been demonstrated to be the case only in certain fields, such as [[construction]] and [[public works]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.)
* These policies are a way to buy social peace (''[[Panem et circenses]]''), but do not solve underlying social problems.
* Criminal behavior does not require social treatment but rather, stricter law enforcement.

==Statistics==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
Poverty rates are higher than the national average in the ''cités''; those for 2005  are shown below (national averages in parentheses)[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123221613/http://www.afp.com/francais/home/swf/violencesfr0411/start.swf]:

* Unemployment: 20.7% (8.6%);
* Poverty: 26.5% (6%);
* Single-parent families: 15% (8%).

The ''cités'' contain a higher proportion of children and adolescents than in the rest of France: 31.5% of their population is 19 or younger, compared with 24.5% nationwide.

==Urban violence and nonviolent demonstrations==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2018|section}}
The first suburban violence is believed to have occurred in 1979  in [[Vaulx-en-Velin]] in suburban [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5joIYYuMke9id85rZbupo5-4fIzJg|title=France promises jobs to riot-hit suburbs|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903095131/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5joIYYuMke9id85rZbupo5-4fIzJg|archivedate=3 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first event to receive wide [[Mass media|media]] coverage, however, was that in the ''Minguettes'' at [[Vénissieux]], also near Lyon{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. After another violent episode in Vénissieux in March 1983, the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] improved its standing in local elections, tapping into widespread fears that the violence would continue. Since then there have been both violent and nonviolent events in the ''cités'', including:

* Events such as the "March for equality and against racism" (''Marche pour l'égalité et contre le racisme'') in 1983  and the women's movement ''[[Ni putes ni soumises]]'' ("Neither whores nor submissive"), formed in 2003  after the murder of [[Sohane Benziane]], 17 years old, burnt alive by a young man.
* Riots, chiefly involving arson and stone throwing, usually provoked by the killing or wounding of a resident during a police operation. Riots in the ''banlieues'' have tended to last a few days. They have also tended to take place on [[New Year's Day]].

Policymakers have used two different approaches to curb violence in the French suburbs. Some have advocated the management of [[poverty]] and social isolation by deploying social workers, forming school aid associations, and instituting crime prevention programs (the 'soft' approach). Others have taken a more hard-line stance, asserting that the best way to curb the violence is to increase the police presence in poor and violence-prone neighborhoods (the 'stick' approach).

==Suburbs and the "quasi-apartheid"==

Although there is no legal apartheid in France, in the sense there is no official will for separation of people,  the ''apartheid'' word has been used by many politics and journalists.&lt;ref name="lemonde20150120"&gt;L'« apartheid » en France ? Pourquoi les mots de Manuel Valls marquent une rupture
www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/01/20/l-apartheid-en-france-pourquoi-les-mots-de-manuel-valls-marquent-une-rupture_4560022_823448.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, prime minister Manuel Valls considers that France faces an ''«apartheid territorial, social, ethnique »'' which could be translated in English words as an ethnic, social and territorial apartheid.&lt;ref name="lemonde20150120" /&gt;

===Algerian roots===
During most of the period when Algeria was [[French Algeria|part of France]] (1830-1962), Malékite Muslim right and French right were nor merged resulting in the fact that Algerian Muslims were treated differently under law from French citizens, a situation which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony. It was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." Bell, David Scott. ''Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France'', Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although formally the Malékite Muslim right has not existed in metropolitan France, Algerian people coming in (metropolitan) France had to follow French law, this system has been understood to have continued in France, informally, after the repeal of the relevant laws and the independence of Algeria. According to Paul A. Silverstein, associate professor of anthropology at [[Reed College]] and author of ''Algeria in France: Transpolitics, Race, and Nation'', and Chantal Tetreault, assistant professor of anthropology at [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], who has researched and written extensively on language, gender, and social exclusion in French suburban housing projects, the colonial apartheid in Algeria has been re-created in the cities of France:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As such, the colonial dual cities described by North African urban theorists Janet Abu-Lughod, Zeynep Çelik, Paul Rabinow, and [[Gwendolyn Wright]] — in which native [[Medina quarter|medinas]] were kept isolated from European settler neighborhoods out of competing concerns of historical preservation, public hygiene, and security — have been effectively re-created in the postcolonial present, with contemporary urban policy and policing maintaining suburban cités and their residents in a state of immobile apartheid, at a perpetual distance from urban, bourgeois centers.&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;Silverstein, Paul A. &amp; Tetreault, Chantal. [http://riotsfrance.ssrc.org/Silverstein_Tetreault/ Postcolonial Urban Apartheid], ''Civil Unrest in the French Suburbs'', November 2005, [[Social Science Research Council]], June 11, 2006. Retrieved July 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Policy issues===
[[Ralph Peters]], in an article about the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], wrote that France's apartheid has a distinctly [[racism|racial aspect]]. In his view, France's "5 million brown and black residents" have "failed to appreciate  discrimination, jobless rates of up to 50 percent, public humiliation, crime, bigotry and, of course, the glorious French culture that excluded them through an informal apartheid system."&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;Peters, Ralph. [http://theonerepublic.com/archives/Columns/Peters/20041109PetersFrance.html France's ''Intifada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084449/http://theonerepublic.com/archives/Columns/Peters/20041109PetersFrance.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, ''[[New York Post]]'', November 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing French senator Roland Muzeau has blamed this apartheid on the right, insisting that it is responsible for both a "social" and "spatial" apartheid in cities controlled by the right, pointing out as an example that [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], from 1983 to 2002 mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], refused to permit the construction of any [[public housing]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "{{lang|fr|La droite a, depuis plusieurs décennies, organisé un apartheid social et un apartheid spatial qui conduit à l'existence de villes pour gens aisés et des villes populaires, car les villes de droite ne veulent pas loger les ouvriers et les employés.}}" [https://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-05_Politique_-La-droite-organise-un-apartheid-social La droite organise un apartheid social], ''[[l'Humanité]]'', June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

French media also tend to ignore blacks and North Africans, failing to market to them, and not representing them in television, print, the internet, or advertisements. This in turn has led to protests against "''l'apartheid culturel''".&lt;ref&gt;"Reluctant inclusion is a fact of life that is perhaps typified by the advertising industry. Unlike the United States, France and other European nations have paid scant attention to the challenges of marketing to domestic ethnic groups. Protests against "''la télé monochrome''" (single-color TV programming) and "''l'apartheid culturel''" (cultural exclusion) of blacks have been raising consciousness and encouraging greater inclusion of minorities in television, Internet, and print products and advertisements. These mediums tend to ignore the existence of blacks along with that of North Africans ("Le pub française fait l'impasse sur les minorités ethniques", 2000). Simons, George F. ''EuroDiversity: A Business Guide to Managing Difference'', [[Elsevier]], 2002, p270.&lt;/ref&gt; against which is engaged the [[:fr:Club Averroes]].

Following this constat, and under [[Jacques Chirac]] impulsion, some people have been changed to present TV programs. On TF1 channel one black or Arab person appeared. Other TV channels have also reconsidered some issues, such as [[TF1]], [[France Télévision]], [[Canal+]], [[Arte France]], [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] [[France 24]] [[BFM TV|BFM]] [[La chaîne parlementaire et le Public Sénat]].&lt;ref&gt;club.averroes.free.fr/uploads/RapportDiversite.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Some have argued that the claims of apartheid in France are a consequence of the rise of [[Islamic fundamentalism]] among some French Muslims, and not just government policy. This argument has been made in the debates about the 2005 [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]], which was formulated primarily to prohibit girls from wearing the ''[[hijab]]'' in schools. It should however be noted that this argument originated in the far-right nationalist French party of [[Jean-Marie Le-Pen]] and was adopted by then French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. [[Gilles Kepel]], who co-authored this law, argued that it was not "acceptable" for members of different religions groups to primarily identify themselves as members of their faith (and secondarily as French) by wearing conspicuous religious symbols, as the end result would be "a sort of apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;"We will have a sort of apartheid. Everyone will be proud to defend his own identity — I am a Muslim, I am a Christian, I am a Jew first. And then a Frenchman, second. This is not acceptable." Maceda, Jim. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4106422/ France divided by headscarf debate], ''[[NBC News]]'', February 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French Muslim women also see the "apartheid" as being internally imposed by the French Muslim community, and the issue as not one about religious freedom, but rather "about saving schoolgirls from a kind of apartheid that was increasingly imposed by men in their community".&lt;ref&gt;McGoldrick, Dominic. ''Human Rights and Religion: The Islamic Headscarf Debate in Europe'', Hart Publishing, 2006, p272.&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates also mirror earlier crises, particularly the "headscarf affair" of 1989, when three Muslim girls were excluded from schools for wearing headscarves. The affair triggered national debate in France, revealed previously unusual alliances between the left, feminists, and the right, and exposed differing views of and visions for the nature of French society. According to Maxim Silverman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the headscarf affair this 'vision', in its most extreme form, was often polarised in terms of the Republic ''or'' fundamentalism (secularism or fanaticism), the Republic ''or'' separate development (integration or apartheid). The problem for large parts of the Left was that they were often sharing the same discourse as [[Jean-Marie Le Pen|Le Pen]] who used the affair to warn against 'the islamicisation of France'… in a splended example of the either/or choice facing France, in which there was is a convergence of many of the discursive elements mentioned above, the Prime Minister [[Michel Rocard]] announced on 2 December 1989, that France cannot be 'a juxtaposition of communities', must be founded on common values and must not follow the Anglo-Saxon model which allows ethnic groups to barricade themselves inside geographical and cultural ghettos leading to 'soft forms of apartheid' (quoted in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 7 December 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Maxim. ''Deconstructing the Nation: Immigration, Racism, and Citizenship in Modern France'', Routledge, 1992, p116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Amir Taheri]] argues that communities dominated by immigrants and their descendants encourage native French to leave, making assimilation difficult, as these groups can effectively live their whole lives without becoming familiar with the French language or culture. In his view, this leads to alienation, and "that, in turn, gives radical [[Islamism|Islamists]] an opportunity to propagate their message of religious and cultural apartheid". He states that some are even calling for a formalization of the ''de facto'' [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|"millet" system]] in Muslim-majority areas, where Muslim men and women are forced to conform to Muslim dress codes, "places of sin" such as "dancing halls, cinemas and theaters" forced to shut down, and French purveyors of liquor and pork products are forced out entirely.&lt;ref name=Taheri&gt;"As the number of immigrants and their descendants increases in a particular locality, more and more of its native French inhabitants leave for "calmer places", thus making assimilation still more difficult. In some areas it is possible for an immigrant or his descendants to spend a whole life without ever encountering the need to speak French let alone familiarize himself with any aspect of the famous French culture.

The result is often alienation. And that, in turn, gives radical Islamists an opportunity to propagate their message of religious and cultural apartheid. Some are even calling for the areas where Muslims form a majority of the population to be re-organized on the basis of the "millet" system that was in force in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under that system each religious community is regarded as "millet" and enjoys the right to organize its social, cultural and educational life in accordance with its religious beliefs.

In some parts of France a de facto "millet" system is already in place. In these areas all women are obliged to wear the standardized Islamist "hijab" while most men grow their beards to the length prescribed by the sheikhs. The radicals have managed to chase away French shopkeepers selling wine and alcohol and pork products, forced "places of sin" such as dancing halls, cinemas and theaters to close down and, seized control of much of the local administration often through permeation." [[Amir Taheri|Taheri, Amir]]. [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=72731 France’s Ticking Time Bomb], ''[[Arab News]]'', November 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minette Marrin of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', while recognizing that "poverty and rejection" have "played a significant part" in the problem, also believes that some French Muslims have "retreat[ed] into more extreme forms of Islam and into the arms of fundamentalists", and that Westerners have been unwilling to recognize this as "deliberate separatism — apartheid."&lt;ref name=Marrin&gt;However, we might at least recognise the problem. As usual a great many people are deliberately avoiding it, in particular by editing the word Muslim out of their debates, as if Islam had nothing to do with the dangerous mood sweeping Europe. Poverty and rejection have played a significant part, but there is an unmistakable sense in which the riots are Muslim, consciously so.

Muslims vary and their beliefs vary. But the response of some Muslims to frustration — whether or not the fault of westerners — has been to retreat into more extreme forms of Islam and into the arms of fundamentalists. Yet although we know this, and despite the Salman Rushdie affair, despite the bombs and assassinations that led up to [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|9/11]], despite the recent atrocities, we seem unwilling to recognise that what this can mean is deliberate separatism — apartheid." Marrin, Minette. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,24391-1869908,00.html Muslim apartheid burns bright in France], ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', November 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French periodical ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'', however, disagrees with this assessment, and devoted two entire articles to the discussion of "urban apartheid"&lt;ref name=Vidal&gt;"A few villains or a handful of Muslim "brothers" can hardly be held responsible for the ghettoization of more than 700 {{lang|fr|zones urbaines sensibles}} (ZUS, "sensitive urban areas": government-designated problem areas) and their 5 million inhabitants. As Laurent Bonelli points out, it makes more sense to attribute the recent violence to a process of urban apartheid — a stark contradiction of the French integrationist model — and to the discrimination and racism that afflict young Berbers, Arabs and Blacks. The smokescreen generated by the controversy over Islamic headscarves has blown away, revealing a brutal reality." Vidal, Dominique. [http://mondediplo.com/2005/12/03apartheid "The fight against urban apartheid"], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and "educational apartheid"&lt;ref&gt;Felouzis, Georges and Perroton, Joëlle. [http://mondediplo.com/2005/12/04education The trouble with the schools], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; in France, citing them as the two main factors in the explosive [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 French youth riots]].  Stating that the controversy of Islamic headscarves was a "smokescreen", it argues that "[a] few villains or a handful of Muslim "brothers"" cannot be held responsible for "the ghettoization of more than 700 {{lang|fr|zones urbaines sensibles}} (ZUS, "sensitive urban areas": government-designated problem areas) and their 5 million inhabitants." The authors agree with Laurent Bonelli that the violence was the result of "a process of urban apartheid" as well as "discrimination and racism that afflict young Berber, Arabs and Blacks".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

===Terminology===
[[Montpellier]]'s socialist mayor, [[Hélène Mandroux]] objects to the term "apartheid" in relation to France's treatment of African minorities, arguing that "Terms like urban apartheid are over-dramatic.  We recognize the problem and we are trying to deal with it, but this is not [[Johannesburg]] in the 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;Gentleman, Amelia.

Below is a list of the titles traditionally employed by leaders and officials within the Somali [[customary law]] or ''[[xeer]]''.

===Leaders===
*'''Islan''': Clan chief.&lt;ref name="Diiriye"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diiriye|first=Anwar Maxamed|title=Literature of Somali onomastics &amp; proverbs with comparison of foreign sayings|year=2006|publisher=Gobaad Communications &amp; Press|isbn=0972661514|pages=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLdtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title evolved after the fragmentation in the 18th century of the great [[Harti (Darod)|Harti]] confederation that dominated the northeastern [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region since at least the 14th century. A general process of decentralization ensued, with new leaders known as ''Islaan'' assuming at the local level some of the power that was previously solely commanded by the Sultan of Majeerteenia, the titular head of the entire confederation. Although they nominally asserted independence from the sultanate, Islaan's mainly wielded religious rather than political authority.&lt;ref name="Cassanelli130"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Cassanelli|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Malakh''': Signifies "War Leader". Historically used mainly by the [[Rahanweyn]] clan that today forms one of the largest constituencies in southern Somalia, in addition to a few sympatric clans.

During his research in the ancient town of [[Amud]], the historian [[G.W.B.

Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], such as [[pottery]] and [[coin]]s, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the Sultanate of Adal's reign.&lt;ref name="Lewis90"/&gt; Northern Somalia in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar edifices found at [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Macajilayn]], [[Booco]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[El Ayo]], [[Heis (town)|Heis]], [[Botiala]], [[Salweyn]], [[Mudun]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]], [[Maduna]] and [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]], among other areas.&lt;ref name="Hodd"&gt;Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade &amp; Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turks in Japan''' ({{lang-ja|在日トルコ人（ざいにちトルコじん）}}; {{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Japonya Türkleri}}}}) are [[Turkish people|Turks]] living in [[Japan]]. The term has historically included [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] (particularly [[Volga Tatar]]) [[émigré]]s and immigrants from former [[Russian Empire]] most of whom later acquired [[Turkish nationality law|Turkish citizenship]].

==History==
In the early 20th century, groups of Tatars immigrated from [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="NDL"&gt;{{citation|periodical=National Diet Library Newsletter|issue=171|date=February 2010|last=Hayashi|first=Shunsuke|title=Yapon mohbiri – the sole magazine introducing Japan to Muslim countries of the world|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/publication/ndl_newsletter/171/715.html|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community became led by the [[Bashkir people|Bashkir]] émigré [[imam]] [[Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev]] who had fought on the side of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], and arrived in Japan in 1924; he then set up an organisation{{#tag:ref|Known in Japanese as the {{nihongo|東京回教団|Tokyō Kaikyōdan}}|group=fn}} to bring together the Tatars living in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; Tatars in Japan founded their first [[mosque]] and school in 1935 in [[Kobe]], and another in Tokyo in 1938, with support from Kurbangaliev's organisation.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chr"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.turkey.jp/tr/kronoloji.htm | title = Kronoloji (Chronology) | publisher = Turkish Embassy | publication-place = Tokyo, Japan | accessdate = 2007-04-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518020739/http://www.turkey.jp/tr/kronoloji.htm | archivedate = 2007-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Tatar organisation, the Mohammedan Printing Office in Tokyo,{{#tag:ref|{{lang-tt|Tokyo'da Mätbää-i İslamiyä}}; {{lang-ja|東京回教印刷所}} (''Tōkyō Kaikyō Insatsusho'')|group=fn}} printed the first [[Qur'an]] in Japan as well as a [[Tatar language|Tatar-language]] magazine in [[İske imlâ|Arabic script]], the ''Japan Intelligencer'';{{#tag:ref|{{lang-tt|Yapon mohbiri}}|group=fn}} it continued publication until the 1940s.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; Most of the Tatars emigrated after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; Those remaining took up Turkish citizenship in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="JaponyaTürkToplumu"/&gt;
But There are 600-2,000 Tatars in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrono.ru/statii/2007/adutov_jap.html Представитель культурной ассоциации «Идель-Урал» считал, что количество татар в Японии в 1930-е годы могло достигать 10000 человек] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;They are almost mixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.today/20030624221109/http://islam3.hp.infoseek.co.jp/column/kurban1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Turkish community has diminished in size, those remaining founded the Tokyo Camii and Turkish Cultural Center in 2000.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tokyocamii.org/publicViews/article/sayfacesit:10/language:2|title=A Brief History of the Tokyo Camii|publisher=Tokyo Camii and Turkish Cultural Center|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade, there was a new wave of migration from Turkey, mostly consisting of people from the [[Fatsa]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2005/10/01/cp/gnc105-20050925-102.html | title=Fatsalı'nın ikinci vatanı Japonya| accessdate= 2009-02-24| date=2005-10-01| periodical=Sabah| language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Turkish citizens in Japan are ethnic Kurds.&lt;ref name=refJapan&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsumura |first=Tadashi |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/03/national/japans-kurds-often-limbo-despite-significant-community/#.Vi2nMStGQrd |title=Japan's Kurds often in limbo, despite significant community |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a clash took place outside the Turkish embassy in Tokyo between Kurds and Turks, it was claimed that this began when Turks and Kurds got into a quarrel after a Kurdish party flag was shown at the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/turks-kurds-clash-japan-turkey-elections-151025194639100.html |title=Turks and Kurds clash in Japan over Turkey elections |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2015-10-25 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sputniknews.com/asia/20151025/1029071175/kurds-turks-fight-in-japan.html |title=Turks Clash With Kurds in Tokyo, at Least 4 Injured (VIDEOS, PHOTOS) |website=Sputniknews.com |date=2015-10-25 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/319619-turkey-embassy-kurds-clashes/ |title=Several injured in violent brawl outside Turkish embassy in Japan |website=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/10/25/434883/Turkey-Japan-Tokyo-Clashes-Snap-elections- |title=PressTV-Turks, Kurds clash near embassy in Japan |website=Presstv.ir |date=2015-10-25 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6639">'''William Healy''' (January 20, 1869 – March 15, 1963) was a British-American [[psychiatrist]] and [[criminologist]] who started the earliest American child guidance clinic, was a pioneer of [[psychoanalysis]] in the United States, and served as the American Orthopsychiatric Association's founding president. 

== Early life and education ==
Healy was born in [[Buckinghamshire]], England on January 20, 1869. He came from a family of farmers who had resided in Farnham Commons of Beaconsfield, twenty-five miles northwest of London for generations. When he was nine,  his family immigrated to the United States, finally settling in [[Chicago]] where Healy spent the remainder of his childhood.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;{{citation|last=Snodgrass|first=Jon|title=William Healy (1869-1963): Pioneer Child Psychiatrist and Criminologist|journal=[[Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences]] |year=1984 |volume=20|pages=332–339|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198410)20:4&lt;332::AID-JHBS2300200403&gt;3.0.CO;2-J|pmid=6389674|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At fourteen,  before finishing eighth grade, Healy began work as an office boy at a bank. The small bank was somewhat of a “cultural storehouse” with Shakespearean scholars, poets, and conductors for employees. Over the next ten years, Healy became head “bookkeeper” before applying to [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt; 

Healy likely received encouragement from William Salter, leader of the Chicago Ethical Cultural Society, Harvard alumnus, and brother-in-law of [[William James]], to apply to Harvard. Healy failed the Latin portion of the Harvard required exams but was still awarded a degree and studied at [[Harvard Medical School]] for three years before returning to Chicago and completing his degree at University of Chicago’s [[Rush Medical School]] specializing in gynecology.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt;

== Career ==

Healy began his career in 1901 as an instructor in gynecology at [[Northwestern Medical School]].  During his two year stint there, he also edited the journal ''Gynecology and Anatomy and Physiology and Pathology''.  During this time his interest began to shift toward neurology, and in 1903 he took up a post as instructor of Nervous and Mental Diseases at Chicago Polyclinic.  He stayed at this post until 1916, while simultaneously running a private practice in general medicine.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt; 

In 1906 and 1907, Healy studied in Vienna, Berlin, and London, and it was during this trip that he was exposed to Freud’s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams|Interpretation of Dreams]]''.  Healy became very interested in Freud’s psychoanalysis while remaining skeptical of Freud’s focus on infantile sexuality.  He was a significant factor in bringing psychoanalysis to the United States, and published ''Structure and Meaning of Psychoanalysis'' in 1931.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt; 

At a 1908 meeting at the Hull House, which Healy had been involved with since medical school, he organized a research program with juvenile delinquents in the juvenile court system.  Healy traveled the country discussing his ideas, and in 1909 led the formation of the Chicago Juvenile Psychopathic Institute.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt;  This was the first child guidance clinic.&lt;ref name=Textbook&gt;{{citation|last=Schultz|first=Duane P., and Sydney Ellen Schultz|title=A History of Modern Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1917, Healy left Chicago for Boston to head the Judge Baker Foundation, a similar institution for juvenile research.  Until he retired in 1947, Healy continued to conduct research at the Judge Baker Foundation, which became known as the Judge Baker Guidance Center.  During this time period, he also taught periodically at Harvard, Boston College, and Yale.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt;

== Contributions ==
Healy considered himself to be a psychiatrist and therapist rather than a criminologist, but he made major contributions on both sides of the spectrum. He is perhaps best known for his work in juvenile delinquency, and particularly for his creation of the first child guidance clinic. His psychiatric aims included hearing the “child’s own story” in order to create a viewpoint from the child itself rather than other sources. In criminology, he is known for supporting the multifactor theory of crime causation, which began to move the American view on crime away from the traditional European view. His work with juvenile populations led him to identify certain “causes,” as well as major and minor “factors” that appeared to contribute to delinquent behavior. However, his factors have faced criticism from others for not appearing to be truly descriptive of the populations he studied. Even Healy criticized himself for not investigating further the factors he created.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt; His major published work, ''The Individual Delinquent'', detailed the work that he did with factors and is considered to be his best-known work.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrJCriminol_obit&gt;{{citation |title=William Healy |author=P D S |journal=[[The British Journal of Criminology]] |volume=4 |pages=79–80 |jstor=/23636709 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Healy's first wife died. In 1932, he married American psychologist [[Augusta Fox Bronner]] (1881–1966), whom he had first met in 1913. Bronner was his long-term collaborator; they co-wrote multiple publications on juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref name=Bronner_profile&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.feministvoices.com/augusta-fox-bronner/ |author=Jacy L. Young |title=Profile: Augusta Fox Bronner |publisher= |accessdate=3 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Healy died in Florida in 1963.&lt;ref name=BrJCriminol_obit /&gt;

'''Yans''' (Yanzi) is a [[Bantu language]] spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. 

There are six language varieties Guthrie classified as Bantu B.85 (Yans). According to Nurse (2003), most belong to the [[Yaka language (Democratic Republic of Congo)|Yaka language]], but one or two are assigned to the [[Boma–Dzing languages]] (ex-Yanzi); he does not say which ones.

Maho (2009) notes that the Tsong variety of Yansi is the unclassified "Songo" language of ''Ethnologue'' and is the one that does not belong with the rest. Ehret (2009), however, retains most varieties in B.80 and classifies only "Yanz Kimatu" as Yaka. The six Guthrie varieties are the following:
*B.85A Mbiem, West Yansi
*B.85B East Yans
*B.85C Yeei
*B.85D Tsong (Itsong, Nsong, Ntsuo, "Songo")
*B.85E Mpur (Mput)
*B.85F Tsambaan

Economic and political problems in [[Zimbabwe]] have led to significant increases in migration to [[Botswana]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Oucho|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, it was estimated that there were 40,000 Zimbabwean migrants in the country, of whom only one-third were resident legally.&lt;ref name="AfricanBusiness"&gt;{{citation|title=Botswana Countryfile: Citizens turn on Zimbabwean migrants|periodical=African Business|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Citizens+turn+on+Zimbabwean+migrants.+(Countryfile:+Botswana).-a0101291137|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2009-08-25|last=Mukumbira|first=Rodrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reside in the Ledumadumane suburb of the capital [[Gaborone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=426 |periodical=ZimOnline News Agency |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |title=Botswana hunts down illegal Zim immigrants |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827023732/http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=426 |archivedate=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a camp for Zimbabwean refugees at [[Dukwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betts|Kaytaz|2009|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal migration==
The number of undocumented Zimbabwean migrants in Botswana was estimated at between forty and one hundred thousand {{asof|2009|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betts|Kaytaz|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Botswana deported 17,402 Zimbabweans, while in 2013 it had already deported 22,675 in the first ten months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.africareview.com//News/Botswana-kicks-out-more-illegal-Zimbabwe-immigrants/-/979180/2087636/-/u85te2/-/index.html?relative=true|first=Kitsepele|last=Nyathi|title=Botswana kicks out more illegal Zimbabwe immigrants|work=Africa Review|date=2013-11-25|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illegal immigration issue has produced various tensions between the governments of Botswana and Zimbabwe, with [[Paul Mangwana]] even threatening to expel all Botswana nationals from Zimbabwe in response to the alleged poor treatment which Zimbabweans face in Botswana.&lt;ref name="AfricanBusiness"/&gt; Botswana claims to have deported 26,717 Zimbabweans residing in the country illegally in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Associated Press|title=More than 26,000 Zimbabweans repatriated from Zimbabwe last year|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-75400394.html|date=2003-07-16|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning the following year, they also began to build an [[electric fence|electrified]] [[separation barrier|fence]] along their boundary with Zimbabwe. Botswana's agricultural officials assert that the main purpose of the fence is to stop animal rather than human migration, with the aim of preventing the transmission of [[foot-and-mouth disease]], but Zimbabwe's high commissioner in [[Gaborone]] rejects this explanation, calling it an attempt to make Zimbabwe into a "Gaza Strip".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=BBC News|title=Zimbabwe crisis spills over border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3582459.stm|last=Phillips|first=Barnaby|date=2004-03-30|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found a support rate of 63% for the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Oucho|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights abuses faced by Zimbabweans in Botswana have also become the subject of a play entitled "Voice of the People", with actors from both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Play Showcases the Plight of Zimbabean Refugees in Southern Africa |periodical=Voice of America |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |last=Ngwenya |first=Martin |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2009-01/2009-01-01-voa27.cfm?moddate=2009-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827091202/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2009-01/2009-01-01-voa27.cfm?moddate=2009-01-01 |archivedate=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Zimbabweans are the most numerous nationality among registered foreign workers in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=8&amp;dir=2009/May/Tuesday5|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Number of foreign workers go up}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of Zimbabwean migrant workers are employed in [[cowboy|cow herding]] and similar agricultural occupations, while others work in construction, real estate, retail, education, health and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nehandaradio.com/zimbabwe/african/botswana/herdingcattle270109.html|date=2009-01-27|accessdate=2009-08-25|title=Most Zimbabweans in Botswana herding cattle|periodical=Nehanda Radio}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, especially the more-easily-exploited irregular migrants, are engaged as [[domestic worker|maid]]s or in [[sex workers|sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betts|Kaytaz|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
