      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">In [[recursion theory]], '''α recursion theory''' is a generalisation of [[recursion theory]] to subsets of  [[admissible ordinal]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  An admissible set is closed under &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1(L_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; functions.  If &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a  model of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] then &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an admissible ordinal.  In what follows &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be fixed.

The objects of study in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursion are subsets of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  A is said to be '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursively enumerable''' if it is &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; definable over &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  A is recursive if both A and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; (its complement in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) are &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursively enumerable.

Members of &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are called &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; finite and play a similar role to the finite numbers in classical recursion theory.

We say R is a reduction procedure if it is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursively enumerable and every member of R is of the form &lt;math&gt; \langle H,J,K \rangle &lt;/math&gt; where ''H'', ''J'', ''K'' are all α-finite.

''A'' is said to be α-recursive in ''B'' if there exist &lt;math&gt;R_0,R_1&lt;/math&gt; reduction procedures such that:

: &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq A \leftrightarrow \exists H: \exists J:[\langle H,J,K \rangle \in R_0 \wedge H \subseteq B \wedge J \subseteq \alpha / B ],&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \alpha / A \leftrightarrow \exists H: \exists J:[\langle H,J,K \rangle \in R_1 \wedge H \subseteq B \wedge J \subseteq \alpha / B ].&lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'' is recursive in ''B'' this is written &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \le_\alpha B&lt;/math&gt;.  By this definition ''A'' is recursive in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; (the [[empty set]]) if and only if ''A'' is recursive.  However A being recursive in B is not equivalent to A being &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1(L_\alpha[B])&lt;/math&gt;.

We say ''A'' is regular if &lt;math&gt;\forall \beta \in \alpha: A \cap \beta \in L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or in other words if every initial portion of ''A'' is α-finite.

==Results in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursion==

Shore's splitting theorem:  Let A be &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursively enumerable and regular.  There exist &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; recursively enumerable &lt;math&gt;B_0,B_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A=B_0 \cup B_1 \wedge B_0 \cap B_1 = \varnothing \wedge A \not\le_\alpha B_i (i&lt;2).&lt;/math&gt;

Shore's density theorem:  Let ''A'', ''C'' be α-regular recursively enumerable sets such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A &lt;_\alpha C&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a regular α-recursively enumerable set ''B'' such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A &lt;_\alpha B &lt;_\alpha C&lt;/math&gt;.

The simplest propulsive systems are composed of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]]. Swimming has evolved a number of times in a range of organisms including [[arthropod]]s,  [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

==Evolution of swimming==
Swimming evolved a number of times in unrelated lineages.  Supposed jellyfish fossils occur in the [[Ediacaran]], but the first free-swimming animals appear in the Early to Middle [[Cambrian]].  These are mostly related to the [[arthropod]]s, and include the [[Anomalocaridid]]s, which swam by means of lateral lobes in a fashion reminiscent of today's [[cuttlefish]].  Cephalopods joined the ranks of the [[nekton]] in the late Cambrian,&lt;ref name='Kroger2009'&gt;{{cite journal| last2 = Yun-bai| first1 = B.| first2 = Y.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrestrial animals retain some capacity to swim, however some have returned to the water and developed the capacities for aquatic locomotion. Most [[apes]] (including humans), however, lost the swimming [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/behavior-water |title=Behavior In Water|publisher=[[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]]| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Pedro Renato Bender, a research fellow at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]'s Institute for Human Evolution, proposed a theory to explain the loss of that instinct. Termed the Saci last common ancestor hypothesis (after [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], a Brazilian folklore character who cannot cross water barriers), it holds that the loss of instinctive swimming ability in apes is best explained as a consequence of constraints related to the adaptation to an arboreal life in the [[last common ancestor]] of apes.&lt;ref name="bender"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/16924/Dissertation%20Convergence%20Bender%203%20August%202014.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The use of convergence as a tool in the reconstruction of human past, with special focus on water use in hominin evolution|publisher=WIReDSpace (Wits Institutional Repository on DSpace)| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender hypothesized that the ancestral ape increasingly avoided deep-water bodies when the risks of being exposed to water were clearly higher than the advantages of crossing them.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt; A decreasing contact with water bodies then could have led to the disaappearance of the [[doggy paddle]] instinct.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt;

===Ciliates===
[[Ciliates]] use small flagella called [[cilia]] to move through the water. One ciliate will generally have hundreds to thousands of cilia that are densely packed together in arrays. During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flagellates===
Certain organisms such as [[bacteria]] and animal sperm have [[flagellum]] which have developed a way to move in liquid environments. A rotary motor model shows that bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor. An electrostatic model|journal= Biophysical Journal |volume= 64 |issue= 4| year = 1993 | pages = 961–973|bibcode = 1993BpJ....64..961B |doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81462-0 |pmid= 7684268|pmc= 1262414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sperm is called [[sperm motility]]. The middle of the mammalian spermatozoon contains mitochondria that power the movement of the flagellum of the sperm. The motor around the base produces torque, just like in bacteria for movement through the aqueous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Mortimer, Sharon T.|title= A critical review of the physiological importance and analysis of sperm movement in mammals |journal= Human Reproduction Update | volume= 3 |issue= 5 | year = 1997 | pages = 403–439 | doi=10.1093/humupd/3.5.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

===Pseudopodia===
Movement using a pseudopod is accomplished through increases in pressure at one point on the [[cell membrane]].  This pressure increase is the result of [[actin]] polymerization between the cortex and the membrane.  As the pressure increases the [[cell membrane]] is pushed outward creating the pseudopod.  When the pseudopod moves outward, the rest of the body is pulled forward by cortical tension.  The result is cell movement through the [[fluid]] medium.  Furthermore, the direction of movement is determined by [[chemotaxis]].  When chemoattraction occurs in a particular area of the [[cell membrane]], [[actin]] polymerization can begin and move the cell in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. P.

[[File:Daphnia pulex.png|thumb|right|[[Daphnia]] swims by beating its antennae]]

Among the [[radiata]], jellyfish and their kin, the main form of swimming is to flex their cup shaped bodies. All [[jellyfish]] are free-swimming, although many of these spend most of their time swimming passively.  Passive swimming is akin to gliding;  the organism floats, using currents where it can, and does not exert any energy into controlling its position or motion.  Active swimming, in contrast, involves the expenditure of energy to travel to a desired location.

In [[bilateria]], there are many methods of swimming. The [[arrow worm]]s ([[chaetognatha]]) undulate their finned bodies, not unlike fish. [[Nematode]]s swim by undulating their fin-less bodies. Some [[Arthropod]] groups can swim - including many [[crustacean]]s. Most crustaceans, such as [[shrimp]], will usually swim by paddling with special swimming legs ([[pleopods]]). [[Swimming crab]]s swim with modified walking legs ([[pereiopod]]s). [[Daphnia]], a crustacean, swims by beating its antennae instead.

There are also a number of forms of swimming [[mollusc]]s.  Many free-swimming [[sea slug]]s, such as [[sea angel]]s, flap fin-like structures. Some shelled molluscs, such as [[scallop]]s can briefly swim by clapping their two shells open and closed. The molluscs most evolved for swimming are the [[cephalopod]]s.

Among the [[Deuterostomia]], there are a number of swimmers as well. [[Feather star]]s can swim by undulating their many arms [http://video.mx.msn.com/watch/video/beautiful-swimming-feather-star/8dw7iajz]. [[Salp]]s move by pumping waters through their gelatinous bodies. The deuterosomes most evolved for swimming are found among the [[vertebrate]]s, notably the [[fish]].

{{main|Jet propulsion}}

[[Jet propulsion]] is a method of aquatic locomotion where animals fill a muscular cavity and squirt out water to propel them in the opposite direction of the squirting water. Most organisms are equipped with one of two designs for jet propulsion; they can draw water from the rear and expel it from the rear, such as jellyfish, or draw water from front and expel it from the rear, such as salps. Filling up the cavity causes an increase in both the mass and drag of the animal. Because of the expanse of the contracting cavity, the animal's velocity fluctuates as it moves through the water, accelerating while expelling water and decelerating while vacuuming water. Even though these fluctuations in drag and mass can be ignored if the frequency of the jet-propulsion cycles is high enough, jet-propulsion is a relatively inefficient method of aquatic locomotion.

All [[cephalopod]]s can move by [[jet propulsion]], but this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"/&gt; The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases. Since the Paleozoic, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"&gt;{{The Mollusca|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stop-start motion provided by the jets, however, continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"/&gt; Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-19-852761-9|author1=Marion Nixon |author2=J.Z. Young |author2link=John Zachary Young |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=The brains and lives of cephalopods}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface}} and they can out accelerate most fish.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Squid as Experimental Animals|author=Daniel L. Gilbert |author2=William J. Adelman |author3=John M. Arnold |others= Daniel L. Gilbert, John M. Arnold

|isbn = 978-0-306-43513-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the [[hyponome]], created by a fold in the mantle. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece, &amp; Mitchell, p.612&lt;/ref&gt; Most cephalopods float (i.e. are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]]), so do not need to swim to remain afloat.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"&gt;{{The Mollusca|chapter=11: Evolution of Buoyancy and Locomotion in recent cephalopods|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Squid]] swim more slowly than fish, but use more power to generate their speed. The loss in efficiency is due to the amount of water the squid can accelerate out of its mantle cavity.&lt;ref name="Levinton"&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology. 3rd ed. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jellyfish]] use a one-way water cavity design which generates a phase of continuous cycles of jet-propulsion followed by a rest phase. The Froude efficiency is about 0.09, which indicates a very costly method of locomotion. The metabolic cost of transport for jellyfish is high when compared to a fish of equal mass.

Other jet-propelled animals have similar problems in efficiency. [[Scallop]]s, which use a similar design to jellyfish, swim by quickly opening and closing their shells, which draws in water and expels it from all sides. This locomotion is used as a means to escape predators such as [[starfish]]. Afterwards, the shell acts as a [[hydrofoil]] to counteract the scallop's tendency to sink. The Froude efficiency is low for this type of movement, about 0.3, which is why it's used as an emergency escape mechanism from predators. However, the amount of work the scallop has to do is mitigated by the elastic hinge that connects the two shells of the bivalve. Squids swim by drawing water into their mantle cavity and expelling it through their siphon. The Froude efficiency of their jet-propulsion system is around 0.29, which is much lower than a fish of the same mass.

Much of the work done by scallop muscles to close its shell is stored as elastic energy in abductin tissue, which acts as a spring to open the shell. The elasticity causes the work done against the water to be low because of the large openings the water has to enter and the small openings the water has to leave. The inertial work of scallop jet-propulsion is also low. Because of the low inertial work, the energy savings created by the elastic tissue is so small that it's negligible. Medusae can also use their elastic mesoglea to enlarge their bell. Their mantle contains a layer of muscle sandwiched between elastic fibers. The muscle fibers run around the bell circumferentially while the elastic fibers run through the muscle and along the sides of the bell to prevent lengthening. After making a single contraction, the bell vibrates passively at the resonant frequency to refill the bell. However, in contrast with scallops, the inertial work is similar to the hydrodynamic work due to how medusas expel water - through a large opening at low velocity. Because of this, the negative pressure created by the vibrating cavity is lower than the positive pressure of the jet, meaning that inertial work of the mantle is small. Thus, jet-propulsion is shown as an inefficient swimming technique.&lt;ref name="Levinton"/&gt;

==Fish==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|[[Epipelagic fish|Open water fish]], like this [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]], are usually streamlined for straightline speed, with a deeply forked tail and a smooth body shaped like a spindle tapered at both ends.]]

{{See also|Fish locomotion}}

Many [[fish]] swim through water by creating [[Undulatory locomotion|undulations]] with their bodies or oscillating their [[Fish fin|fins]]. The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a rearward force, side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies. Eel-shaped fish undulate their entire body in rhythmic sequences. Streamlined fish, such as salmon, undulate the caudal portions of their bodies. Some fish, such as sharks, use stiff, strong fins to create dynamic lift and propel themselves. It is common for fish to use more than one form of propulsion, although they will display one dominant mode of swimming &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;McNeill Alexander, R. Exploring Biomechanics: Animals in Motion. 2nd ed. New York, New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gait changes have even been observed in juvenile reef fish of various sizes. Depending on their needs, fish can rapidly alternate between synchronized fin beats and alternating fin beats.&lt;ref name="Hale et al"&gt;Hale, Melina, R. Day, D. Thorsen, M. Westneat. 2006. Pectoral fin coordination and gait transitions in steadily swimming juvenile reef fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology (209): 3708-3718.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2009'', ''[[Hippocampus zosterae]]'' (the dwarf seahorse) is the slowest moving fish, with a top speed of about {{convert|5|ft|cm}} per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness Book of World Records]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a [[dorsal fin]] and using [[pectoral fin]]s (located behind their eyes) to steer. Seahorses have no [[caudal fin]].

===Body-caudal fin (BCF) propulsion===
*Anguilliform: Anguilliform swimmers are typically slow swimmers. They undulate the majority of their body and use their head as the fulcrum for the load they are moving. At any point during their undulation, their body has an amplitude between 0.5-1.0 wavelengths. The amplitude that they move their body through allows them to swim backwards.   Anguilliform locomotion is usually seen in fish with long, slender bodies like [[eels]], [[lampreys]], [[oarfish]], and a number of [[catfish]] species.
*Subcarangiform, Carangiform, Thunniform: These swimmers undulate the posterior half of their body and are much faster than anguilliform swimmers. At any point while they are swimming, a wavelength &lt;1  can be seen in the undulation pattern of the body. Some Carangiform swimmers include nurse sharks, bamboo sharks, and reef sharks. Thunniform swimmers are very fast and some common Thunniform swimmers include tuna, white sharks, salmon, jacks, and mako sharks{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Thunniform swimmers only undulate their high [[aspect ratio]] caudal fin, so they are usually very stiff to push more water out of the way.
*Ostraciiform: Ostraciiform swimmers oscillate their caudal region, making them relatively slow swimmers.  Boxfish, torpedo rays, and momyrs employ Ostraciiform locomotion. The cow fish uses Osctraciiform locomotion to hover in the water column.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al"&gt;Sfakiotakis, Michael, D. Lane, B. Davies. 1999. Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion. Journal of Oceanic Engineering (24:2) 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Median paired fin (MPF) propulsion===
*Tetraodoniform, Balistiform, Diodontiform: These swimmers oscillate their median fins. They are typically slow swimmers, and some notable examples include the [[oceanic sunfish]] (which has extremely modified anal and dorsal fins), puffer fish, and triggerfish.
*Rajiform, Amiiform, Gymnotiform: This locomotory mode is accomplished by undulation of the pectoral and median fins. During their undulation pattern, a wavelength &gt;1 can be seen in their fins. They are typically slow to moderate swimmers, and some examples include rays, bowfin, and knife fishes. The [[black ghost knife fish]] is a Gymnotiform swimmer that has a very long ventral ribbon fin. Thrust is produced by passing waves down the ribbon fin while the body remains rigid. This also allows the ghost knife fish to swim in reverse.
*Labriform: Labriform swimmers are also slow swimmers. They oscillate their pectoral fins to create thrust. Oscillating fins create thrust when a starting vortex is shed from the trailing edge of the fin. As the foil departs from the starting vortex, the effect of that vortex diminishes, while the bound circulation remains, producing lift. Labriform swimming can be viewed as continuously starting and stopping. [[Wrasses]] and surf perch are common Labriform swimmers.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al" /&gt;

===Hydrofoils===
[[File:Triakis semifasciata monterey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[leopard shark]] angles its [[pectoral fin]]s so they behave as hydrofoils to control the animal's [[Flight dynamics|pitch]]]]

[[Hydrofoils]], or [[fin]]s, are used to push against the water to create a normal force to provide thrust, propelling the animal through water. Sea turtles and penguins beat their paired hydrofoils to create lift. Some paired fins, such as pectoral fins on leopard sharks, can be angled at varying degrees to allow the animal to rise, fall, or maintain its level in the water column. The reduction of fin surface area helps to minimize drag, and therefore increase efficiency. Regardless of size of the animal, at any particular speed, maximum possible lift is proportional to (wing area) x (speed)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Dolphins and whales have large, horizontal caudal hydrofoils, while many fish and sharks have vertical caudal hydrofoils. Porpoising (seen in cetaceans, penguins, and pinnipeds) may save energy if they are moving fast. Since drag increases with speed, the work required to swim unit distance is greater at higher speeds, but the work needed to jump unit distance is independent of speed. Seals propel themselves through the water with their caudal tail, while sea lions create thrust solely with their pectoral flippers.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Drag powered swimming===
[[File:Hippocampus.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The slowest-moving fishes are the [[sea horse]]s, often found in [[Coral reef fish|reefs]]]]

As with moving through any fluid, friction is created when molecules of the fluid collide with organism. The collision causes drag against moving fish, which is why many fish are streamlined in shape. Streamlined shapes work to reduce drag by orienting elongated objects parallel to the force of drag, therefore allowing the current to pass over and taper off the end of the fish. This streamlined shape allows for more efficient use of energy locomotion. Some flat-shaped fish can take advantage of pressure drag by having a flat bottom surface and curved top surface. The pressure drag created allows for the upward lift of the fish.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Appendages of aquatic organisms propel them in two main and biomechanically extreme mechanisms. Some use lift powered swimming, which can be compared to flying as appendages flap like wings, and reduce drag on the surface of the appendage. Others use drag powered swimming, which can be compared to oars rowing a boat, with movement in a horizontal plane, or paddling, with movement in the parasagittal plane.

Drag swimmers use a cyclic motion where they push water back in a power stroke, and return their limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is heading. This opposing force is called [[drag (physics)|drag]]. The return-stroke drag causes drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency. For example, ducks paddle through the water spreading the webs of their feet as they move water back, and then when they return their feet to the front they pull their webs together to reduce the subsequent pull of water forward. The legs of water beetles have little hairs which spread out to catch up and move water back in the power stroke, but lay flat as the appendage moves forward in the return stroke. Also, the water beetle's legs have a side that is wider and is held perpendicular to the motion when pushing backward, but the leg is then rotated when the limb is to return forward, so that the thinner side will catch up less water.&lt;ref name="Lauder"&gt;Lauder, G., and Jayne, B. Pectoral fin Locomotion in Fishes: Testing Drag-Based Models Using Three-Dimensional Kinematics. Oxford Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag swimmers experience a lessened efficiency in swimming due to resistance which affects their optimum speed. The less drag a fish experiences, the more it will be able to maintain higher speeds. Morphology of the fish can be designed to reduce drag, such as streamlining the body. The cost of transport is much higher for the drag swimmer, and when deviating from its optimum speed, the drag swimmer is energetically strained much more than the lift swimmer. There are natural processes in place to optimize energy use, and it is thought that adjustments of metabolic rates can compensate in part for mechanical disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Ohlberger"&gt;Ohlberger, J., G. Staaks, and F. Hoker. Swimming efficiency and the influence of morphology on swimming costs in fishes. J Comp Physiol B. 176: 17-25. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-aquatic animals compared to fully aquatic animals exhibit exacerbation of drag. Design that allows them to function out of the water limits the efficiency possible to be reached when in the water. In water swimming at the surface exposes them to resistive wave drag and is associated with a higher cost than submerged swimming.  Swimming below the surface exposes them to resistance due to return strokes and pressure, but primarily friction. Frictional drag is due to fluid viscosity and morphology characteristics. Pressure drag is due to the difference of water flow around the body and is also affected by body morphology.  Semi-aquatic organisms encounter increased resistive forces when in or out of the water, as they are not specialized for either habitat. The morphology of otters and beavers, for example, must meet needs for both environments. Their fur decreases streamlining and creates additional drag. The platypus may be a good example of an intermediate between drag and lift swimmers because it has been shown to have a rowing mechanism which is similar to lift-based pectoral oscillation. The limbs of semi-aquatic organisms are reserved for use on land and using them in water not only increases the cost of locomotion, but limits them to drag-based modes.&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;Fish, Frank E. Biomechanics and Energetics in Aquatic and Semiaquatic Mammals: Platypus to Whale. Chicago Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although they are less efficient, drag swimmers are able to produce more thrust at low speeds than lift swimmers. They are also thought to be better for maneuverability due to the large thrust produced.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, J., and M. Westneat. Mechanical Performance of aquatic  rowing and flying. The Royal Society. 10.1098. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==
[[File:Frog žába.gif|thumb|Common toad (''Bufo bufo'') swimming]]
Most of the Amphibia have a larval state, which has inherited anguilliform motion, and a laterally compressed tail to go with it, from fish ancestors.
The corresponding tetrapod adult forms, even in the tail-retaining sub-class [[Urodeles]], are sometimes aquatic to only a negligible extent (as in the genus
[[Salamandra]], whose tail has lost its suitability for aquatic propulsion), but the majority of [[Urodeles]], from the newts to the giant salamander Megalobatrachus,
retain a laterally compressed tail for a life that is aquatic to a considerable degree, which can use in a carangiform motion.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "&gt;Lighthill , MJ. Hydromechanics of Aquatic Animal Propulsion- Annu. Rev. Fluid. Mech. - 1969 1-413-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the tailless [[amphibians]] (the [[frogs]] and [[toads]] of the sub-class [[Anura (frog)|Anura]]) the majority are aquatic to an insignificant extent in adult life, but in that considerable minority that are mainly aquatic we encounter for the first time the problem of adapting the tailless-tetrapod structure for aquatic propulsion. The mode that they use is unrelated to any used by fish. With their flexible back legs and webbed feet they execute something close to the leg movements of a human 'breast stroke,' rather more efficiently because the legs are better streamlined.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

==Reptiles==
[[File:CrocoLoco-swimming-01.jpg|thumb|Nile crocodile (''[[Crocodylus niloticus]]'') swimming]]
From the point of view of aquatic propulsion, the descent of modern members of the class [[Reptilia]] from archaic tailed [[Amphibia]] is most obvious in the case of the order [[Crocodilia]] ([[crocodiles]] and [[alligators]]), which use their deep, laterally compressed tails in an essentially carangiform mode of propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Carangiform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

Terrestrial [[snakes]], in spite of their 'bad' hydromechanical shape with roughly circular cross-section and gradual posterior taper, swim fairly readily when required, by an anguilliform propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Anguilliform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

[[Cheloniidae]] (true [[turtles]]) have found a beautiful solution to the problem of [[tetrapod]] swimming through the development of their forelimbs into flippers of high-aspect-ratio wing shape, with which they imitate a bird's propulsive mode more accurately than do the eagle-rays themselves.

==Fin and flipper locomotion==
{{main|Fin and flipper locomotion}}
[[File:Otariidae Phocidae Comparative Anatomy.svg|thumb|Comparative skeletal anatomy of a typical otariid seal and a typical phocid seal]]
Aquatic reptiles such as [[sea turtles]] and extinct species like [[Pliosauroids]] predominantly use their pectoral flippers to propel themselves through the water and their pelvic flippers for maneuvering. During swimming they move their pectoral flippers in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventral motion]], causing forward motion. During swimming, they rotate their front flippers to decrease drag through the water column and increase efficiency. Newly hatched sea turtles exhibit several behavioral skills that help orientate themselves towards the ocean as well as identifying the transition from sand to water. If rotated in the pitch, yaw or roll direction, the hatchlings are capable of counteracting the forces acting upon them by correcting with either their pectoral or pelvic flippers and redirecting themselves towards the open ocean.

Among mammals [[otariids]] ([[fur seals]]) swim primarily with their front flippers, using the rear flippers for steering, and [[phocids]] ([[true seals]]) move the rear flippers laterally, pushing the animal through the water.

==Escape reactions==
[[File:Caridoid escape reaction.gif|200px|thumb|Animated representation of [[caridoid escape reaction|lobstering]]|left]]

Some arthropods, such as [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]]s, can propel themselves backwards quickly by flicking their tail, known as lobstering or the [[caridoid escape reaction]].

Varieties of fish, such as teleosts, also use fast-starts to escape from predators. Fast-starts are characterized by the muscle contraction on one side of the fish twisting the fish into a C-shape. Afterwards, muscle contraction occurs on the opposite side to allow the fish to enter into a steady swimming state with waves of undulation traveling alongside the body. The power of the bending motion comes from fast-twitch muscle fibers located in the central region of the fish. The signal to perform this contraction comes from a set of [[Mauthner cells]] which simultaneously send a signal to the muscles on one side of the fish.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;Wakeling, James M. and Ian A. Johnston. "Body bending during fast-starts in fish can be explain in terms of muscle torque and hydrodynamic resistance." The Journal of Experimental Biology 202.6 (1999): 675-682.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauthner cells are activated when something startles the fish and can be activated by visual&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Robert C. et al. "The Mauthner-initiated startle response in teleost fish." F. exp. Biol. 66 (1977): 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt; or sound-based stimuli.

Fast-starts are split up into three stages. Stage one, which is called the preparatory stroke, is characterized by the initial bending to a C-shape with small delay caused by hydrodynamic resistance. Stage two, the propulsive stroke, involves the body bending rapidly to the other side, which may occur multiple times. Stage three, the rest phase, cause the fish to return to normal steady-state swimming and the body undulations begin to cease. Large muscles located closer to the central portion of the fish are stronger and generate more force than the muscles in the tail. This asymmetry in muscle composition causes body undulations that occur in Stage 3. Once the fast-start is completed, the position of the fish has been shown to have a certain level of unpredictability, which helps fish survive against predators.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

The rate at which the body can bend is limited by resistance contained in the inertia of each body part. However, this inertia assists the fish in creating propulsion as a result of the momentum created against the water. The forward propulsion created from C-starts, and steady-state swimming in general, is a result of the body of the fish pushing against the water. Waves of undulation create rearward momentum against the water providing the forward thrust required to push the fish forward.&lt;ref name="Wakeling"&gt;Wakeling, J.M. "Biomechanics of fast-start swimming in fish." Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A.131 (2001): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
{{See also|Froude number}}

The Froude propulsion efficiency is defined as the ratio of power output to the power input:

{{math|''nf'' {{=}} 2''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / (''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

where U1 = free stream velocity and U2 = jet velocity. A good efficiency for carangiform propulsion is between 50 and 80%.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Minimizing drag===
Pressure differences occur outside the boundary layer of swimming organisms due to disrupted flow around the body.  The difference on the up- and down-stream surfaces of the body is pressure [[drag (physics)|drag]], which creates a downstream force on the object.  Frictional drag, on the other hand, is a result of fluid viscosity in the [[boundary layer]].  Higher [[turbulence]] causes greater frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Levinton/&gt;

[[Reynolds number]] (Re) is the measure of the relationships between inertial and viscous forces in flow ((animal's length x animal's velocity)/kinematic viscosity of the fluid).  Turbulent flow can be found at higher Re values, where the boundary layer separates and creates a wake, and laminar flow can be found at lower Re values, when the boundary layer separation is delayed, reducing wake and kinetic energy loss to opposing water momentum.&lt;ref name="Feldkamp"&gt;Feldkamp, S.D. "Swimming in the California sea lion: morphometrics, drag, and energetics." J. exp. Biol. 131, 117-135 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The body shape of a swimming organism affects the resulting drag.  Long, slender bodies reduce pressure drag by streamlining, while short, round bodies reduce frictional drag; therefore, the optimal shape of an organism depends on its niche.  Swimming organisms with a fusiform shape are likely to experience the greatest reduction in both pressure and frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Feldkamp/&gt;

Wing shape also affects the amount of drag experienced by an organism, as with different methods of stroke, recovery of the pre-stroke position results in the accumulation of drag.

High-speed ram ventilation creates laminar flow of water from the gills along the body of an organism.

The secretion of mucus along the organism's body surface, or the addition of long-chained polymers to the velocity gradient, can reduce frictional drag experienced by the organism.

===Buoyancy===
Many aquatic/marine organisms have developed organs to compensate for their weight and control their [[buoyancy]] in the water.  These structures, make the density of their bodies very close to that of the surrounding water.  Some hydrozoans, such as siphonophores, has gas-filled floats; the Nautilus, Sepia, and Spirula ([[Cephalopods]]) have chambers of gas within their shells; and most [[teleost]] fish and many [[lantern fish]] (Myctophidae) are equipped with [[swim bladders]].  Many aquatic and marine organisms may also be composed of low-density materials.  Deep-water teleosts, which do not have a swim bladder, have few lipids and proteins, deeply ossified bones, and watery tissues that maintain their buoyancy.  Some [[sharks]]' livers are composed of low-density lipids, such as hydrocarbon [[squalene]] or [[wax esters]] (also found in Myctophidae without swim bladders), which provide buoyancy.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

Swimming animals that are denser than water must generate lift or adapt a [[benthic]] lifestyle.  Movement of the fish to generate hydrodynamic lift is necessary to prevent sinking.  Often, their bodies act as [[hydrofoils]], a task that is more effective in flat-bodied fish.  At a small tilt angle, the lift is greater for flat fish than it is for fish with narrow bodies.  Narrow-bodied fish use their fins as hydrofoils while their bodies remain horizontal.  In sharks, the [[heterocercal]] tail shape drives water downward, creating a counteracting upward force while thrusting the shark forward.  The lift generated is assisted by the pectoral fins and upward-angle body positioning.  It is supposed that [[tunas]] primarily use their pectoral fins for lift.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Buoyancy maintenance is metabolically expensive.  Growing and sustaining a buoyancy organ, adjusting the composition of biological makeup, and exerting physical strain to stay in motion demands large amounts of energy.  It is proposed that lift may be physically generated at a lower energy cost by swimming upward and gliding downward, in a "climb and glide" motion, rather than constant swimming on a plane.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can also greatly affect the ability of aquatic organisms to move through water.  This is because temperature not only affects the properties of the water, but also the organisms in the water, as most have an ideal range specific to their body and metabolic needs.

[[Q10 (temperature coefficient)]], the factor by which a rate increases at a 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature, is used to measure how organisms' performance relies on temperature.  Most have increased rates as water becomes warmer, but some have limits to this and others find ways to alter such effects, such as by endothermy or earlier recruitment of faster muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcinek|first=David J.|author2=Susanna B. Blackwell|author3=Heidi Dewar|author4=Ellen V. Freund|author5=Charles Farwell|author6=Daniel Dau|author7=Andrew C. Seitz|author8=Barbara A.

For example, ''Crocodylus porosus'', or estuarine crocodiles, were found to increase swimming speed from 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 23&amp;nbsp;°C and then to have peak swimming speed from 23&amp;nbsp;°C to 33&amp;nbsp;°C.  However, performance began to decline as temperature rose beyond that point, showing a limit to the range of temperatures at which this species could ideally perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsworth|first=Peter G.|author2=Frank Seebacher|author3=Craig E.

===Submergence===
The more of the animal's body that is submerged while swimming, the less energy it uses. Swimming on the surface requires two to three times more energy than when completely submerged. This is because of the bow wave that is formed at the front when the animal is pushing the surface of the water when swimming, creating extra drag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zj395mz_GYkC&amp;pg=PA150 Nature's Flyers: Birds, Insects, and the Biomechanics of Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary evolution==
[[File:penguinu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinstrap penguin]] leaping over water]]
[[File:Swimming dog bgiu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dog paddle|Swimming dog]]]]

While [[tetrapod]]s lost many of their natural adaptations to swimming when they evolved onto the land, many have re-evolved the ability to swim or have indeed returned to a completely aquatic lifestyle.

Primarily or exclusively aquatic animals have re-evolved from terrestrial tetrapods multiple times: examples include [[amphibians]] such as [[newts]], [[reptiles]] such as [[crocodile]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and [[mosasaur]]s, [[marine mammal]]s such as [[cetaceans|whales]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[otter]]s, and [[bird]]s such as [[penguin]]s. Many species of [[snakes]] are also aquatic and live their entire lives in the water. Among invertebrates, a number of [[insect]] species have adaptations for aquatic life and locomotion. Examples of [[aquatic insect]]s include [[dragonfly]] larvae, [[Corixidae|water boatmen]], and [[Dytiscidae|diving beetle]]s. There are also [[Diving bell spider|aquatic spiders]], although they tend to prefer other modes of locomotion under water than swimming proper.

Even though primarily terrestrial tetrapods have lost many of their adaptations to swimming, the ability to swim has been preserved or re-developed in many of them. It may never have been completely lost.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Examples are: Some breeds of [[dog]] swim recreationally. Umbra, a world record-holding dog, can swim 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) in 73 minutes, placing her in the top 25% in human long-distance swimming competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdogv.com/swim.html SWIMMING DOG VIDEOS Swimming Background&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most [[cat]]s hate water, adult cats are good swimmers. The [[fishing cat]] is one wild species of cat that has evolved special adaptations for an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle – webbed digits. Tigers and some individual jaguars are the only big cats known to go into water readily, though other big cats, including lions, have been observed swimming.  A few domestic cat breeds also like swimming, such as the [[Turkish Van]].

[[Horses]], [[moose]], and [[elk]] are very powerful swimmers, and can travel long distances in the water. [[Elephants]] are also capable of swimming, even in deep waters. Eyewitnesses have confirmed that [[camel]]s, including [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]] camels, can swim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mcamelswim.html The Straight Dope Mailbag: The Straight Dope Mailbag: Is the camel the only animal that can't swim?]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there is little deep water in their natural habitats.

Both domestic and wild [[rabbit]]s can swim. Domestic rabbits are sometimes trained to swim as a circus attraction. A wild rabbit famously swam in [[Jimmy Carter rabbit incident|an apparent attack]] on U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s boat when it was threatened in its natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsoftheodd.com/article1021.html News of the Odd - Jimmy Carter Attacked by Killer Rabbit (April 20, 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[guinea pig]] (or cavy) is noted as having an excellent swimming ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Harkness|first= John E.|last2= Wagner|first2= Joseph E.|title= The Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents|publisher= Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1995|pages= 30–39|isbn= 978-0-683-03919-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mice]] can swim quite well. They do panic when placed in water, but many lab mice are used in the [[Morris water maze]], a test to measure learning. When mice swim, they use their tails like [[flagella]] and kick with their legs.

Many snakes are excellent swimmers as well. Large adult [[anaconda]]s spend the majority of their time in the water, and have difficulty moving on land.

Many [[monkeys]] can naturally swim and some, like the [[proboscis monkey]], [[crab-eating macaque]], and [[rhesus macaque]] swim regularly.

==Human swimming==
{{Main|Human swimming|History of swimming}}
Swimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times; the earliest record of swimming dates back to [[Stone Age]] paintings from around 7,000 years ago.  Competitive swimming started in [[Europe]] around 1800 and was part of the first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], though not in a form comparable to the contemporary events.  It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the [[FINA|International Swimming Federation]] to produce [[Swimming (sport)|competitive swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kehm | first = G | title = Olympic Swimming and Diving:Great Moments in Olympic History | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=U2Kr_xFY2eUC&amp;pg=PA14 14] | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4042-0970-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum statistics]], '''Bose–Einstein statistics''' (or more colloquially '''B–E statistics''') is one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting indistinguishable [[particles]] may occupy a set of available discrete [[Energy level|energy states]], at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of [[Laser#Quantum vs. classical emission processes|laser light]] and the frictionless creeping of [[Superfluid helium-4|superfluid helium]]. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924–25) by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by [[Albert Einstein]] in collaboration with Bose.

The Bose–Einstein statistics apply only to those particles not limited to single occupancy of the same state—that is, particles that do not obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] restrictions. Such particles have integer values of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and are named [[boson]]s, after the statistics that correctly describe their behaviour. There must also be no significant interaction between the particles.

==Concept==
At low temperatures, bosons behave differently from [[fermion]]s (which obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]) in a way that an unlimited number of them can "condense" into the same energy state. This apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter &amp;ndash; the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics apply when [[quantum|quantum effects]] are important and the particles are "[[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]". Quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{V} \ge n_q, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|N}} is the number of particles, {{mvar|V}} is the volume, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[quantum concentration]], for which the interparticle distance is equal to the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]], so that the [[wavefunction]]s of the particles are barely overlapping.

Fermi–Dirac statistics apply to fermions (particles that obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), and Bose–Einstein statistics apply to [[bosons]]. As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, most systems at high temperatures obey the classical (Maxwell–Boltzmann) limit, unless they also have a very high density, as for a [[white dwarf]]. Both Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein become [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] at high temperature or at low concentration.

B–E statistics was introduced for [[photon]]s in 1924 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and generalized to atoms by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1924–25.

The expected number of particles in an energy state ''i'' for B–E statistics is
:&lt;math&gt;n_i(\varepsilon_i) = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i - \mu)/k_{\rm B}T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''μ''}} and where {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the number of particles in state {{math|''i'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of energy level {{math|''i'', ''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[energy]] of the ''i''-th state, ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], {{Math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].

For comparison, the average number of fermions with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; given by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics#Distribution of particles over energy|Fermi–Dirac particle-energy distribution]] has a similar form:
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{n}_i(\epsilon_i) = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\epsilon_i - \mu)/k_{\rm B}T} + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

B–E statistics reduces to the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] distribution for &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm B}T \gg \epsilon_i - \mu &lt;/math&gt;, namely 
:&lt;math&gt; n_i = \frac{g_i k_{\rm B}T}{\varepsilon_i - \mu}. &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
While presenting a lecture at the [[University of Dhaka]] (in what was then [[British India]] and now [[Bangladesh]]) on the theory of radiation and the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results. During this lecture, Bose committed an error in applying the theory, which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment. The error was a simple mistake—similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time—that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (remarkably, this error resembled the famous blunder by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] known from his "[http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Dalembert/croix_ou_pile.pdf Croix ou Pile]" article). However, the results it predicted agreed with experiment, and Bose realized it might not be a mistake after all. For the first time, he took the position that the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales. Thus, he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space, where each state is a little patch having volume h&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable.

Bose adapted this lecture into a short article called "Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta"&lt;ref&gt;See p. 14, note 3, of the Ph.D. Thesis entitled
''Bose–Einstein condensation: analysis of problems and rigorous results'', presented by Alessandro Michelangeli to the International School for Advanced Studies, Mathematical Physics Sector, October 2007 for the degree of Ph.D. See: {{cite web

However, the referee's report was negative, and the paper was rejected. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Albert Einstein requesting publication in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein immediately agreed, personally translated the article from English into German (Bose had earlier translated Einstein's article on the theory of General Relativity from German to English), and saw to it that it was published. Bose's theory achieved respect when Einstein sent his own paper in support of Bose's to ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', asking that they be published together. The paper came out in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = &lt;!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--&gt; | last = Bose | title = Plancks Gesetz und Lichtquantenhypothese | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Physik]] | volume = 26 | pages = 178–181 | year = 1924 | language = German | bibcode = 1924ZPhy...26..178B | doi = 10.1007/BF01327326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason Bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third, and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional (classical, distinguishable) coins. Bose's "error" leads to what is now called Bose–Einstein statistics.

Bose and Einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.

==Two derivations of the Bose–Einstein distribution==

=== Derivation from the grand canonical ensemble ===
The Bose–Einstein distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is easily derived from the [[grand canonical ensemble]].&lt;ref name="sriva7"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Statistical Mechanics

 |location=[[New Delhi]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ensemble, the system is able to exchange energy and exchange particles with a reservoir (temperature ''T'' and chemical potential ''µ'' fixed by the reservoir).

Due to the non-interacting quality, each available single-particle level (with energy level ''ϵ'') forms a separate thermodynamic system in contact with the reservoir.
In other words, each single-particle level is a separate, tiny grand canonical ensemble.
With bosons there is no limit on the number of particles ''N'' in the level, but due to [[indistinguishability]] each possible ''N'' corresponds to only one [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] (with energy ''Nϵ'').
The resulting partition function for that single-particle level therefore forms a [[geometric series]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}\mathcal Z &amp; = \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} \exp(N(\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B} T) = \sum_{N=0}^\infty [\exp((\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B}T)]^N \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{1 - \exp((\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B} T)}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the average particle number for that single-particle substate is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \langle N\rangle = k_{\rm B} T \frac{1}{\mathcal Z} \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal Z}{\partial \mu}\right)_{V,T} = \frac{1}{\exp((\epsilon-\mu)/k_{\rm B} T)-1} &lt;/math&gt;
This result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the Bose–Einstein distribution for the entire state of the system.&lt;ref name="sriva6"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Statistical Mechanics
 |chapter=Chapter 6  
 |isbn=9788120327825
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The BE distribution can be derived also from thermal field theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variance in particle number (due to [[thermal fluctuations]]) may also be derived:
:&lt;math&gt; \langle (\Delta N)^2 \rangle = k_{\rm B} T \left(\frac{d\langle N\rangle}{d\mu}\right)_{V,T} = \langle N^2\rangle - \langle N\rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;
This level of fluctuation is much larger than for [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|distinguishable particles]], which would instead show [[Poisson statistics]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\langle (\Delta N)^2 \rangle = \langle N\rangle^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;. The reason is that the [[probability distribution]] for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a [[geometric distribution]], not a [[Poisson distribution]].

=== Derivation in the canonical approach ===

It is also possible to derive approximate Bose–Einstein statistics in the [[canonical ensemble]].
These derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles.
The reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble. The Bose–Einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization, but the mathematically best derivation is by the [[Darwin–Fowler method]] of mean values as emphasized by Dingle.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Dingle, Asymptotic Expansions: Their Derivation and Interpretation, Academic Press (1973), pp. 267–271.&lt;/ref&gt; See also Müller-Kirsten.&lt;ref&gt;H.J.W. Müller-Kirsten, Basics of Statistical Physics, 2nd ed., World Scientific (2013), {{ISBN|978-981-4449-53-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fluctuations of the ground state in the condensed region are however markedly different in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles.&lt;ref name=ZiffKacUhlenbeck77&gt;Ziff R. M;  Kac, M.; Uhlenbeck, G. E. (1977). "[https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(77)90052-7 The ideal Bose-Einstein gas, revisited.]" ''[[Physics Reports|Phys. Reports]]'' '''32''': 169-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hidden begin|style=border:#aaa 1px solid|titlestyle=text-align:center|title=Derivation}}
Suppose we have a number of energy levels, labeled by index
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt;, each level 
having energy &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; and containing a total of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; particles.  Suppose each level contains 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g_i&lt;/math&gt;
distinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta, in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. 
The value of  
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g_i&lt;/math&gt; associated with level &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt; is called the "degeneracy" of that energy level. Any number of bosons can occupy the same sublevel.

Let &lt;span id="w(n,g)"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be the number of ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles among the 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt; sublevels of an energy level. There is only one way of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles with one sublevel, therefore 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,1)=1&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that
there are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles in two sublevels which we will write as:

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,2)=\frac{(n+1)!}{n!1!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

With a little thought 
(see [[#Notes|Notes]] below) 
it can be seen that the number of ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles in three sublevels is

:&lt;math&gt;w(n,3) = w(n,2) + w(n-1,2) + \cdots + w(1,2) + w(0,2)
&lt;/math&gt;
so that

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,3)=\sum_{k=0}^n w(n-k,2) = \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(n-k+1)!}{(n-k)!1!}=\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the following &lt;span id="theorem"&gt;theorem&lt;/span&gt; involving [[binomial coefficient]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(k+a)!}{k!a!}=\frac{(n+a+1)!}{n!(a+1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing this process, we can see that 
&lt;span id="w(n,g)"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
is just a binomial coefficient
(See [[#Notes|Notes]] below)

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,g)=\frac{(n+g-1)!}{n!(g-1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the population numbers for two particles in three sublevels are 200, 110, 101, 020, 011, or 002 for a total of six which equals 4!/(2!2!). The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:

:&lt;math&gt;
W = \prod_i w(n_i,g_i) =  \prod_i \frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}
\approx\prod_i \frac{(n_i+g_i)!}{n_i!(g_i)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximation assumes that &lt;math&gt;n_i \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Following the same procedure used in deriving the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], we wish to find the set of  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; for which  ''W'' is maximised, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed total number of particles, and a fixed total energy. The maxima of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \ln(W)&lt;/math&gt; occur at the same value of  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximise the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using [[Lagrange multipliers]] forming the function:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(n_i)=\ln(W)+\alpha(N-\sum n_i)+\beta(E-\sum n_i \varepsilon_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the &lt;math&gt;n_i \gg 1&lt;/math&gt; approximation and using [[Stirling's approximation]] for the factorials &lt;math&gt;\left(x!\approx x^x\,e^{-x}\,\sqrt{2\pi x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;f(n_i)=\sum_i (n_i + g_i) \ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \ln(n_i) +\alpha\left(N-\sum n_i\right)+\beta\left(E-\sum n_i \varepsilon_i\right)+K.&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''K'' is the sum of a number of terms which are not functions of the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, and setting the result to zero and solving for  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields the Bose–Einstein population numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\alpha+\beta \varepsilon_i}-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By a process similar to that outlined in the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] article, it can be seen that:
:&lt;math&gt;d\ln W=\alpha\,dN+\beta\,dE&lt;/math&gt;

which, using Boltzmann's famous relationship &lt;math&gt;S=k_{\rm B}\,\ln W&lt;/math&gt; becomes a statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] at constant volume, and it follows that &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_{\rm B}T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = - \frac{\mu}{k_{\rm B}T}&lt;/math&gt; where ''S'' is the [[entropy]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], so that finally:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i-\mu)/k_{\rm B}T}-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above formula is sometimes written:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\varepsilon_i/k_{\rm B}T}/z-1},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle z=\exp(\mu/k_{\rm B}T)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the absolute [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]], as noted by McQuarrie.&lt;ref&gt;See McQuarrie in citations&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note that when the particle numbers are not conserved, removing the conservation of particle numbers constraint is equivalent to setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to zero. This will be the case for photons and massive particles in mutual equilibrium and the resulting distribution will be the [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]].

A much simpler way to think of Bose–Einstein distribution function is to consider that '''n''' particles are denoted by identical balls and '''g shells are marked by g-1 line partitions.''' It is clear that the [[permutation#Permutations of multisets|permutation]]s of these '''n balls''' and '''g&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 partitions''' will give different ways of arranging bosons in different energy levels. Say, for 3 (=&amp;nbsp;''n'') particles and 3 (=&amp;nbsp;''g'') shells, therefore (''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the arrangement might be '''|●●|●''', or '''||●●●''', or '''|●|●● ''', etc. Hence the number of distinct permutations of n + (g-1) objects which have n identical items and (''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) identical items will be:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \frac{(g-1 + n)!}
   {(g-1)! n!}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''OR'''

The purpose of these notes is to clarify some aspects of the derivation of the Bose–Einstein (B–E) 
distribution for beginners.  The enumeration of cases (or ways) in the B–E distribution can be recast as 
follows.  Consider a game of dice throwing in which there are 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; dice, 
with each die taking values in the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \{ 1, \dots, g \}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;g \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.  
The constraints of the game are that the value of a die 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_i&lt;/math&gt;, has to be 
'''''greater than or equal to''''' the value of die 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (i-1)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;, in the previous throw, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;m_i \ge m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus a valid sequence of die throws can be described by an 
''n''-tuple 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle ( m_1 , m_2 , \dots , m_n)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;m_i \ge m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of these valid ''n''-tuples:

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   S(n,g) = 
   \Big\{ 
      \left( m_1 , m_2 , \dots , m_n \right) 
      \Big| \Big.
      m_i \ge m_{i-1} ,
      m_i \in \left\{ 1,  \dots, g \right\} ,
      \forall i = 1, \dots , n 
   \Big\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (1)
|}

Then the quantity &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; ([[#w(n,g)|defined above]] as the number of ways to distribute 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles among the 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt; sublevels of an energy level) is the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the number of elements (or valid ''n''-tuples) in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the problem of finding an expression for 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; 
becomes the problem of counting the elements in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1&lt;/math&gt;, except for the last index, 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is incremented from 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1&lt;/math&gt; to
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;.
Subset 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (b)&lt;/math&gt;
is obtained by fixing 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_1 = m_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and incrementing 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_3&lt;/math&gt; from 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2&lt;/math&gt; to

the index
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_4&lt;/math&gt; must 
automatically
take values in

The construction of subsets
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (c)&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (d)&lt;/math&gt;
follows in the same manner.

Each element of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a 
[[multiset]] 
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=4&lt;/math&gt;; 
the elements of such multiset are taken from the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;,
and the number of such multisets is the 
[[multiset#Multiset coefficients|multiset coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \left\langle 
      \begin{matrix} 
	 3 
	 \\ 
	 4 
      \end{matrix}
   \right\rangle 
   = {3 + 4 - 1 \choose 3-1}
   = {3 + 4 - 1 \choose 4}
   =
   \frac
   {6!}
   {4! 2!}
   = 15
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, each element of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;
is a 
[[multiset]] 
of cardinality
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt;
(number of dice)
with elements taken from the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left\{ 1, \dots, g \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt;
(number of possible values of each die),
and the number of such multisets, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;
is the 
[[multiset#Multiset coefficients|multiset coefficient]]
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \left\langle 
      \begin{matrix} 
	 g 
	 \\ 
	 n 
      \end{matrix}
   \right\rangle 
   = {g + n - 1 \choose g-1}
   = {g + n - 1 \choose n}
   = 
   \frac{(g + n - 1)!}
   {n! (g-1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (2)
|}
which is exactly the same as the 
[[#w(n,g)|formula]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;, as derived above with the aid
of
a [[#theorem|theorem]] involving binomial coefficients, namely

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(k+a)!}{k!a!}=\frac{(n+a+1)!}{n!(a+1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (3)
|}

To understand the decomposition
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k=0}^n
   w(n-k, g-1)
   =
   w(n, g-1)
   +
   w(n-1, g-1)
   +
   \cdots
   +
   w(1, g-1)
   +
   w(0, g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (4)
|}
or for example, 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=4&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(4,3)
   =
   w(4,2)
   +
   w(3,2)
   +
   w(2,2)
   +
   w(1,2)
   +
   w(0,2),
&lt;/math&gt;

let us rearrange the elements of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt; as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
   S(4,3) =
   \left\{ 
      \underbrace{
	 (1111), 
	 (1112), 
	 (1122), 
	 (1222), 
	 (2222)
      }_{(\alpha)},
      \underbrace{
	 (111{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}),
	 (112{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}), 
	 (122{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}), 
	 (222{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}) 
      }_{(\beta)},
   \right.
&lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
      \underbrace{
	 (11{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}),
	 (12{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}), 
	 (22{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}) 
      }_{(\gamma)},
      \underbrace{
	 (1{\color{Red}{\underset{===}{333}}}),
	 (2{\color{Red}{\underset{===}{333}}}) 
      }_{(\delta)}
      \underbrace{
	 ({\color{Red}{\underset{====}{3333}}})
      }_{(\omega)}
   \right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, the subset
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;
is the same as the set
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(4,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (1111), 
	 (1112), 
	 (1122), 
	 (1222), 
	 (2222)
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;.

By deleting the index 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_4=3&lt;/math&gt;
(shown in &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red with double underline&lt;/span&gt;)
in
the subset 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;,
one obtains
the set
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(3,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (111),
	 (112), 
	 (122), 
	 (222) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subset
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;
and the set
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(3,2)&lt;/math&gt;.  We write
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\beta)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(3,2)
&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, it is easy to see that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\gamma)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(2,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (11),
	 (12), 
	 (22) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\delta)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(1,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (1),
	 (2) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\omega)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(0,2)
   =
   \varnothing
&lt;/math&gt; (empty set).

Thus we can write 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(4,3) 
   =
   \bigcup_{k=0}^{4}
   S(4-k,2)
&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally,
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(n,g) 
   =
   \bigcup_{k=0}^{n}
   S(n-k,g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;;
| style="width:5%" | (5)
|}
and since the sets 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(i,g-1) \ , \ {\rm for} \ i = 0, \dots , n
&lt;/math&gt;
are non-intersecting, we thus have
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k=0}^{n}
   w(n-k,g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;,
| style="width:5%" | (6)
|}
with the convention that
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(0,g)
   =
   1 \ , \forall g
   \ ,
   {\rm and}
   \ 
   w(n,0)
   =
   1 \ , \forall n
&lt;/math&gt;.
| style="width:5%" | (7)
|}
Continuing the process, we arrive at the following formula
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   w(n - k_1 - k_2, g-2)
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   \cdots
   \sum_{k_g=0}^{n-\sum_{j=1}^{g-1} k_j}
   w(n - \sum_{i=1}^{g} k_i, 0).
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the convention (7)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above, we obtain the formula
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   \cdots
   \sum_{k_g=0}^{n-\sum_{j=1}^{g-1} k_j}
   1,
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (8)
|}

keeping in mind that for 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p&lt;/math&gt;
being constants, we have
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \sum_{k=0}^{q}
   p
   =
   q p
&lt;/math&gt;.
| style= | (9)
|}

It can then be verified that (8) and (2) give the same result for 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(3,3)&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(3,2)&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

==Interdisciplinary applications==

Viewed as a pure [[probability distribution]], the Bose–Einstein distribution has found application in other fields:

* In recent years, Bose Einstein statistics have also been used as a method for term weighting in [[information retrieval]]. The method is one of a collection of DFR ("Divergence From Randomness") models,&lt;ref name=bia1&gt;Amati, G.; C. J. Van Rijsbergen (2002). "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582416 Probabilistic models of information retrieval based on measuring the divergence from randomness ]" ''[[ACM Transactions on Information Systems|ACM TOIS]]'' '''20'''(4):357–389.&lt;/ref&gt; the basic notion being that Bose Einstein statistics may be a useful indicator in cases where a particular term and a particular document have a significant relationship that would not have occurred purely by chance. Source code for implementing this model is available from the [http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/terrier/doc/dfr_description.html Terrier project] at the University of Glasgow.
* {{Main article|Bose–Einstein condensation (network theory)}} The evolution of many complex systems, including the [[World Wide Web]], business, and citation networks, is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the system's constituents. Despite their irreversible and nonequilibrium nature these networks follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose–Einstein condensation. Addressing the dynamical properties of these nonequilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the "first-mover-advantage," "fit-get-rich('''FGR''')," and "winner-takes-all" phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks.&lt;ref name=bia2&gt;Bianconi, G.;  Barabási, A.-L. (2001). "[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v86/i24/p5632_1 Bose–Einstein Condensation in Complex Networks.]" ''[[Physical Review Letters|Phys. Rev. Lett.]]'' '''86''': 5632–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brain Gym International''' is the [[trade name]] of the Educational Kinesiology Foundation, a California nonprofit organization that promotes a series of exercises called "Brain Gym" that the company claims improve academic performance. The underlying ideas are [[pseudoscience]], and as of 2014 there was no good evidence that the exercises are effective in improving learning.

==Business==
In the 1970s, Paul and Gail Dennison developed a set of physical exercises that they say improve children's ability to learn and that they say are based in neuroscience; they called their approach "educational kinesthesiology".&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee Evidence Check|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/091125-evidence-check-government-responses-to-questions-from-the-iuss-committee.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spaulding|first1=Lucinda S.|last2=Mostert|first2=Mark P.|last3=Beam|first3=Andrea P.|title=Is Brain Gym® an Effective Educational Intervention?|journal=Exceptionality|date=19 January 2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1080/09362830903462508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company makes money training people in the methods, and licenses the right to use the "Brain Gym" trademark to people whom it trains; the trained people use branded books and other materials they buy from the company.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;  Schools pay the trained people to work in schools, training teachers and working with students.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

== Methods ==
The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air, and drinking water which are claimed to increase blood flow to the brain, "integrate" the brain, and "repattern" the brain.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre2010/&gt;

One of the underlying ideas is that the exercises are meant to ‘balance’ the [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]] so the two "sides" work together better; there is also a notion of integrating the "top" parts of the brain with the "lower" parts of the brain to integrate thought and emotion, as well as integrating visual, auditory, and motor skills; these are all fairly common "neuromyths" based on work published by [[Samuel Orton]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-NN2014"/&gt;

Another idea is that of "brain buttons" - spots on the neck that if touched in certain ways, can stimulate the flow of blood to the brain.&lt;ref name=TLRP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sense2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/233/ |title=Sense About Science – Brain Gym |publisher=[[Sense About Science]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122215146/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/pdf/braingym.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2009 |quote=These exercises are being taught with pseudoscientific explanations that undermine science teaching and mislead children about how their bodies work. ... There have been a few peer reviewed scientific studies into the methods of Brain Gym, but none of them found a significant improvement in general academic skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of underlying ideas is [[psychomotor patterning]], also known as the Doman-Delacato theory of development, which claims that if motor skills are not acquired in the correct order, the result will be a lifelong deficit in learning ability, and also claims that these deficits can be overcome by going back and learning the skipped skills; this theory and claims to improve learning based on it were discredited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt; An example of this in the Brain Gym method, is to have children practice crawling.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

In 2009, after inquiries from the House of Commons, the UK [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] said that it had no policy on Brain Gym, and said that it was aware of substantial criticism, and was not aware of substantial research supporting Brain Gym's effectiveness.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

As of 2014, publications presenting research finding that the methods are effective in improving learning had not appeared in high quality journals, and the papers that had been published were widely condemned for methodological flaws and small sample sizes that made generalization not possible.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

'''Byzantine law''' was essentially a continuation of [[Roman law]] with increased [[Christian]] influence. Most sources define ''Byzantine law'' as the Roman legal traditions starting after the reign of [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century and ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century.

Though during and after the [[European Renaissance]] Western legal practices were heavily influenced by ''[[Justinian's Code]]'' (the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'') and Roman law during classical times,&lt;ref&gt;http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine law nevertheless had substantial influence on Western traditions during the [[Middle Ages]] and after.

The most important work of Byzantine law was the [[Ecloga]], issued by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], the first major Roman-Byzantine legal code issued in Greek rather than Latin. Soon after the ''Farmer's Law'' was established regulating legal standards outside the cities. While the Ecloga was influential throughout the Mediterranean (and Europe) because of the importance of Constantinople as a trading center, the Farmer's Law was a seminal influence on Slavic legal traditions including [[Law of Russia|those of Russia]].

==Influences and sources==
Byzantium inherited its main political, cultural and social institutions from Rome. Similarly, Roman law constituted the basis for the Byzantine legal system. For many centuries, the two great codifications of Roman law, carried out by [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] respectively, were the cornerstones of Byzantine legislation. Of course, over the years these Roman codes were adjusted to the current circumstances, and then replaced by new codifications, written in Greek. However, the influence of Roman law persisted, and it is obvious in codifications, such as ''[[Basilika]]'', which was based on ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. In the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]] prides himself for being acquainted with the Roman legal legacy ("Ἰταλῶν σοφία").&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the late Roman legal tradition, the main source of law (''fons legum'') in Byzantium remained the enactments of the emperors. The latter initiated some major codifications of the Roman law, but they also issued their own "new laws", the ''Novels'' ("Novellae", "Νεαραὶ"). In early Byzantine (late Roman) era the legislative interest of the emperors intensified, and laws were now regulating the main aspects of public, private, economic and social life.&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 53&amp;ndash;54; R. Morris, "Dispute Settlement", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 399&amp;ndash;400.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Constantine I]] was the first to regulate divorce and Theodosius I intervened in faith issues, imposing a specific version of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 56, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Diocletian]] to [[Theodosius I]], namely during approximately 100 years, more than 2,000 laws were issued. Justinian alone promulgated approximately 600 laws. Gradually, the legislative enthusiasm receded, but still some of the laws of later emperors, such as [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo III]]'s ''Novels'', are of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; Custom continued to play a limited role as a secondary source of law, but written legislation had a precedence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Morris, "Dispute Settlement", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 401&amp;ndash;402.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Byzantine period ==
There is no definitively established date for when the so-called ''Byzantine'' period of Roman history begins. During the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries the Empire was split and united administratively more than once. But it was during this period that Constantinople was first established and the East gained its own identity administratively; thus, it is often considered the ''early'' Byzantine period. Despite this, though, the legal developments during this period are typically considered part of ''Roman'' Law, as opposed to ''Byzantine'' Law, in part because legal documents during this period were still written in Latin. These developments, nevertheless, were key steps in the formation of Byzantine Law.

===Codex Theodosianus===
{{main article|Codex Theodosianus}}

In 438, Emperor Theodosius published the [[Codex Theodosianus]], which consisted of 16 books, containing all standing laws from the age of [[Constantine I]] till then.

=== Corpus Iuris Civilis ===
{{main article|Corpus Iuris Civilis}}

Soon after his accession in 527, [[Justinian]] appointed a commission to collect and codify existing Roman law. A second commission, headed by the jurist [[Tribonian]], was appointed in 530 to select matter of permanent value from the works of the jurists, to edit it and to arrange it into 50 books. In 533 this commission produced the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]a''.

Although Law as practiced in Rome had grown up as a type of case law, this was not the "Roman Law" known to the Medieval, or modern world. Now Roman law claims to be based on abstract principles of justice that were made into actual rules of law by legislative authority of the emperor or the Roman people. These ideas were transmitted to the Middle Ages in the great codification of Roman law carried throughout by the emperor Justinian. The [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] was issued in Latin in three parts: the [[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]], the Digest (Pandects), and the Code (Codex). It was the last major legal document written in Latin.

Two of the world's most widespread legal systems, [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] are based on the Corpus (in, for instance, most of Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]] and [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]).

== Middle Byzantine period ==
Following Justinian's reign the Empire entered a period of rapid decline partially enabling the Arab conquests which would further weaken the Empire. Knowledge of Latin, which had been in decline since the fall of the West, virtually disappeared making many of the old legal codices almost inaccessible. These developments contributed to a dramatic weakening of legal standards in the Empire and a substantial drop in the standards of legal scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mousourakis|first=George|title=The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law|isbn=0-7546-2108-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC|pages=402–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal practice would become much more ''pragmatic'' and, as knowledge of [[Latin language|Latin]] in the Empire waned, direct use of Justinian's ''"Corpus Juris Civilis"'' would be abandoned in favor of summaries, commentaries, and new compilations written in [[Medieval Greek|Greek]].

=== Ecloga ===
The changes in the internal life of the empire which occurred in the years following the publication of Justinian's code called for a review of the legislation, so as for the requirements of the times should be met. Within the framework of the reforms [[Leo III the Isaurian]], (the first [[Isauria]]n emperor), introduced, he provided also for the modification of current laws. In 726 he issued the "Ecloga", that bore his name as well as the name of his son Constantine.
"Ecloga", referring to both the civil and criminal law, constituted, as was declared in the title a "rectification (of the Justinian legislation) towards a more philanthropic version". The membership of the editing committee is not known, but its primary mission, however, was, on the one hand, to modify those dispositions not in step with the times and, on the other, to provide judges with a concise legal handbook to help them dispense justice properly.

The dispositions of "Ecloga", influenced by the Christian spirit, as well as by the [[common law]], protected and supported the institution of marriage, increased the rights of wives and legal children, and introduced the equality of all citizens before the law. On the other hand, the penalties of amputation and blindness were introduced, reflecting the Byzantine concept in this period of changes{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. By means of his "Ecloga" Leo addressed the judges also, inviting them ''"neither the poor to despise nor the ones unjust to let uncontrolled"''. Besides, in his effort to deter bribery in the execution of their duties he made their payment local and payable by the imperial treasury. "Ecloga" constituted the basic handbook of justice dispensation up to the days of the Macedonian emperors, that also assumed legislative activity, whereas later it influenced the ecclesiastic law of the Russian Orthodox Church. Formerly the researchers attributed the juridical collections ''"Farmer's Law", "Rhodian Sea Law"'' and ''"Military Laws"'' to [[Leo III the Isaurian]]. These views, however, are no longer valid.

=== The Farmer's Laws ===
With the exception of a few cities, and especially [[Constantinople]], where other types of urban economic activities were also developed, Byzantine society remained at its heart agricultural.  An important source regarding law, which reflects in a particularly characteristic way the internal life of the Byzantine villages during the Middle Byzantine Era (7th – end of 12th century) is the ''Nomos Georgikos'', also known as the ''Lex Rustica'' or ''Farmer's Law''. Due to its importance, the ''Farmer's Law'' roused the interest of researchers from a very early stage. Ever since it has been one of the most discussed texts concerning the internal history of Byzantium. It has been suggested that, because of the major influences caused by the influx of Slavs into the Empire at the time the Farmer's Law was established, Slavic traditions were in fact an important influence of the Farmer's Law, both in terms of why it was developed and its content.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'', pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a private collection, continuously enriched, and refers to specific cases relevant to rural property within the framework of the Byzantine rural "community". As evident by the dispositions of the "Law", peasants were organized in "communities" and collectively responsible for the payment of the total tax the "community" was liable for, being obliged to pay as well the amounts corresponding to indebted members of the community. As for the chronology of its writing, since the text itself bears no specific date, it is placed somewhere in between the second half of the 6th century and the middle of the 14th. Very early on, it was acknowledged as a legal handbook of great importance and greatly influenced much of the law of the Slavic countries and especially [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]].

=== The Sea Laws ===
Dating  problems, similar to the ones of the ''"Farmer's Law"'', presents a code of equal character, the "Rhodian Sea Law" (''Nomos Rhodion Nautikos''). Written probably between 600 and 800, it is a collection of [[maritime law]] regulations divided into three parts. The first part refers to the ratification of the "Naval Law" by the Roman emperors. The second specifies the participation of the crew in maritime profits and the regulations valid on the ship, while the third and largest refers to maritime law, as for example to the apportionment of responsibility in case of theft or damage to the cargo or the ship. The ''"Naval Law"'' was included in the ''Basilika'' of [[Leo VI the Wise]] as a complement to book 53.

=== Ecclesiastical law ===
In accordance with the model of the secular legal associations, the canons of the ecclesiastic councils concerned ecclesiastic issues and  regulated the conduct of the clergy, as well as of the secular as concerned matters of belief. The "In Trullo" or "Fifth-Sixth Council", known for its canons, was convened in the years of Justinian II (691-692) and occupied itself exclusively with matters of discipline. The aim of the synod was to cover the gaps left in canon law by the previous Fifth (553)and Sixth [[Ecumenical Councils]].

This collection of canons was divided into four parts:

a) The canons ratifying the doctrinal decisions of the first six ecumenical councils along with the teachings of the Fathers of the Church.

b) The canons specifying the obligations of the ministrational clergy.

c) The canons referring to the monks.

d) The canons referring to the secular. The influence of these canons carried on in the future and they were extensively annotated by Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenos, the three great ecclesiastic jurists of the 12th century.

There were also other [[Ancient Church Orders]] no longer extant in Greek. Later, more-scientific collections emerged, including:

* The ''[[Nomocanon]]'' of [[John Scholasticus]], from the 6th century 
* The ''Nomocanon'' in 14 titles of [[Heraclius]], from the 7th century
* The ''Nomocanon'' of [[Photios]], from the 9th century

* The ''Synopsis Canonum'' by [[Alexios Aristenos]], from the 12th century

All of these books were compiled later by the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk Saint [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]] and became the basis of the modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] law, his ''[[Pedalion]]''.

== Later Byzantine law ==
The following legal texts were prepared in the later Byzantine Empire:
* The ''Prochiron'' of Basil the Macedonian, c. 870&lt;ref name="Mears"&gt;Lambert Mears, Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, pp. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt; or 872,&lt;ref name="Laiou"&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; which invalidates parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restores Justinians Laws, as well as Hellenising arcane Latin expressions.
* The ''Epanagoge'' (repetita proelectio legis),&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; also of [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], together with his sons, a second edition of the Prochiron, c.879 - 886&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Eisagoge'' of Photios, which includes novel law, c.880&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;
* The ''[[Basilika|Basilicae]]'' (repurgatio veterum legum) or ''Basilics'' of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo the Philosopher]], together with his brother [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] and [[Constantine VII]], c.900&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt; or 906-11,&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; which attempts to synthesise 6th century commentaries and glosses on Justinians laws by headings, and remove contradictions.  By the 11th century, the Basilics had replaced Justinian's laws as the primary source of Roman law.
* The ''Synopsis (Basilicorum) maior'', an abridgment of the ''Basilika'' from the late 9th century&lt;ref&gt;G. Mousourakis, Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Epitome Legum'', later known as the Epitome ad Prochiron mutata, a synthesis of Justinian and the Epanagoge, c. 920-1&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;
* The ''Epanagoge aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Epanagogue from c.11th century.&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Prochiron aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Prochiron from c.13th century.&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Hexabiblos'', a 14th-century compilation of the above books made by [[Constantine Harmenopoulos]], a judge in [[Thessalonica]]
* The ''Hexabiblos aucta'', a late 14th century revision of Harmenopoulos' work by  Ioannes Holobolos
Other jurists (including at least one Emperor) prepared private collections of cases and commentaries,&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; but these did not form the body of law used by jurists at large.  It is held that the ''113 Novels of Leo the Wise'' fall into this category.&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;

Lokin&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt; argues that while later legal texts tended to rearrange or explain the 6th century work of Justinian, rather than create new law, they did alter the locus of authority for law (''legis vigor'') from the Emperor to God.  In Justinian's work, Mosaïc Law and God's authority ''support'' the Emperor, and are consultative, but do not temper his absolute authority.  This process has already begun in the  ''Ecloga'', which states law is God-given by way of Isaiah 8:20, and is made explicit first in the Prochiron.&lt;ref&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  There was, however, 'legislative creep' over this period, where the redaction of old laws and case law created new laws in effect, although not explicitly cited as such.&lt;ref&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During the early Middle Ages Roman/Byzantine Law played a major role throughout the Mediterranean region and much of Europe because of the economic and military importance of the Empire.

The [[Syro-Roman law book]], a Syriac translation of a Greek original from the 5th century, was highly influential in eastern Christian communities after the early Muslim conquests. It was based on Roman case law and imperial statutes from the east of the empire.

After the Islamic conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Islamic caliphates gradually codified their legal systems using Roman/Byzantine law as an important model. It has been suggested in fact that it was the publication of the Ecloga that spurred the first major codification of Islamic imperial law.&lt;ref&gt;B. Jokisch, ''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'', pp. 484-485.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavic legal traditions, including countries ranging from [[Bulgaria]] to [[Russia]], were substantially influenced by the Farmer's Law. To a lesser extent the Ecloga and other Byzantine codices influenced these areas as well. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as Russia increased its contact with the West, Justinian's Code began to be studied thus bringing in this influence.

In Western Europe, following the fall of the Roman Empire, the influence of Roman/Byzantine law became more indirect though always significant during much of the Middle Ages. During the European Renaissance, Western scholars embraced Justinian's Code as a basis for jurisprudence, shunning many of the later legal developments of the Byzantine Empire such as the Ecloga. This was to a great extent affected by the East/West ([[Roman Catholic]] vs. [[Eastern Orthodox]]) split in the Church. The perception in the West was that Roman law that was recorded in Latin was truly ''Roman'' whereas later laws written in Greek was distinct and foreign.

In [[computational biology]], '''cellular Potts model''' (CPM) is a computational model of the collective behavior of cellular structures. It allows modelling of many phenomena, such as cell migration, clustering, and growth taking [[cell adhesion|adhesive forces]], [[cell signalling|environment sensing]] as well as volume and surface-area constraints into account. The first CPM was proposed for the simulation of cell sorting by [[François Graner|Graner]] and [[James Glazier|Glazier]] as a modification of a large-Q [[Potts model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graner|first1=Fraçois|last2=Glazier|first2=James|title=Simulation of biological cell sorting using a two-dimensional extended Potts model|journal=[[Physical Review Letters|Phys. Rev. Lett.]]|year=1992|volume=69|issue=13|pages=2013–7|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2013|url=https://www.if.ufrgs.br/~leon/cursopg/mod_min/Articles/PRL_69-13-2013.pdf|bibcode = 1992PhRvL..69.2013G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the model was developed to model [[biological cell]]s it can also be used to model individual parts of a biological cell, or even regions of fluid.

== Model description ==
The CPM works on a rectangular [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[lattice (group)|lattice]] where it represents each cell as a [[subset]] of lattice sites sharing the same ''cell ID'' (analogical to spin in Potts models in physics). In order to evolve the model [[Metropolis algorithm|Metropolis]]-style updates are performed, that is,
# choose a lattice site and propose a new cell ID to be assigned to it, and
# decide if to accept or reject this change based on an energy function called the ''[[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]''.

=== The Hamiltonian ===
The Hamiltonian is a central component of every CPM. It is determined by the configuration of the cell lattice. A basic Hamiltonian proposed by Graner and Glazier included adhesion energies and volume constraints:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H = \sum_{i,j\text{ neighbors}}J\left(\tau(\sigma_i),\tau(\sigma_j)\right)\left(1-\delta(\sigma_i,\sigma_j)\right)
  + \lambda\sum_{i}\left(v(\sigma_i)- V(\sigma_i)\right)^2.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where i, j are lattice sites, σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the cell at site i, τ(σ) is the cell type of cell σ, J is the boundary coefficient determining the adhesion between two cells of types τ(σ),τ(σ'), δ is the [[Kronecker delta]], v(σ) is the volume of cell σ, V(σ) is the target volume, λ is a [[Lagrange multiplier]] determining the strength of the volume constraint.

The Hamiltonian can be modified to control cell behaviors such as [[chemotaxis]], elongation and [[haptotaxis]] by using other sub-lattices containing information such as the concentrations of chemicals.

== Extensions ==
Over time, the CPM has evolved from a specific model to a general framework with many extensions and even related methods that are entirely or partially off-lattice.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Multiscale and hybrid modeling using CPM ===
Core GGH (or CPM) algorithm which defines the evolution of the cellular level structures can easily be integrated with intracellular signaling dynamics, reaction diffusion dynamics and rule based model to account for the processes which happen at lower (or higher) time scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2013.00087/abstract|title = Cellular potts modeling of tumor growth, tumor invasion, and tumor evolution|last = Szabó|first = A|date = 2013|journal = Frontiers in Oncology|doi = 10.3389/fonc.2013.00087|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Merks|first2 = RM|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open source software Bionetsolver can be used to integrate intracellular dynamics with CPM algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033726|title = Integrating intracellular dynamics using CompuCell3D and Bionetsolver: applications to multiscale modelling of cancer cell growth and invasion|last = Andasari|first = Vivi|date = 2012|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0033726|pmid = 22461894|last2 = Roper|first2 = Ryan T|last3 = Swat|first3 = Maciej H|last4 = Chaplain|first4 = MA|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...733726A|volume=7|pages=e33726|pmc=3312894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human anatomy]], the '''cephalic  vein''' &lt;ref name=HealthlineBasilic&gt;{{cite web|title=BodyMaps: Median basilic vein|url=http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/median-basilic-vein|publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[superficial vein]] in the arm.

It communicates with the [[basilic vein]] via the [[median cubital vein]] at the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] and is located in the superficial [[fascia]] along the anterolateral surface of the [[biceps brachii muscle]].

Near the shoulder, the cephalic vein passes between the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] and [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] [[muscle]]s ([[deltopectoral groove]]) and through the [[deltopectoral triangle]], where it empties into the [[axillary vein]].

== Clinical significance ==
The cephalic vein is often visible through the [[skin]], and its location in the deltopectoral groove is fairly consistent, making this site a good candidate for venous access. [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|Permanent pacemaker]] leads are often placed in the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral groove. The vein may be used for [[intravenous therapy|intravenous access]], as large bore [[cannula]] may be easily placed.&lt;ref name="HealthlineCephalic"&gt;{{cite web|title=BodyMaps: Cephalic vein|url=http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/cephalic-vein|publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cannulation of a vein as close to the radial nerve as the cephalic vein can sometimes lead to nerve damage.&lt;ref name="HealthlineCephalic" /&gt;

==History==
Ordinarily the term ''[[cephalic]]'' refers to anatomy of the head. When Persian physician [[Ibn Sīnā]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Canon]] was translated into [[medieval Latin]], ''cephalic'' was mistakenly chosen to render the [[Arabic]] term ''al-kífal'', meaning "outer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diab|first=Mohammad|title=Lexicon of orthopaedic etymology|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-90-5702-597-6|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Rand|title=Etymology of shoulder and arm terms|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/resources/etymology/Shoulder_arm.htm|publisher=© O'Rahilly 2008|location=Dartmouth Medical School|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''certificate''' (also called a '''witness''') is a string that certifies the answer to a computation, or certifies the membership of some string in a language. A certificate is often thought of as a solution path within a verification process, which is used to check whether a problem gives the answer "Yes" or "No". 

In the [[decision tree model]] of computation, certificate complexity is the minimum number of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; input variables of a [[decision tree]] that need to be assigned a value in order to definitely establish the value of the [[Boolean function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

The notion of certificate is used to define semi-decidability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Stephen|title=Computability and Noncomputability|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/comp.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

L ∈ SD iff there is a two-place predicate R ⊆ Σ∗ × Σ∗ such that R is computable, and such that for all x ∈ Σ∗:
    x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that R(x, y)

It can also be used to define the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]]:

L ∈ NP iff there is a [[polytime]] verifier V such that:
    x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that |y| &lt;= |x|&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; and V accepts (x, y)

==Example==
  L = {&lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w&gt; | does &lt;M&gt; accept x in |w| steps?}
  Show L ∈ NP.
  '''verifier:'''
    gets string c = &lt;M&gt;, x, w such that |c| &lt;= P(|w|)
    check if c is an accepting computation of M on x with at most |w| steps
    |c| &lt;= O(|w|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
    if we have a computation of a TM with k steps the total size of the computation string is k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
    Thus, &lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w&gt; ∈ L ⇔ there exists c &lt;= a|w|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w, c&gt; ∈ V ∈ P

'''Coreshine''' is an astronomical term for [[infrared]] light scattered by unusually large grains of dust in the denser core regions of [[molecular clouds]] and which evidently begin their growth before the start of cloud collapse. These clouds which are opaque to visible light, are a mixture of gas and dust and are the regions where stars are formed.

Coreshine offers a new tool for observing the earliest phases of [[star formation]], a process effectively hidden up to now. The scattered mid-infrared light, found throughout our galaxy, could reveal the origins of the cloud material, the size and density of the dust particles, the age of the core region, the distribution of the dust and gas, and the chemical processes taking place deep inside the cloud.

The phenomenon was first studied seriously with [[NASA]]’s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Researchers Laurent Pagani ([[CNRS]], [[Paris Observatory]]), Jürgen Steinacker ([[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]]) and colleagues from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and ''Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de l’Observatoire de Grenoble'', discovered surprisingly bright mid-infrared radiation from the core of the molecular cloud L183 in the constellation [[Serpens Cauda]] 360 light-years away. Using computer simulations, it became clear that they were observing light scattered by particles of around 1 micrometer in diameter. In a follow-up they studied 110 molecular clouds, at distances between 300 and 1300 light-years, and which had been part of previous Spitzer surveys. The results showed that coreshine is a widespread phenomenon and was present in about half the clouds studied. Clouds in the southern constellation [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] show no coreshine and it is thought that this has been brought about by recorded supernova explosions in the region, blowing away or destroying larger dust particles.

Coreshine will lead to new projects for both the Spitzer and [[James Webb Space Telescope]], due to be launched in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/ Universe Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aa/full_html/2010/03/aa12835-09/aa12835-09.html Direct evidence of dust growth in L183 from mid-infrared light scattering - Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diogenites''' are a group of the [[HED meteorite]] clan, a type of [[achondrite|achondritic]] stony [[meteorite]]s.

==Origin and composition==
Diogenites are currently believed to originate from deep within the crust of the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]], and as such are part of the [[HED meteorite]] clan. There are about 40 distinct members known.

Diogenites are composed of [[igneous]] rocks of [[plutonic]] origin, having solidified slowly enough deep within [[4 Vesta|Vesta's]] crust to form crystals which are larger than in the [[eucrite]]s. These crystals are primarily [[magnesium]]-rich [[orthopyroxene]], with small amounts of [[plagioclase]] and [[olivine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beck |first=A. W. |last2=McSween |first2=H.

==Name==
Diogenites are named for [[Diogenes of Apollonia]], an ancient Greek philosopher who was the first to suggest an outer space origin for meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawn|first=Walter &amp; Audrey|title=Why is it called Diogenite?|url=http://www.diogenite.com/|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SoilStack.PNG|thumb|{{colorbox|darkseagreen}}{{nbsp}}Soil stack is connected to the sewer at the bottom and vented at the top, while {{colorbox|white}}{{nbsp}}each plumbing fixture has its own trap.]]
In modern [[plumbing]], a '''drain-waste-vent''' (or DWV) is part of a system that removes [[sewage]] and [[greywater]] from a building, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes to aid free flow. Waste is produced at [[Plumbing fixture|fixtures]] such as toilets, sinks, and showers, and exits the fixtures through a [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]], a dipped section of pipe that always contains water.

== Overview ==
DWV systems maintain [[pressure|neutral air pressure]] in the drains, allowing free flow of [[water]] and [[sanitary sewer|sewage]] down drains and through waste pipes by [[gravity]]. It is critical that a sufficient downward slope be maintained throughout, to keep liquids and entrained solids flowing freely towards the main drain from the building. In relatively rare situations, a downward slope out of a building to the sewer cannot be created, and a special collection pit and grinding lift "sewage ejector" [[pump]] are needed. By contrast, [[potable water]] supply systems operate under pressure to distribute water up through buildings, and do not require a continuous downward slope in their piping.

Every fixture is required to have an internal or external [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]]; double trapping is prohibited by [[plumbing code]]s due to its susceptibility to clogging. Every plumbing fixture must also have an attached vent. The top of stacks must be vented too, via a '''stack vent''', which is sometimes called a '''stink pipe'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Gee|title=Cat burglar's crude escape|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/cat-burglars-crude-escape/story-e6freuzi-1111114069411|date=30 July 2007|accessdate=20 March 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All plumbing waste fixtures use traps to prevent [[sewer gas]]es from leaking into the house. Through traps, all fixtures are connected to waste lines, which in turn take the waste to a "soil stack", or "soil vent pipe". At the building drain system's lowest point, the drain-waste vent is attached, and rises (usually inside a wall) to and out of the roof. Waste exits from the building through the building's main drain and flows through a sewage line, which leads to a [[septic system]] or a [[sanitary sewer|public sewer]]. [[Cesspit]]s are generally prohibited in developed areas.

The '''venting system''', or '''plumbing vents''', consists of a number of pipes leading from waste pipes to the outdoors, usually through the roof. Vents provide a means to release sewer gases outside instead of inside the house. Vents also admit oxygen to the waste system to allow [[aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] sewage digestion, and to discourage noxious [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic decomposition]].{{elucidate|date=March 2015}} Vents provide a way to equalize the pressure on both sides of a trap, thereby allowing the trap to hold the water which is needed to maintain effectiveness of the trap, and avoiding "trap suckout" which otherwise might occur.

== Operation ==

A [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] pipe is normally at neutral air pressure compared to the surrounding [[atmosphere]]. When a column of [[waste water]] flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead of it in the pipe, creating a ''positive'' pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream trap water seals. As the column of water passes, air must freely flow in behind the waste stream, or ''negative'' pressure results. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge.

Excessive negative air pressure, behind a "slug" of water that is draining, can [[siphon]] water from [[Trap (plumbing)|traps]] at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a [[toilet]] outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious [[sewer gas]]es to enter a building.

On the other hand, if the air pressure within the drain becomes suddenly higher than ambient, this positive transient could cause waste water to be pushed into the fixture, breaking the trap seal, with serious [[hygiene]] and health consequences if too forceful. [[Tall buildings]] of three or more stories are particularly susceptible to this problem. '''Vent stacks''' are installed in parallel to waste stacks to allow proper venting in tall buildings.

== External venting ==
Most residential building drainage systems in North America are vented directly through the building roofs. The DWV pipe is typically [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or [[PVC]] DWV-rated plastic pipe equipped with a [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] at the roof penetration to prevent rainwater from entering the buildings. Older homes may use [[copper]], [[iron]], [[lead]] or [[clay]] pipes, in rough order of increasing antiquity.

Under many older building codes, a vent stack (a pipe leading to the main roof vent) is required to be within a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack.  One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run.  Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Clean-outs|cleanout]] allows for better serviceability of the long run.

A blocked vent is a relatively common problem caused by anything from leaves, to dead animals, to [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in very cold weather, or a horizontal section of the venting system, sloped the wrong way and filled with water from rain or condensation. Symptoms range from bubbles in the toilet bowl{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} when it is flushed, to slow drainage,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and all the way to siphoned (empty) traps which allow sewer gases to enter the building.

When a fixture trap is venting properly, a "sucking" sound can often be heard as the fixture vigorously empties out during normal operation. This phenomenon is harmless, and is different from "trap suckout" induced by pressure variations caused by wastewater movement ''elsewhere'' in the system, which is not supposed to allow interactions from one fixture to another. Toilets are a special case, since they are usually designed to self-siphon to ensure complete evacuation of their contents; they are then automatically refilled by a special valve mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Internal venting ==
'''Mechanical vents''' (also called '''cheater vents'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/illegal-plumbing-products-in-minnesota/180329901/ |work=[[Star Tribune]] |date=21 November 2012 |title=Illegal Plumbing Products in Minnesota |first=Reuben |last=Saltzman |quote=Mechanical vents are not allowed in Minnesota. These are often referred to as cheater vents, and they come in two varieties - an air admittance valve and a check vent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) come in two types: Air admittance valves and '''check vents''', the latter being a vent with a [[check valve]].

'''Air admittance valves''' ('''AAVs''', or commonly referred to in the UK as '''Durgo valves''' and in the US as '''Studor vents''' and '''Sure-Vent®''') are negative-pressure-activated, one-way mechanical valves, used in a [[plumbing]] or drainage venting system to eliminate the need for conventional pipe venting and roof penetrations. A discharge of [[wastewater]] causes the AAV to open, releasing the vacuum and allowing air to enter the plumbing vent pipe for proper pressure equalization.

Since AAVs will only operate under negative pressure situations, they are not suitable for all venting applications, such as venting a sump, where positive pressures are created when the sump fills. Also, where positive drainage pressures are found in larger buildings or multi-story buildings, an air admittance valve could be used in conjunction with a positive pressure reduction device such as the PAPA positive air pressure attenuator, to provide a complete venting solution for more-complicated drainage venting systems.

Using AAVs can significantly reduce the amount of venting materials needed in a plumbing system, increase plumbing labor efficiency, allow greater flexibility in the layout of plumbing fixtures, and reduce long-term roof maintenance problems associated with conventional vent stack roofing penetrations.

While some state and local building departments prohibit AAVs, the International Residential and International Plumbing Codes allow it to be used in place of a vent through the roof. AAV's are certified to reliably open and close a minimum of 500,000 times, (approximately 30 years of use) with no release of sewer gas; some manufacturers claim their units are tested for up to 1.5 million cycles, or at least 80 years of use. AAVs have been effectively used in Europe for more than two decades.{{when|date=July 2015}} US manufacturers offer warranties that range from 1 year to "lifetime".

==Island fixture vent==
[[Image:chicago loop plumbing 01.png|thumb|right|400px|Island fixture vent for under-cabinet waste plumbing]]
An '''island fixture vent''', sometimes colloquially called a "Chicago Loop" or "Bow Vent", is an alternate way of venting the [[trap (plumbing)|trap]] installed on an under [[countertop|counter]] island [[sink]] or other similar applications where a conventional vertical vent stack or [[air admittance valve]] is not feasible or allowed.

As with all drains, ventilation must be provided to allow the flowing [[wastewater|waste water]] to displace the [[sewer gas]] in the drain, and then to allow air (or some other fluid) to fill the [[vacuum]] which would otherwise form as the water flows down the pipe.

An island fixture vent provides an elegant solution for this necessity:  when the drain is opened, water displaces the sewer gas up to the [[sanitary tee]], the water flows downward while sewer gas is displaced upward and toward the vent.  The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created.

The key to a functional island fixture vent is that the top elbow must be at least as high as the "flood level" (the peak possible drain water level in the sink).  This ensures that the vent never becomes waterlogged.

===Cost===
The cost of installation is high because of the number of elbows and small pieces of pipe required.  The largest cost outlay with modern plastic drain pipes is labor. Use of [[street elbow]]s is helpful.

Alternately if moving sink to an island sink, install the P-trap below the floor of the island and vent off the top of the drain.  Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain.  Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to existing vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned.  Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g., 1.25&amp;nbsp;inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm, etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a  plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.

== Fittings ==
{{See also|Piping and plumbing fittings}}
Drainage and venting systems require not only [[piping|pipe]], but also many specialized [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]] which add considerably to their cost of construction. Special access fittings such as "[[Piping and plumbing fittings#Clean-outs|clean-outs]]" enhance the long-term maintainability of the systems, and are required by most plumbing codes.

'''Erhard Blankenburg''' (October 30, 1938 – March 28, 2018) was a German sociologist, specializing in the [[sociology of law]].
[[File:Erhard Blankenburg.jpg|thumb|Erhard Blankenburg (2013)]]

== Education and Career ==
Blankenburg studied philosophy, sociology and German literature at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the Free University Berlin. He received an MA from the University of Oregon (1965) and a PhD (D.Phil.) from the University of Basel (1966). After working as an assistant to the sociologist [[Heinrich Popitz]] at the University of Freiburg (1966-1968), he received there his [[habilitation]] (1974). From 1975 to 1980, Blankenburg worked at the renowned [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung|Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin]]. In 1980 he became professor of sociology of law at the [[Free University Amsterdam]]

In the 1970s, he was, along with [[Wolfgang Kaupen]], [[Rüdiger Lautmann]] and [[Volkmar Gessner]], instrumental in reviving sociology of law in Germany. There, he was among the founders of the "Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie", still the leading journal in the German socio-legal community. He also played a role in establishing the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]]. In 1991, together with [[Bill Felstiner]], he organized the first joint meeting of the [[Law and Society Association]] and the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], the two leading organizations of socio-legal scholars in Amsterdam. His research covered a broad range of socio-legal topics, with an interest in describing and comparing legal cultures at the centre.

In 2005, Blankenburg received, at the annual conference of the Research Committee on Sociology of Law in Paris, the [[Adam Podgórecki]] Prize "for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research".
"Blankenburg has given us an important body of work. It is work that is (and should be) extremely influential in the field; and no respectable sociologist of law  can afford to ignore it. For this he deserves out thanks and our congratulation" (Friedman 1998, 386).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19401">'''Intelligence''' and '''intelligent systems''' has to be able to [[Evolution|evolve]], self-develop, self-learn continuously in order to reflect the dynamically evolving environment. The concept of Evolving Intelligent Systems (EISs) was conceived around the turn of the century &lt;ref name="refv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv5" /&gt; with the phrase EIS itself coined for the first time in &lt;ref name="refv6" /&gt;  and expanded in.&lt;ref name="refv5" /&gt; EISs develop their structure, functionality and internal knowledge representation through [[Autonomy|autonomous]] learning from data streams generated by the possibly unknown environment and from the system self-monitoring.&lt;ref name="refv7" /&gt; EISs consider a gradual development of the underlying (fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy) system structure and differ from evolutionary and genetic [[algorithm]]s which consider such phenomena as chromosomes crossover, mutation, selection and [[reproduction]], parents and off-springs. The evolutionary fuzzy and neuro systems are sometimes also called “evolving” &lt;ref name="refv8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv10" /&gt; which leads to some confusion. This was more typical for the first works on this topic in the late 1990s.

== Implementations ==
EISs can be implemented, for example, using neural networks or fuzzy rule-based models. The first neural networks which consider an evolving structure were published in.&lt;ref name="refv11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv12x" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv12y" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv12z" /&gt; These were later expanded by N. Kasabov &lt;ref name="refv3" /&gt; and P. Angelov &lt;ref name="refv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv3a" /&gt; for the neuro-fuzzy models. P. Angelov &lt;ref name="refv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv4" /&gt; introduced the evolving fuzzy rule-based systems (EFSs) as the first mathematical self-learning model that can dynamically evolve its internal structure and is human interpretable and coined the phrase EFS. Contemporarily, the offline incremental approach for learning an EIS, namely, EFuNN, was proprosed by N. Kasabov.&lt;ref name="refv13a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv13b" /&gt; P. Angelov, D. Filev, N. Kasabov and O. Cordon organised the first IEEE Symposium on EFSs in 2006 (the proceedings of the conference can be found in &lt;ref name="refv12a" /&gt;). EFSs include a formal (and mathematically sound) learning mechanism to extract it from streaming data. One of the earliest and the most widely cited comprehensive survey on EFSs was done in 2008.&lt;ref name="refv13" /&gt; Later comprehensive surveys on EFS methods with real applications were done in 2011&lt;ref name="refv14" /&gt; and 2016&lt;ref name="refv14b" /&gt; by E. Lughofer. Other works that contributed further to this area in the following years expanded it to evolving participatory learning,&lt;ref name="refv15" /&gt; evolving grammar,&lt;ref name="refv16" /&gt; evolving decision trees,&lt;ref name="refv17" /&gt; evolving human behaviour modelling,&lt;ref name="refv18" /&gt; self-calibrating (evolving) sensors (eSensors),&lt;ref name="refv19" /&gt; evolving fuzzy rule-based classifiers,&lt;ref name="refv20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv24" /&gt; evolving fuzzy controllers,&lt;ref name="refv24b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv24a" /&gt; autonomous fault detectors.&lt;ref name="refv24d" /&gt; More recently, the stability of the evolving fuzzy rule-based systems that consist of the structure learning and the fuzzily weighted recursive least square &lt;ref name="refv4" /&gt; parameter update method has been proven by Rong and Angelov.&lt;ref name="refv24e" /&gt; Generalized EFS, which allow rules to be arbitrarily rotated in the feature space and thus to improve their data representability, have been proposed in &lt;ref name="refv24f" /&gt; with significant extensions in &lt;ref name="refv24g" /&gt; towards 'smartness' of the rule bases (thus, termed as "Generalized Smart EFS"), allowing more interpretability and reducing curse of dimensionality. The generalized rule structure was also successfully used in the context of evolving neuro-fuzzy systems in &lt;ref name="refv24h" /&gt;. Several facets and challenges for achieving more transparent and understandable rule bases in EFS have been discussed by E. Lughofer in &lt;ref name="refv24i" /&gt;. 

EISs form the theoretical and methodological basis for the Autonomous Learning Machines (ALMA)&lt;ref name="refv25" /&gt; and autonomous multi-model systems (ALMMo)&lt;ref name="refv26" /&gt; as well as of the Autonomous Learning Systems.&lt;ref name="refv7" /&gt; Evolving Fuzzy Rule-based classifiers,&lt;ref name="refv20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv24" /&gt; in particular, is a very powerful new concept that offers much more than simply incremental or online classifiers – it can cope with new classes being added or existing classes being merged. This is much more than just adapting to new data samples being added or classification surfaces being evolved. Fuzzy rule-based classifiers  &lt;ref name="refv23" /&gt;  are the methodological basis of a new approach to deep learning that was until now considered as a form of multi-layered neural networks.&lt;ref name="refv27" /&gt; Deep Learning offers high precision levels surpassing the level of human ability and grabbed the imagination of the researchers, industry and the wider public. However, it has a number of intrinsic constraints and limitations. These include:
# The “black box”, opaque internal structure which has millions of parameters and involves ad hoc decisions on the number of layers and algorithm parameters.
# The requirement for a huge amount of training data samples, computational resources (usually requiring GPUs and/or HPC) and time (usually requiring many hours of training).
# Iterative search.
# Requires retraining for new situations (is not evolving).
# Does not have proven convergence and stability.
Most, if not all, of the above limitations can be avoided with the use of the Deep (Fuzzy) Rule-based Classifiers,&lt;ref name="refv28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refv29" /&gt; which were recently introduced based on ALMMo, while achieving similar or even better performance. The resulting prototype-based IF…THEN…models are fully interpretable and dynamically evolving (they can adapt quickly and automatically to new data patterns or even new classes). They are non-parametric and, therefore, their training is non-iterative and fast (it can take few milliseconds per data sample/image on a normal laptop which contrasts with the multiple hours the current deep learning methods require for training even when they use GPUs and HPC). Moreover, they can be trained incrementally/online/in real-time. Another aspect of Evolving Fuzzy Rule-based classifiers has been proposed in &lt;ref name="refv30" /&gt;, which, in case of multi-class classification problems, achieves the reduction of class imbalance by cascadability into class sub-spaces and an increased flexibility and performance for adding new classes on the fly from streaming samples. &lt;ref name="refv31" /&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''gating''' has the following meanings:

#The process of selecting only those portions of a wave between specified [[time]] intervals or between specified amplitude limits.
#The controlling of signals by means of combinational logic elements.
#A process in which a predetermined [[set (mathematics)|set]] of conditions, when established, permits a second process to occur.

== Educating about genocide in Rwanda ==
Recent Rwanda history curricula explicitly stipulate the teaching of the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide of the Tutsi]], notably through the comparison "of different genocides" with a view to "suggest ways of preventing genocide from happening again in Rwanda and elsewhere". A comparative approach has been adopted, which is clearly reflected in the 2015 Curriculum for [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The competence-based curriculum framework mentions "[[genocide studies]]" as a cross-cutting issue, therefore introducing the study of genocide in a variety of subject areas. It further states that "Rwandan children should know about the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi alongside the Holocaust and other genocides".&lt;ref&gt;Rwanda Education Board. 2015. Competence based curriculum: Curriculum framework pre-primary to upper secondary. Ministry of Education, Republic of Rwanda. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.tcop.rw/&lt;/nowiki&gt; le/2041/download?token=T398Bm6a&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching about the 1994 genocide of the [[Tutsi]] in Rwanda, and thereby introducing genocide studies in history textbooks and curricula, has been part of a gradual process to promote national unity and peace. This process included a moratorium on some chapters of Rwandan history in 1995, which ended when considerations pertaining to the 1994 genocide were introduced into the 2008 history curriculum. Recent approaches also built on the acknowledgement of the disastrous effects of pre-genocide Rwandan education, which contributed to discrimination against the Tutsi population and constituted a backdrop for the ideology that led to the genocide. In contrast, introducing the history of the genocide in the education system was a recognition that schools, in addition to non-formal and informal learning environments, are crucial venues to impart knowledge about the genocide and to overcome silence, denial and conflict. These changes also correspond to a deeper reflection on appropriate pedagogies to help learners grapple with the legacy of the genocide. According to Jean-Damascène Gasanabo, director-general of the Research and Documentation Center on Genocide at the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide (CNLG) in Kigali, "This change in the curriculum has been supplemented by a shift to transform learning from one based on standard rote memorization to one that encourages discussion and a spirit of critical thinking and analysis.

The [[Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre|Kigali Genocide Memorial]] and [[Aegis Trust]], in partnership with other Rwandan organizations such as the Educators' Institute for Human Rights, has developed education programmes and in-service training to help teachers build capacity and acquire historical knowledge to deal with genocides and mass atrocities. Such programmes emphasize "critical thinking, empathy and individual moral responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Gasanabo, J.D., Mutanguha, F. and Mpayimana, A.. 2016. Teaching about the Holocaust and Genocide in Rwanda. Contemporary Review of the Middle East. Special Issue: Holocaust Education, Volume 3, Issue 3, pp. 329-345. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347798916654583&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They explore historical examples, primarily the genocide of the Jewish people and the genocide of the Tutsi, through a "Sustainable Peace Model/Framework" which seeks to link genocide education (looking back) to genocide prevention (looking into the present) to peace-building (looking forward).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education about the Holocaust ==
{{Main|Education about the Holocaust}}

"Genocide education" deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. [[Genocide studies]] – referring to academic research about the broader trends and patterns of genocide and mass atrocities – and genocide education have become more widespread in universities and schools, as genocide and mass atrocities are recurring phenomena in the world. The studies have expanded to examine theories about how and why genocide happens. Education about the particular event of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] includes considerations about the concept, planning and implementation of that genocide, and can prompt reflections as to how what we learn about the Holocaust can contribute to the prevention of mass atrocities today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The role of gender ==
Scholars and educators are increasingly recognizing and exploring gender as a dimension of genocide and other mass atrocities. Educators may wish to consider how gender influences, affects, and manifests itself in genocide, from the strategies of its perpetrators to the experiences of its victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, most atrocities have been committed by men. Genocide scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], however, notes that "when women, along with men, are mobilized, forced, encouraged, allowed to participate in genocide and other atrocious violence, they generally display no more reluctance than (often reluctant) males". [[Wendy Lower]], for example, studied the role of German women during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and found that relative to their role in German society and their professional positions, women participated in the perpetration of crimes "as zealous administrators, robbers, tormentors, and murderers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. 2017. Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction, 3rd edition, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lower, W. 2013. Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, Houghton Mi in Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gender can shape and dictate both the experiences of victims and the methods perpetrators employ when committing genocide and mass atrocities. Roles often relegated to the female sphere can influence the fates of women. As traditional caregivers, for example, women who provide direct care for children or elderly relatives may inadvertently hinder or eliminate their own ability to survive genocidal violence. At the same time, perpetrators often differently persecute men and women. During the Holocaust, pregnant women and mothers of small children were consistently labeled "incapable of work". Consequently, women often found themselves among the  first sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "Women during the Holocaust," &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005176&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressors' intent on a symbolic and physical disruption of group reproduction often target women and girls for sexualized violence, such as mass rape or forced sterilization. Cases also exist in which boys and men have been systematically sexually victimized. Transgressions of gender norms such as homosexuality and transsexuality have also served as grounds for the targeting of both men and women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6224">[[Sigmund Freud]] noticed that [[humor]], like dreams, can be related to unconscious content.&lt;ref name = Freud2&gt;Freud, S. (1928). Humor. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]], 9,'' 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1905 book ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten}}), as well as in the 1928 journal article ''Humor'', Freud distinguished contentious jokes&lt;ref name = Matte7&gt;Matte, G. (2001). A psychoanalytical perspective of humor. ''Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 14''(3),223-241&lt;/ref&gt; from non-contentious or silly humor.  In fact, he sorted humor into three categories that could be translated as: [[joke]], [[comic]], and [[mimetic]].&lt;ref name =Freud3&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''Jokes and their relation to the unconscious'' (J. Strachey, Trans.). New York: W. W. Norton. (Original work published 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's theory of humor==
In Freud's view, jokes (the verbal and interpersonal form of humor) happened when the [[conscious]] allowed the expression of thoughts that society usually suppressed or forbade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 215–228 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[superego]] allowed the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to generate [[humor]].&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;  A benevolent [[superego]] allowed a light and comforting type of humor, while a harsh superego created a biting and sarcastic type of humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  A very harsh superego suppressed humor altogether.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  [[Freud]]’s humor theory, like most of his ideas, was based on a dynamic among [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;  The commanding superego would impede the ego from seeking pleasure for the id, or to momentarily adapt itself to the demands of reality,&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt; a mature coping method.  Moreover, Freud (1960)&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; followed [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ideas of energy being conserved, bottled up, and then released like so much steam venting to avoid an explosion.  Freud was imagining psychic or emotional energy, and this idea is now thought of as the relief theory of laughter.

Later, Freud re-turned his attention to humor noting that not everyone is capable of formulating humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name = Newirth8&gt;Newirth, J. (2006). Jokes and their relation to the unconscious: humor as a fundamental emotional experience. ''Psychoanalytic dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 557–571&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different types of humor==
If [[jokes]] let out forbidden thoughts and feelings that the conscious mind usually suppresses in deference to society,&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, A. (2006). ''Humor.'' In The internet encyclopedia of philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/humor.htm#H3, retrieved from the web on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an interaction between unconscious drives and conscious thoughts.

[[Mimesis]], on the other hand, was a process involving two different representations of the body in our mind.&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; For example, in the phrase “Their hearts are in the right place,” the heart has two representations.  One is, of course, anatomical while the other is a metaphorical reference to caring and meaning well.

===Tendentious jokes===
Tendentious jokes are jokes that have to contain lust, hostility or both.

===Non-tendentious jokes===

The [[comic]] meant applying “to one and the same act of ideation, two different ideational methods” (Freud, 1905, 300; as cited in Matte, G. (2001)&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;). [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Falstaff]] would be an example of Freud's "comic," generating laughter by expressing previously repressed inhibition.&lt;ref name = Kincaid4&gt;Kincaid, J. R. (2001). ''Falstaff as an example for Freud’s “comic.”'' http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/kincaid2, retrieved from the web on the 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An upset American says at Sunday School: "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] is my Shepherd; I am in want. He makes me to lie down on park benches; he leads me in the paths of destruction for His party's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. (2006) ''Studies in American humor'', University of Southern California, http://www.compedit.com/introduction.htm, retrieved from the web 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In advertising ==
An analysis of content from [[business-to-business]] advertising magazines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany found a high (23 percent) overall usage of humor. The highest percentage was found in the British sample at 26 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Lynette S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Ronald K.|date=1993|title=Humor in American, British, and German Ads|url=|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=22|pages=17-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the types of humor found by McCullough and Taylor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; three categories correspond with Freud’s grouping of tendentious (aggression and sexual) and non-tendentious (nonsense) wit. 20 percent of the humor are accounted for as “aggression” and “sexual.” “Nonsense” is listed at 18 percent.

==Criticism==
It has been claimed that Freud's division is artificial and not very clear.&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1&gt;Altman, N. (2006). And now for something completely different: Humor in psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Altman (2006),&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; these divisions are more semantic than functional.  Hence, all three types of humor may be the result of the dynamic of the [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; For example, hate and anger can be hidden by a false sense of love and compassion, which could be the opposite of what was meant, and which could formulate a joke.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt;

'''Jupiter mass''', also called '''Jovian mass''', is the [[units of mass|unit of mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]]. This value may refer to the mass of the [[planet]] alone, or the mass of the entire Jovian system to include the [[moons of Jupiter]]. Jupiter is by far the most [[giant planet|massive planet]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is approximately 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.&lt;ref name="Universe Today"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coffey |first=Jerry |title=Mass of Jupiter |url=https://www.universetoday.com/15141/mass-of-jupiter/ |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=18 June 2008 |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter mass is a common unit of [[mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other similarly-sized objects, including the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It may also be used to describe the masses of [[brown dwarf]]s, as this unit provides a convenient scale for comparison.

==Current best estimates==
The current best known value for the mass of Jupiter can be expressed as {{val|1898130|u=[[Orders of magnitude (mass)|yottagrams]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=(1.89813\;\pm\;0.00019)\times10^{27}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="JPL Planets"/&gt;
which is about 1000 times less massive than the sun (about {{solar mass|0.1%}}):
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=\frac{1}{1047.348644\;\pm\;0.000017}\;M_{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="CBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#MSMJ2009|website=maia.usno.navy.mil|publisher=IAU Working Group|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in scientific notation,
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 954.7919(15)\times10^{-6}\;M_{Sun} &lt;/math&gt;.
Compared to the mass of Earth, Jupiter is 318 times more massive.
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 317.82838\;M_\oplus &lt;/math&gt;.

==Context and implications==
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined—this is so massive that its [[barycenter]] with the [[Sun]] lies beyond the [[Photosphere|Sun's surface]] at 1.068&amp;nbsp;[[solar radius|solar radii]] from the Sun's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacDougal |first1=Douglas W. |title=Newton's Gravity |date=November 6, 2012 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781461454434 |pages=193–211 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |accessdate=July 28, 2016 |language=en |chapter=A Binary System Close to Home: How the Moon and Earth Orbit Each Other |quote=the barycenter is 743,000 km from the center of the sun. The Sun's radius is 696,000 km, so it is 47,000 km above the surface.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |series=Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the mass of Jupiter is so large compared to the other objects in the solar system, the effects of its gravity must be included when calculating satellite trajectories and the precise orbits of other bodies in the solar system, including Earth's moon and even Pluto.

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, its atmosphere would collapse, and the planet would shrink.&lt;ref name=Seager2007&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravitational constant==
The mass of Jupiter is derived from the measured value called the [[standard gravitational parameter|Jovian mass parameter]], which is denoted with ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''. The mass of Jupiter is calculated by dividing ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the constant ''[[gravitational constant|G]]''. For celestial bodies such as Jupiter, Earth and the Sun, the value of the ''GM'' product is known to many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more precisely than either factor independently. The limited precision available for ''G'' limits the uncertainty of the derived mass. For this reason, astronomers often prefer to refer to the gravitational parameter, rather than the explicit mass. The ''GM'' products are used when computing the ratio of Jupiter mass relative to other objects.

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the ''nominal Jovian mass parameter'' to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of {{Jupiter mass}}. This  constant is defined as exactly:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{GM})^\mathrm N_\mathrm J&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.2668653|e=17|u=m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
If the explicit mass of Jupiter is needed in SI units, it can be calculated in terms of the [[Gravitational constant]], ''G'' by dividing ''GM'' by ''G''.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1510.07674|last1=Mamajek|first1=E.

==Mass composition==
The majority of Jupiter's mass is hydrogen and helium. These two elements make up more than 87% of the total mass of Jupiter.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|last4=Saumon|first4=Didier|title=The Interior of Jupiter| url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/39188/1/Stevenson_2004p35.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total mass of heavy elements other than hydrogen and helium in the planet is between 11 and {{earth mass|45}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Gautier|first2=Daniel|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|title=New Constraints on the Composition of Jupiter from Galileo Measurements and Interior Models|journal=Icarus|date=December 1997|volume=130|issue=2|pages=534–539|doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5812|arxiv=astro-ph/9707210|bibcode=1997Icar..130..534G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the hydrogen on Jupiter is solid hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Öpik|first1=E.J.|title=Jupiter: Chemical composition, structure, and origin of a giant planet|journal=Icarus|date=January 1962|volume=1|issue=1–6|pages=200–257|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(62)90022-2|bibcode=1962Icar....1..200O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that Jupiter contains a central dense core. If so, the mass of the core is predicted to be no larger than about {{earth mass|12}}. The exact mass of the core is uncertain due to the relatively poor knowledge of the behavior of solid hydrogen at very high pressures.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"/&gt;

The '''lepus cornutus''' or '''horned hare''' is a type of hare or rabbit that in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries was believed to exist, but is now considered to be fictional.

==Scientific descriptions==
Horned hares were described in medieval and early Renaissance texts, both as real creatures and as farcical or mythological ones, e.g. by [[Rabelais]] in his ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. But the first mention of the lepus cornutus as described here as a real animal comes from [[Conrad Gessner]] in his ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'', mentioning that they live in [[Saxony]].&lt;ref name=Balis/&gt;

Many other scientific works on animals repeated this or similar claims, often with the same depictions. These include [[John Jonston]]'s ''Historiae naturalis de quadrupetibus libri'' from 1655, whose illustrations were reused in e.g. the 1718 ''Theatrum universale omnium animalium, piscium, avium, quadrupedum, exanguium, aquaticorum, insectorum et angium'' by Ruysch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruysch|first=Hendrick|title=Theatrum universale omnium animalium, piscium, avium, quadrupedum, exanguium, aquaticorum, insectorum et angium|year=1718|publisher=Wetstenios|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMivNlyn7FgC&amp;pg=PP15 |language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaspar Schott]] wrote about the horned hare in his 1662 work ''Physica curiosa'', displaying it on the frontispice and with a further illustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schott|first=Gaspar|title=Physica curiosa|year=1662|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zekTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22physica+curiosa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QyTdUsuQGIqHtQaC44DgBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22physica%20curiosa%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gabriel Clauder]] published in 1687 an article on a horned hare he had sighted, with an illustration. In 1743, [[Jacob Theodor Klein]] in his ''Summa dubiorum'' produced another illustration of the same.

[[Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre]]'s 1789 ''Tableau Encyclopedique et Methodique'' was apparently the last major scientific work to include the lepus cornutus as a real animal. By the late 18th and early 19th century, the idea of a horned hare as a real species was mostly rejected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erxleben|first=Johann Christian Polykarp|title=Systema regni animalis: classis I|year=1777|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnw-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |language=Latin|quote=Lepus Cornutus, si non hybridus (sed ex quonam), certe fabulosus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle, appliquée aux arts, principalement à l'agriculture et à l'économie rurale et domestique: avec des figures tirées des trois règnes de la nature. Lau - Mal, Volume 13|year=1803|publisher=Deterville|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivNOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA176 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; although e.g. the 1817 ''Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle'' considers it a possibly real but very rare animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Sève|first=Jacques Eustache|title=Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle: appliquée aux arts, à l'agriculture, à l'économie rurale et domestique, à la médecine, etc|year=1817|publisher=Deterville|page=621|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2RIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA620 |language=French|quote=[...] mais de pareils individues paroissent extrêmement rares, du moins nous n'avons jamais eu l'occasion d'en voir.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the story of the horned hare may not only be caused by fertile imagination or fabrications by taxidermists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Leek|first=J. H.|title=Wandelingen in de tuinen van het Koninklijk Zoölogisch Genootschap Natura Artis Magistra, te Amsterdam|year=1855|publisher=Allart &amp; Van der Made|page=249|language=Dutch|quote=Men heeft zich vroeger wel eens vermaakt met reehorens in den kop van opgezette hazen te bevestigen, en op deze wijze is de fabel van gehoornde hazen ontstaan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may be caused by sightings of hares with the [[Shope papilloma virus]].&lt;ref name=Kompanje&gt;{{cite web|last=Kompanje|first=Erwin J. O.|title='Lepus Cornutus' een haas met een gewei: een mythologisch wezen, een grap van de taxidermist, of realiteit?|work=Straatgras|language=Dutch|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Reported actual animals==
Horned hares were reported in the collection of Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].

In the biography of French scientist [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] is related that in 1606 he visited a widow in [[Leuven]] who had two living horned hares, said to be from Norway, but that one of them had died before his arrival.&lt;ref name=Balis&gt;{{cite book|last=Balis|first=Arnout|title=Het Aards Paradijs|year=1982|publisher=Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde van Antwerpen|location=Antwerp|language=Dutch|chapter=Facetten van de Vlaamse dierenschilderkunst van de 15e tot de 17de eeuw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British naturalist [[John Ray]], in his 1673 ''Travels Through the Low-Countries, Germany, Italy and France'', reports that he has seen in [[Delft]], in the museum of apothecary Jean Vander Mere, the "head of a horned hare" (next to things like a tooth of a hippopotamus, although Ray questions the existence of said animal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=John|title=Travels Through the Low-Countries, Germany, Italy and France|year=1673|publisher=J. Hughs|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPtWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Count [[Ludwig August Mellin]] was said to own the antlers of a horned hare, which were reported on and depicted by German naturalist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1792 in his ''Die Säugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen'' (Mammals in Illustrations from Nature with Descriptions).

==Related animals==
Unlike the lepus cornutus, the following were never believed to be real animals by scientists, and have not been included in lists of [[binomial nomenclature]].

The [[wolpertinger]] is a German mythical animal, usually described as a horned rabbit or horned squirrel with wings and other unusual attributes.
The [[jackalope]] is a mythical hare from North America, described as a hare with antlers. It was invented in the 1930s. The [[Al-mi'raj]] is a single-horned hare from Islamic mythology. Unlike most horned hares, it was described as carnivorous.

At least one genus of real 'horned' small mammal existed, the extinct [[horned gopher]] ''[[Ceratogaulus]]''. However, this was a rodent (not a hare); and the paired conical bone protrusions on its skull were atop its snout forward of its eyes (not on its forehead nor towards the back of its head as illustrations portray for a lepus cornutus or jackalope).

Louise Merzeau is a former student of the [[École normale supérieure de lettres et sciences humaines|École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]] (L1982 promotion) and a qualified teacher of contemporary literature (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/louise-merzeau|title=CV HAL : Louise Merzeau|last=HAL|website=cv.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://affordance.typepad.com//mon_weblog/2017/07/salut-louise.html|title=Salut Louise.|website=affordance.info|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis "From scriptural to index: text, photography, document" in 1993 was written under supervision of [[Nicole Boulestreau]]. She passed her [[habilitation]] to conduct research in 2011 on the subject of the concept of memory in the age of internet. In 2016, she becomes a university professor at Paris-Nanterre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret du 15 décembre 2016 portant nomination, titularisation et affectation (enseignements supérieurs)|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033624003&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a co-director of the Nanterre research laboratory Dicen-IDF and member of the e.laboratory on Human Trace Complex System Digital Campus UNESCO.

Merzeau's research was inspired by the concept of [[mediology]] designed by [[Régis Debray]] and was primarily about the relations between culture and technology, in particular, on the technological, institutional, and sociological aspects of memory. She has designed the concept of hypersphere to extend the list of [[Médiasphère|mediaspheres]] initially proposed by Debray, to characterize sociological and technical ecosystems associated with the development of the internet. She was the chief co-editor of the journal ''[[Les cahiers de médiologie]]'' during several years.

Merzeau also focused on the question of traces - that she developed with researchers like [[Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec]] - and on [[numerical identity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archimag.com/archives-patrimoine/2016/09/13/louise-merzeau-memoire-pensee-oubli|title=Louise Merzeau : "Il n'y a pas de mémoire sans une pensée de l'oubli"|work=Archimag|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the idea of an [[identity mediation]] and a presence which cannot be reduced to an accumulation of calculated traces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/conferences/bibliotheque-publique-dinformation/facebook-twitter-instagram-fictions-de-soi|title=Facebook, Twitter, Instagram : fictions de soi|website=France Culture|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/du-grain-moudre/reseaux-sociaux-sommes-nous-tous-des-big-brothers|title=Réseaux sociaux : sommes-nous tous des Big Brothers ?|work=France Culture|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, her work concentrated on behavior in numerical environments and the conditions of a numerical culture. In a conference on "The User's intelligence" for example, employing the theories of usage and the stakes of digital literacy, she seeks to demonstrate, from the user to the consumer and the content producer, the multiplicity of the user's role. In the article "Copy and paste",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merzeau|first=Louise|date=|title=Copier-coller.|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/727080/filename/Merzeau-Copier-coller.pdf|journal=M ́edium : Transmettre pour Innover, Ed. Babylone, 2012, pp.312-333.|volume=|pages=312–333|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Merzeau proposes a vision that aims at overcoming the simple notions of plagiarism and theft associated to this practice. The notion of paste and copy should not be forbidden: a new learning process of copying as a way of thinking could lead to knowledge, therefore underlying the importance of a pedagogical frame. The copy and paste could be a solution to the commercial logics of the web. This conception is to be put in relation with her engagement in the movement of common goods, to which she participates through the Savoirscom1 collective group, which fights for the user's rights against the risks of informational enclosure,. On this subject, she has opened an axe called "numerical common goods" in the university master's "Cultural industries and numerical environments" at the Paris Nanterre university.

In March 2015, Sylvie directed in collaboration with Lionel Barbe and Valérie Schafer the publication of a collective book on [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/01/11/wikipedia-un-objet-scientifique-non-identifie_4845331_1650684.html|title=Wikipédia, " un objet scientifique non identifié "|last=par)|first=David Larousserie (propos recueillis|date=2016-01-11|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-07-26|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research switches to the notion of editorialisation, that she developed with researchers like [[Marcello Vitali-Rosati]] of the University of Montréal and [[Gérard Wormser]] of the journal [[Sens Public]]. This notion centers the question of traces on writing processes seen as collective interaction and technical contexts.

Louise Merzeau is also involved in [[web archiving]] through the workshops on methodological research of legal web deposits at [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]], where she supervised scientifical aspects from 2010 to her death.

She also has an activity of numeric and [[creative photography]]. She became a member of the scientifical council of [[Wikimedia France]] in 2015, and was coopted in as a member of the board of trustees in May 2017. 

Sylvie died on July 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue89-nos-vies-connectees/20170718.OBS2248/exclusions-menaces-budget-recale-c-est-la-crise-chez-wikimedia-france.html|title=Exclusions, menaces, budget recalé : c'est la crise chez Wikimédia France|work=L'Obs|access-date=2017-07-26|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">'''Memory dependence prediction''' is a technique, employed by high-performance [[out-of-order execution]] [[microprocessor]]s that execute [[primary storage|memory]] access operations (loads and stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads and stores at [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] [[execution (computers)|execution]] time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to [[speculative execution|speculatively execute]] certain loads and stores out of order, while preventing other loads and stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]], [[memory disambiguation]] techniques are used to determine if the loads and stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.

By using the memory dependence predictor to keep most dependent loads and stores in order, the processor gains the benefits of aggressive out-of-order load/store execution but avoids many of the memory dependence violations that occur when loads and stores were incorrectly executed. This increases performance because it reduces the number of [[pipeline flush]]es that are required to recover from these memory dependence violations. See the [[memory disambiguation]] article for more information on memory dependencies, memory dependence violations, and recovery.

In general, memory dependence prediction predicts whether two memory operations are dependent, that is, if they interact by accessing the same memory location. Besides using store to load (RAW or true) memory dependence prediction for the out-of-order scheduling of loads and stores, other applications of memory dependence prediction have been proposed. See for example.&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP"&gt;Streamlining Inter-Operation Memory Communication via Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory dependence prediction is an optimization on top of '''memory dependence speculation'''. Sequential execution semantics imply that stores and loads appear to execute in the order specified by the program. However, as with out-of-order execution of other instructions, it may be possible to execute two memory operations in a different from the program implied order. This is possible when the two operations are independent. In memory dependence speculation a load may be allowed to execute before a store that precedes it. Speculation succeeds when the load is independent of the store, that is, when the two instructions access different memory locations. Speculation fails when the load is dependent upon the store, that is, when the two accesses overlap in memory. In the first, modern out-of-order designs, memory speculation was not used as its benefits were limited. Αs the scope of the out-of-order execution increased over few tens of instructions, naive memory dependence speculation was used. In '''naive memory dependence speculation''',&lt;ref name="SaSoMD"&gt;Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Memory Dependences, Moshovos, Breach, Vijaykumar and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1997. Also as technical report, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; a load is allowed to bypass any preceding store. As with any form of speculation, it is important to weight the benefits of correct speculation against the penalty paid on incorrect speculation. As the scope of out-of-order execution increases further into several tens of instructions, the performance benefits of naive speculation decrease. To retain the benefits of aggressive memory dependence speculation while avoiding the costs of mispeculation several predictors have been proposed.

'''Selective memory dependence prediction'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP"&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos, Ph.D. Thesis, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dec. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; stalls specific loads until it is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Specifically, '''Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP" /&gt; delays loads only as long as it is necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The '''synonym predictor'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The '''store sets'''&lt;ref&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction using Store Sets, Chrysos and Emer, in the Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The '''store barrier'''&lt;ref&gt;Apparatus to dynamically control the out-of-order execution of load-store instructions in a processor capable of dispatching, issuing and executing multiple instructions in a single processor cycle, Hesson, LeBlanc and Ciavaglia, IBM, US Patent 5,615,350, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, '''speculative memory cloaking'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; and '''speculative memory bypassing'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory.

==Analogy to branch prediction==
Memory dependence prediction for loads and stores is analogous to [[branch predictor|branch prediction]] for [[conditional branch]] instructions. In branch prediction, the branch predictor predicts which way the branch will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions down one of the paths of the branch. Later, when the branch instruction executes, it can be determined if the branch instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a [[misprediction|branch misprediction]], and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed.

Branch prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines the direction of the branch (taken or not). This is a binary decision. Then, the predictor determines the actual target address. Similarly, memory dependence prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines whether there is a dependence. Then it determines which this dependence is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

:''This article is about the initiative linked to chemical process analytical systems, see also [[Networked European Software and Services Initiative]]''

'''NeSSI''' (for '''N'''ew '''S'''ampling/'''S'''ensor '''I'''nitiative) is a global and open initiative sponsored by the Center for Process Analysis and Control (CPAC) at the [[University of Washington]], in [[Seattle]].

The NeSSI initiative was begun to simplify the tasks and reduce the overall costs associated with engineering, installing, and maintaining chemical process analytical systems. Process analytical systems are commonly used by the [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[oil refinery|oil refining]] and [[petrochemical industry|petrochemical industries]] to measure and control both chemical composition as well as certain [[Intensive and extensive properties|intrinsic physical properties]] (such as [[viscosity]]). The specific objectives of NeSSI are:
# Increasing the reliability of these systems through the use of increased [[automation]],
# Shrinking their physical size and energy use by means of [[miniaturization]],
# Promoting the creation and use of industry standards for process analytical systems,
# Helping create the infrastructure needed to support the use of the emerging class of robust and selective microAnalytical sensors.

To date, NeSSI has served as a forum for the adoption and improvement of an industrial standard which specifies the use of miniature and modular [[Lego]]-like flow components. NeSSI has also issued a specification which has been instrumental in spurring the development and commercialization of a [[plug and play]] low power communication bus (NeSSI-bus) specifically designed for use with process analytical sample systems in electrically hazardous environments. As part of its development road map, NeSSI has defined the electrical and mechanical interfaces, as well as compiled a list of automated (smart) software features, which are now beginning to be used by microAnalytical manufacturers for industrial applications.

==Background==
[[Image:Analyzer Shelter.jpg|thumb|left|Conventional sample system in an analyzer house ca. 2006]]
Modern chemical and petrochemical processing plants are complex systems containing many steps (often called [[unit operations]]) involved in producing one or more products from various raw materials. In order to control the many processes, for both improved product quality and operational safety, many measurements are made at the different stages of processing. These measurements, either from simple [[sensors]] (such as temperature, pressure, flow, etc.) or from sophisticated chemical analyzers (providing composition of one or more components in the chemical stream), are typically used as inputs to [[process control]] algorithms to give a "snapshot" of the process operation and to control the process to ensure it is operating efficiently and safely

Traditionally, most of the measurements (with the exception of temperature, pressure and flow) were performed "off-line" by taking a sample from the process and analyzing it in the laboratory. Beginning in the latter of part of the 1930s a trend aimed at moving the analysis from the laboratory to the process plant began. With the advent of more sophisticated analyzers, this concept known as Process Analytics become much more prevalent in the 1980s and a new discipline called Process Analytical Chemistry (PAC) emerged which combined [[chemical engineering]] and [[analytical chemistry]].

One of the main driving forces for PAC (See also a more recent but related development in the pharmaceutical industry, called [[Process analytical technology|PAT]]) is to remove the bottleneck, and time lag, associated with sending the samples to the lab and waiting for the analysis results. By moving the analysis to the process, results can be obtained closer to real-time which effectively improves the ability for the control action to correct for process changes (i.e. feedback and feed forward control).

By far, the most common implementation of PAC (especially for more complex analyzers) utilizes what is known as extractive sampling. This typically involves the continuous (or sometimes periodic) removal of a small portion of sample from a much larger piping system or process vessel. This sample is then conditioned (filtered, pressure regulated, flow controlled, etc.) and introduced to the analyzer where the [[chemical composition]] or the intrinsic [[physical properties]] of process fluids (vapours and liquids) are measured. In the industrial plants, the majority of sample systems and their related analyzers are installed in analyzer houses.

The hardware (traditionally metal tubing, compression fittings, valves, regulators, rotameters and filters) associated with extractive sampling is collectively referred to as the sampling system. Sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions (pressure, amount of particulate allowed, temperature and flow) to a level suitable for use with an analytical device (analyzer) such as a gas chromatograph, an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer. Despite the simple explanation just given, modern sampling systems can be quite large, complex, and expensive. The design features of analytical sample systems have changed little, when the discipline of Process Analytics began in Germany, right through until the present day. An example of an early analyzer and sample system used at the Buna Chemical Works (Schkopau, Germany), is shown in the following photograph. Process analytics remains exceptional in the fact that it is the last outpost of low level automation (retains manual adjustments and visible checks) within the process industries.

==History==
The rationale for NeSSI originated from focus group meetings held in 1999 at the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) which called out for more reliable sampling and analysis for the manufacturing processes. Early work with NeSSI was started in July, 2000 by Peter van Vuuren (ExxonMobil Chemical) and Rob Dubois (Dow Chemical) with the initial aim of adopting new types of modular and miniature hardware which were being addressed in a standard being developed by an ISA (Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society) technical committee. (Reference 1)

The term NeSSI, along with the futuristic concepts of a communication/power bus specifically designed for process analytical (the NeSSI-bus) and fully automated sampling systems were first introduced outside of CPAC at a presentation given in January 2001 at the International Forum of Process Analytical Chemistry (IFPAC) at Amelia Island, Florida, USA. These new concepts were collected in the NeSSI Generation II Specification and released by CPAC in 2003 as an open publication. The specification is located on the CPAC website. (Reference 2)

==NeSSI Technical Objectives==
* Facilitate the acceptance and implementation of modular, miniature and automated (smart) sample system technology using the mechanical design based on the ANSI/ISA SP76.00.02-2002 standard.[ANSI = American National Standards Institute]
* Provide the mechanical, electrical and software infrastructure needed to accelerate the use of microAnalytical sensors within the process industries.
* Move the analytical systems out of the analyzer houses by promoting the use of field-mounted analytical systems (similar to pressure transmitters) which are close-coupled to the major process equipment. (NeSSI refers to this concept as By-Line analysis)
* Lay the groundwork for the adoption of an open communication standard(s) for process analytical. This includes communication between sample system components such as flow sensors, actuators, and microAnalytical sensors, as well as communication to a Distributed Control System (DCS).

==Technology Development Roadmap==
[[Image:End user value.jpg|thumb|right|Technology Development Roadmap Pyramid]]
The NeSSI Technology Development Roadmap groups the technology into three generations which are backward compatible. Generation I is a commercial product and proven in numerous industrial and laboratory applications. Generation II products have been proven in the laboratory but have yet to be commercialized. Generation III (microAnalytical) is in development.

==Technical Development Generations==

===Generation I Fluid Components===
Generation I covers the commercially available mechanical systems associated with the fluid handling components. Generation I has adopted the ANSI/ISA SP76.00.2002 miniature, modular mechanical standard. This standard precisely defines inlet and outlet ports and overall dimensions which allow Lego-like interchangeability of components, between different manufacturers. The ANSI/ISA standard is referenced by the International Electrotechnical Commission in publication IEC 62339-1:2006.

[[Image:ANSI-ISA SP76 mechanical footprint.jpg|thumb|right|The ANSI/ISA SP76.00.02-2002 standard defines dimensions and porting.]]

Currently three manufacturers produce the mechanical mounting system (known as a substrate) which serves as the platform for attaching various components. Since the components are bolted to the surface of the substrate with sealing done by O-rings, they are sometimes referred to as surface mount devices. (The semiconductor industry has a related system; however the sealing is done by metallic seals rather than elastomeric O-rings.) There are currently over 60 different types of surface mount components available from various suppliers who provide valves, filters and regulators as well as pressure and flow sensing devices. Although the platform for mounting various components is common among the manufacturers, the interconnections below the surface are proprietary. The following figure shows three of the common designs. (From left to right) A Swagelok system which uses various lengths of tube connectors set in rigid channels; a CIRCORTech design which uses a single block with assorted flow-tubes; and a [[Parker Hannifin]] design which uses various blocks ported together with small connectors which also serve as flow paths.

The figure below illustrates the spacing differences between a conventional system and a modular sample system.

===Generation II Connectivity using NeSSI-bus and the SAM===
The key elements of the NeSSI Generation II Specification are as follows.
* Adoption of a digital communication bus (NeSSI-bus) that is specifically tailored for process analytics and intended to replace 4-20 mA systems. This bus can handle up to 30 devices. (This bus would be equivalent to a plug-and-play USB bus on a personal computer but with special requirements.)
* For electrical equipment in hazardous areas, classifying the interior of an enclosure handling hazardous (flammable) fluids (e.g. hydrogen and ethylene) as Division 1/Zone 1 rather than Division/Zone 2.
* Adopting the use of a safe low energy, globally accepted method of electrical protection called [[intrinsic safety]] for the NeSSI-bus.
* Adopting the use of miniature smart/automated electronic devices including sensors (flow, pressure temperature), on/off and proportional actuators and enclosure heater controls.
* A move away from the use of local indicating devices such as gauges and rotameters in order to reduce labor-intensive manual checking (rounds).
* A move away from centralized control (automation) model to a local/field control model which is represented by a small computing device called the Sensor Actuator Manager (SAM).
* Adopting the concept of portable, commercially available software smart applets for the purpose of automating specific sample system functions. These applets would be resident in the SAM.
* Employing an Ethernet network between the SAM, the DCS and the Operator &amp; Maintenance (O &amp; M) user station. (NeSSI refers to this bus as the ANLAN)
* Introduction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better visualization of physically compact sampling systems.

[[Image:NeSSI Gen II connectivity model.jpg|thumb|none|upright=2.0|Generation II Connectivity Model using NeSSI-bus and SAM]]

The first prototype of a multi node/miniature Generation II system was demonstrated by Siemens Process Analytics in 2006. Siemens has adapted an existing bus system called I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C to operate in an intrinsically safe mode. This work was undertaken once it was determined that existing intrinsically safe capable digital communication systems such as Foundation Fieldbus and Profibus could not meet the requirements of reduced physical size as well as the lower cost and power draw defined by the NeSSI-bus. Whether or not this bus will go into wide commercial production is unknown at this time.

[[Image:NeSSI Gen I 5.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a Generation 1.5 system]]

A nonprofit organization, CAN in Automation (CiA) released in 2007 a Draft Standard Proposal (DSP-103), that specifies the physical layer of an intrinsically safe bus. [CAN = Controller Area Network] The specification has been developed by members of the CiA organization among them ABB, Pepperl+Fuchs, Texas Instruments, and Siemens. By using a lower voltage (9.5 V) for its power supply, this bus can provide more current (up to 1,000 mA) to power multiple devices in a hazardous environment. This group has standardized upon the 5-pin M8 pico connector for providing both power and signal to the devices. A commercial implementation of a process analytical system using this bus has yet to be demonstrated.

An interim development called Generation 1.5 uses both conventional 4-20 mA analogue sensors and discrete signals to actuate valves. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is used as the Sensor Actuator Manager (SAM).

===Generation III - microAnalytical===
The introduction of new microAnalytical devices to the process industries can be enabled by employing standard physical, electrical and software interfaces. Generation III will allow tighter integration of the sample conditioning and analytical measurement devices.

[[Image:NeSSI GenIII.jpg|thumb|none|An example of an integrated analytical device (oxygen transmitter) and sampling system.]]

==Applications==
NeSSI is used for process analytical measurements in the petrochemical, chemical and oil refining industries. These measurements may be for [[quality control]] of raw material or final product, [[environmental law|environmental compliance]], safety, energy reduction or process control purposes. Vapour applications may include hydrocarbon feed stocks and intermediates (ethylene, ethane, propylene, etc.), natural gas streams, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) streams, hydrogen and air gas streams.

Liquid systems suitable for use with the Generation I mechanical portion of NeSSI are [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[diesel fuel]] as well as aqueous streams. Highly viscous fluids and solids are not suitable for use with NeSSI. Very dirty, high particulate streams need to be filtered. Some liquid service applications may be limited by pressure drops associated with components hooked up in a serial configuration. NeSSI systems have found applications in areas other than the process analytical environments including micro reactor, mini plant and laboratory environments where small size, unskilled assembly and flexible configuration is important.

==Role of CPAC==
The development of NeSSI has been a collaborative effort between industrial end-users, manufacturers who supply the industries, and academic researchers working in the area of process analytics. CPAC continues as the focal point for NeSSI development, and sponsor of the NeSSI steering team. CPAC provides a neutral umbrella under which interested companies (many of which are competitors in the marketplace) have been able to meet, discuss needs and issues, and make progress towards defining the future of industrial sampling and analyzer systems. The NeSSI name is trademarked by the University of Washington to ensure that it remains freely associated with the open nature of the initiative anyone can use the name NeSSI to refer to products or services that are consistent with the specifications and guidelines of NeSSI as long as they refrain from exclusively tying the name to a proprietary product or service.

==Criticism, Impact and Summary==
Criticism of NeSSI mechanical systems have included higher initial cost, inability to troubleshoot at a component level (due to compact/intensive spacing), and the lack of performance data associated with the use of elastomeric seals in long term installations. From a design perspective, it may be difficult to design a modular, mechanical system which meets the needs of the diverse process applications found in industry. Development of the NeSSI-bus has been an iterative exercise and it will need the close cooperation of both component and analyzer manufacturers to make their equipment NeSSI-bus compliant. At this time, there are missing elements such as a low cost, low power flow sensor which is capable of providing a continuous reading of sample system flow as well as a proportional, miniature control valve.

The predicted impact of NeSSI systems are as follows:
* Adoption of a universally accepted method of protection (intrinsic safety) for sample systems will globalize and harmonize system design and help overcome geographical restrictions currently mandated by various electrical certification/approval bodies such as Factory Mutual (FM) and Underwriters Laboratories (UL), ATEX (Europe), GOST (Russian Federation) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA).
* Analyzer technical staff will have the capability of accessing the status of all the key indicators of analytical sample system performance both locally and remotely. Predictive rather than preventive maintenance can be performed and remote diagnostics and graphical user interfaces are the norm. Analyzer rounds will be eliminated. Analyzer systems will become more reliable and trustworthy. The analyzer technician will have the power to configure a sampling/analytical system, as he/she desires using the smart applets. The adjustable wrench and screwdriver will be replaced with software.
* Molecular management meaning tighter process control by more analysis of the chemical processes - will become feasible with better, faster, less costly and more abundant analysis. This will help reduce manufacturing energy costs and minimize environmental emissions in the process industries.

Since its debut in 2000, NeSSI the mechanical portion has seen gradual but steady acceptance in industry. Currently, there are three major commercial suppliers of NeSSI compliant mechanical systems along with dozens of components available for mounting on these systems. There is also a growing list of companies implementing NeSSI systems in their manufacturing and pilot-plant facilities. Recently, two of the largest suppliers of process analyzers have committed to supporting NeSSI hardware and the development of the intrinsically safe NeSSI-bus communication into their products. NeSSI is gaining status as a ''de facto'' standard for many process sampling system applications.

NeSSI acceptance (Generation I) today, has spread beyond its initial chemical and petrochemical industry roots to find applications in the automotive, food, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as applications as an analytical development system in research laboratories. Generation II electrical systems are now close to commercialization with the first industrial systems scheduled for operation in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''near-infrared (NIR) window''' (also known as optical window or therapeutic window) defines the range of [[wavelength|wavelengths]] from 650 to 1350 nanometre (nm) where [[light]] has its maximum depth of penetration in [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].&lt;ref name="SmithMancini2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Mancini|first2=Michael C.|last3=Nie|first3=Shuming|title=Bioimaging: Second window for in vivo imaging|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=4|issue=11|year=2009|pages=710–711|issn=1748-3387|doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.326|pmc=2862008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the NIR window, scattering is the most dominant light-tissue interaction, and therefore the propagating light becomes diffused rapidly. Since scattering increases the distance travelled by [[photon|photons]] within tissue, the probability of photon absorption also increases. Because scattering has weak dependence on wavelength, the NIR window is primarily limited by the light absorption of blood at short wavelengths and water at long wavelengths. The technique using this window is called [[near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]. Medical imaging techniques such as [[fluorescence image-guided surgery]] often make use of the NIR window to detect deep structures.

==Absorption properties of tissue components==
The absorption [[coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{a}&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the probability of photon absorption in tissue per unit path length.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Different tissue components have different &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt; values. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt; is a function of wavelength. Below are discussed the absorption properties of the most important [[chromophores]] in tissue. The [[molar extinction coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt;) is another parameter that is used to describe photon absorption in tissue. By multiplying &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt; by the molar concentration and by ln(10), one can convert &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mu_a \,&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Fig 1 - The molar extinction coefficient of HbO2 and Hb.png|thumb|right|alt='''Figure 1:''' The molar extinction coefficients of HbO2 and Hb .|'''Figure 1:''' The molar extinction coefficients of HbO2 and Hb.&lt;ref&gt;Molar extinction coefficients of oxy and deoxyhemoglobin compiled by Scott Prahl. URL: http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/hemoglobin.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

===Blood===
Blood consists of two different types of [[hemoglobin]]: oxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt;) is bound to oxygen, while deoxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt;) is unbound to oxygen. These two different types of hemoglobin exhibit different absorption [[spectrum|spectra]] that are normally represented in terms of molar extinction coefficients, as shown in Figure 1. The molar extinction coefficient of Hb has its highest absorption peak at 420&amp;nbsp;nm and a second peak at 580&amp;nbsp;nm. Its spectrum then gradually decreases as light wavelength increases. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;HbO2&lt;/math&gt; shows its highest absorption peak at 410&amp;nbsp;nm, and two secondary peaks at 550&amp;nbsp;nm and 600&amp;nbsp;nm. As light wavelengths passes 600&amp;nbsp;nm, &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; absorption decays much faster than Hb absorption. The points where the molar extinction coefficient spectra of &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; intersect are called [[isosbestic points]]. 

By using two different wavelengths, it is possible to calculate the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;C_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt;) and deoxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;C_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt;) as shown in the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(\lambda_1) = \ln(10)\varepsilon_{HbO2}(\lambda_1)C_{HbO2}+\ln(10)\varepsilon_{Hb}(\lambda_1)C_{Hb} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(\lambda_2) = \ln(10)\varepsilon_{HbO2}(\lambda_2)C_{HbO2}+\ln(10)\varepsilon_{Hb}(\lambda_2)C_{Hb} \,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fig 2 - The absorption spectrum of water.png|thumb|200 px| right|alt='''Figure 2:''' The absorption spectrum of water .|'''Figure 2:''' The absorption spectrum of water.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Hale, and M. R. Querry, Optical constants of water in the 200 nm to 200 µm wavelength region, Appl. Opt., 12, 555-563, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Here, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; are the two wavelengths; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt; are the molar extinction coefficients of &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt;, respectively; &lt;math&gt;C_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt; are the molar concentrations of &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt; in tissue, respectively.
Oxygen saturation (&lt;math&gt;SO_2&lt;/math&gt;) can then be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;SO_2=\frac {C_{HbO2}} {C_{HbO2}+C_{Hb}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Water=== 
Although water is nearly transparent in the range of visible light, it becomes absorbing over the near-infrared region. Water is a critical component since its concentration is high in human tissue. The absorption spectrum of water in the range from 250 to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm is shown in Figure 2. Although absorption is rather low in this spectral range, it still contributes to the overall attenuation of tissue.

URL: http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/melanin/extcoeff.html.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Other tissue components with less significant contributions to the total absorption spectrum of tissue are melanin and fat.

[[Image:The absorption coefficient spectrum of fat.png|thumb|right|alt='''Figure 4:''' Figure 4: The absorption coefficient spectrum of fat .|'''Figure 4:''' The absorption coefficient spectrum of fat.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.P. van Veen, H.J.C.M. Sterenborg, A. Pifferi, A. Torricelli, and R. Cubeddu, OSA Annual BIOMED Topical Meeting, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

===Melanin===
Melanin is a chromophore that exists in the human epidermal layer of skin responsible for protection from harmful UV radiation. When melanocytes are stimulated by solar radiation, melanin is produced.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vo-Dinh, Biomedical Photonics Handbook. Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8493-1116-0}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Melanin is one of the major absorbers of light in some biological tissue (although its contribution is smaller than other components). There are two types of melanin: eumelanin which is black-brown and pheomelanin which is red-yellow.&lt;ref&gt;George Zonios and Aikaterini Dimou, Ioannis Bassukas, Dimitrios Galaris, and Argyrios Ysolakidis and Efthimios Kaxiras, J. Biomed. Opt., Vol.13, 014017, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The molar extinction coefficient spectra corresponding to both types are shown in Figure 3. 

===Fat===
Fat is one of the major components in tissue that can comprise 10-40% of tissue. Although not many mammalian fat spectra are available, Figure 4 shows an example extracted from pig fat.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.P. van Veen, H.J.C.M. Sterenborg, A. Pifferi, A. Torricelli, and R. Cubeddu, OSA Annual BIOMED Topical Meeting, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:The scattering coefficient spectrum of biological tissue.png|thumb|right|alt='''Figure 5:''' Figure 5: The absorption coefficient spectrum of fat .|'''Figure 5:''' The scattering coefficient spectrum of biological tissue.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jacques, C. Newman, D. Levy, and A. von Eschenbach. Univ. of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Scattering properties of tissue components==
Optical scattering occurs due to mismatches in refractive index of the different tissue components, ranging from cell membranes to whole cells. Cell nuclei and mitochondria are the most important scatterers.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Their dimensions range from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 6 μm, and thus fall within the NIR window. Most of these organelles fall in the [[Mie regime]], and exhibit highly anisotropic forward-directed scattering.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vo-Dinh, Biomedical Photonics Handbook. Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8493-1116-0}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Light scattering in biological tissue is denoted by the scattering coefficient (&lt;math&gt;\mu_s&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined as the probability of photon scattering in tissue per unit path length.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 5 shows a plot of the scattering spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jacques, C. Newman, D. Levy, and A. von Eschenbach. Univ. of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective attenuation coefficient==
Attenuation of light in deep biological tissue depends on the effective attenuation coefficient (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\text{eff}}=\sqrt{3\mu_a(\mu_a+\mu'_s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu'_s&lt;/math&gt; is the transport scattering coefficient defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu'_\text{s}=\mu_s (1-g) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the anisotropy of biological tissue, which has a representative value of 0.9. Figure 5 shows a plot of transport scattering coefficient spectrum in breast tissue, which has a wavelength dependence of &lt;math&gt;\lambda \,^{-0.7}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = SS&gt;S. Srinivasan, B. Pogue, S. Jiang, H. Dehghani, C. Kogel, S. Soho, J. Gibson, T. Tosteson, S. Poplack, and K. Paulsen, K D 2003, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 12349 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The effective attenuation coefficient is the dominant factor for determining light attenuation at depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; ≫ 1/ &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\text{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Estimation of the NIR window in tissue==
The NIR window can be computed based on the absorption coefficient spectrum or the effective attenuation coefficient spectrum. A possible criterion for selecting the NIR window is given by the FWHM of the inverse of these spectra as shown in Figure 7. 

In addition to the total concentration of hemoglobin, the oxygen saturation will define the concentration of oxy and deoxyhemoglobin in tissue and so the total absorption spectrum. Depending on the type of tissue, we can consider different situations. Below, the total concentration of hemoglobin is assumed to be 2.3 mM.

In this case &lt;math&gt;SaO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 98% (arterial oxygen saturation). Then oxyhemoglobin will be dominant in the total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra, as shown in Figure 6 (a).

===Absorption spectrum for veins===
In this case &lt;math&gt;SvO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 60% (venous oxygen saturation). Then oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin will have similar contributions to the total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra, as shown in Figure 6 (b).

===Absorption spectrum for breast tissue===
To define &lt;math&gt;StO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; (tissue oxygen saturation) (or &lt;math&gt;TSI \,&lt;/math&gt; (tissue saturation index)), it is necessary to define a distribution of arteries and veins in tissue. an arterial-venous blood volume ratio of 20%/80% can be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;S.

The total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra for breast tissue is shown in Figure 6 (c). In addition, the effective penetration depth is plotted in Figure 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12962">'''Onomasiology''' (from {{lang-el|ὀνομάζω}} (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "how do you express X?" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of [[lexicology]], the study of words (although some apply the term also to [[grammar]] and conversation). 

Onomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior&lt;ref&gt;OED: "The study of language which deals with the identification of a preconceived
meaning or concept by name or names"&lt;/ref&gt;
(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as [[semasiology]]: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" (answers: ''french fries'' in the US, ''chips'' in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., "what is the meaning of the term ''chips''?" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).

Onomasiology can be carried out [[wikt:synchronic|synchronically]] or [[wikt:diachronic|diachronically]], i.e. historically.

==Definition==

Onomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in [[Romance languages]]. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and [[Hugo Schuchardt]] started the "[[Wörter und Sachen]]" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the "dame phonétique" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the "dame sémantique" (justify semantic changes).

Another branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable [[linguistic atlas]]es. The first ones are ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, the ALF (''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'') by [[Jules Gilliéron]] (1902–1920), the AIS (''Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'') by [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]] (1928–1940), the DSA (''Deutscher Sprachatlas'') by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by [[Hans Kurath]], the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).

In 1931 the German linguist [[Jost Trier]] introduced a new method in his book ''Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes'' which is known as the [[lexical field theory]]. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by [[Cecil H. Brown]], [[Stanley R. Witkowski]], [[Brent Berlin]]). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of [[Dirk Geeraerts]], Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical ''Onomasiology Online'', which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by [[Joachim Grzega]], Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.

==Instruments for the historical onomasiologist==

The most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:
* the [[linguistic atlas]]
* the [[etymological dictionary]]
* the dialect dictionary
* [[thesaurus|thesauri]]
* diachronic [[text corpus|text corpora]]

==Lexical change==
===Explanations===

When a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.

The coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):
* difficulties in classifying the thing to be named or attributing the right word to the thing to be named, thus confusing designations
* fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world
* everyday contact situations
* institutionalized and non-institutionalized linguistic pre- and proscriptivism
* flattery
* insult
* disguising things (i.e. [[euphemism|euphemistic]] language, [[doublespeak]])
* taboo
* avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words
* abolition of forms that can be ambiguous in many contexts
* wordplay/puns
* excessive length of words
* morphological misinterpretation (creation of transparency by changes within a word = [[folk-etymology]])
* deletion of irregularity
* desire for plastic/illustrative/telling names for a thing
* natural prominence of a concept
* cultural-induced prominence of a concept
* changes in the world
* changes in the categorization of the world
* prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

The following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.

===Processes===

In the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected ["naming in a more abstract sense"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected ["naming in a more concrete sense"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.

If the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):

* adoption of either
# an already existing word of speaker's own language ([[semantic change]]) or (b)
# a word from a foreign language ([[loanword]])
* [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (e.g. ''to e-mail'' from the noun ''e-mail'')
* composition (in a broad sense, i.e. [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and derivations, which are, very consciously, not further subclassified)
* [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] (i.e. morpheme deletion, e.g. the noun ''daily'' from ''daily newspaper'')
* [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] (i.e. morpheme shortening, e.g. ''fan'' from ''fanatic'')
* [[acronym]]s (e.g. ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* [[Blend word|blend]]ings (including [[folk-etymology|folk-etymologies]], although these come up non-intentionally, e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* [[back-derivation]] (e.g. ''to baby-sit'' from ''babysitter'')
* [[reduplication]] (e.g. ''goody-goody'')
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] alteration (e.g. number change as in ''people'' as a plural word instead of a singular word)
* [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] compounds (e.g. ''peacock'' for original ''pea'', which already meant 'peacock')
* wordplaying/[[pun]]s
* stress alteration (e.g. stress shift in E. ''ímport'' vs. ''impórt'')
* graphic alteration (e.g. E. ''discrete'' vs. ''discreet'')
* [[Phraseology|phraseologism]]
* [[Root (linguistics)|root creation]] (including [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] and expressive words)

The name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.

In order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations ([[iconeme]]s) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:

*contiguity relations (= "neighbor-of" relations)
*similarity relations (= "similar-to" relations)
*partiality relations (= "part-of" relations)
*contrast relations (= "opposite-to" relations)
These relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. 

A complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):

* identity (e.g. with loans)
* "figurative", i.e. individually felt, similarity of the concepts (e.g. ''mouse'' for a computer device that looks '''like''' a mouse)
* contiguity of concepts (e.g. ''a Picasso'' for a painting '''by''' Picasso or ''glass'' for a container made '''out of''' glass)
* partiality of concepts (e.g. ''bar'' 'place of an inn where drinks are mixed' for the '''entire''' inn)
* contrast of concepts (e.g. ''bad'' in the sense of "good")
* "literal" or "figurative" similarity between the forms of a sign and the concept (e.g. with onomatopoetic words like ''purr'')
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. with generalization of meaning, e.g. ''Christmas tree'' for any kind of fir tree or even any kind of conifer)
* strong relation between contents of signs and contrast of concepts (e.g. with ''learn'' in the sense of "teach" in some English dialects)
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. ''corn'' in the English sense of "wheat" or Scottish sense of "oats" instead of "cereal")
* ("literal") similarity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* contiguity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''brunch'' from ''breakfast + lunch'', ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* "literal", i.e. objectively visible, similarity and contiguity of concepts (e.g. with the transfer of names among spruce and fir in many dialects)
* "literal" similarity of referents and strong relation between contents of signs
* multiple associations (e.g. with certain forms of word-play)

The concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.

{{hatnote|The term ''opposing force'' is occasionally used to refer to a genuine military foe. This article is concerned only with its use in simulated conflict.}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:OPFOR Soldiers.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|U.S. OPFOR Soldiers at [[Fort Polk]], Louisiana]]
An '''opposing force''' (abbreviated '''OPFOR''' or '''enemy force''') is a [[military unit]] tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in [[War exercise|war game]] scenarios. The related concept of [[aggressor squadron]] is used by some air forces. The United States maintains the [[Fort Irwin National Training Center]] with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] serving in the main OPFOR role. Other major units include the [[First United States Army]] which consists of 16 training brigades that often also serve as OPFOR. [[Fort Polk]]'s Joint  Readiness Training Center is another major training site typically reserved for units that are slated to deploy into conflict areas.

At a basic level, a unit might serve as an opposing force for a single scenario, differing from its 'opponents' only in the objectives it is given. However, major armies commonly maintain specialized groups trained to accurately emulate real-life enemies, to provide a more realistic experience for their training opponents. (To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictionalized versions with different names but similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes.)

==Tactics==
Opposing forces can also coincide with [[red team]]ing activities. Once the Analytic Red Team develops adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) it will be the opposing force that makes use of those TTPs in wargames and exercises.

Some dedicated opposing forces may fight using the likely enemy's doctrine, weapons, and equipment. They may wear uniforms which resemble the likely enemy's, or one dissimilar to "friendly forces". Their vehicles may either be those operated by the likely enemy's, or may be modified to look like those. All these measures help to enhance training realism and provide useful lessons on how to fight this particular enemy.

[[Blank ammunition]], [[smoke grenade]]s, and [[artillery]] simulators are often used by both sides in the exercise to provide the [[fog of war]] caused by the noise and smoke of battle.

In addition, a simulation system such as the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System]] (MILES) may be used. This system is attached to various weapons, and are zeroed to the sights of the weapon. When a blank round is fired, the system sends out a laser beam, which score "kills" or "injuries" on any soldier or vehicle in what would be the path of the weapon's projectile. These laser beams are detected by receivers on harnesses worn by the soldiers, or on the vehicle itself.

Alternatively, [[paintball]] weapons which look like real weapons, or simulation rounds such as [[plastic bullet]]s may be used. Usually, controllers follow the training troops to help score additional kills, such as when a simulated grenade is thrown. They may do so with the MILES system using a controller gun. All these measures help to emphasize the importance of aimed fire, and taking cover. These concepts, while obvious, are often neglected in ordinary one-sided training exercises because the soldier does not suffer the consequences.

==Units==

[[File:OPFOR Training.JPG|thumbnail|OPFOR Training 2012]]
[[File:MT-LB US Marines.jpg|thumb|[[US Marines]] using a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[MT-LB]] vehicle for the OPFOR role during an exercise]]
One of the best-known examples of specialist operations is the [[United States]]' OPFOR. During the [[Cold War]], opposing force units employed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military doctrine and simulated Soviet equipment; since the fall of the USSR, US opposing force units have become more flexible to represent a wider range of opponents. More recently training has focused on Iraq and Afghanistan.

There are three Major Training Centers that utilize home-based OPFOR units for the [[US Army]]:

*The [[National Training Center]] or ''NTC'' at [[Fort Irwin, California]]—home unit is the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] (the ''Blackhorse'')
*The [[Fort Polk#JRTC moves to Polk|Joint Readiness Training Center]] or ''JRTC'' at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]]—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment (the ''Geronimos'')
*The [[Joint Multinational Readiness Center]] or ''JMRC'' (formerly known as the Combat Maneuver Training Center or CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hohenfels.army.mil Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Separate) (the ''Warriors'')

[[File:Operation_force_Surrogate_Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An OSV replicating a Soviet BMP at NTC, Fort Irwin, CA]]
The units at NTC and JMRC were used to replicate a Soviet Motorized Rifle regiment or division. At NTC, [[M551 Sheridan]]s were used to replicate Soviet [[T-80]] tanks until 2003.  [[vismod|Visually Modified]] (VISMOD) [[HMMWV]]s are used to replicate [[BRDM-2]]s, VISMOD [[M113 armored personnel carrier#Basic variants|M113A3]]s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle [OSV]) are used to replicate [[BMP-2]] Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), while VISMOD [[M1 Abrams]] Tanks (known as the Krasnovian Variant Tank [KVT]) and M113A2s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, Tank [OSV-T]) are also used to replicate the [[T-80]]. At JMRC, M113A2s are used to replicate Soviet BMP-2s and [[M60 Patton#M60A3 series|M60A3]] tanks are used to replicate Soviet T-80s.

During the mid-1990s, JMRC was used to train peacekeeping forces for the former [[Yugoslavia]] under low-intensity conflict missions.  Currently, the OpFor mission has since been modified for counter-insurgency training for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

Starting in early 2004, NTC began focusing on training units selected to deploy to [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] in [[Urban Operations|urban operations]] (UO). Towns of ever increasing size and complexity have been constructed throughout the training area to provide battlefield realism and housing for the hundreds of role-playing personnel, many of whom speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] natively, and replicate civilians on the battlefield while wearing Afghan or Iraqi clothing. Cultural awareness and liaison operations with local leaders are emphasized at all times and at all levels.

Various US military installations and/or major units have their own local versions of opposing force used for training exercises. The joint Australian/US military exercise "Crocodile '03" featured an Australian-led opposing force in which soldiers from a range of Australian units worked together with a [[US Marine Corps]] contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exercise Crocodile '03: You win some, you lose some | author = John Wellfare | url = http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1084/features/feature01a.htm | publisher = Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[state defense force]]s have served as OPFOR units when training with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. The [[California State Military Reserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4thmpbnpmo.com/opfor.htm |title=OPFOR |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=1st Battalion (MP), 2nd Brigade (Civil Support), California State Military Reserve |access-date=16 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Georgia State Defense Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seay |first=Howard, WO1 |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Operation Roughrider Cold |url=http://issuu.com/allanhayesgsdf/docs/headsup_june2015 |journal=Heads Up |publisher=Georgia State Defense Force |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi= |access-date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have provided OPFOR services to their respective National Guard counterparts.

The [[British Army]] rotates units through [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] as OPFOR.

The [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] utilizes a regiment-sized OPFOR unit replicating the [[Korean People's Army Ground Force|North Korean Army]] infantry force at the [[Korea Combat Training Center]].

===Private OPFOR companies===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
There are a number of private companies that provide OPFOR services to support the training missions of various military units. As the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close, the use of private training forces are on the rise in the Department of Defense. OPFOR companies supplement the existing training programs in a number of ways.{{which|date=November 2017}}

In [[human–computer interaction]], an '''organic user interface''' ('''OUI''') is defined as a [[user interface]] with a non-flat display.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After [[Douglas Engelbart|Engelbart]] and [[Ivan Sutherland|Sutherland's]] [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was based on the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and [[Alan Kay|Kay]] and [[Mark Weiser|Weiser's]] [[ubiquitous computing]], which is based on the flat panel [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD), OUI represents the third wave of display interaction paradigms, pertaining to multi-shaped and [[flexible display]]s. In an OUI, the display surface is always the locus of interaction, and may actively or passively change shape upon analog (i.e., as close to non-quantized as possible) inputs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roel Vertegaal and Ivan Poupyrev, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1349026.1349033 Organic User Interfaces: Introduction], Communications of the ACM 51(6), 26–30, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These inputs are provided through direct physical [[Gesture recognition|gestures]], rather than through indirect [[Point and click|point-and-click]] control. Note that the term "Organic" in OUI was derived from [[organic architecture]], referring to the adoption of natural form to design a better fit with [[human ecology]]. The term also alludes to the use of [[organic electronics]] for this purpose.

Organic user interfaces were first introduced in a special issue of the ''Communications of the ACM'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first International Workshop on Organic User Interfaces took place at CHI 2009 in Boston, Massachusetts. The second workshop took place at TEI 2011 in Madeira, Portugal. The third workshop was held at MobileHCI 2012 in Monterey, California, and the fourth workshop at CHI 2013 in Paris, France.

==Types==
According to Vertegaal and Poupyrev,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there are three general types of organic user interface:

'''Flexible (or deformable) user interfaces:''' When flexible displays are deployed, shape deformation, e.g., through bends, is a key form of input for OUI. Flexible display technologies include [[Flexible organic light-emitting diode|flexible OLED]] (FOLED) and [[Flexible display#Flexible electronic paper based displays|flexible E Ink]], or can be simulated through 3D [[Projection mapping|active projection mapping]].

'''Shaped user interfaces:''' Displays with a static non-flat display. The physical shape is chosen so as to better support the main function of the interface. Shapes may include spheres, cylinders or take the form of everyday objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Actuated (or kinetic) user interfaces:''' Displays with a programmable shape controlled by a computer algorithm. Here, display shapes can actively adapt to the physical context of the user, the form of the data, or the function of the interface. An extreme example is that of [[Claytronics]]: fully physical 3D [[voxel]]s that dynamically constitute physical 3D images.

==Organic design principles==

Holman and [[Roel Vertegaal|Vertegaal]] present three design principles that underlie OUI:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;David Holman and Roel Vertegaal, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1349026.1349037 Organic user interfaces: designing computers in any way, shape, or form], Communications of the ACM 51(6), 26–30, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Input equals output:''' In traditional GUIs, input and output are physically separated: Output is generated graphically on the screen on the basis of input provided by a control device such as a mouse. A key feature of OUI is that the display surface, and its physical deformations are always the locus of user interaction.

'''Function equals form:''' Coined by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], this means the shape of an interface determines its physical functionality, and vice versa. Shapes should be chosen such that they best support the functionality of the interface. An example is a spherical multitouch interface,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is particularly suited to geographic information interfaces, which were previously limited to [[Mercator projection|distorted flat projections]] of spherical earth data.

'''Form follows flow:''' OUIs physically adapt to the context of a user's multiple activities, e.g., by taking on multiple shapes. An example of this is the "clamshell" phone, where the physical metaphor of altering the phone's shape (by opening it) alters the state of the user interface (to open communications). Another example is folding a thin-film tablet PC into a smaller, pocket-sized smartphone for mobility.

Eyes-on: Samsung's Youm flexible-display tech at CES 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; are early commercial prototypes of OUIs. It is widely expected that OUIs will be introduced on the market by the year 2018.

Note that OUIs differ from a [[natural user interface]] (NUI) in that NUIs are limited to touch or remote gestural interactions with a flat display only. Although remote gestural interaction violates the principle of ''Input Equals Output'', OUIs generally subsume NUIs. Also note that OUI is a successor to and form of [[tangible user interface]] that always features a bitmapped display skin around its multi-shaped body. Finally, note that all OUIs are examples of [[Haptic technology|haptic technologies]], as their physical shapes, like real objects, provide passive tactile-kinaesthetic feedback even in non-actuated cases.

The '''Owatonna Art Education Project''' was a project in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]] in the United States, intended to promote the production of new knowledge through science, establish standards of excellence in education, and provide opportunities for self-improvement and visual enhancement. It was started 1933 and continued until 1938. The findings were published in 1944.

The '''pericycle''' is a cylinder of [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] or [[sclerenchyma]] cells that lies just inside the [[endodermis]] and is the outer most part of the [[stele (biology)|stele]] of plants.

Although it is composed of non-vascular parenchyma cells, it is still considered part of the vascular cylinder because it arises from the procambium as do the vascular tissues it surrounds.

In [[eudicots]], it also has the capacity to produce [[lateral roots]].  Branch roots arise from this primary [[meristem]] tissue. In plants undergoing [[secondary growth]], the pericycle contributes to the [[vascular cambium]] often diverging into a [[cork cambium]].

In [[angiosperms]] certain molecules within the [[endodermis]] and the surrounding vasculature are sent to the pericycle which promotes the growth of the root [[meristem]]s.

== Location ==

The pericycle is located between the endodermis and phloem in plant roots.  In dicot stems, it is situated around the ring of vascular bundles in the stele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.031 |pmid=24845660 |title=Pericycle |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=R378–9 |year=2014 |last1=Beeckman |first1=Tom |last2=De Smet |first2=Ive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

In dicot roots, the pericycle strengthens the roots and provides protection for the [[vascular bundle]]s.

In dicot root, the vascular cambium is completely secondary in origin, and it originates from a portion of pericycle tissue.

The pericycle regulates the formation of lateral roots by rapidly dividing near the xylem elements of the root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7588064 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7588064 |year=1995 |author1=Laskowski |first1=M.

C. |last4=Sussex |first4=I. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been known to often be confused with other parts of the plant. However, its unique ring structure allows it to be more easily identified.

Past efforts to isolate such tissue have been successful. Monocot roots rarely branch, but can, and this branch will originate from the pericycle.

[[File:Phase Angle 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Phase angle diagram]]

'''Phase angle''' in [[Observational astronomy|astronomical observation]]s is the angle between the light incident onto an observed [[Astronomical object|object]] and the light reflected from the object. In the context of astronomical observations, this is usually the angle [[Sun]]-object-observer.

For terrestrial observations, "Sun–object–Earth" is often nearly the same thing as "Sun–object–observer", since the difference depends on the [[parallax]], which in the case of observations of the [[Moon]] can be as much as 1°, or two full Moon diameters. With the development of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], as well as in hypothetical observations from other points in space, the notion of phase angle became independent of Sun and Earth.

The [[etymology]] of the term is related to the notion of [[planetary phase]]s, since the [[brightness]] of an object and its appearance as a "phase" is the function of the phase angle.

The phase angle varies from 0° to 180°. The value of 0° corresponds to the position where the illuminator, the observer, and the object are collinear, with the illuminator and the observer on the same side of the object. This is known as [[astronomical opposition]]. The value of 180° is the position where the object is between the illuminator and the observer. Values less than 90° represent [[backscatter]]ing; values greater than 90° represent [[forward scatter]]ing.

For some objects, such as the [[Moon]] (see [[lunar phases]]), [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] the phase angle (as seen from the Earth) covers the full 0&amp;ndash;180° range. The [[superior planet]]s cover shorter ranges. For example, for [[Mars]] the maximum phase angle is about 45°.

The brightness of an object is a function of the phase angle, which is generally smooth, except for the so-called [[opposition spike]] near 0°, which does not affect gas giants or bodies with pronounced atmospheres, and when the object becomes fainter as the angle approaches 180°. This relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].

'''Planctomycetes''' are a [[phylum]] of aquatic [[bacteria]]  and are found in samples of [[brackish water|brackish]], and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[fresh water|fresh]] [[water]]. They reproduce by [[budding]]. In structure, the organisms of this group are [[oval (geometry)|ovoid]] and have a [[holdfast]], at the tip of a thin cylindrical extension from the cell body called the stalk, at the nonreproductive end that helps them to attach to each other during budding.

[[Cavalier-Smith]] has postulated that the Planctomycetes are within the clade [[Planctobacteria]] in the larger clade [[Gracilicutes]], but this is not generally accepted.

==Structure==
For a long time bacteria belonging to this group were considered to lack [[peptidoglycan]], (also called murein) in their [[cell wall]]s, which is an important [[heteropolymer]] present in most [[bacteria]]l cell walls that serves as a protective component. It was thought that instead their walls were made up of [[glycoprotein]] which is rich in [[glutamate]]. Recently, however, representatives of all three clades within the Planctomycetes were found to possess peptidoglycan-containing cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jeske, O., Schueler, M., Schumann, P., Schneider, A., Boedeker, C., Jogler, M.,  Bollschweiler, D., Rohde, M., Mayer, C., Engelhardt, H., Spring, S. &amp; Jogler, C.|year=2015|title=Planctomycetes do possess a peptidoglycan cell wall |journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms8116|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8116/full/ncomms8116.html|pmid=25964217|pages=7116|pmc=4432640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=van Teeseling, M.C.F., Mesman, R.J., Kuru, E., Espaillat, A., Cava, F., Brun, Y.V., VanNieuwenhze, M.S., Kartal, B &amp; van Niftrik, L.|year=2015|title=Anammox Planctomycetes have a peptidoglycan cell wall |journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms7878|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms7878/full/ncomms7878.html|pages=6878|pmid=25962786|pmc=4432595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planctomycetes have a distinctive [[bacterial morphology|morphology]] with the appearance of [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound internal compartments, often referred to as the ''paryphoplasm'' (ribosome-free space), ''pirellulosome'' (ribosome-containing space) and ''nucleoid'' (condensed nucleic acid region, in these species surrounded by a double membrane).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One 2013 study found the appearance of internal compartments to be due to a densely invaginated but continuous single membrane, concluding that only the two compartments typical of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria - the [[cytoplasm]] and [[periplasm]] - are present. However, the excess membrane triples the surface area of the cell relative to its volume, which may be related to ''Gemmata's'' [[sterol]] biosynthesis abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Santarella-Mellwig, R., Pruggnaller, S., Roos, N., Mattaj, I., &amp; Devos, D.|year=2013|title=Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Bacteria with a Complex Endomembrane System|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001565|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001565|pmid=23700385|pages=e1001565|pmc=3660258}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study using similar methods reported confirmation of the earlier enclosed compartment hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It has recently been shown that ''Gemmata obscuriglobus'' is able to take in large molecules via a process which in some ways resembles [[endocytosis]], the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.&lt;ref name=Lonhienne2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lonhienne |first=Thierry G.

==Molecular Signatures==

Although the ''Planctomycetes'' are renowned for their unusual cellular characteristics, their distinctness from all other bacteria is additionally supported by the shared presence of two [[conserved signature indels]] (CSIs).&lt;ref name=Gupta2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS, Bhandari V, Naushad HS |title=Molecular Signatures for the PVC Clade (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and Lentisphaerae) of Bacteria Provide Insights into Their Evolutionary Relationships |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=327 |year=2012 |pmid=23060863 |pmc=3444138 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00327 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These CSIs demarcate the group from neighboring phyla within the [[PVC group]].&lt;ref name=pmid27279642&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS |title=Impact of genomics on the understanding of microbial evolution and classification: the importance of Darwin's views on classification |journal= FEMS Microbiol Rev |volume=40|issue=4|pages=520–53 |date=2016|pmid=27279642 |doi=10.1093/femsre/fuw011 |url=http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/07/femsre.fuw011.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional CSI has been found that is shared by all ''Planctomycetes'' species, with the exception of ''[[Kuenenia stuttgartiensis]]'', which is in line with the observation that ''K. stuttgartiensis'' forms a deep branch within the phylum.

A [[conserved signature indel]] has also been found to be shared by the entire [[PVC group]], including Planctomycetes.&lt;ref name=Gupta2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27279642/&gt; Planctomycetes also harbours an important conserved signature protein that has been characterized to play an important housekeeping function that is exclusive to members belonging to the PVC clade.&lt;ref name=pmid24185849&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lagkouvardos I, Jehl MA, Rattei T, Horn M |title= Signature protein of the PVC superphylum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=80|issue=2|pages=440–445 |date=2014|pmid=24185849 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02655-13|pmc=3911108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
The [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of many planctomycetes involves alternation between [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] cells and [[flagellum|flagellated]] swarmer cells. The sessile cells bud to form the flagellated swarmer cells which swim for a while before settling down to attach and begin reproduction.

'''Páramo''' can refer to a variety of [[alpine tundra]] [[ecosystem]]s. Some ecologists describe the páramo broadly as "all high, tropical, montane vegetation above the continuous timberline".&lt;ref name="Baruch"/&gt; A more narrow term classifies the páramo according to its regional placement in the northern [[Andes]] of South America and adjacent southern Central America. The páramo is the ecosystem of the regions above the continuous forest line, yet below the permanent snowline.&lt;ref name=Baruch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baruch|first=Zdravko|title=Ordination and Classification of Vegetation along an Altitudinal Gradient in the Venezuelan Páramos|journal=Vegetation|date=20 March 1984|volume=55|series=2|pages=115–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "[[Neotropical]] high mountain biome with a vegetation composed mainly of giant rosette plants, shrubs and grasses".&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; According to scientists, páramos may be "[[evolution|evolutionary hot spots]]" and among the fastest evolving regions on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20131107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=High Above Sea Level, Evolutionary Hot Spots |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/science/high-above-sea-level-evolutionary-hot-spots.html |date=November 7, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Paramo de Sumapaz - Yuri Romero Picon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sumapaz Paramo|Sumapaz Páramo]]]]
The Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion includes the [[Cordillera Central páramo]] (Ecuador, Peru), [[Santa Marta páramo]] (Colombia), [[Cordillera de Merida páramo]] (Venezuela) and [[Northern Andean páramo]] (Colombia, Ecuador) terrestrial ecoregions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Northern Andean Paramo – WWF Global}}|title=Northern Andean Paramo|publisher=WWF Global|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/northern_andean_paramo.cfm|accessdate=2017-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181324/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/northern_andean_paramo.cfm|archivedate=2017-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Costa Rican páramo]] in Costa Rica and Panama is another páramo ecoregion.
In the strictest sense of the term, all páramo ecosystems are located in the [[Neotropics]], specifically South and Central America.  Scattered throughout the regions between [[11th parallel north|11°N]] and [[8th parallel south|8°S]] latitudes, these ecosystems are located mainly in the northwest corner of South America, in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]].

In Venezuela, the páramo occurs in the [[Cordillera de Mérida]]. Páramo ecosystems are also found in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in Colombia, and in the regions of [[Huehuetenango]] and [[El Quiché]] of Guatemala in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg, Michael and Matthew Taylor   |year=2008 |title=Guatemala's Altos de Chiantla: Changes on the High Frontier|journal=Mountain Research and Development |volume=28 |issue=3/4 |pages=255–262|issn=1994-7151 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1659/mrd.0891 |doi=10.1659/mrd.0891}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] of Costa Rica and the westernmost part of Panama has  páramo. In northern Ecuador, the [[Guandera Biological Station]] is a fairly undisturbed páramo ecosystem.

The majority of the páramo ecosystems occur in the [[Colombian Andes]]. The [[Sumapaz Páramo]], south of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]] (about {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of Bogotá), is the largest páramo in the world. This region was declared a National Park of Colombia in 1977 because of its importance as a [[biodiversity hotspot]] and main source of water for the most densely populated area of the country, the Bogotá Savannah.
The {{convert|1405|acre|km2|1|adj=on|order=flip}} Páramo Wildlife Refuge Park in the [[San José Province]] of Costa Rica "protects tropical forest areas in the high elevations of the [[Talamanca Mountains]]".&lt;ref name="Páramo Wildlife Refuge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paramo Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.costarica-nationalparks.com/paramowildliferefuge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotopaxi National Park]] contains {{convert|81524|acre|km2|1|order=flip}} of protected land in the [[Cotopaxi Province]] of Ecuador. Much of this park is páramo. Its flora includes [[Gentiana|gentians]], [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]], [[valeriana|valerians]], and [[asteraceae|asters]] such as ''[[Loricaria (plant)|Loricaria]]'' and ''[[Chuquiraga]]'' species.&lt;ref name="Planet Ecuador"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marbache|first=Julie|title=National Parks|url=http://www.planetecuador.net/parks.htm|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
[[File:Culcitium.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Culcitium]]'' sp. in Páramo de Chiles, [[Carchi]], [[Ecuador]].]]
Páramo climates differ slightly depending on the specific location. In Colombia and northern Ecuador, air masses from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) have a substantial effect on the climate, and these regions tend to be consistently humid (approx. 70-85%)&lt;ref name=Luteyn&gt;{{cite book|last=Luteyn|first=James L.|title=Páramos: A Checklist of Plant Diversity, Geographical Distribution, and Botanical Literature|year=1999|publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press|location=Bronx, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  throughout the year. The Andes also play a key role in the climate of these regions as they cause an orographic uplift in which moist air rises. This creates continuous moisture via rain, clouds, and fog, with many of them receiving over {{convert|2000|mm|abbr=on}} of rain annually.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;

The páramos of the northern-most Andes of Venezuela, northern Colombia, and Costa Rica experience a different climate due to the dry season, which is caused by northeasterly trade winds. Southern Ecuador and northern Peru experience the most severe dryness as they are influenced by an air mass from the Amazon Basin, which releases its moisture on the eastern slopes, as well as another air mass from the west that is influenced by the [[Humboldt Current]].

Overall, páramo climates are known for their daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity. While they are generally cold and humid ecosystems, they often undergo a sudden and drastic change in weather in which they fluctuate between temperatures from below freezing to as high as {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}. This oscillation often results in a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as "summer every day and winter every night."&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;  Mean annual temperatures of páramo ecosystems range from {{convert|2|C|F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|C|F|abbr=on}}, with increasingly colder temperatures at higher latitudes.

== Soils==
[[File:Rabanal.JPG|thumb|left|Páramo de Rabanal, [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], Colombia]]
Soils in páramo ecosystems vary, but most are young and partially weathered. The soil has a relatively low pH because of an abundance of moisture and organic content. Organic content, even within disturbed sites averages very high which contributes to water retention in the soil. During cold and wet weather, there are few nutrients available and productivity is very low in páramo soils.&lt;ref name=Hofstede&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Robert|author2=Arnout Rossenaar |title=Biomass of Grazed, Burned, and Undisturbed Páramo Grasslands, Colombia. II. Root Mass and Aboveground:Belowground Ratio|journal=Arctic and Alpine Research|date=February 1995|volume=27|issue=1|pages=13–18|jstor=1552063|doi=10.2307/1552063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soils in páramo ecosystems have changed because of human activity, especially due to burning vegetation to clear land for grazing.

Soils in the south Ecuadorian páramo are characterized broadly into [[Andisols]], [[Inceptisols]], [[Histosols]], [[Entisols]], and [[Mollisols]].&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Recently, there has been an increase in Andisol soils, largely due to more volcanic activity&lt;ref name=Buytaert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buytaert|first=W.|author2=J. Sevink |author3=B. De Leeuw |author4=J. Deckers |title=Clay mineralogy of the soils in the south Ecuadorian páramo region|journal=Geoderma|year=2005|volume=127|pages=114–129|url=http://www.paramo.be/pubs/geoderma.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2011|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These soils have a very high water retention rate, which contributes to the rise in cultivation and differential land use. This water supply stored in the soil in the higher elevation páramo in the Andes becomes the water supply for Andean settlements in lower altitudes.

==Vegetation zones==
Páramos are divided into separate zones based on altitude and vegetation structure, with the three main types of páramo vegetation unequally distributed throughout the different zones. 
[[File:Azorella peduculata (14401587732).jpg|thumb|''[[Azorella pedunculata]]'']]

Superpáramo is at the highest elevation and is usually considered to be the transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about {{convert|4500|-|4800|m|abbr=on}}. It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar radiation and night frost. For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes ''[[Azorella pedunculata]]'' of the [[Apiaceae]] family and species from the [[Asteraceae]], [[Fabaceae]], and [[Ericaceae]] families.

[[File:Blühende Rosetten.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Espeletia]] grandiflora'' in Páramo de Guerrero, [[Colombia]]]]
[[File:Espeletia killipii 1.JPG|thumb|''Espeletia killipii'' in Páramo de [[Guasca]], Colombia.]]
The most broadly described zone is the grass páramo. Grass páramos cover large areas of mountain ranges, while others are limited to small areas on slopes and summits of very high mountains.&lt;ref name=Sklenar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sklenar|first=P.|author2=P.M. Jorgensen |title=Distribution Patterns of Paramo Plants in Ecuador|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=July 1999|volume=26|issue=4|pages=681–691|jstor=2656172|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00324.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "páramo" is sometimes used to refer to this specific type. It has continuous vegetation and plant cover with a "yellowish to olive–brown" look due to the combination of dead and living grasses.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; The grass páramo extends from approximately {{convert|3500|-|4100|m|abbr=on}}, and is composed of mostly tussock-grasses and bunch-grasses.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Grasses of the ''[[Calamagrostis]]'' and ''[[Festuca]]'' genera tend to dominate this zone. Other common vegetation includes large and small shrubs, stunted trees, cushion plants, herbs, and rosette plants.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; While these are the dominant species, grass páramos can also contain tall- and short-grass communities, including herbaceous and woody vegetation. Due to its easier access and high levels of grass, this zone is more impacted by humans and suffers from both burning and grazing activities.

Subpáramo is the lowest and most diverse zone. At {{convert|3000|-|3500|m|abbr=on}}, it is a shrub-dominated zone that combines aspects of both the grass páramo above and the forest below. Along with shrubs, this zone also contains small, scattered trees which gradually transition into the grasses and herbs of the grass páramo above. Plant communities in this vegetation zone are also known to include thickets that are mainly composed of shrubby or woody vegetation, including species from the ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Ageratina]]'', and ''[[Baccharis]]'' genera. Fragmented forests can appear in the subpáramo due to [[microclimate|microclimatic]] or [[edaphic]] conditions, yet the more abrupt changes are generally due to anthropogenic disruption such as cutting, burning, and grazing activities. Because of these high levels of disruption, it is believed that subpáramos are made up of largely secondary-growth communities. The high levels of disruption also make this zone particularly difficult to define, as humans typically extend and expand the zone for their own purposes, sometimes over hundreds or thousands of years. This has altered forest lines, often lowering them by several hundred meters, which has also affected the [[zoning habitat]]s for many animals.

==Fauna==
[[File:Pudu mephistolephis.png|thumb|''Pudu mephistolephis'', the Northern [[Pudú]], the smallest deer in the world, found up to 4,000 metres]]
[[File:Osoandino.JPG|thumb|''Tremarctos ornatus'', the [[spectacled bear]] or Andean bear is the only surviving species of bear native to South America.]]

The vegetation of the páramo provides shelter and habitat for a variety of mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, and reptiles. Some animals commonly found in páramo ecosystems include the [[Culpeo]] (sometimes called the páramo wolf), the [[white-tailed deer]], and the [[spectacled bear]]  which occasionally forages in the high páramo for its favored food, ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' bromeliads.&lt;ref name="Travel site" /&gt; Invertebrates such as grasshoppers, cockroaches, beetles, and flies are found in the subpáramo. Amphibians have been well documented in páramo ecosystems, including [[salamander]]s such as ''[[Bolitoglossa]]'' species and frogs such as ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' species. Reptiles include lizards of the genera ''[[Stenocercus]]'', ''[[Phenacosaurus]]'', and ''[[Proctoporus]]''.

Sixty-nine species of birds are considered to be "total users" of páramo habitats, with "41 species making it their primary habitat and 16 as [[indicator species]]".&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; The [[Andean condor]], also called "king of the Andes", is known for its wide wingspan, but is no longer frequently seen. The most numerous bird families in the páramo include [[eagle]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]], [[Tanager|thraupid "finches"]], and [[tyrant flycatcher]]s.&lt;ref name="Travel site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity: Paramo Regions|url=http://www.ecuador-travel.net/biodiversity.ecosystems.paramo.htm|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hummingbirds tolerate the cold climate by going into "a kind of nightly hibernation."&lt;ref name="Travel site"/&gt;

Hummingbirds, bees and flies are all important [[pollinator]]s in the páramo, while birds and smaller mammals such as [[rabbit]]s and [[Cavia|guinea pigs]] are important [[seed dispersal|seed dispersers]]. Many of the larger mammals of the páramo are rare due to hunting.

==Human impact and climate change==
[[File:Charolais cattle, Sierra Nevada, Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Cattle were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. A feral [[Charolais cattle|charolais bull]] in the [[Sierra Nevada de Mérida|Sierra Nevada]], Venezuela]]
[[File:Erosioenparamo.jpg|thumb|[[Erosion]] in a páramo, caused by wind and [[overgrazing]]]]

Humans have inhabited the páramo of the Andes for approximately the past 15,000 years. Deforestation has been extensive and in some cases, like the northern Andes, 90-95% of forests have been cleared. Other sites in Venezuela and Colombia show evidence that humans settled there at least 800 years ago and used the land for agriculture and hunting.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;

When Europeans came to the Americas they introduced exotic plants and animals that greatly affected the land, especially cattle, which were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. By the 20th century the growing population of settlers led to an increased demand for land, and páramo ecosystems suffered accordingly. As more land was needed for cattle, fire was used to clear land, and eventually páramos became excessively burned and overgrazed. Both burning and grazing have damaged vegetation, soils, species diversity, and water storage capacity of the páramos. In burned and disturbed sites that were studied in the Andes the pH and phosphorus concentration in the soil are higher than in non-burned sites.&lt;ref name=Suarez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suárez|first=Esteban|author2=Galo Medina |title=Vegetation Structure and Soil Properties in Ecuadorian Páramo Grasslands with Different Histories of Burning and Grazing|journal=Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research|date=May 2001|volume=33|issue=2|pages=158–164|jstor=1552216|doi=10.2307/1552216}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:Páramo andino venezolano nevado.jpg|thumb|right|Snowfall in a páramo in the [[Sierra La Culata|Sierra La Culata, Venezuela]]]] --&gt;
[[Climate change]] is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for páramo ecosystems.
Growing populations in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador have forced settlements in higher elevations covering more páramo. Recent developments such  as construction of aqueducts, drainage systems, and roads, mining, and afforestation have been a huge additional páramo disturbance.  Increases in temperature extremes are forcing many fauna and flora species to higher grounds, and eventually they could face extinction. The flora of páramos is adapted to specific conditions and is thus vulnerable to even small climatic change. Climate change in the Andes is causing glaciers in the páramo to disappear and a drop in rainfall, virtually drying up páramo and in turn, drying up the water supply for cities such as Quito, Ecuador and Bogotá, Colombia.

On 8 February 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] banned all mining operations in the paramos, prioritising the protection of the environment, and terminating 347 mining licenses that had operational rights in the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/corte-constitucional-prohibe-proyectos-mineros-en-los-paramos-del-pais/16504666&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rachis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|k|ᵻ|s}} is a [[biological]] term for a main axis or "shaft" (from the Greek ''ράχις, backbone, spine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*r%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Dr%28a%2Fxis Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ράχις]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==In zoology/microbiology==
In [[vertebrate]]s a ''rachis'' can refer to the series of articulated [[vertebrae]], which encase the [[spinal cord]]. In this case the ''rachis'' usually forms the supporting axis of the body and is then called the [[Vertebral column|spine]] or [[vertebral column]].  ''Rachis'' can also mean the central shaft of [[pennaceous feather]]s.

In the gonad of the invertebrate nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', a ''rachis'' is the central cell-free core or axis of the gonadal arm of both adult males and [[hermaphrodite]]s where the [[germ cell]]s have achieved [[pachytene]] and are attached to the walls of the gonadal tube.  The rachis is filled with [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name="Schedl2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Schedl|title=Germ Cell Development in C. elegans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2poB6z05ZlsC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=9 August 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-4015-4|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In botany==
In [[plant]]s, a ''rachis'' is the main axis of a compound structure. It can be the main stem of a compound [[leaf]], such as in ''[[Acacia]]'' or [[fern]]s, or the main, flower-bearing portion of an [[inflorescence]] above a supporting [[Peduncle_(botany)|peduncle]].

A ripe head of wild-type wheat is easily [[shattering (agriculture)|shattered]] into dispersal units when touched or blown by the [[wind]]. A series of [[Wiktionary:abscission|abscission]] layers forms that divides the rachis into dispersal units consisting of a small group of flowers (a single spikelet) attached to a short segment of the rachis. This is significant in the [[history of agriculture]], and referred to by [[archaeologists]] as a "brittle rachis", one type of [[shattering (agriculture)|shattering]] in crop plants.

In [[anatomy|anatomical]] contexts, '''salpinx''' is used to refer to a type of tube. Per [[Terminologia Anatomica]], the Latin term "tuba" is usually used to describe most tubes (after the [[Roman tuba]], not the modern [[Tuba]]), but the term "salpinges" and its adjectival derivatives are still sometimes used to describe the following two "tubes":&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|seven/000094332|Salpinx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Eustachian tube]] (as in [[salpingopalatine fold]], [[salpingopharyngeal fold]], and [[salpingopharyngeus muscle]])

'''Second wind''' is a phenomenon in distance running, such as [[marathon]]s or [[road running]] (as well as other sports), whereby an athlete who is out of breath and too tired to continue suddenly finds the strength to press on at top performance with less exertion. The feeling may be similar to that of a "[[runner's high]]", the most obvious difference being that the runner's high occurs after the race is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Runner Glossary|publisher=Road Runner Sports|url=http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/content/content.jsp?contentId=500063#r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists believe the second wind to be a result of the body finding the proper balance of [[oxygen]] to counteract the buildup of [[lactic acid]] in the muscles.&lt;ref name=Gontang/&gt; Others claim second winds are due to [[endorphin]] production.  

Heavy breathing during exercise is also to provide cooling for the body.   After some time the veins and capillaries dilate and cooling takes place more through the skin, so less heavy breathing is needed.   The increase in the temperature of the skin can be felt at the same time as the "second wind" takes place.

Documented experiences of the second wind go back at least 100 years, when it was taken to be a commonly held fact of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Energies of Men|author=William James|year=1907|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/energies.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has come to be used as a metaphor for continuing on with renewed energy past the point thought to be one's prime, whether in other sports, careers, or life in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Second Wind|publisher=Time|date=March 29, 1971|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944328,00.html?promoid=googlep}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capriati Barely Outlasts Hingis in a Well-Heated Match|author=Christopher Clarey|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=January 28, 2002|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/01/28/open_ed3__2.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charles Gibson Enjoys a Second Wind on ABC|author=Jacques Steinberg|date=May 17, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/arts/television/17abc.html?ex=1337054400&amp;en=113d1e659553d21c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wind phenomenon is also seen in some medical conditions, such as [[glycogen storage disease type V]].

==Hypotheses==
===Metabolic switching===
When non-aerobic glycogen metabolism is insufficient to meet energy demands, physiologic mechanisms utilize alternative sources of energy such as fatty acids and proteins via aerobic respiration. Second-wind phenomena in metabolic disorders such as [[McArdle's disease]] are attributed to this metabolic switch and the same or a similar phenomenon may occur in healthy individuals (see [[Glycogen storage disease type V#Signs and symptoms|symptoms of McArdle's disease]]).

===Lactic acid===
Muscular exercise as well as other cellular functions requires oxygen to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and properly function. This normal function is called [[aerobic metabolism]] and does not produce lactic acid if enough oxygen is present. During heavy exercise such as long distance running or any demanding exercise, the body's need for oxygen to produce energy is higher than the oxygen supplied in the blood from respiration. [[Anaerobic metabolism]] to some degree then takes place in the muscle and this less ideal energy production produces [[lactic acid]] as a waste metabolite. If the oxygen supply is not soon restored, this may lead to accumulation of lactic acid.

This is the case even without exercise in people with [[respiratory disease]], challenged circulation of blood to parts of the body or any other situation when oxygen cannot be supplied to the tissues involved.

Some people's bodies may take more time than others to be able to balance the amount of oxygen they need to counteract the lactic acid. This theory of the second wind posits that, by pushing past the point of pain and exhaustion, runners may give their systems enough time to warm up and begin to use the oxygen to its fullest potential. For this reason, well-conditioned Olympic-level runners do not generally experience a second wind (or they experience it much sooner) because their bodies are trained to perform properly from the start of the race.

The idea of "properly trained" athlete delves into the theory of how an amateur athlete can train his or her body to increase the aerobic capacity or aerobic metabolism. A big push{{clarify|date=August 2016}} in Ironman Triathlon ten years ago introduced the idea of heart rate training and "tricking" one's body into staying in an aerobic metobolic state for longer periods of time.  This idea is widely accepted and incorporated into many Ironman Triathlon training programs.&lt;ref name=Gontang&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newsweek|date=July 27, 1992|first=Ozzie|last=Gontang|title=Second Wind|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/running/26-Second-Wind.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Endorphins===
[[Endorphins]] are credited as the cause of the feeling of euphoria and wellbeing found in many forms of exercise, so proponents of this theory believe that the second wind is caused by their early release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Active For Your Mental Health|url=http://www.mhca.org.au/AboutMentalHealth/ExerciseForYourMentalHealth.html|publisher=Mental Health Council of Australia|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these proponents feel that the second wind is very closely related to&amp;mdash;or even interchangeable with&amp;mdash;the runner's high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hal Higdon's Smart Running|pages=27|publisher=Rodale Books|year=1998|author=[[Hal Higdon]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0875965350/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft energy technologies''' may be seen as ''appropriate'' renewable technologies.&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php The soft energy path] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222005324/http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php |date=2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft energy technologies are not simply renewable energy technologies, as there are many [[renewable energy]] technologies which are not regarded as "soft".

== Definition ==
More specifically, soft energy technologies have five defining characteristics.&lt;ref name=en&gt;Lovins, 1977, pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;  They rely on [[renewable energy]] resources, are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances, are flexible and relatively simple to understand, are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale, and are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality. An energy technology must satisfy all five of these criteria to be soft.&lt;ref name=en/&gt;

Residential [[solar energy]] technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, [[energy conservation|energy conserving]], [[residential solar]] energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy.  ''Active'' residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun's rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply.  '''''Passive''''' residential solar technologies ([[passive house]]) involve the natural transfer (by radiation, convection and conduction) of solar energy without the use of mechanical devices.

== Sociological definition ==
The term soft is not meant to be vague, speculative, or ephemeral, but rather sustainable, flexible, resilient, and benign.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  Soft technology impacts are generally seen to be more "gentle, pleasant and manageable" than high technology impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, favourable socio-political impacts include:&lt;ref&gt;Morrison &amp; Lodwick, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
* reduction in social conflicts and inequalities;
* reduction in population concentration;
* increase in employment, especially for the lower social classes;
* increase in the satisfaction of basic human needs;
* increase in consumer self-sufficiency; and
* increase in social participation and democratic processes.

The use of soft energy technologies, in conjunction with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and the transitional use of [[fossil fuel]] technology, comprise the [[soft energy path]].&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"/&gt;

'''''The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood''''', a report submitted to the [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] in [[Rome]] in 1971, by Dr [[Conrad Baars]], a Dutch-born Catholic psychiatrist from [[Minnesota]], and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that seminary training left priests poorly prepared for a lifetime of [[celibacy]].

==Description==
This report was published by Franciscan Herald Press in 1972 as '''''How to Treat and Prevent the Crisis in the Priesthood'''''. It was also expected to be published in 2006 by St. Paul's/Alba House as part of a book of essays on the priesthood and religious life.

#"psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often. Virtually all of these priests were . . . suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis”.
#Less than 15% of priests in Europe and North America were emotionally fully developed;
#Of the remaining 85%, 20–25% had "serious psychiatric difficulties" that they expressed through alcohol abuse, while 60–70% had less severe degrees of emotional immaturity.

Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, and one of those most active in the Synod was Cardinal Wojtyła, who on October 16, 1978 was elected [[Pope John Paul II]], no implementation of the report's detailed recommendations followed.

[[Image:ViksNAFighter.JPG|thumb|Vikings NA member checks equipment prior to live-steel combat]]
'''The Vikings NA''' is a Viking-Age re-enactment group based in the United States of America.

The group was founded in 2003 as the North American arm of [[The Vikings (reenactment)]] and it currently has member groups in [[California]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]], [[Missouri]], [[Arkansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vikingsna.com/vna-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

Its primary mission is to reenact the culture of "Viking Age" Northern Europe.  This is achieved through participation at [[Renaissance Faire]]s, Scandinavian heritage festivals, and other living-history events where period crafts and live-steel weapons combat are demonstrated to members of the public. 

The standard format is for the group to set up an ''encampment'' — several tents and shelters, with tables of craft demo displays.  Members appear in ''garb'' — Viking-era costume.  Typically, this consists of a [[tunic]] (shorter for men, ankle-length for women), [[breeches]] (men), [[turnshoe|turn shoes]], a belt, small knife, jewelry, and a hat (men) or [[kerchief]] (women).

Compared to other groups much greater emphasis is placed on ensuring that clothing and equipment worn or used by the group members are as close a representation of what the peoples of Viking-Age northern Europe used or wore as possible. For example, man-made fibres, plastics, fake fur and cotton are not allowed in camp.

In January 2009 Vikings NA became independent of the UK body and incorporated in Indiana for Non profit status . While the two organizations maintain close ties over the years and has a similar structure, the Vikings NA operates independently of The Vikings.

'''Toxicofera''' (Greek for "those who bear [[toxin]]s") is a proposed [[clade]] of [[squamata|scaled reptiles]] (squamates) that includes the [[snake|Serpentes]] (snakes), [[Anguimorpha]] (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and [[Iguania]] (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4,600 species, (nearly 60%) of [[extant taxon|extant]] squamata.&lt;ref name="Fry2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04328 |pmid=16292255 |title=Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7076 |pages=584–8 |year=2005 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Norman |first3=Janette A. |last4=Vonk |first4=Freek J. |last5=Scheib |first5=Holger |last6=Ramjan |first6=S.

== Venom ==
{{Further|Evolution of snake venom}}
Venom in squamates has historically been considered a rarity; while it has been [[Asp (reptile)|known in Serpentes since ancient times]], the actual percentage of [[venomous snake|snake species considered venomous]] was relatively small (around 25%).&lt;ref name="Fry2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2009.01.009 |pmid=19457354 |title=Evolution and diversification of the Toxicofera reptile venom system |journal=Journal of Proteomics |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=127–36 |year=2009 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Van Der Weerd |first3=Louise |last4=Kochva |first4=Elazar |last5=Renjifo |first5=Camila }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 2,650 species of advanced snakes (Caenophidia), only the front-fanged species (~650) were considered venomous by the anthropocentric definition.
Following the classification of Helodermatidae in the 19th century, their venom was thought to have developed independently.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; In snakes, the venom gland is in the upper jaw, but in helodermatids, it is found in the lower jaw.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; The origin of venom in squamates was thus considered relatively recent in [[evolution]]ary terms and the result of [[convergent evolution]] among the seemingly-[[polyphyletic]] venomous snake [[Family (biology)|families]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2003  a study was published that described venom in snake subfamilies previously thought to lack it.&lt;ref name="Fry2003"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Some non-venomous snakes have been previously thought to have only mild 'toxic [[saliva]]'. But these results suggest that they actually possess true venoms. We even isolated from a [[rat snake]]'' [''Coelognathus radiatus'' (formerly known as ''[[Elaphe radiata]]'')&lt;ref name="Fry2003-ratsnake" /&gt;]'', a snake common in pet stores, a typical [[cobra]]-style [[neurotoxin]], one that is as potent as comparative toxins found in close relatives of the cobra. These snakes typically have smaller quantities of venom and lack fangs, but they can still deliver their venom via their numerous sharp teeth. But not all of these snakes are dangerous. It does mean, however, that we need to re-evaluate the relative danger of non-venomous snakes.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This prompted further research, which led to the discovery of venom (and venom [[genes]]) in species from groups which were not previously known to produce it, e.g. in Iguania (specifically ''[[Pogona barbata]]'' from the family [[Agamidae]]) and Varanidae (from ''[[Varanus varius]]'').&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  It is thought that this was the result of descent from a common venom-producing squamate ancestor; the hypothesis was described simply as the "venom clade" when first proposed to the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venom clade included Anguidae for [[phylogenetic]] reasons and adopted a previously suggested clade name: Toxicofera.&lt;ref name="Vidal2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.10.001 |pmid=16286089 |title=The phylogeny of squamate reptiles (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians) inferred from nine nuclear protein-coding genes |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=328 |issue=10–11 |pages=1000–8 |year=2005 |last1=Vidal |first1=Nicolas |last2=Hedges |first2=S. Blair }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that the common ancestral species that first developed venom in the venom clade lived on the order of 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venoms are thought to have evolved after genes normally active in various parts of the body [[Gene duplication|duplicated]] and the copies found new use in the [[salivary glands]].&lt;ref name="Fry2003" /&gt;

Among snake families traditionally classified as venomous, the capacity seems to have evolved to extremes more than once by [[parallel evolution]]; 'non-venomous' snake lineages have either lost the ability to produce venom (but may still have lingering venom [[pseudogene]]s) or actually do produce venom in small quantities (e.g. 'toxic saliva'), likely sufficient to assist in small prey capture, but not normally causing harm to humans if bitten.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The newly discovered diversity of squamate species producing venoms is a [[Treasure trove#Terminology|treasure trove]] for those seeking to develop new [[pharmaceutical]] drugs; many of these venoms lower [[blood pressure]], for example.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  Previously known venomous squamates have already provided the basis for [[medication]]s such as [[Ancrod]], [[Captopril]], [[Eptifibatide]], [[Exenatide]] and [[Tirofiban]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Criticism ===

Other scientists such as [[Washington State University]] biologist Kenneth V. Kardong and toxicologists Scott A. Weinstein and Tamara L. Smith, have stated that the allegation of venom glands found in many of these animals "has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution". According to these scientists "reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey". These researchers concluded that, "Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems".&lt;ref name="Mackessy2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinstein|first1=Scott A.|last2=Smith|first2=Tamara L.|last3=Kardong|first3=Kenneth V.|editor=Stephen P.

[[File:Troldsalen-inne03.jpg|thumb|The podium in Troldsalen]]
'''Troldhaugen''' is the former home of [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]] and his wife [[Nina Grieg]]. Troldhaugen is located in [[Bergen, Norway]] and consists of the Edvard Grieg [[Museum]], Grieg’s villa, the hut where he composed music, and his and his wife's [[gravesite]].

==Background==
The building was designed by Grieg's cousin, the architect [[Schak Bull]]. The name comes from ''trold'' meaning [[troll]] and ''haug'' from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr'' meaning hill or knoll. Grieg is reputed to have said that children called the nearby small valley  "The Valley of Trolls" and thus gave the name for his building as well. Edvard Grieg himself called the building "my best composition hitherto".

Edvard and Nina Grieg finished building Troldhaugen in 1885. Edvard and Nina Grieg lived in Troldhaugen when he was home in Norway, mostly in the summer.  Troldhaugen was the home of Edvard Grieg from April 1885 to his death. After the death of her husband in 1907, Nina Grieg moved to Denmark where she spent the remainder of her life.  Grieg's and his wife's ashes rest inside a mountain [[tomb]] near the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://griegmuseum.no/en/about-troldhaugen About Troldhaugen - Grieg museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Troldhaugen is a typical 19th-century residence with panoramic tower and a large veranda.  Grieg's small composer's hut overlooks Nordås Lake. Grieg immortalized the name of his home in one of his piano pieces, ''[[Wedding Day at Troldhaugen]]'', Opus 65, No. 6.

==Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen==
Troldhaugen and its surroundings are now operated as the Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen which is dedicated to the memory of Edvard Grieg. In 1995, a museum building was added, with a permanent exhibition of Edvard Grieg's life and music, as well as shop and restaurant. In the villa’s living room stands Grieg’s own [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] [[grand piano]], which he was given as a [[silver wedding anniversary]] present in 1892. Today the instrument is used for private concerts, special occasions and intimate concerts held in connection with [[Bergen International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergenbyarkiv.no/bergenbyleksikon/arkiv/1424370 ''Troldhaugen'' (Bergen byleksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the noted Norwegian pianist [[Leif Ove Andsnes]] has recorded an album of selections from Grieg's ten volumes of ''[[Lyric Pieces]]''.

Troldsalen, a concert hall,  offers concert series in the summer and autumn months, as well as many other concerts and events. Troldsalen, which was completed in 1985, is an elegant and beautiful concert hall, with excellent acoustics. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind the stage provide the audience with a lovely view of the composer's hut and Lake Nordås.

==Trivia==
*Australian experimental folk metal band Troldhaugen take their name from the home, as well as incorporate excerpts of Grieg's music into their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Troldhaugen/3540317025 ''Troldhaugen'' (metal-archives)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva''''' (''All the Works of Architecture and Perspective'') is an [[architecture|architectural]] [[treatise]] by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475-1554). Serlio is sometimes regarded as one of the most important. The treatise is composed of eight [[book]]s, the sixth of which was lost for some centuries and the eighth of which was not published until relatively recently. The eighth book is not always considered to be part of the treatise. The first five books cover Serlio's works on [[geometry]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] antiquity, the [[Classical order|Orders]] and [[Church (building)|church]] design. The sixth illustrates domestic designs ranging from [[peasant]] huts to royal palaces, providing a unique record of Renaissance house types, including up-to-date [[fortress]]es for [[tyrant]]s and mercenaries as well as Serlio's unbuilt design for the [[Louvre]]. The seventh book illustrates a range of common design problems ignored by past theorists, including how to remodel, or 'restore', [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[façade]]s following antique principles of [[symmetry]] and [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]. The eighth book, called "'''Castrametation of the Romans'''", reconstructs a Roman encampment after the description by [[Polybius]], followed by a military [[city]] and monumental [[bridge]] supposedly built by the Emperor [[Trajan]]. With its [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], [[consul]]'s palace and [[Roman baths|baths]], the book is part-fantasy and part-[[archaeology]], quite unlike Serlio's other more practical works.

A '''vactrain''' (or '''vacuum tube train''') is a proposed design for very-[[high-speed rail]] transportation. It is a [[maglev]] (magnetic levitation) line using partly [[vacuum|evacuated]] tubes or tunnels. Reduced air resistance could permit vactrains to travel at very high speeds with relatively little power—up to {{convert|4000|–|5000|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}. This is 5–6 times the [[speed of sound]] in Earth's atmosphere at sea level.&lt;ref name="eett"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Transatlantic Tunnel |episodelink=&lt;!-- for wikiarticle about episode --&gt; |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html |series=Extreme Engineering |serieslink=Extreme Engineering |credits=Joseph Giotta (Narrator), Powderhouse Productions |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |airdate=April 16, 2003 |transcripturl= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014656/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vactrains might use [[Gravity train|gravity]] to assist their acceleration. If these trains achieve the predicted speeds, they could surpass [[aircraft]] as the world's fastest mode of public transportation. 

However, without major advances in tunneling and other technology, vactrains would be prohibitively expensive.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==18th century==
{{main|Atmospheric railway}}
In 1799, [[George Medhurst]] of London conceived of and patented an [[Atmospheric railway#Medhurst | atmospheric railway]] that could convey people or cargo through pressurized or evacuated tubes.  The early atmospheric railways and pneumatic tube transport systems (such as the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]]) relied on steam power for propulsion.

==19th century==
In 1888, [[Michel Verne]], son of [[Jules Verne]], imagined a submarine pneumatic tube transport system that could propel a passenger capsule at speeds up to 1800 km/h under the Atlantic Ocean in a short story called "An Express of the Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0606611h.html | title=An Express of the Future | first=Michel | last=Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
The vactrain proper was invented by [[Robert Goddard]] as a freshman at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in the United States in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-scifi-story-robert-h-goddard-published-100-years-a-1494959842 | title=The SciFi Story Robert H. Goddard Published 100 Years Ago | website=gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goddard subsequently refined the idea in a 1906 short story called "The High-Speed Bet" which was summarized and published in a Scientific American editorial in 1909 called "The Limit of Rapid Transit".  Esther, his wife, was granted a US patent for the vactrain in 1950, five years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2511979 | title=Vacuum tube transportation system | website=patents.google.com | publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Russian professor {{Interlanguage link multi|Boris Weinberg|ru|3=Вейнберг, Борис Петрович}} built the world's first model of his proposed version of the vactrain at [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veinberg.o7.ru/ |title=Движение без трения. pre-α |trans-title=Motion without friction. pre-α |first=Boris |last=Weinberg |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Popular_Science_Monthly_Volume_90.djvu/721 |title=Five Hundred Miles an Hour |first=Boris |last=Weinberg |journal=Popular Science Monthly |year=1917 |volume=90 |pages=705–708}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later published a vactrain concept in 1914 in the book ''Motion without friction (airless electric way)''.

In 1955, Polish science-fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]] in a novel ''The Magellan Nebula'' wrote about intercontinental vactrain called "organowiec", which moved in a transparent tube at a speed higher than 1,666&amp;nbsp;km/h.
Later in April 1962, the vactrain appears in the story "Mercenary" by [[Mack Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mack|last = Reynolds|title = Mercenary|date = April 1962|publisher = [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24370/24370-h/24370-h.htm|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he mentions Vacuum Tube Transport in passing.

During the 1970s, a leading vactrain advocate, [[Robert M.

An interview with Robert Salter appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (June 11, 1972). He discussed, in detail, the relative ease with which the [[U.S. government]] could build a tube shuttle system using technologies available at that time. Maglev being poorly developed at the time, he proposed steel wheels. The chamber's door to the tube would be opened, and enough air admitted behind to accelerate the train into the tube. Gravity would further accelerate the departing train down to cruise level. Rising from cruise level, the arriving train would decelerate by compressing the rarefied air ahead of it, which would be vented. Pumps at the stations would make up for losses due to friction or air escaping around the edges of the train, the train itself requiring no motor. This combination of modified (shallow) [[gravity train]] and [[atmospheric railway]] propulsion would consume little [[energy]] but limit the system to subsonic speeds, hence initial routes of tens or hundreds of miles or kilometers rather than transcontinental distances were proposed.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Trains were to require no [[Railway coupling|coupler]]s, each car being directly welded, bolted, or otherwise firmly connected to the next, the route calling for no more bending than the flexibility of steel could easily handle. At the end of the line the train would be moved sideways into the end chamber of the return tube. The railway would have both an inner evacuated tube and an outer tunnel. At cruise depth, the space between would have enough water to float the vacuum tube, softening the ride.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A route through the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] was laid out, with nine stations, one each in the [[Washington DC|District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], and two in [[Connecticut]]. [[Commuter rail]] systems were mapped for the [[San Francisco]] and New York areas, the commuter version having longer, heavier trains, to be propelled less by air and more by gravity than the intercity version. The New York system was to have three lines, terminating in [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], and [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Salter pointed out how such a system would help reduce the environmental damage being done to the atmosphere by [[aviation]] and surface transportation. He called underground Very High Speed Transportation (tube shuttles) his nation's "logical next step". The plans were never taken to the next stage.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

At the time these reports were published, national prestige was an issue as [[Japan]] had been operating its showcase [[shinkansen|bullet train]] for several years and [[maglev train]] research was hot technology. The American ''Planetran'' would establish transcontinental subway service in the United States and provide a commute from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]] in one hour. The tunnel would be buried to a depth of several hundred feet in solid rock formations. Construction would make use of [[laser]]s to ensure alignment and use [[tungsten]] probes to melt through [[igneous]] rock formations. The tunnel would maintain a partial vacuum to minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. A trip would average {{convert|3000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and subject passengers to accelerations up to 1.4 times that of gravity, requiring the use of [[gimbal]]led compartments. Enormous construction costs (estimated as high as US$1 trillion) were the primary reason why Salter's proposal was never built.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Swissmetro Network 2005.png|thumb|[[Swissmetro]] as proposed in 2005]]
Starting in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Swissmetro]] was proposed to leverage the invention of the experimental German [[Transrapid]] maglev train, and operate in large underground tunnels reduced to the pressure altitude of {{convert|68000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} at which the [[Concorde]] SST was certified to fly.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In the 1980s, [[Frank P. Davidson]], a founder and chairman of the [[Channel Tunnel]] project, and Japanese engineer {{Interlanguage link multi|Yoshihiro Kyotani|ja|3=京谷好泰}} tackled the transoceanic problems with a proposal to float a tube above the ocean floor, anchored with cables (a [[submerged floating tunnel]]). The transit tube would remain at least {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below the ocean surface to avoid water turbulence.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

On November 18, 1991, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] filed a patent application for a vactrain system. He called the company he wanted to form ''VSE International'', for velocity, silence, and efficiency.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept itself he called ''[[Magnetic Flight]]''.  The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to {{convert|2,500|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} – about five times faster than a jet airliner – if the air was evacuated from the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O'Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

==21st century==
[[James R. Powell]], former co-inventor of [[superconducting]] [[maglev]] in the 1960s, has since 2001 led investigation of a concept for using a maglev vactrain for [[space launch]] (theoretically two orders of magnitude less marginal cost than present rockets), where the [[StarTram]] proposal would have vehicles reach up to {{convert|8900|to|19600|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} within an acceleration tunnel (lengthy to limit [[g-force]]s), considering boring through the ice sheet in Antarctica for lower anticipated expense than in rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010|publisher=startram.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ET3 Global Alliance|ET3]] claim to have achieved some work that resulted in a patent on "evacuated tube transport technology" which was granted in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.et3.com |title=Why ET3? {{!}} Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies |publisher=ET3 |location=US |date=2013 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They presented their idea 2013 on public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.ideacity.ca/video/daryl-oster-speedy-travel-vacuum-tube/ |title=Speedy Travel in a Vaccuum Tube |first=Daryl |last=Oster |via=Idea City |location=US |date=October 9, 2013 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elon Musk]], CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, champions the vactrain concept under the term [[hyperloop]]. An agreement was signed in 2017 to co-develop a hyperloop line between Seoul and Busan in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/investment-in-hyperloop-routes-speeds-up |title=Investment in hyperloop routes speeds up |first=Jørn |last=Madslien |publisher=Institute of Mechanical Engineers |location=UK |date=July 19, 2017 |access-date=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TransPod]] is a Canadian company designing and manufacturing ultra-high-speed tube transportation technology and vehicles.&lt;ref name="transpodabout"&gt;{{cite web|title=About TransPod|url=https://transpodhyperloop.com/about-transpod/|website=TransPod|publisher=TransPod Inc|accessdate=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050639/https://transpodhyperloop.com/about-transpod/|archive-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TransPod vehicles are being designed to travel at over 1000 km/h between cities using fully electric propulsion and zero need for fossil fuels.

'''''An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words''''' was written by [[William Edwy Vine]] and published as a four volume set in 1940.  In common usage, the title is often shortened to '''''Vine's Expository Dictionary''''', or simply '''''Vine's'''''.  It is a cross-reference from key English words in the [[Authorized King James Version]] to the original words in the Greek texts of the New Testament.  In his preface to the book, Vine wrote, "The present volumes are produced especially for the help of those who do not study Greek, though it is hoped that those who are familiar with the original will find them useful."  
It provides a concise meaning of the original Greek word, often providing Bible verse references as examples.  If there are several Greek words that may translate to the same English word, Vine's distinguishes the shadings of meaning and connotation that may be lost in the English translation.  For example, there are a number of Greek words that may be translated by the English word '''''love'''''.

Vine's also provides the definition of a word (as used in the King James Version) more accurately than an English dictionary, because it expands the Greek use of the word. For example, the word, "godliness" in 1 Tim. 2:2 is defined in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary as "1: Divine 2: pious, devout -", but in Vines, it is defined as " 'to be devout,' denotes that piety which is characterized by a Godward attitude, does that which is well-pleasing to Him." So we have a fuller meaning of the word by seeing how the word is used in the NT.

Vine's can be used with [[Strong's Concordance]]. Every word is numbered with the equivalent Strong's number so you can use it more efficiently.  

Vine did not write an equivalent work for Old Testament Hebrew words; however, Vine's work is sometimes combined with another author's Hebrew dictionary and marketed under Vine's name as a "complete" expository dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatebiblereferencelibrary.com/Vines_Expositary_Dictionary.pdf ''Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;
