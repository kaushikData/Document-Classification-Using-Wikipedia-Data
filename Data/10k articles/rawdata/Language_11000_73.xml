'''Ahmad Rahi''' (12 November 1923 – 2 September 2002) was a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] poet and writer from [[Pakistan]]. He was born in [[Amritsar]], British India. His real name was Ghulam Ahmad, a name given by his spiritual leader Khorsheed Ahmad. He completed his basic early education from [[Amritsar]], India in 1940. After completing his high school, he got admission in [[M.A.O. College]], [[Lahore]] but was expelled due to taking part in political movements. After expulsion, he joined his father in his business of selling embroidered wool shawls in the local market.

==Life and film career in Pakistan==
After independence of Pakistan in 1947, he migrated to [[Pakistan]] and joined the magazine '''Sawera''' as an editor in [[Lahore]]. He was paid Rupees 25 as monthly salary back then. He wrote about the events and bloodshed leading to [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947 which was a very painful personal experience for him due to the atrocities committed by Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus against each other.&lt;ref name=rekhta/&gt; Religious biases and sectarian animosities were flared up and at their peak level during 1947. Deeply and personally affected by the events, he wrote two books on this subject. His first book  '''Tarinjan''' was published in 1952 and second book was also published under the name of '''Nimi Nimi Hawa'''. Both books were in the [[Punjabi language]]. Taranjan was a poetry book about the bloodshed related to [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=DunyaNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=rekhta/&gt;

==''Progressive Writers' Movement'' activist== 
Ahmad Rahi, along with the renowned Pakistani film producer-director '''Saifuddin Saif''', noted short story writer [[Saadat Hassan Manto]] and the now-celebrated Pakistani poet [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] started gathering socially at the historic [[Pak Tea House]] in [[Lahore]], shortly after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. One of those Ahmad Rahi's old friends was [[Abdul Hameed (writer)]] (1928 &amp;ndash; 29 April 2011) who had told a major Lahore newspaper in an interview before he died in 2011, "Literary giants like [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Munir Niazi]], Ahmad Rahi, [[Ashfaq Ahmad]], [[Ibn-e-Insha]] and [[Nasir Kazmi]] were among his closest friends. He had been a part of the historic years of 'Pak Tea House' "&lt;ref name=TheNation&gt;[http://nation.com.pk/blogs/31-May-2016/a-hameed-later-years A. Hameed: Later years] The Nation (newspaper), Published 31 May 2016, Retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; crowd in Lahore, Pakistan. This historic tea house was and still is known as a gathering place for intellectuals, poets, writers and artists. "It holds a special place in the memories of those who know about Lahore's vibrant literary and cultural past."&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/791223/nawaz-reopens-pak-tea-house-in-lahore Nawaz reopens Pak Tea House in Lahore] Dawn (newspaper), Published 8 March 2013, Retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Pak Tea House, therefore, also became a central location for all these above intellectuals who were also active in the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]] in Pakistan.

Film songs written by him for films '''Heer Ranjha (1970)''', '''Mirza Jat (1967)''', '''Baji (1963)''' and  '''Yakke Wali (1957)'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1390858/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Ahmad Rahi as a film song lyricist on Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website] Retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; became run-away super-hits in Pakistan. He was a close friend of renowned Pakistani writer [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] and film producer and poet '''Saifuddin Saif''', and all 3 friends played key roles in the early years of [[Pakistan film industry]] in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. He wrote film songs for a total of 51 films-9 films in [[Urdu language|Urdu]] language and for 42 movies in the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] language.
 
==Death and legacy==
Ahmad Rahi died on 2 September 2002 in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] at age 79.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/55546/ahmad-rahi-dies-at-79 Obituary and profile on Dawn (newspaper)] Published 3 September 2002, Retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He had been paralyzed for almost seven months which had affected his speech and memory. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

On his death anniversary event in 2009, Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture (PILAC) Director-General said that Ahmad Rahi was an 'egoist' who never made compromises in his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/952297 A tribute to Ahmad Rahi] Dawn (newspaper), Published 13 November 2009, Retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banana boat''' was a term, a descriptive nickname, given to fast ships also called banana carriers engaged in the [[Banana#Trade|banana trade]] designed to transport easily spoiled bananas rapidly from tropical growing areas to northern markets that often carried passengers as well as fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/fruitindex.shtml |title=Fruit Shipping Companies / Banana Boats |author=S.

Surplus naval vessels were converted in some cases in the search for speed with Standard Fruit converting four U.S. Navy destroyer hulls, without machinery, to the banana carriers [[USS Dale (DD-290)|''Masaya'']], [[USS Osborne (DD-295)|''Matagalpa'']], [[USS Worden (DD-288)|''Tabasco'']] and [[USS Putnam (DD-287)|''Teapa'']] in 1932.&lt;ref name=SLSFC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/sfruit.shtml |title=Standard Fruit Co / Vaccaro Brothers |author=S.

Modern banana boats tend to be [[reefer ship]]s or other refrigerated ships that carry cooled bananas on one leg of a voyage, then general cargo on the return leg.

The large fruit companies such as [[Standard Fruit Company]], [[United Fruit Company]] in the United States and [[Fyffes Line|Elders &amp; Fyffes Shipping]], which itself came under control of the United Fruit Company in 1910, in the banana trade acquired or built ships for the purpose, some strictly banana carriers and others with passenger accommodations.&lt;ref name=SLSFC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/ufruit.shtml |title=United Fruit Company |author=S.

[[File:United Fruit Ad 1916.jpg|thumb|1916 advertisement for the United Fruit Company Steamship Service]]
United Fruit operated a large fleet, advertised as [[United Fruit Company#The Great White Fleet|The Great White Fleet]], for over a century until its successor [[Chiquita Brands International]] sold the last ships in a sale with leaseback in 2007 of eight refrigerated and four container ships that transported approximately 70% of the company's bananas to North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/pc/large/united-fruit.html |title=United Fruit Company Photograph Collection, 1891–1962 |author=Baker Library—Historical Collections |publisher=Harvard University—Baker Library |date= |website= |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/05/02/2577604.htm |title=Chiquita sells remaining Great White Fleet |author=TMC News |publisher=Informa Maritime Trade and Transport |date=May 2, 2007 |website= |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time the fleet consisted of 100 refrigerated ships and was the world's largest private fleet with some being lent to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to support the attempted overthrow of the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] regime in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/778739c4-f869-11db-a940-000b5df10621.html#axzz3DTXcCoNP |title=Rotten fruit |author=Chapman, Peter |publisher=Financial Times |date=May 15, 2007 |website= |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage the term has been associated with a derogatory term for immigrants. As the main produce of the [[West Indies]] was bananas they were also used as a form of cheap transportation and the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 1959–60|English cricket team that toured the West Indies in 1959–1960]] used banana boats to travel across the Atlantic and between the islands.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} They were better known for bringing West Indian immigrants to [[Great Britain]], and to say that someone 'came off a banana boat' was a derogatory phase used by those who objected to their arrival. It fell out of use in the 1980s as by then most of the [[British African-Caribbean community]] had been born in the UK. 

The term "banana boat" is perhaps best known today in the context of [[Harry Belafonte]]'s 1956 song [[The Banana Boat Song]] (Day-O).

'''Basudeb Dasgupta'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaurab.com/english/bengali_poetry/Hungry-Generation/&lt;/ref&gt; (31 December 1938&amp;nbsp;– 31 August 2005), a Bengali novelist and short-story writer (associated with the [[Hungry generation]] movement), is considered as one of the most significant [[avant-garde]]s and controversial figures in the history of [[Bengali literature]].

==Early life and education==
His family came to India as refugees following the partition of Bengal in 1947. He graduated with an honours in Bengali literature from the [[Scottish Church College]] in 1961, which he followed with a degree in education. Between 1965 and till his retirement in 1999, he taught in a school.

==Writings==
Basudeb's major contribution to Bengali literature spanned from the early 1960s to mid 80's. His distinct styled short stories of that span includes ''Randhanshala'' (1963), ''Ratanpur'' (1964), ''Basantoutsav'' (1964), ''Riputarito'' (1965), ''Bamanrahasya'' (1965), ''Abhiramer Chalaphera'' (1967), ''Leni Bruce O Gopal Bhandke'' (1968), ''Debotader Koyekminit'' (1971), ''Dr. Wanger Gopan Sanket'' (1972), ''Baba'' (1975), ''Durbin'' (1983).

His only collection of short-stories ''Randhanshala'' was first published in 1965 which is considered as a Hungry-classic&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blogs.ibibo.com/hungryalistclassics/hungry-generation-classics{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in 1983.

Basudeb Dasgupta published his first novel titled ''Utpat'' in 1962 in Upadruto journal and the second one ''Kheladhula''
(probably the most significant one) in 1981 in Dandashuk journal.

Thereafter Basudeb wrote a few short stories such as ''Bondi Bastabata'' (1986), ''Mrityuguha Thekey'' (in two installments in 1986 and 1987), ''Shesh Praharer Abhijan'' (1987), ''Eso'' (1990) and ''Mouno Nagarir Itikatha'' (in two installments in 1995 and 1996), but he had lost the previous magical charm of his prose style and imaginative fictional world.

'''Budukh''' or '''Budugh''' is a [[Samur languages|Samur language]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language family]] spoken in parts of the [[Quba Rayon]] of [[Azerbaijan]]. It is spoken by about 200 of approximately 1,000 ethnic [[Budukh people|Budukhs]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Budukh is a severely [[endangered language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/chris.html Published in: Encyclopedia of the world’s endangered languages. Edited by Christopher Moseley. London &amp; New York: Routledge, 2007. 211–280.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slsoBudukh"&gt;[http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-013.pdf The sociolinguistic situation of the Budukh in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; and classified as such by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=February 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNESCO Endangered Language Criteria: 1. Vulnerable, 2. Definitely Endangered, 3. Severely Endangered, 4. Critically Endangered, 5. Extinct--&gt;

== Grammar ==
=== Gender and agreement ===
Authier (2010) reports that Budugh has six 'gender-number' classes: 
*human masculine,
*human adult feminine,
*animate (which includes animals, plants, and non-adult human females, as well as some abstract nouns),
*inanimate,
*nonhuman plural,
*human plural.

Verbs normally agree with their [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] argument (intransitive subject or transitive object) in gender.  In the following examples, the verb 'beat' shows animate agreement with 'donkey' and non-human plural agreement with 'donkeys'.

{|
|-
|Ma'lla'-cır
|lem
|ğùvotu-ri
|-
|Mullah-erg
|donkey
|animate:beat:present
|-
|colspan='3'| 'Mullah beat the donkey'
|}

{|
|-
|Ma'lla'-cır
|lemér
|ğùtu-ri
|-
|Mullah-erg
|donkey
|nonhumanplural:beat:present
|-
|colspan='3'| 'Mullah beat the donkeys'
|}

Compare these examples with the following, where the verb agrees with the intransitive subject:

{|
|-
|Ma'lla'
|vìxhici
|-
|Mullah
|masculine:go:narrative_tense
|-
|colspan='3'| 'Mullah went.'
|}

{|
|-
|Lem
|vüxhücü
|-
|donkey
|animate:go:narrative_tense
|-
|colspan='3'| 'The donkey went.'
|}

=== Verb agreement ===
Budukh verbs typically agree with a single argument, the absolutive.  In the agreement paradigms, the majority of verbs show no overt agreement for the masculine, neuter, and nonhuman plural.  Consider the following paradigm for the verb 'keep' in the perfective (Authier 2009):

{|class="wikitable"
|M/N/NPL||ˤa-q-a
|-
|F||ˤa-ra-q-a
|-
|A||ˤa-va-q-a
|-
|HPL||ˤa-ba-q-a
|}
 
In this paradigm, /ˤa/ is a preverb which must appear with the verb root /q/ 'keep', and the agreement morphology appears between the preverb and the root. Due to historical changes, the relationships between the various members of an agreement paradigm are often more complex and show changes of vowel and/or consonant.  The following perfective paradigm for 'go' shows this (with the reconstructed form shown after the *)

{|class="wikitable"
|M||vi-xhi
|-
|F||v-r-xhi
|-
|A||vüxhü &lt; *vi-v-xhi
|-
|N/NPL||vidki &lt; *vi-d-xhi
|-
|HPL||vibki &lt; *vi-b-xhi
|}

=== Word order ===
Budukh is an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language, as seen in the following example:

{|
|-
|Ma'lla'-cır
|lemér
|ğùtu-ri
|-
|Mullah-erg
|donkey
|nonhuman plural:beat:present
|-
|colspan='3'| 'Mullah beat the donkeys'
|}

It has possessors before possessed nouns:

{|
|-
|Mallá-co
|rij
|-
|Mullah-adlocative
|daughter
|-
|colspan='3'| 'the mullah's daughter'
|}

Adjectives appear before the nouns that they modify:

{|
|-
|q'usú
|Mallá'
|-
|old
|mullah
|-
|colspan='3'| 'the old mullah'
|}

Caoch Cise was a member of the [[Ó Chlúmháin]] family of [[Connacht]]. [[Lambert McKenna]] ascribes to him poem XVII in ''[[Leabhar Méig Shamhradháin]]'', which praises [[Niall Mág Shamhradháin]] and his wife, [[Sadhbh Ní Conchobhair]]. The poem credits them with maintaining many poets and bards, also stating that ''the prince gets none of his princely renown without a princely portion accruing to Sadhbh.''

'''Comparatio''' in [[Classical rhetoric]] is strategy that uses ''comparison'' to persuade people. Comparatio relies upon people's [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about a phenomenon, and then discursively "links" that phenomenon to a different phenomenon about which the speaker/writer wishes to make a claim.

For example, if someone wanted to persuade an audience of the merit of putting in a new freeway system, they could use comparatio as a rhetorical strategy. They might compare the new freeway system to a "river of life flowing through our community" or they could call it a "path to commercial vibrance."

Comparisons can also be made to phenomena about which an audience could be expected to have negative feelings. For example, if you were opposed to the new freeway because of the environmental damage it would do to waterfowl nesting areas, you might compare the new freeway to "a corridor of death for our bird species."

The rhetorical success of comparatio hinges upon comparing your claim to a phenomenon that is:
*familiar to the audience
*likely to evoke emotional feelings
*adequately similar to your claim to seem logical.

It would not, for example, work well to call the freeway a "ham sandwich lodged in the throat of the community." The freeway seems more logically related to the throat (a passageway or throughway) than an obstacle in that passageway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4204">{{Other uses|Negligence}}
'''Comparative negligence''', or non-absolute [[contributory negligence]] outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the [[plaintiff]]'s negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Victor E.|title=Strict Liability and Comparative Negligence|journal=Tennessee Law Review|date=1974|volume=42|page=171|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/tenn42&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Explanation ==
Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called "pure" comparative negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooter|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|title=An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1986|volume=61|page=1067|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)

The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called "modified" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only" if the plaintiff's negligence is "not greater than" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).

The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only if" the plaintiff's negligence is "not as great as" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.

== Contributory negligence doctrine ==
Some states, though, still use the [[contributory negligence]] doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, [[Alabama]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] continue to use contributory negligence.

Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with [[joint and several liability]], which generally holds each of two or more culpable [[defendants]] responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

In [[linguistics]], '''determinatum''' (from the [[Latin]] ''determinare'', ''to fix the limits of something'') is a [[part of speech]] that is modified by another part of speech. In the [[noun phrase]] ''noun phrase'', for example, ''phrase'' is the ''determinatum'', and ''noun'' is the [[determinans]] or modifier. The ''determinatum'' is often referred to as the [[head (linguistics)|head]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27841">In mathematics, '''Thurston's geometrization conjecture''' states that certain three-dimensional [[topological space]]s each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the [[uniformization theorem]] for two-dimensional [[surface (topology)|surface]]s, which states that every [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[Riemann surface]] can be given one of three geometries ([[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[Spherical geometry|spherical]], or [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]]).
In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure.  The conjecture was proposed by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=William Thurston|first=William|last= Thurston|year= 1982}}, and implies several other conjectures, such as the [[Poincaré conjecture]] and Thurston's [[elliptization conjecture]].

Thurston's  [[hyperbolization theorem]] implies that [[Haken manifold]]s satisfy the  geometrization conjecture.  Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s and since then several complete proofs have appeared in print.

[[Grigori Perelman]] sketched a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 using [[Ricci flow]] with [[Surgery theory|surgery]].
There are now several different manuscripts (see below) with details of the proof. The Poincaré conjecture and the [[spherical space form conjecture]] are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.

==The conjecture==
A 3-manifold is called '''closed''' if it is [[compact space|compact]] and has no [[Manifold#Manifold with boundary|boundary]].

Every closed 3-manifold has a [[prime decomposition (3-manifold)|prime decomposition]]: this means it is the [[connected sum]] of prime 3-manifolds (this decomposition is  essentially unique except for a small problem in the case of  [[Orientability#Orientability of manifolds|non-orientable manifolds]]). This reduces much of the study of 3-manifolds to the case of prime 3-manifolds: those that cannot be written as a non-trivial connected sum.

Here is a statement of Thurston's conjecture:

:Every oriented prime closed [[3-manifold]] can be cut along tori, so that the interior of each of the resulting manifolds has a geometric structure with finite volume.

There are 8 possible geometric structures in 3 dimensions, described in the next section. There is a unique minimal way of cutting an irreducible oriented 3-manifold along tori into pieces that are [[Seifert manifold]]s or [[atoroidal]]  called the [[JSJ decomposition]], which is not quite the same as the decomposition in the geometrization conjecture, because some of the pieces in the JSJ decomposition might not have finite volume geometric structures. (For example, the mapping torus of an [[Anosov map]] of a torus has a finite volume solv structure, but its JSJ decomposition cuts it open along one torus to produce a product of a torus and a unit interval, and the interior of this has no finite volume geometric structure.)

For non-oriented manifolds the easiest way to state a geometrization conjecture is to first take the [[Orientable double cover|oriented double cover]]. It is also possible to work directly with non-orientable manifolds, but this gives some extra complications: it may be necessary to cut along projective planes and Klein bottles as well as spheres and tori, and manifolds with a projective plane boundary component usually have no geometric structure.

In 2 dimensions the analogous statement  says that every  surface (without boundary) has a geometric structure consisting of a metric with constant curvature; it is not necessary to cut the manifold up first.

==The eight Thurston geometries==
A '''model geometry''' is a simply connected smooth manifold ''X'' together with a transitive action of a [[Lie group]] ''G'' on ''X'' with compact stabilizers.

A model geometry is called '''maximal''' if ''G'' is maximal among groups acting smoothly and transitively on ''X'' with compact stabilizers. Sometimes this condition is included in the definition of a model geometry.

A '''geometric structure''' on a manifold  ''M'' is a diffeomorphism from ''M'' to  ''X''/Γ for some model geometry ''X'', where Γ is a discrete subgroup of ''G'' acting freely on ''X'' ; this is a special case of a complete [[(G,X)-structure]]. If a given manifold admits a geometric structure, then it admits one whose model is maximal.

A 3-dimensional model geometry ''X'' is relevant to the geometrization conjecture if it is maximal  and if there is at least one compact manifold with a geometric structure modelled on ''X''. Thurston classified the 8 model geometries satisfying these conditions; they are listed below and are sometimes called '''Thurston geometries'''. (There are also uncountably many model geometries without compact quotients.)

There is some connection with the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi groups]]: the 3-dimensional Lie groups. Most Thurston geometries can be realized as a left invariant metric on a Bianchi group. However  [[2-sphere|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] × '''R''' cannot be, Euclidean space corresponds to two different Bianchi groups, and there are an uncountable number of solvable non-unimodular Bianchi groups, most of which give model geometries with no compact representatives.

===Spherical geometry S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
The point stabilizer is O(3, '''R'''), and the group ''G'' is the 6-dimensional Lie group O(4, '''R'''), with 2 components. The corresponding manifolds are exactly the closed 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group. Examples include the [[3-sphere]], the [[Poincaré homology sphere]], [[Lens space]]s.  This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type IX]]. Manifolds with this geometry are all compact, orientable, and have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]] (often in several ways). The complete list of such manifolds is given in the article on [[Spherical 3-manifold]]s. Under Ricci flow manifolds with this geometry  collapse to a point in finite time.

===Euclidean geometry ''E''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
The point stabilizer is O(3, '''R'''), and the group ''G'' is the 6-dimensional Lie group '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × O(3, '''R'''), with 2 components. Examples are the [[three-torus|3-torus]], and more generally the [[mapping torus]]  of a finite order automorphism of the 2-torus; see [[torus bundle]]. There are exactly 10 finite closed 3-manifolds with this geometry, 6 orientable and 4 non-orientable. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi groups of type I or VII&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are all compact,  and have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]] (sometimes in two ways). The complete list of such manifolds is given in the article on [[Seifert fiber space]]s. Under Ricci flow manifolds with Euclidean  geometry  remain invariant.

===Hyperbolic geometry H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
The point stabilizer is O(3, '''R'''), and the group ''G'' is the 6-dimensional Lie group O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1, 3, '''R'''), with 2 components. There are enormous numbers of examples of these, and their classification is not completely understood. The example with smallest volume is the [[Weeks manifold]]. Other examples are given by the [[Seifert–Weber space]], or "sufficiently complicated" [[Dehn surgery|Dehn surgeries]] on links, or most [[Haken manifold]]s. The geometrization conjecture implies that a closed 3-manifold is hyperbolic if and only if it is irreducible, [[atoroidal]], and has infinite fundamental group. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type V]]. Under Ricci flow manifolds with hyperbolic  geometry expand.

===The geometry of S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × R===
The point stabilizer is O(2, '''R''') × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', and the group ''G'' is O(3, '''R''') × '''R''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', with 4 components.  The four finite volume manifolds with this geometry are: '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the mapping torus of  the antipode map of '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the connected sum of two copies of 3-dimensional projective space, and the product of '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with two-dimensional projective space. The first two are mapping tori of  the identity map and antipode map of the 2-sphere, and are the only examples of 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible. The third is the only example of a non-trivial connected sum with a geometric structure. This is the only model geometry that cannot be realized as a left invariant metric on a 3-dimensional Lie group. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are all compact and have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]] (often in several ways). Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this  geometry converge to a 1-dimensional manifold.

===The geometry of H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × R===
The point stabilizer is O(2, '''R''') × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', and the group ''G'' is O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1, 2, '''R''') × '''R''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', with 4 components. Examples include the product of a [[hyperbolic surface]] with a circle, or more generally the mapping torus of an isometry of a hyperbolic surface. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry  have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]] if they are orientable. (If they are not orientable the natural fibration by circles is not necessarily a Seifert fibration: the problem is that some fibers may "reverse orientation";  in other words their neighborhoods look like fibered solid Klein bottles rather than solid tori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ronald |last=Fintushel |title=Local S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; actions on 3-manifolds |journal=[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]] |volume=66 |number=1 |year=1976 |pages=111–118 |url=http://msp.org/pjm/1976/66-1/p12.xhtml | doi=10.2140/pjm.1976.66.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The classification of such (oriented) manifolds is given in the article on [[Seifert fiber space]]s. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type III]]. Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this  geometry converge to a 2-dimensional manifold.

===The geometry of the universal cover of SL(2, R)===
The [[universal cover]] of [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is denoted &lt;math&gt;{\widetilde{\rm{SL}}}(2, \mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;.  It fibers over '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The group ''G'' has 2 components. Its identity component has the structure &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{R}\times\widetilde{\rm{SL}}_2 (\mathbf{R}))/\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  The point stabilizer is O(2,'''R''').

Examples of these manifolds include: the manifold of unit vectors of the tangent bundle of a hyperbolic surface, and more generally the [[homology sphere|Brieskorn homology spheres]] (excepting the 3-sphere and the [[Poincare dodecahedral space]]). This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type VIII]]. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry  are orientable and have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]]. The classification of such manifolds is given in the article on [[Seifert fiber space]]s. Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this geometry converge to a 2-dimensional manifold.

===Nil geometry===
{{see also|Nilmanifold}}

This fibers over ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is the geometry of the [[Heisenberg group]]. The point stabilizer is O(2, '''R'''). The group ''G'' has 2 components, and is a semidirect product of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group by the group O(2, '''R''') of isometries of a circle. Compact manifolds with this geometry include the mapping torus of  a [[Dehn twist]] of a 2-torus, or the quotient of the Heisenberg group by the "integral Heisenberg group". This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type II]]. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry  are compact and orientable and have the structure of a [[Seifert fiber space]]. The classification of such manifolds is given in the article on [[Seifert fiber space]]s. Under normalized Ricci flow, compact manifolds with this  geometry converge to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the flat metric.

===Solv geometry===
{{see also|Solvmanifold}}

This geometry fibers over the line with fiber the plane, and is the geometry of the identity component of the group ''G''. The point stabilizer is the dihedral group of order 8. The group  ''G'' has  8 components, and is the group of maps from 2-dimensional Minkowski space to itself that are either isometries or multiply the metric by −1. The identity component  has a normal subgroup '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with quotient '''R''', where '''R''' acts on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 2 (real) eigenspaces, with distinct real  eigenvalues of product 1. This is the  [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group of type VI&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] and the geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on this group. All finite volume manifolds with solv geometry are compact. The compact  manifolds with solv geometry are either the [[mapping torus]] of  an [[Anosov map]] of the 2-torus (an automorphism of the 2-torus given by an invertible 2 by 2 matrix whose eigenvalues are real and distinct, such as &lt;math&gt;\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   2 &amp; 1  \\
   1 &amp; 1  \\
\end{array}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, or quotients of these by groups of order at most 8. The eigenvalues of the automorphism of the torus generate an order of a real quadratic field, and the solv manifolds could in principle be classified in terms of the units and ideal classes of this order, though the details do not seem to be written down anywhere.
Under normalized Ricci flow compact manifolds with this  geometry converge (rather slowly) to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Uniqueness==
A closed 3-manifold has a geometric structure of at most one of the 8 types above, but finite volume non-compact 3-manifolds can occasionally have more than one type of geometric structure. (Nevertheless, a manifold can have many different geometric structures of the same type; for example, a surface of genus at least 2 has a continuum of different hyperbolic metrics.) More precisely, if ''M'' is a manifold with a finite volume geometric structure, then the type of geometric structure is almost determined as follows, in terms of the fundamental group π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M''):
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is finite then the geometric structure on ''M'' is spherical, and ''M'' is compact.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is virtually cyclic but not finite then the geometric structure on ''M'' is '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R''', and ''M'' is compact.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is virtually abelian but not virtually cyclic then the geometric structure on ''M'' is Euclidean, and ''M'' is compact.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is virtually nilpotent but not virtually abelian then the geometric structure on ''M'' is nil geometry, and ''M'' is compact.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is virtually solvable but not virtually nilpotent then the geometric structure on ''M'' is solv geometry, and ''M'' is compact.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') has an infinite normal cyclic subgroup but is not virtually solvable then the geometric structure on ''M'' is either '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R''' or the universal cover of SL(2, '''R'''). The manifold ''M'' may be either compact or non-compact. If it is compact, then the 2 geometries can be distinguished by whether or not π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') has a finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] subgroup that splits as a semidirect product of the normal cyclic subgroup and something else. If the manifold is non-compact, then the fundamental group cannot distinguish the two geometries, and there are examples (such as the complement of a trefoil knot) where a manifold may have a finite volume geometric structure of either type.
*If π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') has no infinite normal cyclic subgroup and is not virtually solvable then the geometric structure on ''M'' is hyperbolic, and ''M'' may be either compact or non-compact.

Infinite volume manifolds can have many different types of geometric structure: for example, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can have 6 of the different geometric structures listed above, as 6 of the 8 model geometries are homeomorphic to it. Moreover if the volume does not have to be finite there are an infinite number of new geometric structures with no compact models; for example, the geometry of almost any non-unimodular 3-dimensional Lie group.

There can be more than one way to decompose a closed 3-manifold into pieces with geometric structures. For example:
*Taking connected sums with several copies of '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; does not change a manifold.
*The connected sum of two projective 3-spaces has a '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R''' geometry, and is also the connected sum of two pieces with '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; geometry.
*The product of a surface negative curvature and a circle has a geometric structure, but can also be cut along tori to produce smaller pieces that also have geometric structures. There are many similar examples for Seifert fiber spaces.

It is possible to choose a "canonical" decomposition into pieces with geometric structure, for example by first cutting the manifold into prime pieces in a minimal way, then cutting these up using the smallest possible number of tori. However this minimal decomposition is not necessarily the one produced by Ricci flow; if fact, the Ricci flow can cut up a manifold into geometric pieces in many inequivalent ways, depending on the choice of initial metric.

==History==
The [[Fields Medal]] was awarded to Thurston in 1982 partially for his proof of the geometrization conjecture for [[Haken manifold]]s.

The case of 3-manifolds that should be spherical has been slower, but provided the spark needed for [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to develop his [[Ricci flow]].  In 1982, Hamilton showed that given a closed 3-manifold with a metric of positive [[Ricci curvature]], the Ricci flow would collapse the manifold to a point in finite time, which proves the geometrization conjecture for this case as the metric becomes "almost round" just before the collapse.  He later developed a program to prove the geometrization conjecture by [[Ricci flow with surgery]]. The idea is that the Ricci flow will in general produce singularities, but one may be able to continue the Ricci flow past the singularity by using surgery to change the topology of the manifold. Roughly speaking, the Ricci flow contracts positive curvature regions and expands negative curvature regions, so it should kill off the pieces of the manifold with the "positive curvature" geometries '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R''', while what is left at large times should have a [[thick-thin decomposition]] into a "thick" piece with hyperbolic geometry and a "thin" [[graph manifold]].

In 2003, [[Grigori Perelman]] sketched a proof of the geometrization conjecture by showing that the Ricci flow can indeed be continued past the singularities, and has the behavior described above.  The main difficulty in verifying Perelman's proof of the geometrization conjecture was a critical use of his Theorem 7.4 in the preprint 'Ricci Flow with surgery on three-manifolds'. This theorem was stated by Perelman without proof.  There are now several different proofs of Perelman's Theorem 7.4, or variants of it which are sufficient to prove geometrization.  There is the paper of Shioya and Yamaguchi&lt;ref&gt;T. Shioya and T. Yamaguchi, 'Volume collapsed three-manifolds with a lower curvature bound,' Math. Ann. 333 (2005), no. 1, 131–155.&lt;/ref&gt; that uses Perelman's stability theorem&lt;ref&gt;V. Kapovitch, 'Perelman's Stability Theorem', in Surveys of Differential Geometry, Metric and Comparison Geometry, vol. XI, International press, (2007), 103–136. There is a preprint on https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703002v3&lt;/ref&gt; and a fibration theorem for Alexandrov spaces.&lt;ref&gt;T. Yamaguchi. A convergence theorem in the geometry of Alexandrov spaces. In Actes de la Table Ronde de Geometrie Differentielle (Luminy, 1992), volume 1 of Semin. Congr., pages 601–642. Soc. math. France, Paris, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This method, with full details leading to the proof of geometrization, can be found in the exposition by [[Bruce Kleiner]] and [[John Lott (mathematician) | John Lott]] in 'Notes on Perelman's papers' in the journal Geometry &amp; Topology.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kleiner and J. Lott, 'Notes on Perelman's papers', Geometry &amp; Topology, volume 12, pp. 2587–2855, 2008. There is a preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605667v3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Henry Weideman''' (2 July 1947 – 27 August 2008) was a [[South Africa]]n [[poet]] and [[writer]].  Born in [[Cradock, Eastern Cape]], he grew up between the [[Karoo]] of the Eastern Cape and the [[Northern Cape]].  He matriculated from Namakwaland High School in [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]].

At the age of nine, he was already interested in learning languages like [[Magyar language|Magyar]] (spoken in [[Hungary]]) and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and by the age of thirteen he was already running the school newspaper.

In June 1966, as a second-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] student at the [[University of Pretoria]], he published his first collection of poetry entitled ''"Hondegaloppie"'' (lit. "dog gallop"), which contained verses about the Karoo, [[Bushmanland, Northern Cape|Boesmanland]] and [[Namaqualand]].  ''"As die son kliplangs spring"'', published three years later, also contains material that is mostly about the landscape and nostalgia.

In 1970, while he was teaching in [[Fraserburg]], he published ''"Klein manifes van ’n reisiger"'' ("Little manifest of a traveller"), and in 1977, while teaching in [[Port Elizabeth]], he published ''"Hoera, hoera die ysman"'' ("Hooray, hooray the iceman").  Poetry about love was included in these two:  he married Celién Nel from Fraserburg in 1973 while he was staying in Kenhardt.  They have two daughters, Melita and Siobhan.

While staying in [[South-West Africa]] from 1978 until 1989, George completed his [[doctorate]] and published his first collection of short stories, ''"Tuin van klip en vuur"'' ("Garden of stone and fire"), as well as releasing another poetry collection, ''"Uit hierdie grys verblyf"'' ("From this grey existence").  Three of his dramas was performed by the [[University of Namibia]].

His first book aimed at the youth, ''"Los my uit, paloekas!"'', received the silver Sanlam Prize in 1992, and ''"Die optog van die aftjoppers"'' received gold in 1994.  The latter also received the highly acclaimed Scheepers Prize in 1995, as well as a nomination by the Children's Book Forum as IBBY Honour Book for the International Board on Books for Young People.

In 1994 his second collection of short stories appeared, entitled ''"Die donker melk van daeraad"''.

In 1997 he published '''n Staning onder sterre'', a collection of poetry; ''Nuwe stemme'', an omnibus of the works of eleven debut poets, which George arranged; and his first adult novel, ''Die onderskepper'' ("The Interceptor"), about a mysterious woman from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1998 ''"Pella lê ’n kruistog vêr"'', a selection from his previous collections, was published, as well as a youth novel, ''"Dana se jaar duisend"'', which again won the Sanlam prize for Youth literature.

The novel ''"Draaijakkals"'' was published in October 1999.

His radio drama, ''"Lig"'', won the third place in the [[Radio Sonder Grense|RSG]] competition for 2000/2001.

Until his retirement, George was a lecturer at the [[Peninsula Technikon]], now part of the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]].

On 17 July 2004 he received the first Sanlam prize for Afrikaans theatre.

After a long struggle against cancer, Weideman died on 27 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Life ==

He was originally from Arbela and lived during the time of the Mongol invasions.

== Works ==
Warda was a significant poet of the [[Syriac literature|Syriac]] renaissance of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a number of whose poems were incorporated into the liturgy of the [[Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilhelm Baum |authorlink= |title=The Church of the East: A Concise History |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location= |pages=164 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 |isbn=9781134430192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is mainly spoken in  [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]], [[Punjab India|Punjab]], [[Delhi]] and other parts of [[India]]. The language is also spoken by [[Gujjar]]s across [[Pakistan]], including the [[Azad Kashmir]] and the [[Hazara region]]. In [[Pakistan]] organisations and institutions work for the development of Gujari, including a Gujari-language news channel. The government of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] has recognized Gujari y including it in the sixth schedule of the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt; In Jammu and Kashmir, Gujari is written right-to-left in an extension of the Persian alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet. Gujari is associated with the Nastaʿlīq style of Persian calligraphy - http://jktribals.page.tl/Gojri-Language.htm, http://www.merinews.com/article/writers-in-jk-seek-constitutional-safeguards-for-gojri/129813.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary traditions ==
{{unsourced section |date= October 2018}}
Gujari folklore includes songs, ballads and folktales, known as Dastans. Hundreds of folk songs have been recorded and published, including "Nooro", "Tajo", "Nura Beguma", "Shupiya", "Kunjhdi", "Mariyan".

A modern tradition of creative writing encompasses poets such as Sain Qadar Baksh, Noon Poonchi, and others. Others such as Mian Nizam ud Din, Khuda Baksh Zar, Zabai Rajouri, Shams ud Din Mehjoor Poonchi, [[Mian Bashir Ahmed]], [[Javaid Rahi]], [[Rafiq Anjum]] Milki Ram Kushan, Sarwari Kassana, Naseem Poonchi have also made remarkable contributions to Gujari through poetry, prose and criticism.

== Institutions and media ==
{{unsourced section |date= October 2018}}

[[All India Radio]] and Doordarshan Kendra run various Gujari programmes. [[Radio Kashmir Jammu]], Srinagar, [[Poonch]] in India and Seven Radio Stations of Pakistan and PTV air Gojri programmes and news bulletins accepted across Jammu and Kashmir. Books have been published in Gujarati, including encyclopedias, poetry, fiction and non-fiction, on topics including dictionaries, grammars, nature, folklore, art and architecture, agriculture, sociology and research.

The National Academy of Letters, [[Sahitya Akademi]], recognized Gujari as one of the major Indian languages for its National Award, Bhasha Samman, and other programmes. The Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Arts, Culture and Languages established a Gujari Department in its Central Office in the 1970s and published in Gujari. They organized seminars, conferences, etc. for the development of the Gujarati Language. Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education made curriculum in Gujari up to Middle Standard for Teaching Gujari in Schools. The University of Jammu Council approved the opening of Gojri Research Centre in Jammu and University of Kashmir that have been awarded Doctorate Degrees on completing research projects on the language. In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the GoGujari RI Academy has been established and Post Graduate Studies Department were set up in various Universities and Regional Research Centers.

'''Gulbadan [[Begum]]''' ({{circa}} 1523 &amp;ndash; 7 February 1603) was a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal princess]] and the youngest daughter of Emperor [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] and the first [[Mughal emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aftab|first1=Tahera|title=Inscribing South Asian Muslim women : an annotated bibliography &amp; research guide|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158498|page=8|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known as the author of ''Humayun-Nama'', the account of the life of her half-brother, Emperor [[Humayun]], which she wrote on the request of her nephew, Emperor [[Akbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faruqui|first1=Munis D.|title=Princes of the Mughal Empire, 1504-1719|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107022171|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gulbadan Begum ("Princess Rose-Body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruggles|first1=D. Fairchild (ed.) |authorlink=D. Fairchild Ruggles |title=Women, patronage, and self-representation in Islamic societies|date=2000|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=9780791444696|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; was about eight years old at the time of her father's death in 1530 and was brought up by her older half-brother, Humayun. She grew up to be a highly educated and well-cultured lady and was married to a Chagatai Mughal noble, Khizr Khwaja Khan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balabanlilar|first1=Lisa|title=Imperial Identity in the Mughal Empire: Memory and Dynastic Politics in Early Modern South and Central Asia|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857732460|page=8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of seventeen. She enjoyed a very happy and prosperous family life and stayed most of the time at [[Kabul]] when, in 1557, she was invited by her nephew, Akbar, to join the imperial household at [[Agra]]. She wielded great influence and respect in the imperial household and was much loved both by Akbar and his mother, [[Hamida Banu Begum|Hamida]]. She died in 1603.

Gulbadan recorded her reminiscences in the form of a book, entitled, ''Humayun-Nama'' on a request of Akbar. Gulbadan's recollection of Babur are very brief albeit she gives a refreshing account of Humayun's household and provides a rare material regarding his confrontation with her half-brother, [[Kamran Mirza]]. She records the fratricidal conflict between her brothers with a sense of grief.    

Gulbadan Begum finds reference throughout the ''[[Akbarnama]]'' ("Book of Akbar") written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and much of her biographical details are accessible through the work.

==Early life==
Her name means literally "with a body like a rose flower" in [[Persian language|Persian]]. When Princess Gulbadan was born in {{circa}} 1523 to Dildar Begum, her father, Babur, had been lord in [[Kabul]] for 19 years; he was master also in [[Kunduz]] and [[Badakhshan]], had held [[Bajaur]] and Swat since 1519, and [[Kandahar]] for a year. During 10 of those 19 years he had been styled ''[[Padshah]]'', in token of headship of the [[Timurid dynasty|House of Timur]] and of his independent sovereignty. Two years later Babur set out on his last expedition across the [[Indus]] to conquer an empire in [[India]]. Gulbadan Begum was brought to India at the age of six, was married at 17 to Khizr Khwaja, a [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], and had at least one son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.infionline.net/~ddisse/gulbadan.html Gulbadan..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511165048/http://home.infionline.net/~ddisse/gulbadan.html |date=11 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulbadan's siblings included her older brother, [[Hindal Mirza]], and two other sisters, Gulrang Begum and [[Gulchehra Begum]], while her younger brother Alwar Mirza, died in his childhood. Among her siblings, Gulbadan was very close to her brother, Hindal Mirza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie|title=The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, Art and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humayun and his sister ===
In 1540 [[Humayun]] lost the kingdom that his father Babur had established in India to [[Sher Shah Suri]], an upstart from [[Bihar]]. With only his pregnant wife(Hamida Banu Begum, one female attendant and a few loyal supporters, Humayun first fled to [[Lahore]], and then later to Kabul. He was in exile for the next fifteen years in present-day [[Afghanistan]] and [[Persia]]. Gulbadan Begum went to live in Kabul again. Her life, like all the other Mughal women of the [[Mughal Harem|harem]], was intricately intertwined with three Mughal kings – her father Babur, brother Humayun and nephew [[Akbar]]. Two years after Humayun re-established the Delhi Empire, she accompanied other Mughal women of the harem back to [[Agra]] at the behest of Akbar, who had begun his rule.

== Writing of ''Humayun Nama'' ==
Akbar commissioned Gulbadan Begum to chronicle the story of his father ''Humayun''. He was fond of his aunt and knew of her storytelling skills. It was fashionable for the Mughals to engage writers to document their own reigns (Akbar's own history, ''[[Akbarnama]]'', was written by the well-known Persian scholar [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]]). Akbar asked his aunt to write whatever she remembered about her brother's life. Gulbadan Begum took the challenge and produced a document titled ''Ahwal Humayun Padshah Jamah Kardom Gulbadan Begum bint Babur Padshah amma Akbar Padshah''. It came to be known as ''[[Humayun-nama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/gulbadan/index.html The Humayun Namah, by Gulbadan Begam, a study site by Deanna Ramsay&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gulbadan wrote in simple Persian without the erudite language used by better-known writers. Her father Babur had written ''Babur-nama'' in the same style and she took his cue and wrote from her memories. Unlike some of her contemporary writers, Gulbadan wrote a factual account of what she remembered, without embellishment. What she produced not only chronicles the trials and tribulations of Humayun's rule, but also gives us a glimpse of life in the Mughal [[harem]]. It is the only surviving writing penned by a woman of Mughal royalty in the 16th century.

The memoir had been lost for several centuries and what has been found is not well preserved, poorly bound with many pages missing. It also appears to be incomplete, with the last chapters missing. There must have been very few copies of the manuscript, and for this reason it did not receive the recognition it deserved.'''
'''

== Translation of  ''Humayun Nama'' ==
A battered copy of the manuscript is kept in the [[British Library]]. Originally found by an Englishman, Colonel [[G. W. Hamilton]]. it was sold to the British Museum by his widow in 1868. Its existence was little known until 1901, when [[Annette Akroyd|Annette S. Beveridge]] translated it into English (Beveridge affectionately called her '''Princess Rosebud''').&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Annette Susannah|title=Life and writings of Gulbadan Begam (Lady Rosebody)|date=1898|location=Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewritingsofgu00beve|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begam|first1=Gulbaden|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The history of Humāyūn (Humāyūn-nāma)|date=1902|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhumynhum00bevegoog|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Dr. Rieu called it one of the most remarkable manuscripts in the collection of Colonel Hamilton (who had collected more than 1,000 manuscripts). A paperback edition of Beveridge's English translation was published in India in 2001.

Pradosh Chattopadhyay translated ''Humayun Nama'' into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in 2006 and Chirayata Prokashan published the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|81-85696-66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the document==
Upon being entrusted with the directive by Akbar to write the manuscript, Gulbadan Begum begins thus: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There had been an order issued, ‘Write down whatever you know of the doings of Firdous-Makani (Babur) and Jannat-Ashyani (Humayun)’. At this time when his Majesty Firdaus-Makani passed from this perishable world to the everlasting home, I, this lowly one, was eight years old, so it may well be that I do not remember much. However in obedience to the royal command, I set down whatever there is that I have heard and remember.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From her account we know that Gulbadan was married by the age of 17 to Khizr Khwaja, a [[Chagatai people|Chagatai]] Mughal by ancestry on his mother's side and from the [[Khwajgan (Khwaja Khel)|Khwajgan]] Sayyid rulers of Bukhara on his father's side. She had at least one son. She had moved to [[Delhi]]/[[Agra]] in 1528 from Kabul with one of her stepmothers, who was allowed to adopt her as her own on the command of her father the Emperor. After the defeat of Humayun in 1540 she moved back to Kabul to live with one of her half-brothers. She did not return to Agra immediately after Humayun won back his kingdom. Instead, she stayed behind in Kabul until she was brought back to Agra by Akbar, two years after Humayun died in a tragic accident in 1556. Gulbadan Begum lived in Agra and then in Sikri for a short while but mostly in Lahore or with the Court for the rest of her life, except for a period of seven years when she undertook a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. The Mughal Court even up to the early years of [[Shah Jahan]]'s reign was never a confined thing but a travelling grand encampment and there is no doubt that Gulbadan Banu Begum like most Mughal ladies hated the confines living in buildings and no doubt wholeheartedly agreed with the verses of [[Jahanara Begum]], the daughter of Shah Jahan, that the rot of the empire would set in when the Mughals confine themselves to closed houses.

She appears to have been an educated, pious, and cultured woman of royalty. She was fond of reading and she had enjoyed the confidences of both her brother Humayun and nephew Akbar. From her account it is also apparent that she was an astute observer, well-versed with the intricacies of warfare, and the intrigues of royal deal making. The first part of her story deals with Humayun's rule after her father's death and the travails of Humayun after his defeat. She had written little about her father Babur, as she was only aged eight when he died. However, there are anecdotes and stories she had heard about him from her companions in the Mahal (harem) that she included in her account. The latter part also deals with life in the Mughal harem.

She recorded one light-hearted incident about Babur. He had minted a large gold coin, as he was fond of doing, after he established his kingdom in India. This heavy gold coin was sent to Kabul, with special instructions to play a practical joke on the court jester Asas, who had stayed behind in Kabul. Asas was to be blindfolded and the coin was to be hung around his neck. Asas was intrigued and worried about the heavy weight around his neck, not knowing what it was. However, when he realised that it was a gold coin, Asas jumped with joy and pranced around the room, repeatedly saying that no one shall ever take it from him.

Gulbadan Begum describes her father's death when her brother had fallen ill at the age of 22. She tells that Babur was depressed to see his son seriously ill and dying. For four days he circumambulated the bed of his son repeatedly, praying to [[Allah]], begging to be taken to the eternal world in his son's place. As if by miracle, his prayers were answered. The son recovered and the 47-year-old father died soon after.

Soon after his exile, Humayun had seen and fallen in love with a 13-year-old girl named [[Hamida Banu Begum|Hamida Banu]] the niece of Shah Husain Mirza. At first she refused to come to see the Emperor, who was much older than her. Finally she was advised by the other women of the harem to reconsider, and she consented to marry the Emperor. Two years later, in 1542, she bore Humayun a son named Akbar, the greatest of the Mughal rulers. Gulbadan Begum described the details of this incident and the marriage of Humayun and Hamida Banu with glee, and a hint of mischievousness in her manuscript.

Gulbadan also recorded the nomadic life style of Mughal women. Her younger days were spent in the typical style of the peripatetic Mughal family, wandering between Kabul, Agra and Lahore. During Humayun's exile the problem was further exaggerated. She had to live in Kabul with one of her step brothers, who later tried to recruit her husband to join him against Humayun. Gulbadan Begum persuaded her husband not to do so. He, however, did so during her nephew's reign and, along with his son, was defeated and was expelled from court and from her presence for the rest of his life. He was not even allowed to be buried next to her. His grave is in one corner of the main quadrangle in which she is buried.

== Pilgrimage to Mecca ==
Gulbadan Begum described in her memoir a pilgrimage she along with Hamida Banu Begum undertook to Mecca, a distance of 3,000 miles, crossing treacherous mountains and hostile deserts. Though they were of royal birth, the women of the harem were hardy and prepared to face hardships, especially since their lives were so intimately intertwined with the men and their fortunes. Gulbadan Begum stayed in Mecca for nearly four years and during her return a shipwreck in [[Aden]] kept her from returning to Agra for several months. She finally returned in 1582, seven years after she had set forth on her journey.

Akbar had provided for safe passage of his aunt on her [[Hajj]] and sent a noble as escort with several ladies in attendance. Lavish gifts were packed with her entourage that could be used as alms. Her arrival in Mecca caused quite a stir and people from as far as [[Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] swarmed to Mecca to get a share of the bounty.

If Gulbadan Begum wrote about the death of Humayun, when he tumbled down the steps in [[Purana Qila]] in Delhi, it has been lost. The manuscript seems to end abruptly in the year 1552, four years before the death of Humayun. It ends in mid-sentence, describing the blinding of [[Kamran Mirza]]. As we know that Gulbadan Begum had received the directive to write the story of Humayun's rule by Akbar, long after the death of Humayun, it is reasonable to believe that the only available manuscript is an incomplete version of her writing. It is also believed that Akbar asked his aunt to write down from her memory so that [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]] could use the information in his own writings about the Emperor Akbar.

==Old age and death==
When she was 70, her name is mentioned with that of Muhammad-yar, a son of her daughter, who left the court in disgrace; again, she and Salima join in intercession to Akbar for Prince Salim; again, with Hamida, she receives royal gifts of money and jewels.

Her charities were large, and it is said of her that she added day unto day in the endeavour to please God, and this by succouring the poor and needy.

When she was 80, in February 1603, her departure was heralded by a few days of fever. Hamida was with her to the end, and it may be that [[Ruqaiya Sultan Begum|Ruqaiya]], Hindal's daughter, also watched her last hours. As she lay with closed eyes, Hamida Banu Begum spoke to her by the long-used name of affection, "Jiu!" (live or May you Live). There was no response. Then, "Gul-badan!" The dying woman opened her eyes, quoted the verse, "I die—may you live!" and died.

Akbar helped to carry her bier some distance, and for her soul's repose made lavish gifts and did good works. He will have joined in the silent prayer for her soul before committal of her body to the earth, and if no son were there, he, as a near kinsman, may have answered the Imam's injunction to resignation: "It is the will of God."

It is said that for the two years after her death, Akbar lamented constantly that he missed his favourite aunt, until his own death in 1605.

Gulbadan was also said to have been a poet, fluent in both Persian and Turkish. None of her poems have survived. However, there are references to two verses and a quaseeda written by her by the Emperor [[Bahadur Shah II|Bhadur Shah Zafar]] in his collection of verses as well as some references by [[Mir Taqi Mir]]. It is unfortunate that a large collection of imperial Mughal archival material which had found its way to [[Lukhnow]] was destroyed by the [[Frangistan|Farangis]] to impose and lend substance to the myth of centuries of foreign rule over Hindustan instead of the ninety years which was actually endured.

For much of history the manuscript of Gulbadan Begum remained in obscurity. There is little mention of it in contemporary literature of other Mughal writers, especially the authors who chronicled Akbar’s rule. Yet, the little-known account of Gulbadan Begum is an important document for historians, with its window into a woman’s perspective from inside the Mughal harem.

==In popular culture==
*Gulbadan Begum is a prinicpal character in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Enchantress of Florence]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salman|title=Enchantress of Florence, The|date=2008|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=1407016490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vazirov acted as Othello in a spectacle staged in Shusha, in 1904. Hashimbey Vazirov was author of such plays as “School education”, “Don’t knock my door – or your door will be knocked”, “Marrying – not slaking the thirst”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6961">'''Indexed languages''' are a class of [[formal language]]s discovered by [[Alfred Aho]];&lt;ref name="aho1968"&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Alfred Aho|Aho]] | first = Alfred | year = 1968 | title = Indexed grammars—an extension of context-free grammars | journal = [[Journal of the ACM]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 647–671 | url = http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=321488&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE,&amp;CFID=17841194&amp;CFTOKEN=70113868 | doi = 10.1145/321479.321488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are described by [[indexed grammar]]s and can be recognized by [[nested stack automata]].&lt;ref name="partee_etal_1990"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Barbara Partee| last = Partee | first = Barbara | author2 = Alice ter Meulen|author3= Robert E. Wall | title = Mathematical Methods in Linguistics | year = 1990 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | pages = 536–542 | isbn = 978-90-277-2245-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indexed languages are a [[proper subset]] of [[context-sensitive language]]s.&lt;ref name="aho1968"/&gt; They qualify as an [[abstract family of languages]] (furthermore a full AFL) and hence satisfy many closure properties. However, they are not closed under intersection or complement.&lt;ref name="aho1968" /&gt;

The class of indexed languages has {{cnspan|practical importance in [[natural language processing]] as a computationally affordable|date=August 2014}} generalization of [[context-free languages]], since [[indexed grammar]]s can describe many of the nonlocal constraints occurring in natural languages.

[[Gerald Gazdar]] (1988)&lt;ref name="gazdar1998"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Applicability of Indexed Grammars to Natural Languages | year=1988 | last=Gazdar | first=Gerald | title=Natural Language Parsing and Linguistic Theories | editor=U. Reyle and C. Rohrer | pages=69–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Vijay-Shanker (1987)&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/303610666&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a [[mildly context-sensitive language]] class now known as linear indexed grammars (LIG).&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wC0dko1L4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear indexed grammars have additional restrictions relative to IG. LIGs are [[Equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] (generate the same language class) as [[tree adjoining grammars]].&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wC0dko1L4C&amp;pg=PA32|date=16 August 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following languages are indexed, but are not [[context-free language|context-free]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \{a^n b^n c^n d^n| n \geq 1 \} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="gazdar1998"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \{a^n b^m c^n d^m | m,n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="partee_etal_1990"/&gt;

These two languages are also indexed, but are not even [[mildly context-sensitive language|mildly context sensitive]] under Gazdar's characterization:

:&lt;math&gt; \{a^{2^{n}} | n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="partee_etal_1990"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \{www | w \in \{a,b\}^+ \}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="gazdar1998"/&gt;

On the other hand, the following language is not indexed:&lt;ref name="Gilman.1996"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Gilman | first = Robert H. | title=A Shrinking Lemma for Indexed Languages| journal=Theoretical Computer Science| year=1996| volume=163| issue = 1–2  | pages=277–281| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397596002447/pdf?md5=33e62c7398fd8c6fb98f6759b154dcbd&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0304397596002447-main.pdf | doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(96)00244-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{(a b^n)^n | n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

[[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] tend to consider indexed languages as a "natural" class, since they are generated by several formalisms, such as:{{#tag:ref|Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation,&lt;ref name="hopcroft_ullman_1979"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= John Hopcroft|last = Hopcroft | first = John | author2 = Jeffrey Ullman|author2link = Jeffrey Ullman | title = [[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] | year = 1979 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-201-02988-X | page = 390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliographic notes, p.394-395}}

She was Minister of State from 1962 to 1966.&lt;ref name="WMotRS"/&gt;

Born in [[Trivandrum|Thiruvananthapuram]], she was the child of Rama Varma Thampan and Madhavikutty Amma. In 1930, she married Professor V.K.

'''Lovono''' (''Vano'', ''Alavano'', ''Alavana'') is a nearly extinct language of the island of [[Vanikoro]] in the easternmost province of the [[Solomon Islands]]. As of 2012, it is only spoken by four speakers;&lt;ref name=francois&gt;[http://alex.francois.free.fr/AF-field.htm#Solomons Homepage of the linguist A. François] ([[LACITO]]-[[CNRS]]).&lt;/ref&gt; it has been [[Language shift|replaced]] by the island’s dominant language, [[Teanu language|Teanu]].

Some information on Lovono, as well as on the other languages of the island, can be found in {{Harvcoltxt|François|2009}}.

==Name==
The language name makes reference to an ancient village in the northwest of the island [[Banie (island)|Banie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the language Lovono, which was once the dominant one in that area, the village was [[endonym|called]] ''Alavana''. In Teanu, which is now the only language spoken by the modern population, the same village is [[exonym|called]] ''Lovono''. This [[language shift]] is reflected in the people’s preference to use the Teanu form (i.e. '''Lovono''') both for the village name and for the ancient language that used to be associated with it.

The same village – and hence the language – has been also spelled ''Whanou'' or ''Vano'' in the scientific literature, possibly reflecting an older pronunciation of the word.

'''Magic words''' or '''words of power''' are words which have a specific, and sometimes unintended, effect.&lt;ref name="Lecouteux2015"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lecouteux | first=C. | title=Dictionary of Ancient Magic Words and Spells: From Abraxas to Zoar | publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-62055-375-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmAoDwAAQBAJ | access-date=27 July 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often [[nonsense]] phrases used in [[fantasy]] fiction or by [[Magic (illusion)|stage prestidigitators]]. Frequently such words are presented as being part of a [[Divine_language|divine]], [[Adamic_language|adamic]], or other [[Twilight language|secret]] or [[Language of the birds|empowered]] [[language]]. Certain [[comic book]] heroes use magic words to activate their  powers. Magic words are also used as ''[[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]]'' or [[Cheating in video games|cheats]] in computer games, other software, and [[operating system]]s. (For example, the words ''[[xyzzy (magic word)|xyzzy]]'', ''plugh'', and ''plover'' were magic words in the classic computer adventure game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''.

Craig Conley, a scholar of magic, writes that the magic words used by conjurers may originate from "pseudo-Latin phrases, nonsense syllables, or esoteric terms from religious antiquity", but that what they have in common is "language as an instrument of creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conley|first=Craig|year=2008|title=Magic Words: A Dictionary|publisher=Weiser Books|page=18|isbn=9781609250508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic words in technology==

Software like [[MediaWiki]] uses "magic words" to make system information available to templates and editors, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which displays the server time: '''{{CURRENTTIME}}''', see {{Self-reference link|Help:Magic words}}.

[[Hexspeak|Hexadecimal "words"]] used in byte code to identify a specific file or data format are known as [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]]s.

"[[The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage]]" was the solution to a challenge ciphertext posed by the inventors of the RSA cipher in 1977.

==Manners==
{{Main|Etiquette}}
The term "magic word" may also refer to the word ''[[wiktionary:please|please]]'' when used by adults to teach children [[manners]]:

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;"Gimme ketchup right now!"
"What's the magic word?"
"Sorry. May I have some ketchup, ''please''?"&lt;/poem&gt;

The single word changes an imperative order into a conditional request, concisely communicating "Do as I say, if it pleases you."

Though it was primarily used for teaching children in reading, writing, grammar and [[Islamic studies]] such as [[Qira'at]] (Quranic recitation), other practical and theoretical subjects were also often taught.&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt; Until the 20th century, ''maktabs'' were the prevalent means of mass education in much of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].

Maktab refers to only elementary schools in Arabic. ''Maktab'' is used in [[Dari language|Dari Persian]] in [[Afghanistan]] as an equivalent term to [[school]], including both [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s. [[Avicenna]] used the word maktab in the same sense.

Maktabs or kuttābs are an old-fashioned method of [[education]] in [[Egypt]] and Muslim majority countries, in which a [[sheikh]] teaches a group of students who sit in front of him on the ground. The curriculum includes [[Islam]] and [[Quranic Arabic]], but focused mainly on memorising the [[Quran]]. With the development of modern schools, the number of kuttabs has declined. Kuttāb means "writers", plural ''{{transl|arz|katatīb}} / {{transl|ar|ALA|katātīb}}''.

In common Modern Arabic usage, ''maktab'' means "office" while ''maktabah'' means "library" or "(place of) study" and ''kuttāb'' is a plural word meaning "books".&lt;ref name="M. S.

==History==
[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|200px|thumb|Scholars and Students in an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Maktab.]]
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], an elementary [[school]] was known as a ''maktab'', which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to [[higher education]]), a ''maktab'' was often attached to a [[mosque]].&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurist [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]] discussed ''Maktab'' schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: ''Law and Education in Medieval Islam: Studies in Memory of Professor George Makdisi'', Edited by Joseph E. Lowry, [[Devin J. Stewart]] and Shawkat M. Toorawa|author=Francis Robinson|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]|year=2008|volume=18|issue=01|pages=98–100|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S1356186307007912}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a [[petition]] from a retired [[Shia Islam]]ic judge who ran a ''Madhab'' elementary school for orphans, al-Haytami issues a [[fatwa]] outlining a structure of ''maktab'' education that prevented any physical or economic exploitation of enrolled orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: ''Law and Education in Medieval Islam: Studies in Memory of Professor George Makdisi'', Edited by Joseph E. Lowry, Devin J. Stewart and Shawkat M. Toorawa|author=R. Kevin Jaques|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=359–62|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/jis/etl027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, the famous Persian [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and teacher, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the ''maktab'' entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children", as a guide to teachers working at ''maktab'' schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in [[class (education)|class]]es instead of individual [[tuition]] from private [[tutor]]s, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of [[competition]] and [[emulation (observational learning)|emulation]] among pupils as well as the usefulness of group [[discussion]]s and [[debate]]s. Ibn Sina described the [[curriculum]] of a ''maktab'' school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a ''maktab'' school.&lt;ref name=Asimov&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary education===
Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a ''maktab'' school from the age of 6 and be taught [[primary education]] until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic metaphysics]], [[Arabic language|language]], [[Islamic literature|literature]], [[Islamic ethics]], and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt;

===Secondary education===
Ibn Sina refers to the [[secondary education]] stage of ''maktab'' schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Islamic mathematics|geometry]], [[Islamic economics in the world|trade and commerce]], [[Inventions in medieval Islam|craftsmanship]], or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future [[career]]. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.&lt;ref name="M. S. Asimov 1999 34–5"/&gt;

===Literacy===
In medieval times, the [[Caliphate]] experienced a growth in [[literacy]], having the highest literacy rate of the [[Middle Ages]], comparable to [[classical Athens]]' literacy in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Delivering Education|author=Andrew J.

He mostly writes in [[Zazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zazaki.net/haber/malmisanij-22.htm MALMISANIJ, biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He often writes under the pseudonym Malmîsanij.

He studied at the [[University of Ankara]], and was under arrest three times between 1975 and 1981 because of his political activities. In  1982, he moved to [[Sweden]]. He continued his studies in Europe. He studied [[Iranian studies]] at the [[Sorbonne University]], [[Iranian languages]] at the [[University of Uppsala]] and folk education at the [[University of Linköping]]. Besides he has a master's degree at the [[University of Gothenburg]].

After [[Ehmedê Xasî]] and [[Usman Efendiyê Babijî]] who wrote the first works in Zazaki, in the late 19th and early 20th century, nobody wrote in Zazaki until 1970. Malmîsanij is the first author who started modern Zazaki literature in the 1970s. He has prepared and published the first Zazaki dictionary. He and his friends published a magazine, named "Tîrêj", in the 1970s. This magazine was half [[Zazaki]] and half [[Kurmanji]]. He has written for several publications: " Hêvî", " Armanc", "Çar çira", "Çira", "Wan", "Vate". Some of his works have been translated into English, Arabic, French and Swedish.

Actually, he takes place at "Grûba Xebate Ya Vateyî"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zazaki.net/html_page.php?page=gruba_xebate&lt;/ref&gt; in order to develop and unify Zazaki language. He also takes part in the standardization of [[Kurmanji Kurdish]].

"'''Now hear this'''" is a phrase used, particularly in the [[United States Navy]], to instruct personnel to give "attention to an order or command about to follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manual of Commands and Orders 1945|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/commands_order.htm|website=www.history.navy.mil|publisher=United States Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was also heard in nautical use in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' science fiction series. The phrase was used on [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-A)]] in the film ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', and on [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-D)]] in the ''[[Star Trek:The Next Generation]]'' episodes "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]" and "[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]", and on [[Starfleet Academy]] in the video-game ''[[Star Trek Online]]''.

This phrase was also used in the ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'' video game, for announcements on board Galactic Empire starships.

:''Not to be confused with 17th century princess, [[Nuala O'Donnell]].''
'''Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill''' {{IPA-ga|ˈn̪ˠuəl̪ˠə nʲiː ˈɣoː.n̪ˠɪlʲ|}} (born 1952) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfu.edu/wfupress/authors/nuala_ni_dhomhnaill.php|title=Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill|publisher=Wake Forest University Press|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1952, of English parents, she moved to Ireland at the age of 6, and was brought up in the Dingle [[Gaeltacht]] and in [[Nenagh]], [[County Tipperary]]. Her uncle is Monsignor [[Pádraig Ó Fiannachta]] of [[Dingle]], the leading authority alive on Munster Irish. She studied English and Irish at UCC in 1969 and became part of the '[[Innti]]' school of poets. In 1973, she married Turkish geologist Dogan Leflef and lived abroad in Turkey and Holland for seven years. Her mother brought her up to speak English, though she was an Irish speaker herself. Her father and his side of the family spoke very fluent Irish and used it every day, but her mother thought it would make life easier for Nuala if she spoke English instead.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Randolph, Jody. "Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill." ''Close to the Next Moment: Interviews from a Changing Ireland.'' Manchester: Carcanet, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after her return to [[County Kerry]] in 1980, she published her first collection of poetry in Irish, ''An Dealg Droighin'' (1981), and became a member of [[Aosdána]]. Ní Dhomhnaill has published extensively and her works include poetry collections, children’s plays, screenplays, anthologies, articles, reviews and essays. Her other works include ''Féar Suaithinseach'' (1984);  ''Feis'' (1991), and ''Cead Aighnis'' (1998). Ni Dhomhnaill's poems appear in English translation in the dual-language editions ''Rogha Dánta/Selected Poems'' (1986, 1988, 1990); ''The Astrakhan Cloak'' (1992), ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1990), ''The Water Horse'' (2002), and ''The Fifty Minute Mermaid'' (2007). ''Selected Essays'' appeared in 2005.

Dedicated to the Irish language she writes poetry exclusively in Irish and is quoted as saying ‘Irish is a language of beauty, historical significance, ancient roots and an immense propensity for poetic expression through its everyday use’. Ní Dhomhnaill also speaks English, Turkish, French, German and Dutch fluently.

Ní Dhomhnaill’s writings focus on the rich traditions and heritage of Ireland and draw upon themes of ancient [[Irish folklore]] and mythology combined with contemporary themes of femininity, sexuality and culture. Her myth poems express an alternative reality and she speaks of her reasons for writing about myths as those that are an integral part of the Irish language and Irish culture. ‘Myth is a basic, fundamental structuring of our reality, a narrative that we place on the chaos of sensation to make sense of our lives’

Ní Dhomhnaill has received many scholarships, prizes, and [[bursaries]]. She has also won numerous international awards for works which have been translated into French, German, Polish, Italian, Norwegian, Estonian, Japanese and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/27/poetry.features|title=Like a mermaid out of water|last=Phillips|first=Adam|date=27 January 2008|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is one of Ireland's most well-known Irish language writers.  She was Ireland Professor of Poetry from 2001–2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandchairofpoetry.org/n_dhomhnaill.php|title=Professor Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill|publisher=The Ireland Chair of Poetry Trust|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Professor of Irish (language) Poetry.  Her papers are collected at Boston College's Burns Library. In March 2018, she received the [[Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award]] for her achievements in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://poland.pl/arts/literature/irish-poet-awarded-herbert-prize/ |title=Irish poet awarded Herbert Prize |access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuala currently lives near [[Dublin]] with her husband and four children and is a regular broadcaster on Irish radio and television.

'''Numeracy''' is the ability to [[reason]] and to apply simple numerical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=M|author2=Pui |title=Are individual differences in numeracy unique from general mental ability? A closer look at a common measure of numeracy.|journal=Individual Differences Research|year=2010|volume=8|series=4|pages=257–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Basic numeracy skills consist of comprehending fundamental [[arithmetics]] like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  For example, if one can understand simple mathematical equations such as, 2 + 2 = 4, then one would be considered possessing at least basic numeric knowledge.  Substantial aspects of numeracy also include [[number sense]], operation sense, computation, [[measurement]], [[geometry]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. A numerically [[literacy|literate]] person can manage and respond to the mathematical demands of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Statistics Canada|title=Building on our Competencies: Canadian Results of the International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey|url=http://www.nald.ca/library/research/booc/booc.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|page=209|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003001/http://www.nald.ca/library/research/booc/booc.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, '''innumeracy''' (the lack of numeracy) can have a negative impact. Numeracy has an influence on career decisions, and risk perception towards health decisions. For example, innumeracy distorts risk perception towards health decisions&lt;ref name="Reyna2009" /&gt; and may negatively affect economic choices.&lt;ref name="Gerardi2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gerardi | first1 = K. | last2 = Goette | first2 = L. | last3 = Meier | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1220568110 | title = Numerical ability predicts mortgage default | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 28 | pages = 11267–11271 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23798401| pmc = 3710828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Banks | first1 = J. | last2 = O'Dea | first2 = C. | last3 = Oldfield | first3 = Z. | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02395.x | title = Cognitive Function, Numeracy and Retirement Saving Trajectories* | journal = The Economic Journal | volume = 120 | issue = 548 | pages = F381–F410 | year = 2010 | pmid =  22228911| pmc =3249594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Greater numeracy has been associated with reduced susceptibility to [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing effects]], less influence of nonnumerical information such as mood states, and greater sensitivity to different levels of numerical risk".&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weller | first1 = J.

==Representation of numbers==

Humans have evolved to mentally represent numbers in two major ways from observation (not formal math).&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Feigenson | first1 = L. | last2 = Dehaene | first2 = S. | last3 = Spelke | first3 = E. | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.002 | title = Core systems of number | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 307–314 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15242690| pmc = }} {{cite web |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/feigenson2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509130626/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/feigenson2004.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These representations are often thought to be innate&lt;ref name="Izard2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = V. | last2 = Sann | first2 = C. | last3 = Spelke | first3 = E.

They are:
# Approximate representation of numerical magnitude, and
# Precise representation of the quantity of individual items.

Approximate representations of numerical magnitude imply that one can relatively estimate and comprehend an amount if the number is large (see [[Approximate number system]]). For example, one experiment showed children and adults arrays of many dots.&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"/&gt; After briefly observing them, both groups could accurately estimate the approximate number of dots. However, distinguishing differences between large numbers of dots proved to be more challenging.&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

Precise representations of distinct individuals demonstrate that people are more accurate in estimating amounts and distinguishing differences when the numbers are relatively small (see [[Subitizing]]).&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"/&gt; For example, in one experiment, an experimenter presented an infant with two piles of crackers, one with two crackers the other with three. The experimenter then covered each pile with a cup. When allowed to choose a cup, the infant always chose the cup with more crackers because the infant could distinguish the difference.&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

Both systems—approximate representation of magnitude and precise representation quantity of individual items—have limited power. For example, neither allows representations of [[fractions]] or [[negative number]]s. More complex representations require education. However, achievement in school mathematics correlates with an individual's unlearned approximate [[number sense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Halberda | first1 = J. | last2 = Mazzocco | first2 = M.

==Definitions and assessment==

Fundamental (or rudimentary) numeracy skills include understanding of the real number line, time, measurement, and estimation.&lt;ref name="Reyna2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reyna | first1 = V.

More sophisticated numeracy skills include understanding of ratio concepts (notably fractions, proportions, percentages, and probabilities), and knowing when and how to perform multistep operations.&lt;ref name="Reyna2009" /&gt; Two categories of skills are included at the higher levels: the analytical skills (the ability to understand numerical information, such as required to interpret graphs and charts) and the statistical skills (the ability to apply higher probabilistic and statistical computation, such as conditional probabilities).

A variety of tests have been developed for assessing numeracy and health numeracy.

==Childhood influences==
The first couple of years of childhood are considered to be a vital part of life for the development of numeracy and literacy.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciampa|first1=Philip J.|last2=Osborn|first2=Chandra Y.|last3=Peterson|first3=Neeraja B.|last4=Rothman|first4=Russell L.|title=Patient Numeracy, Perceptions of Provider Communication, and Colorectal Cancer Screening Utilization|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=15|issue=sup3|year=2010|pages=157–168|issn=1081-0730|doi=10.1080/10810730.2010.522699|pmc=3075203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many components that play key roles in the development of numeracy at a young age, such as Socioeconomic Status (SES), parenting, Home Learning Environment (HLE), and age.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt;

==Socioeconomic status==
Children who are brought up in families with high SES tend to be more engaged in developmentally enhancing activities.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt; These children are more likely to develop the necessary abilities to learn and to become more motivated to learn.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt; More specifically, a mother's education level is considered to have an effect on the child's ability to achieve in numeracy. That is, mothers with a high level of education will tend to have children who succeed more in numeracy.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt;

==Parenting==
Parents are suggested to collaborate with their child in simple learning exercises, such as reading a book, painting, drawing, and playing with numbers. On a more expressive note, the act of using complex language, being more responsive towards the child, and establishing warm interactions are recommended to parents with the confirmation of positive numeracy outcomes.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt; When discussing beneficial parenting behaviors, a feedback loop is formed because pleased parents are more willing to interact with their child, which in essence promotes better development in the child.&lt;ref name="CiampaOsborn2010" /&gt;

==Home-learning environment==
Along with parenting and SES, a strong [[Homeschooling|home-learning]] environment increases the likelihood of the child being prepared for comprehending complex mathematical schooling.&lt;ref name="MelhuishPhan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melhuish|first1=Edward C.|last2=Phan|first2=Mai B.|last3=Sylva|first3=Kathy|last4=Sammons|first4=Pam|last5=Siraj-Blatchford|first5=Iram|last6=Taggart|first6=Brenda|title=Effects of the Home Learning Environment and Preschool Center Experience upon Literacy and Numeracy Development in Early Primary School|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=64|issue=1|year=2008|pages=95–114|issn=0022-4537|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2008.00550.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a child is influenced by many learning activities in the household, such as puzzles, coloring books, mazes, or books with picture riddles, then they will be more prepared to face school activities.&lt;ref name="MelhuishPhan2008"/&gt;

==Age==
Age is accounted for when discussing the development of numeracy in children.&lt;ref name="MelhuishPhan2008"/&gt; Children under the age of 5 have the best opportunity to absorb basic numeracy skills.&lt;ref name="MelhuishPhan2008" /&gt; After the age of 7, achievement of basic numeracy skills become less influential.&lt;ref name="MelhuishPhan2008" /&gt;  For example, a study was conducted to compare the reading and mathematic abilities between children, ages 5 and 7, each in three different mental capacity groups (underachieving, average, and overachieving).  The differences in the amount of knowledge retained were greater between the three different groups at age 5, than between the groups at age 7. This reveals that the younger you are the greater chance you have to retain more information, like numeracy.

==Literacy==
There seems to be a relationship between [[literacy]] and numeracy,&lt;ref name="Bullock1994"&gt;{{citation | title = Literacy in the Language of Mathematics | first =  James O. | last = Bullock | journal = [[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 101 | issue =  8 &lt;!--| number = 8--&gt; |date=October 1994 | pages = 735–743 | jstor = 2974528 | doi=10.2307/2974528}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Steen2001"&gt;{{citation | title = Mathematics and Numeracy: Two Literacies, One Language | journal = The Mathematics Educator (Journal of the Singapore Association of Mathematics Educators) | volume = 6 | number = 1 | year = 2001 | pages = 10–16 | first = Lynn Arthur | last = Steen }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in young children.  Depending on the level of literacy or numeracy at a young age, one can predict the growth of literacy and/ or numeracy skills in future development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Purpura|first=David|author2=Hume, L |author3=Sims, D |author4= Lonigan, C |title=Early literacy and early numeracy: The value of including early literacy skills in the prediction of numeracy|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=2011|volume=110|issue=4|pages=647–658|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2011.07.004|pmid=21831396}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is some evidence that humans may have an inborn sense of number. In one study for example, five-month-old [[infant]]s were shown two dolls, which were then hidden with a screen. The babies saw the experimenter pull one doll from behind the screen. Without the child's knowledge, a second experimenter could remove, or add dolls, unseen behind the screen. When the screen was removed, the infants showed more surprise at an unexpected number (for example, if there were still two dolls). Some researchers have concluded that the babies were able to count, although others doubt this and claim the infants noticed surface area rather than number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/numbers-mind Numbers in Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Numeracy has a huge impact on employment.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2010 257–265"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=M.|author2=Pui, S. |title=Are individual differences in numeracy unique from general mental ability? A closer look at a common measure of numeracy|journal=Individual Differences Research|year=2010|volume=8|series=4|pages=257–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a work environment, numeracy can be a controlling factor affecting career achievements and failures.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2010 257–265"/&gt; Many professions require individuals to have a well-developed sense of numeracy, for example: [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[accountant]], [[actuary]], [[Risk Analyst]], [[financial analyst]], [[engineer]], and [[architect]]. 
Even outside these specialized areas, the lack of proper numeracy skills can reduce employment opportunities and promotions, resulting in unskilled manual careers, low-paying jobs, and even unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Ciampa, Philip J.; Osborn, Chandra Y.; Peterson, Neeraja B.; Rothman, Russell L. (2010). "Patient Numeracy, Perceptions of Provider Communication, and Colorectal Cancer Screening Utilization". ''Journal of Health Communication'' 15 (sup3): 157–168. doi:10.1080/10810730.2010.522699. ISSN 1081-0730.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, carpenters and interior designers need to be able to measure, use fractions, and handle budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Melhuish, Edward C.; Phan, Mai B.; Sylva, Kathy; Sammons, Pam; Siraj-Blatchford, Iram; Taggart, Brenda (2008). "Effects of the Home Learning Environment and Preschool Center Experience upon Literacy and Numeracy Development in Early Primary School." ''Journal of Social Issues'' 64 (1): 95–114. doi:10.1111/j.1540-4560.2008.00550.x. ISSN 0022-4537.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example pertaining to numeracy influencing employment was demonstrated at the [[Poynter Institute]].  The Poynter Institute has recently included numeracy as one of the skills required by competent [[journalists]]. [[Max Frankel]], former executive editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'', argues that "deploying numbers skillfully is as important to communication as deploying [[verb]]s". Unfortunately, it is evident that journalists often show poor numeracy skills.  In a study by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], 58% of job applicants interviewed by broadcast news directors lacked an adequate understanding of statistical materials.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, Chip (2004). "[http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;aid=71048 Why Math Matters]" ''Poynter Online'', September 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to assessing applicants for an employment position, [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] numerical reasoning tests have been created by [[occupational psychologist]]s, who are involved in the study of numeracy. These psychometric numerical reasoning tests are used to assess an applicants' ability to comprehend and apply numbers. These tests are sometimes administered with a time limit, resulting in the need for the test-taker to think quickly and concisely. Research has shown that these tests are very useful in evaluating potential applicants because they do not allow the applicants to prepare for the test, unlike interview questions.  This suggests that an applicant's results are reliable and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Andrews (2009). [http://www.practiceaptitudetests.com/psychometric-numerical-tests-employment/ Psychometric Numerical Tests &amp; Employment] Psychometric numerical reasoning tests, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

These psychometric numerical reasoning tests first became prevalent during the 1980s, following the pioneering work of psychologists, such as P.&amp;nbsp;Kline.  In 1986 P.&amp;nbsp;Kline's published a book entitled, "A handbook of test construction: Introduction to psychometric design", which explained that psychometric testing could provide reliable and objective results. These findings could then be used to effectively assess a candidate's abilities in numeracy. In the future, psychometric numerical reasoning tests will continue to be used in employment assessments to fairly and accurately differentiate and evaluate possible employment applicants.

==Innumeracy and dyscalculia==
Innumeracy is a [[neologism]] coined by an analogue with [[illiteracy]].  Innumeracy refers to a lack of ability to reason with numbers. The term ''innumeracy'' was coined by cognitive scientist [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. However, this term was popularized in 1989 by mathematician [[John Allen Paulos]] in his book entitled, ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]''.

Developmental [[dyscalculia]] refers to a persistent and specific impairment of basic numerical-arithmetical skills learning in the context of normal intelligence.

==Patterns and differences==
The root cause of innumeracy varies. Innumeracy has been seen in those suffering from poor education and childhood deprivation of numeracy.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lefevre|first1=Jo-Anne|title=Research on the development of academic skills: Introduction to the special issue on early literacy and early numeracy.|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie expérimentale|volume=54|issue=2|year=2000|pages=57–60|issn=1878-7290|doi=10.1037/h0088185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Innumeracy is apparent in children during the transition of numerical skills obtained before schooling and the new skills taught in the education departments because of their memory capacity to comprehend the material.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt; Patterns of innumeracy have also been observed depending on age, gender, and race.&lt;ref name="Donelle2007" /&gt;
Older adults have been associated with lower numeracy skills than younger adults.&lt;ref name="Donelle2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donelle|first=L.|author2=Hoffman-Goetz, L. |author3=Arocha, J. F. |title=Assessing health numeracy among community-dwelling older adults|journal=Journal of Health Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=7|series=7|pages=651–665|doi=10.1080/10810730701619919|pmid=17934942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men have been identified to have higher numeracy skills than women.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2010 257–265"/&gt;  Some studies seem to indicate young people of African heritage tend to have lower numeracy skills.&lt;ref name="Donelle2007" /&gt; The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which children at fourth-grade (average 10 to 11 years) and eighth-grade (average 14 to 15 years) from 49 countries were tested on mathematical comprehension. The assessment included tests for number, algebra (also called patterns and relationships at fourth grade), measurement, geometry, and data.  The latest study, in 2003 found that children from [[Singapore]] at both grade levels had the highest performance. Countries like Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Taiwan also shared high levels of numeracy.  The lowest scores were found in countries like South Africa, Ghana, and Saudi Arabia. Another finding showed a noticeable difference between boys and girls with some exceptions.  For example, girls performed significantly better in Singapore, and boys performed significantly better in the United States.&lt;ref name="wjh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==Theory==
There is a theory that innumeracy is more common than illiteracy when dividing cognitive abilities into two separate categories.  David C. Geary, a notable cognitive developmental and evolutionary psychologist from the [[University of Missouri]], created the terms "biological primary abilities" and "biological secondary abilities".&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt; Biological primary abilities evolve over time and are necessary for survival.  Such abilities include speaking a common language or knowledge of simple mathematics.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt; Biological secondary abilities are attained through personal experiences and cultural customs, such as reading or high level mathematics learned through schooling.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt; Literacy and numeracy are similar in the sense that they are both important skills used in life.  However, they differ in the sorts of mental demands each makes. Literacy consists of acquiring vocabulary and grammatical sophistication, which seem to be more closely related to memorization, whereas numeracy involves manipulating concepts, such as in [[calculus]] or [[geometry]], and builds from basic numeracy skills.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt; This could be a potential explanation of the challenge of being numerate.&lt;ref name="Lefevre2000" /&gt;

==Innumeracy and risk perception in health decision-making==

Health numeracy has been defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, biostatistical, and probabilistic health information needed to make effective health decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golbeck | first1 = AL | last2 = Ahlers-Schmidt | first2 = CR | last3 = Paschal | first3 = AM | last4 = Dismuke | first4 = SE | year = 2005 | title = A definition and operational framework for health numeracy | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 375–376 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.06.012| pmid = 16242604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of health numeracy is a component of the concept of [[health literacy]]. Health numeracy and health literacy can be thought of as the combination of skills needed for understanding risk and making good choices in health-related behavior.

Health numeracy requires basic numeracy but also more advanced analytical and statistical skills. For instance, health numeracy also requires the ability to understand probabilities or relative frequencies in various numerical and graphical formats, and to engage in [[Bayesian inference]], while avoiding errors sometimes associated with Bayesian reasoning (see [[Base rate fallacy]], [[Conservatism (Bayesian)]]). Health numeracy also requires understanding terms with definitions that are specific to the medical context. For instance, although 'survival' and 'mortality' are complementary in common usage, these terms are not complementary in medicine (see [[five-year survival rate]]).&lt;ref name="Welch2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = H.

One study found that people tended to overestimate their chances of survival or even to choose lower quality hospitals.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2010 257–265" /&gt; Innumeracy also makes it difficult or impossible for some patients to read medical graphs correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hess | first1 = R. | last2 = Visschers | first2 = V.

Once again, a misunderstanding between a doctor and patient due to either the doctor, patient, or both being unable to comprehend numbers effectively could result in serious health consequences.

Different presentation formats of numerical information, for instance natural frequency icon arrays, have been evaluated to assist both low numeracy and high numeracy individuals.&lt;ref name="Donelle2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancker2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ancker | first1 = J.

==Evolution of Numeracy==
In the field of [[economic history]], numeracy is often used to assess [[human capital]] at times when there was no data on schooling or other educational measures. Using a method called [[Whipple's index|age-heaping]], researchers like professor [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] study the development and inequalities of numeracy over time and throughout regions. For example, [[Jörg Baten|Baten]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |last2=Hippe |first2=Ralph |title=The early regional development of human capital in Europe, 1790–1880 |journal=Scandinavian Economic History Review |date=2012 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=254–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hippe find a numeracy gap between regions in West / Central [[Europe]] and the rest of [[Europe]] for the period 1790 - 1880. At the same time, their [[data analysis]] reveals that these differences as well as within country inequality decreased over time. Taking a similar approach, [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] and Fourie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |last2=Fourie |first2=Johan |title=Numeracy of Africans, Asians, and Europeans during the early modern period: new  evidence from Cape Colony court registers |journal=The Economic History Review |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=632–656}}&lt;/ref&gt; find overall high levels of numeracy for people in the Cape Colony (late [[17th century|17th]] to early [[19th century]]). 

In contrast to these studies comparing numeracy over [[country|countries]] or [[region]]s, it is also possible to analyze numeracy within [[country|countries]]. For example, [[Jörg Baten|Baten]], Crayen and Voth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |last2=Crayen |first2=Dorothee |last3=Voth |first3=Hans-Joachim |title=Numeracy and the impact of high food prices in industrializing Britain, 1780–1850 |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |date=2014 |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=418–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; look at the effects of [[war]] on numeracy in [[England]] and [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] and Priwitzer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |last2=Priwitzer |first2=Stefan |title=Social and intertemporal differences of basic numeracy in Pannonia (first century BCE to third century CE). |journal=Scandinavian Economic History Review |date=2015 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=110–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; find a "military bias" in today's West [[Hungary]]: people opting for a military career had - on average - better numeracy indicators (1 BCE to 3[[Common Era|CE]]).

'''Ola Hansson''' (12 November 1860, [[Hönsinge]], [[Sweden]] – 26 September 1925, [[Büyükdere, Istanbul|Büyükdere]], [[Turkey]]) was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] poet, prose writer, and critic.  

== Biography ==
Hansson  published his first works, ''Dikter'' ("''Poems''") in 1884 and ''Notturno'' in 1885. In those he expressed a celebration of the natural beauty and [[folk culture]] of his native province [[Skåne]], southern Sweden. The refined poetry did not fit the [[Swedish realism]] of the 1880s-90s and gained little attention. Hansson followed up with the [[decadent]] ''Sensitiva Amorosa'' (1887), a collection of morbid, erotic sketches that shocked the Sweden of his day. The reaction from the public was harsh, and Hansson left his country for Germany in 1889. He would then continue to live abroad for the remainder of his life, in countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]] (where he also died). 

== Ideas and works ==
In the period following the notorious ''Sensitiva Amorosa'' (1887) he proclaimed himself an adherent of [[Nietzsche]]an ideas, a view he made public with the cycle of poems ''Ung Ofegs visor'' (1892). Here he voiced his contempt of the general crowd and belief in the ''[[Übermensch]]''. Hansson, together with [[Georg Brandes]] was instrumental in calling attention to Nietzsche's works in Germany, and he also helped publicize [[August Strindberg|Strindberg's]] work in German magazines at a point when the latter was not appreciated in Sweden. The two men rapidly became enemies, though, after Strindberg moved to Berlin in 1892.

While in Germany, he wrote and published works in German, Danish and Norwegian, for example ''Fatalistische Geschichten'' (German, 1890) which was published the same year in Danish as ''Skæbnenoveller''. Other German language works during this period included  ''Im Huldrebann'' (1895), ''Meervögel'' (1895), ''Der Weg zum Leben'' (1896; also in Swedish, ''Vägen till lifvet'', 1896), and ''Der Schutzengel'' (1896).

Later in the 1890s he came to loathe Germany, and a hatred of people grew to fanatical proportions, manifesting itself in [[anti-semitism]] among other things. For a short period he expressed an adherence to [[roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]. These peculiarities further alienated him from contemporary Sweden. He did however gain some recognition in Germany thanks to his German wife Laura (1854&amp;ndash;1928; pseudonym [[Laura Marholm]]), who spread Hansson's works to a larger audience.

== Legacy ==
A productive writer, his writings are uneven. However, he is considered today a pioneer within modern Swedish poetry, who reshaped nature poetry; he has sometimes been called the only one among late-19th-century Swedish poets who really absorbed the influence of French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolism]] and "fin-de-siècle" moods. In 1906 [[Vilhelm Ekelund]], a major poet of the next generation, published a paeanic poem hailing him as the like of [[Pindar]], the bard of his province and a poetic forerunner. Ekelund, like Hansson, was a native of the rural southern province of [[Scania]] and felt in opposition to the literary fashions of Stockholm; he felt these had rejected Hansson and driven him into exile. From this point on, Ola Hansson began to be reappraised, and in his final years an (unsatisfying) edition of his collected works began to appear in Sweden (greeted by the author's angry pointing out of its shortcomings in newspaper articles dispatched from his exile). He has remained, in particular, an invoked hero of Scanian writers.

In 1913 he was awarded the first scholarship in memory of [[Gustaf Fröding]], elected by Swedish university students.

'''Recursion''' occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], where a [[function (mathematics)|function]] being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

==Formal definitions==
[[File:Serpiente alquimica.jpg|thumb|[[Ouroboros]], an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:
# {{anchor|base case}}A simple '''base case''' (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
# A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:
*One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case'').
*The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step'').

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(0)=0\text{ as base case 1,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(1)=1\text{ as base case 2,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{For all integers }n&gt;1,~\text{ Fib}(n):=\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s by the [[Peano axioms]] can be described as: ''0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.'' By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.

Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s.

There are various more tongue-in-cheek "definitions" of recursion; see [[#Recursive humor|recursive humor]].

==Informal definition==
[[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed [[sourdough]], bubbling through [[fermentation]]: the [[recipe]] calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.]]

Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.

Recursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a [[sourdough]] recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a [[maze]]. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.

==In language==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Language Instinct|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.08.004 | title = The faculty of language: What's so special about it? | year = 2005 | last1 = Pinker | first1=Steven | last2 = Jackendoff | first2=Ray | journal = Cognition | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–236 | pmid=15694646| citeseerx = 10.1.1.116.7784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: ''Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous'', in which the sentence ''witches are dangerous'' occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.

This provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: ''Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...''. There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.

Recently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by [[Daniel Everett]] on the basis of his claims about the [[Pirahã language]]. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0140 |title=Evidence and argumentation: A reply to Everett (2009) |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |year=2009 |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |last2=Pesetsky |first2=David |last3=Rodrigues |first3=Cilene |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=671–681 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106154616/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary [[self-reference]] can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker|first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in [[natural language semantics]]. The word ''and'', for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, ''and'' is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer Bäuerle et al., ''Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language''. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. ''Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[recursive grammar]] is a formal grammar that contains recursive [[production (computer science)|production rules]].&lt;ref name="ns02"&gt;{{citation

===Recursive humor===
Recursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a [[circular definition]] or [[self-reference]], in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an [[infinite regress]]. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their [[glossary]] along the lines of:
:Recursion, ''see Recursion''.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=David|title=Essentials of Discrete Mathematics|year=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuwhTxCVovQC&amp;dq=recursion+joke&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found on page 269 in the [[Back-of-the-book index|index]]  of some editions of [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''; the index entry recursively references itself ("recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269"). The earliest version of this joke was in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of ''The C Programming Language''.

Another joke is that "To understand recursion, you must understand recursion."&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; In the English-language version of the [[Google]] web search engine, when a search for "recursion" is made, the site suggests "Did you mean: ''recursion''." An alternative form is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."''

[[Recursive acronym]]s can also be examples of recursive humor. [[PHP]], for example, stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor", [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator." and [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's not Unix".

==In mathematics==
[[File:Sierpinski triangle.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Sierpinski triangle]]—a confined recursion of triangles that form a [[fractal]]]]

===Recursively defined sets===
{{Main|Recursive definition}}

====Example: the natural numbers====
{{see also|Closure (mathematics)}}
The canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the [[natural numbers]]:

:0 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''n'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''n'' + 1 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:The set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.

====Example: The set of true reachable propositions====
Another interesting example is the set of all "true reachable" propositions in an [[axiomatic system]].

*If a proposition is an axiom, it is a true reachable proposition.
*If a proposition can be obtained from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a true reachable proposition.
*The set of true reachable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.

This set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Finite subdivision rules===
{{Main|Finite subdivision rule}}
Finite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create [[fractal]]-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the [[Cantor set]] is a subdivision rule, as is [[barycentric subdivision]].

===Functional recursion===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be partly defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the [[Fibonacci number]] sequence: ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' − 1) + ''F''(''n'' − 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case ''F''(0) = 0 and ''F''(1) = 1.

A famous recursive function is the [[Ackermann function]], which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.

===Proofs involving recursive definitions===
Applying the standard technique of [[proof by cases]] to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields [[structural induction]], a powerful generalization of [[mathematical induction]] widely used to derive proofs in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

===Recursive optimization===
[[Dynamic programming]] is an approach to [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the [[Bellman equation]], which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).

===The recursion theorem===
In [[set theory]], this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set ''X'', an element ''a'' of ''X'' and a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem states that there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for any natural number ''n''.

====Proof of uniqueness====
Take two functions &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  such that:

:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(n + 1) = f(G(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is an element of ''X''.

It can be proved by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'':

:'''Base Case''': &lt;math&gt;F(0) = a = G(0)&lt;/math&gt; so the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Inductive Step''': Suppose &lt;math&gt;F(k) = G(k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(k+1) = f(F(k)) = f(G(k)) = G(k+1).&lt;/math&gt;
::Hence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).

By induction, &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}
A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a [[computer programming]] technique, this is called [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is [[dynamic programming]]. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.

A classic example of recursion is the definition of the [[factorial]] function, given here in [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

If not having reached the [[base case (recursion)|base case]] and returning with value {{math|1,}} every [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by {{math|1}} ({{code|(n - 1)}}), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of {{code|n}}, analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.

Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in [[parser]]s for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.

[[Recurrence relation]]s are equations to define one or more sequences  recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be "solved" to obtain a non-recursive definition.

Use of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.  The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

A '''revenue stamp''', '''tax stamp''', '''duty stamp''' or '''fiscal stamp''' is a (usually) adhesive label used to collect [[tax]]es or fees on documents, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, [[hunting license]]s, firearm registration, and many other things.  Typically businesses purchase the stamps from the government, and attach them to taxed items as part of putting the items on sale, or in the case of documents, as part of filling out the form.

Revenue stamps often look very similar to [[postage stamp]]s, and in some countries and time periods it has been possible to use postage stamps for revenue purposes.

== Description ==
[[File:Cundinamarca 1899 passport stamp 3rd class.jpg|right|thumb|An 1899 passport tax stamp from Cundinamarca in Colombia|upright]]
Revenue stamps are stamps used to collect taxes and fees. They are issued by governments, national and local, and by official bodies of various kinds. They take many forms and may be gummed and ungummed, perforated or imperforate, printed or embossed, and of any size. In many countries, they are as detailed in their design as much as banknotes; they are often made from the same type of paper. The high value of many revenue stamps means that they may contain security devices to prevent counterfeiting.

The [[Revenue Society]] has defined revenue stamps as " ...stamps, whether impressed, adhesive or otherwise, issued by or on behalf of International, National or Local Governments, their Licensees or Agents, and indicate that a tax, duty or fee has been paid or prepaid or that permission has been granted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revenuesociety.org.uk Home.] The Revenue Society, 2011. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the [[Ottoman empire]], [[Damga resmi]] was already in use by the sixteenth century. Records of tax revenue from stamps for silk provide evidence of changes in silk production over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=İslamoğlu-İnan|first=Huri|title=The Ottoman Empire and the World-Economy|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52607-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of revenue stamps goes back further than that of postage stamps ([[Penny Black|first used in 1840]]); the stamps of the [[Stamp Act]]s of the 18th century were revenues.&lt;ref&gt;"The Stamp Act of 1765 - A Serendipitous Find" by Hermann Ivester in ''The Revenue Journal'', The [[Revenue Society]], Vol.XX, No.3, December 2009, pp.87-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their use became widespread in the 19th century, partly inspired by the success of the postage stamp, and partly motivated by the desire to streamline government operations, the presence of a revenue stamp being an indication that the item in question had already paid the necessary fees. Revenue stamps have become less commonly seen in the 21st century, with the rise of computerization and the ability to use numbers to track payments accurately.

There are a great many kinds of revenue stamps in the world, and it is likely that many remain unrecorded. Both national and local entities have issued them. Governments have sometimes combined the functions of postage and revenue stamps. In the former British Empire, such stamps were often inscribed "''Postage and Revenue''" to reflect their dual function. Other countries have simply allowed revenue stamps to be used for postage or vice versa. A revenue stamp authorized subsequently for postal use is known as a [[postal fiscal]]. Bhutan, for instance, authorized the use of revenue stamps for postal purposes from 1955 until the first proper postage stamps of the country were issued in 1962. In the Stanley Gibbons catalog, this type of stamp has an F prefix.&lt;ref name=sgasia&gt;''Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Part 21 South-East Asia''. 4th edition. London: [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2004, p. 1. {{ISBN|0852595638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of cancellation ==
{{main article|Fiscal cancel}}
[[Image:USAPlayingCardsStamp.jpg|right|thumb|An American revenue stamp for the tax on playing cards|upright]]
While revenue stamps often resemble [[postage stamp]]s, they are not normally intended for use on mail and therefore do not receive a postal [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]. Some countries such as [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|Great Britain]] have issued stamps valid for both postage and revenue, but this practice is now rare. Many different methods have been used to cancel revenue stamps, including [[pen cancel]]s, inked [[handstamp]]s, perforating, [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], hole punching or simply tearing.

From around 1900, United States revenue stamps were required to be mutilated by cutting, after being affixed to documents, and in addition to being cancelled in ink. A class of office equipment was created to achieve this which became known as "stamp mutilators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officemuseum.com/mutilators.htm |title=Revenue Stamp Mutilators |publisher=Early Office Museum |year=2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012}} [https://www.webcitation.org/68QZTkY1W archived from the original]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US653366.pdf United States Patent for a "Stamp Mutilator", 1900. No. 653366.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting ==
Revenue stamps were once widely collected by [[philatelists]] and given the same status as [[postage stamp]]s in [[stamp catalog]]ues and at exhibitions. After World War One, however, they declined in popularity, possibly due to being excluded from catalogues as the number of postage stamps issued rose rapidly and crowded revenues out.

The lowest point in revenue philately was during the middle years of the twentieth century. A [[Stanley Gibbons]] children's stamp album from the 1950s warned in its introduction: "Since Philately is the collecting of stamps that are employed in connection with the Posts, do not put in your album fiscals, telegraph stamps, tobacco-tax labels and other such strange things as are often found in some collections."&lt;ref&gt;"Stamp Collecting Hints" in ''Improved Postage Stamp Album''. 28th edn. London: Stanley Gibbons, c. 1953, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a definition of [[philately]] that would be recognised today.

More recently, revenue philately has become popular again and now has its own FIP ([[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]]) Commission and is an approved category in FIP endorsed [[stamp exhibition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fip-revenue.org/ FIP REVENUE COMMISSION] [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] 2011. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many catalogues have been issued by specialist publishers and dealers but revenue stamps still do not feature in some of the most popular catalogues, for instance by Stanley Gibbons and [[Michel catalog|Michel]], unless they are ''revenue and postage'' stamps. However, both the standard [[Scott catalogue|Scott]] and the Scott Specialised United States catalogue feature US revenue stamps. The leading catalogue for revenue stamps of the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth and several European countries is the [[Barefoot Catalogue]].

== Some types of revenue stamps ==
{{main article|List of types of revenue stamps}}
[[file:Lincoln Beer Stamp 1871.JPG|right|thumb|1871 U.S. Revenue stamp for 1/6 Barrel of beer]]

=== Court fees ===

One of the earliest uses of revenue stamps was to pay Court Fees. Stamps were used in the Indian feudal states as early as 1797, almost 50 years before the first postal stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/SouthAsia/princely.html Court Fee and Revenue Stamps of the Princely States of India.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although India is only one of several countries that have used tax stamps on legal documents, it was one of the most prolific users. The practice is almost entirely stopped now, partly due to the prevalence of forgeries which cost the issuing government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/10/stories/2003091006060400.htm Court fee stamp racket busted,] ''The Hindu'', Sept. 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documents ===
The tax on documents, also commonly known as [[stamp duty]], is one of the oldest uses of revenue stamps, probably being invented in Spain, and introduced (or re-invented) in the Netherlands in the 1620s, then reaching France in 1651 and England in 1694.&lt;ref name=dagnall&gt;[[Harry Dagnall|Dagnall, H.]] (1994) ''Creating a Good Impression: three hundred years of The Stamp Office and stamp duties.'' London: HMSO, p. 3. {{ISBN|0116414189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments enforce the payment of the tax by making unstamped documents unenforcable in court. The tax has been applied to contracts, tenancy agreements, wills etc. A pre-printed revenue stamp appeared on many [[hundi]]s of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/h/hundi_indian_bill_of_exchange.aspx Hundi (Indian bill of exchange),] [[British Museum]], 2013.

=== Tobacco and alcohol ===

In many countries, tobacco and alcohol are taxed by the use of [[excise stamp]]s. For instance, the producer may buy stamps from the government which are then affixed to each bottle of alcohol or packet of cigarettes to show that tax has been paid. Often the stamp will be fixed across a seal so that on opening the pack or bottle the stamp is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025107&amp;propertyType=document UK Duty Stamps Scheme.] [[HM Revenue &amp; Customs|H.M.

'''Samuel Edward Krune Loliwe Ngxekengxeke Mqhayi''' ('''S. E. K. L. N Mqhayi''', 1 December 1875&amp;ndash;29 July 1945) was a [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] dramatist, essayist, critic, novelist, historian, biographer, translator and poet whose works are regarded as instrumental in standardising the grammar of [[Xhosa language| isiXhosa]] and preserving the language in the 20 century.&lt;ref name="Mqhayi1"&gt;{{cite web| title= S E K Mqhayi: Piercing Curtains of Modernity| publisher= The Journalist | url=http://www.thejournalist.org.za/pioneers/samuel-edward-krune-mqhayi-piercing-curtains-of-modernity | accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Mqhayi was born in the village of Gqumashe in the Thyume valley near [[Alice, Eastern Cape| Alice]] in the [[Eastern Cape Province]], South Africa to parents Ziwani Krune Mqhayi and Qashani Bedle on 1 December 1875. Mqhayi's parents were Christians with his father Ziwani known as  “a leading man in his church, famous for his counsel, his preaching, and his singing." Mqhayi began his primary schooling in the Thyume Valley. At the age of nine, Mqhayi moved with his father (his mother having died when he was 2 years old)to Centane to stay with his uncle Nzanzana (the headsman of the area) during the witgatboom famine of 1885. Mqhayi recounts the six years he spent in Centane as having had an impact on him and his writing “In those six years I learned much respecting Xhosa life, including the refinements of Xhosa
language. … If I had not been at Kentani [sic] for those six years, it seems to me as if I would not have been any help to my nation … it was the means of getting an insight into the national life of my people." When Mqhayi was 15, his uncle died and his father, who had moved to Grahamstown, sent his sister to fetch him. Mqhayi attended [[Lovedale College]] where he studied to become a teacher.&lt;ref name="Mqhayi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sociological Imagination of S.E.K Mqhayi |publisher= Leo Jonathan Schoots|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Schoots/publication/317664183_The_Sociological_Imagination_of_SEK_Mqhayi_Towards_an_African_Sociology/links/5948039c458515db1fd6e544/The-Sociological-Imagination-of-SEK-Mqhayi-Towards-an-African-Sociology.pdf | accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mqhayi died in 1945 at Ntab'ozuko, and was buried in Berlin near King Williams Town. 

== Works==

During the 1890s, the printing press had become popular amongst the Black community in [[South Africa]]. In 1897, Mqhayi, Allan Kirkland, [[Tiyo Soga]] and others launched their own newspaper, Izwi Labantu. In one of his prose writings on Izwi  Labantu, Mqhayi reflected on his disappointment with the westernisation of Africa: &lt;ref name="Mqhayi1"&gt;{{cite web| title= S E K Mqhayi: Piercing Curtains of Modernity| publisher= The Journalist | url=http://www.thejournalist.org.za/pioneers/samuel-edward-krune-mqhayi-piercing-curtains-of-modernity | accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Mqhayi was appointed in the Xhosa Bible Revision Board in 1905. Later, he would help to standardize Xhosa grammar and writing, and then become a full-time author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Senekal | first=B.

In 1907 he wrote his first novel in the [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] language, ''U-Samson'' an adaption of the biblical story of Samson, which is now lost.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Social semiotics''' (also '''social semantics''')&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thibault, ''Agency and Consciousness in Discourse: Self-Other Dynamics as a Complex System'', Continuum, 2004, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of the field of [[semiotics]] which investigates human signifying practices in specific social and cultural circumstances, and which tries to explain [[meaning-making]] as a social practice. Semiotics, as originally defined by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], is "the science of the life of signs in society". Social semiotics expands on Saussure's founding insights by exploring the implications of the fact that the "codes" of language and communication are formed by social processes. The crucial implication here is that meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change.

Social semiotics is thus the study of the social dimensions of meaning, and of the power of human processes of signification and interpretation (known as semiosis) in shaping individuals and societies. Social semiotics focuses on [[social meaning-making]] practices of all types, whether visual, verbal or aural in nature (Thibault, 1991). These different systems for meaning-making, or possible "channels" (e.g. speech, writing, images) are known as semiotic modes. Semiotic modes can include visual, verbal, written, gestural and musical resources for communication. They also include various "multimodal" ensembles of any of these modes (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2001).

Social semiotics can include the study of how people design and interpret meanings, the study of texts, and the study of how semiotic systems are shaped by social interests and ideologies, and how they are adapted as society changes (Hodge and Kress, 1988). Structuralist semiotics in the tradition of Ferdinand de Saussure focused primarily on theorising semiotic systems or structures (termed ''[[Langue and parole|langue]]'' by de Saussure, which change diachronically, i.e. over longer periods of time). In contrast, social semiotics tries to account for the variability of semiotic practices termed ''[[Langue and parole|parole]]'' by Saussure. This altered focus shows how individual creativity, changing historical circumstances, and new social identities and projects can all change patterns of usage and design (Hodge and Kress, 1988). From a social semiotic perspective, rather than being fixed into unchanging "codes", signs are considered to be resources which people use and adapt (or "design") to make meaning. In these respects, social semiotics was influenced by, and shares many of the preoccupations of [[pragmatics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] and has much in common with [[cultural studies]] and [[critical discourse analysis]].

The main task of social semiotics is to develop analytical and theoretical frameworks which can explain meaning-making in a social context (Thibault, 1991).

==Halliday and the social semiotic in language==
Linguistic theorist, [[Michael Halliday]], introduced the term ‘social semiotics’ into linguistics, when he used the phrase in the title of his book, ''Language as Social Semiotic''. This work argues against the traditional separation between language and society, and exemplifies the start of a 'semiotic' approach, which broadens the narrow focus on written language in linguistics (1978).
For Halliday, languages evolve as systems of "meaning potential" (Halliday, 1978:39) or as sets of resources which influence what the speaker can do with language, in a particular social context. For example, for Halliday, the grammar of the English language is a system organised for the following three purposes (areas or "metafunctions"):
* Facilitating certain kinds of social and interpersonal interactions (interpersonal),
* Representing ideas about the world (ideational), and
* Connecting these ideas and interactions into meaningful texts and making them relevant to their context (textual) (1978:112).
Any sentence in English is composed like a musical composition, with one strand of its meaning coming from each of the three semiotic areas or metafunctions.  
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]] generalises Halliday’s essays &lt;ref&gt;Review of Language as Social Semiotic: The Social Interpretation of Language and Meaning by M. A.K. Halliday, reviewer: Greg Urban, University of Texas at Austin, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3 (Sep., 1981), pp. 659-661, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the American Anthropological Association https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~gurban/pdfs/reviews/Urban-Language_as_Social_Semiotic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on social semiotics into five premises:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semioticon.com/seo/S/social_semiotics.html#  Social Semiotics] - Semiotics Encyclopedia Online, E.J. Pratt Library, Victoria University, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ‘Language is a social fact’ (1978:1)
# ‘We shall not come to understand the nature of language if we pursue only the kinds of question about language that are formulated by linguists’ (1978:3)
#‘Language is as it is because of the functions it has evolved to serve in people’s lives’ (1978:4).
# Language has ‘metafunctions’, which in English are: ideational (‘about something’), interpersonal (’doing something’) and textual (‘the speaker’s text-forming potential’) (1978:112).
# Language is constituted as ‘a discrete network of options’ (1978:113)

==Social semiotics and critical linguistics==
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Robert Hodge]] and [[Gunther Kress]]'s ''Social Semiotics'' (1988) focused on the uses of semiotic systems in social practice. They explain that the social power of texts in society depends on interpretation: "Each producer of a message relies on its recipients for it to function as intended." (1988:4) This process of interpretation (semiosis) situates individual texts within discourses, the exchanges of interpretative communities. The work of interpretation can contest the power of hegemonic discourses. Hodge and Kress give the example of feminist activists defacing a sexist advertising billboard, and spray-painting it with a new, feminist message.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Text is only a trace of discourses, frozen and preserved, more or less reliable or misleading. Yet discourse disappears too rapidly, surrounding a flow of texts." (1988:8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hodge and Kress built on a range of traditions from linguistics (including [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Michael Halliday]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] and [[sociolinguistics]]), but the major impetus for their work is the critical perspective on ideology and society that originates with [[Marx]].

Hodge and Kress build a notion of semiosis as a dynamic process, where meaning is not determined  by rigid structures, or predefined cultural codes. They argue that [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s structuralist semiotics avoided addressing questions about creativity, movement, and change in language, possibly in reaction to the diachronic linguistic traditions of his time (the focus on the historical development from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This created a "problematic" legacy, with linguistic change relegated to the "contents of Saussure’s rubbish bin" (1988:16-17).

Instead, Hodge and Kress propose to account for change in semiosis through the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Meaning is a process, in their interpretation of Peirce. They refer to Peirce's triadic model of semiosis, which depicts the "action" of a sign as a limitless process of infinite semiosis, where one "interpretant" (or idea linked to a sign) generates another. The flow of these infinite processes of interpretation are constrained in Peirce's model, they claim, by the material world (the "object"), and cultural rules of thought, or "habit". (1988:20)

Social semiotics revisits De Saussure's doctrine of the "arbitrariness of the linguistic [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]". This notion rests on the argument that the signifier only has an [[arbitrary]] relationship to the signified) — in other words, that there is nothing about the sound or appearance of (verbal) signifiers (as, for example, the words "dog" or "chien") — to suggest what they signify. Hodge and Kress point out that questions of the [[referent]] become more complicated when semiotics moves beyond verbal language. On the one hand, there is the need to account for the continuum of relationships between the [[referent]] and the representation. Here, they draw on Pierce's differentiation between iconic signification (e.g. a colour photograph of smoke, where the signifier recreates the perceptual experience of the signified), indexical signification (e.g. a column of smoke, where there is a causal relationship between the physical signifier and the fire it might signify), and symbolic signification (e.g. the word "smoke", where the arbitrary link between signifier and signified is maintained by social convention).

Social semiotics also addresses the question of how societies and cultures maintain or shift these conventional bonds between signifier and signified. De Saussure was unwilling to answer this question, Hodge and Kress claim. This leaves the [[socially determinist]] implication that meanings and interpretations are dictated from above, by "the whims of an inscrutably powerful collective being, Society." For Hodge and Kress, social semiotics must respond to the question and  explain how the social shaping of meanings works in practice (1988:22).

==Social semiotics and multimodality==
Social semiotics is currently extending this general framework beyond its linguistic origins to account for the growing importance of sound and visual images, and how modes of communication are combined in both traditional and digital media ([[semiotics of social networking]]) (see, for example, Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996), thus approaching semiotics of culture (Randviir 2004). Theorists such as Gunther Kress and [[Theo Van Leeuwen|Theo van Leeuwen]] have built on Halliday's framework by providing new "grammars" for other semiotic modes. Like language, these grammars are seen as socially formed and changeable sets of available "resources" for making meaning, which are also shaped by the semiotic metafunctions originally identified by Halliday. The visual and aural modes have received particular attention. Accounting for [[multimodality]] (communication in and across a range of semiotic modes - verbal, visual, and aural) is considered a particularly important ongoing project, given the importance of the visual mode in contemporary communication.

'''Sons of the God''' ([[Hebrew|Heb]]: ''bənê hāʼĕlōhîm'',&lt;ref name="ZIBD,1384"&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|Tenney|Silva|2011|p=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; בני האלהים , literally: "Sons of the gods") is a phrase used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and apocrypha. The phrase is also used in [[Kabbalah]] where ''Bene elohim'' are part of different [[Jewish angelic hierarchy|Jewish angelic hierarchies]].

== Hebrew Bible ==

===Genesis 6===
{{quote|When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. Then the Lord said, "My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years." The [[Nephilim]] were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.|Genesis 6:1–4}}
The first mention of "sons of God" in the Hebrew Bible occurs at Genesis 6:1–4. In terms of [[Historical criticism|literary-historical]] origin, this phrase is typically associated with the [[Jahwist|Jahwist tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1995|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage has had two interpretations in Judaism.
* Offspring of [[Seth]]:  The first references to the offspring of Seth rebelling from God and mingling with the daughters of Cain are found in Christian and Rabbinic literature from the second century CE onwards e.g. Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Julius Africanus]], and the [[Clementine literature|Letters attributed to St. Clement]]. It is also the view expressed in the modern canonical [[Amharic]] [[Bible translations (Amharic)|Ethiopian Orthodox Bible]]. In Judaism "Sons of God" usually refers to the righteous, i.e. the children of Seth.
* Angels: All of the earliest sources interpret the "sons of God" as angels. From the third century BCE onwards, references are found in the [[Book of Enoch|Enochic literature]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] the ([[Genesis Apocryphon]], the [[Damascus Document]], 4Q180), [[Jubilees]], the Testament of Reuben, [[2 Baruch]], [[Josephus]], and the book of Jude (compare with 2 Peter 2). This is also the meaning of the only two identical occurrences of bene ha elohim in the Hebrew Bible (Job 1:6 and 2:1), and of the most closely related expressions (refer to the list above). In the [[Septuagint]], the interpretive reading "angels" is found in [[Codex Alexandrinus]], one of four main witnesses to the Greek text.

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] traditionally adheres to the first interpretation, with some exceptions, and modern Jewish translations may translate bnei elohim as "sons of rulers" rather than "sons of God". Regardless, the second interpretation (sons of angels or other divine beings) is nonexistent in modern Judaism. This is reflected by the rejection of Enoch and other Apocrypha supporting the second interpretation from the Hebrew Bible Canon.

Joseph Hong believes that Genesis 6:1–4 has gone through drastic abridgment by either the original writer or later editors.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hong. ''Problems in an Obscure Passage.'' Notes on Genesis 6.1–4: The Bible Translator XL, 2, 1989, p.420&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1995|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nahum M. Sarna]] believes that the text defies certain interpretation, based on difficulties with the text's themes, extreme terseness, vocabulary, and syntax. Sarna postulates that such a passage cannot be other than a fragment, or bare outline, from a well-known fuller story.&lt;ref&gt;Sarna. ''Genesis'', JPSTC, 1989, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1995|p=21,24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ugaritic text====
[[Claus Westermann]] claims that the text of Genesis 6 is based on an [[Ugaritic]] [[wikt:urtext|urtext]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Westermann, ''Genesis'', BKAT 1/3. (Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1982), 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Ugaritic, a cognate phrase is ''bn 'il''.&lt;ref name="DDD,795"&gt;{{harvnb|DDD|1998|p=795}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur in the Ugaritic [[Baal Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith ''The Ugaritic Baal cycle'' 1994 p249 "all the divine sons" (or "all the sons of God"). ESA sources may support this point."&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Keilschrift Texte aus Ugarit|KTU]]² 1.40 demonstrates the use of ''bn il'' to mean "sons of gods".&lt;ref&gt;M. Dietrich, O. Loretz, J. Sanmartin ''Die keilalphabetischen Texte aus Ugarit'' 2d ed. (Munster: Ugarit-Verlag, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
* KTU² 1.65 (which may be a scribal exercise) uses ''bn il'' three times in succession: ''il bn il / dr bn il / mphrt bn il'' "El, the sons of gods, the circle of the sons of gods / the totality of the sons of gods."&lt;ref name="DDD,795"/&gt;

The phrase ''bn ilm'' ("sons of the gods") is also attested in Ugaritic texts,&lt;ref&gt;Jesús-Luis Cunchillos, Juan-Pablo Vita, ''A concordance of Ugaritic words'' 2003 p389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jesús-Luis Cunchillos, Juan-Pablo Vita, ''The texts of the Ugaritic data bank'' 2003 p82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin H. Pope ''El in the Ugaritic texts'' 1955 p49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahmouni, A. ''Divine epithets in the Ugaritic alphabetic texts'' 2008 p91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young G. D. ''Concordance of Ugaritic'' 1956 Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; as is the phrase ''phr bn ilm'' ("assembly of the sons of the gods").&lt;ref&gt;G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren ''Theological dictionary of the Old Testament'' 2000 p130&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the Ugarit corpus it is suggested that the ''bn ilm'' were the 70 sons of [[Asherah]] and [[El (deity)|El]], who were the titulary deities of the people of the known world, and their "[[Hieros gamos#Ancient Near East|hieros gamos]]" marriage with the daughters of men gave rise to their rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Simon B. |title=Ugaritic Literature and the Bible |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |volume=63 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=228–31 |jstor=3210794 |doi=10.2307/3210794}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence in 2 Samuel 7 that this may have been the case also in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/zatw.1961.73.2.202 |title=The Israelite King As Son of God |year=1961 |last1=Cooke |first1=Gerald |journal=Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=202–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late text====
J. Scharbert associates Genesis 6:1–4 with the [[Priestly source]] and the final [[redaction]] of the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref name="Davies,23"&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1995|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, he assigns the text to later editorial activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharbert, J. ''Traditions- und Redaktionsgeschichte von Gn 6'' 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rüdiger Bartelmus]] sees only Genesis 6:3 as a late insertion.&lt;ref name="Davies,23"/&gt;

[[Józef Milik]] and [[Matthew Black]] advanced the view of a late text addition to a text dependent on post-exilic, non-canonical tradition, such as the legend of the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] from the [[pseudepigraphic]] [[Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref name="Davies,23"/&gt;

====Translations====
Different source versions of Genesis 6:1–4 vary in their use of "sons of God". Some manuscripts of the [[Septuagint]] have emendations to read "sons of God" as "[[angel]]s".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} [[Codex Vaticanus]] contains "angels" originally.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In [[Codex Alexandrinus]] "sons of God" has been omitted and replaced by "angels".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2004|p=75, "Rahlfs (1971) reports that Alexandrinus was emended by another hand at 6.2 crossing out the word ''uioi'' and writing the word ''aggeloi''."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peshitta]] reads "sons of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Biblia Peshitta en español: traducción de los antiguos manuscritos arameos.''|year=2006|publisher=Holman Bible Publishers|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=9789704100001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan}}
The [[Book of Enoch]] and the [[Book of Jubilees]] refer to the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] who are paralleled to the "sons of God" in Genesis 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Epistle of Barnabas]] is considered by some to acknowledge the Enochian version.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Carleton Paget]], ''The Epistle of Barnabas: outlook and background'' 1994 - p10 "The quotation finds no precise equivalent in Enoch, which is probably explicable on the grounds that B. is inspired by something he remembers from Enoch at this point (see for a parallel to I Enoch 89:61-64; 90:17f.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

===Christian antiquity===
Early Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Eusebius]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Commodianus]] believed that the "sons of God" in Genesis 6:1–4 were [[fallen angel]]s who engaged in unnatural union with human women, resulting in the [[beget]]ting of the [[Nephilim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gg4BifSJH8C&amp;pg=PA1384#v=onepage&amp;q=nephilim&amp;f=false 1384]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Christians have argued against this view by reasoning on [[Jesus]]' comment in {{bibleref2|Matthew|22:30}} that [[angel]]s do not marry, although it only refers to angels in heaven.&lt;ref name="ZIBD,1384"/&gt; Others saw them as descendants of [[Seth]].&lt;ref name ="ZIBD,1384"/&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] subscribed to this view, based on the orations of [[Julius Africanus]] in his book ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', which refer to the "sons of God" as being descendants of [[Seth]] (or Sethites), the pure line of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. The "daughters of men" are viewed as the descendants of [[Cain]] (or [[Cainite]]s). Variations of this view were also received by Jewish philosophers.&lt;ref name="Bamberger, 150-1"/&gt;

=== Medieval Judaism ===
Traditionalists and philosophers of [[Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically practiced [[rational theology]]. They rejected any belief in rebel or fallen angels since [[evil]] was considered abstract. Rabbinic sources, most notably the [[Targum]], state that the "sons of God" who married the daughters of men were merely human beings of exalted social station.&lt;ref name="Bamberger,149"&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been considered as pagan royalty&lt;ref name ="ZIBD,1384"/&gt; or members of nobility&lt;ref name="Bamberger,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, out of lust, married women from the general population. Other variations of this interpretation define these "sons of God" as tyrannical [[Ancient Near East]]ern kings who were honored as divine rulers, engaging in polygamous behavior.&lt;ref name ="ZIBD,1384"/&gt; No matter the variation in views, the primary concept by Jewish rationalists is that the "sons of God" were of human origin.&lt;ref name="Bamberger,149"/&gt;

Most notable Jewish writers in support for the view of human "sons of God" were 
[[Saadia]], [[Rashi]], [[Lekah Tob]], [[Aggada|Midrash Aggada]], [[Joseph Bekor Shor]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[Maimonides]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Nahmanides]], [[Hizkuni]], Bahya Ashur. [[Gersonides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|pp=149, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shimon bar Yochai|Shimeon ben Yochai]] and [[Hillel ben Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jung|''2004 Reprint''|pp=66, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Ezra reasoned that the "sons of God" were men who possessed divine power, by means of [[astrology|astrological]] knowledge, able to beget children of unusual size and strength.&lt;ref name="Bamberger,150"/&gt;

Jewish commentator [[Isaac Abrabanel]] considered the ''[[aggadot]]'' on Genesis 6 to have referred to some secret doctrine and was not to be taken literally. Abrabanel later joined [[Nahmanides]] and [[Levi ben Gerson]] in promoting the concept that the "sons of God" were the older generations who were closer to physical perfection, as [[Adam and Eve]] were perfect. Though there are variations of this view, the primary idea was that Adam and Eve's perfect attributes were passed down from generation to generation. However, as each generation passed, their perfect physical attributes diminished. Thus, the early generations were mightier than the succeeding ones. The physical decline of the younger generations continued until the [[Great Deluge|Flood]], to the point that their days were numbered as stated in Genesis 6:3. It was immoral for the older generations to consort with the younger generations, whereby puny women begot unusually large children. ''Nephilim'' was even considered a stature.&lt;ref name="Bamberger, 150-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|pp=150, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Anatoli]] and [[Isaac Arama]] viewed the groups and events in Genesis 6:1–4 as an [[allegory]], primarily for the [[sin]] of [[lust]] that declined man's higher nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bamberger|2006|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Journalism|journalistic]] parlance, '''spiking''' refers to withholding a story from publication for reasons pertaining to its veracity (whether or not it conforms to the facts). Spiking is relatively rare and usually happens late in the editing process (after the assigning [[Editor#Periodicals|editor]] has signed off on it). It is only required when a simple edit or questioning the reporter or assigning editor cannot fix the problem.

Reasons for spiking include a clear bias (someone on an opposing side of an issue did not respond, despite the fact that said response is central to the story), a major hole (many, if not most, readers will have a question after reading the story), a sudden change in events (three more people have died, but getting details from officials is impossible on deadline), or suspicions of plagiarism or other ethical violations on the part of the author.

In some cases, a story may be spiked if it is deemed to conflict with the commercial interests of the newspaper's publisher: if, for example, it concerns a company with which the publisher has a close relationship. This is more likely at a local level, where small newspapers are dependent on advertising revenue from businesses such as estate agents and recruitment agencies.

Stories are spiked for other reasons, but the decision is not taken lightly, as a valid, usually detailed explanation will be solicited by those further up the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], often at the behest of the reporter.

The '''Tibetic languages''' ({{bo|t=བོད་སྐད།}}) are a cluster of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] descended from [[Old Tibetan]], spoken across a wide area of eastern Central Asia bordering the [[Indian subcontinent]], including the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and the [[Himalayas]] in [[Baltistan]], [[Ladakh]], [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]],  [[Bhutan]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. [[Classical Tibetan]] is a major regional literary language, particularly for its use in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] literature.

The [[Central Tibetan language]] (the dialects of [[Ü-Tsang]], including [[Lhasa]]), [[Khams Tibetan]], and [[Amdo Tibetan]] are generally considered to be dialects of a single language, especially since they all share the same literary language, while [[Dzongkha]], [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]], [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], and [[Balti language|Balti]] are generally considered to be separate languages.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Tibetic languages are spoken by some 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |given=Nicolas |surname=Tournadre |chapter=The Tibetic languages and their classification |pages=103–129 |title=Trans-Himalayan Linguistics: Historical and Descriptive Linguistics of the Himalayan Area |editor1-given=Thomas |editor1-surname=Owen-Smith |editor2-given=Nathan W. |editor2-surname=Hill |publisher=De Gruyter |year=2014 |isbn=978-3-11-031074-0 }} ([http://www.nicolas-tournadre.net/wp-content/uploads/multimedia/2014-The_Tibetic_languages.pdf preprint])&lt;/ref&gt;
With the worldwide spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the Tibetan language has spread into the western world and can be found in many [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist publications]] and prayer materials; with some western students learning the language for translation of Tibetan texts. Outside Lhasa itself, [[Lhasa Tibetan]] is spoken by approximately 200,000 exile speakers who have moved from modern-day Tibet to [[India]] and other countries. Tibetan is also spoken by groups of ethnic minorities in Tibet who have lived in close proximity to Tibetans for centuries, but nevertheless retain their own languages and cultures.

Although some of the [[Qiang people]]s of [[Kham]] are classified by [[China]] as ethnic Tibetans (see [[rGyalrongic languages]]; rGyalrong people are identified as 'Tibetan' in China), [[Qiangic languages]] are not Tibetic, but rather form their own branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family.

[[Classical Tibetan]] was not a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]], but some varieties such as Central and Khams Tibetan have developed tone registers. Amdo and Ladakhi-Balti are without tone. Tibetic morphology can generally be described as [[agglutination|agglutinative]].

== Languages ==
Nicolas Tournadre (2008) describes the language situation of Tibetan as follows:{{quote|Based on my 20 years of field work throughout the Tibetan language area and on the existing literature, I estimate that there are 220 'Tibetan dialects' derived from Old Tibetan and nowadays spread across 5 countries: China, India, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan [which] may be classed within 25 dialect groups, i.e. groups which do not allow mutual intelligibility. The notion of ‘dialect group’ is equivalent to the notion of language but does not entail any standardization. Thus if we set aside the notion of standardization, I believe it would be more appropriate to speak of 25 languages derived from Old Tibetan. This is not only a terminological issue but it gives an entirely different perception of the range of variation. When we refer to 25 languages, we make clear that we are dealing with a family comparable in size to the Romance family which has 19 groups of dialects.&lt;ref&gt;
Tournadre N. (2008), "Arguments against the Concept of ‘Conjunct’/‘Disjunct’ in Tibetan" in Chomolangma, Demawend und Kasbek. Festschrift für Roland Bielmeier zu seinem 65. Geburtstag. B. Huber, M. Volkart, P. Widmer, P. Schwieger, (Eds), Vol 1. p. 281–308. http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2008-Conjunct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 25 languages include a dozen major dialect clusters:
:[[Central Tibetan language|Central Tibetan]] ([[Ü-Tsang]]), [[Khams Tibetan|Khams]] ([[Chamdo]], [[Sichuan]], [[Qinghai]], [[Yunnan]]), [[Amdo Tibetan|Amdo]] (Qinghai, [[Gansu]], Sichuan), [[Choni language|Choni]] (Gansu, Sichuan), [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] ([[Jammu and Kashmir]]), [[Balti language|Balti]] ([[Gilgit-Baltistan]]), [[Burig]] (Jammu and Kashmir), [[Lahuli–Spiti language|Lahuli–Spiti]] ([[Himachal Pradesh]]), [[Dzongkha]] ([[Bhutan]]), [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]] ([[Sikkim]]), [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]] ([[Nepal]], [[Tibet]]), [[Kyirong-Kagate language|Kyirong-Kagate]] (Nepal, Tibet) 
and another dozen minor clusters or single dialects, mostly spoken by a few hundred to a few thousand people:
:[[Jirel language|Jirel]] (Nepal), [[Chocangaca language|Chocangaca]] (Bhutan), [[Lakha language|Lakha]] (Bhutan), [[Brokkat language|Brokkat]] (Bhutan), [[Brokpa language|Brokpa]] (Bhutan), [[Groma language|Groma]] (Tibet), [[Zhongu Tibetan language|Zhongu]] (Sichuan), [[Gserpa language|Gserpa]] (Sichuan), [[Khalong Tibetan language|Khalong]] (Sichuan), [[Dongwang Tibetan language|Dongwang]] (Yunnan), [[Zitsadegu language|Zitsadegu]] (Sichuan) and [[Drugchu language|Drugchu]] (Gansu).

In addition, there is [[Baima language|Baima]], which retains an apparent Qiangic substratum, and has multiple layers of borrowing from Amdo, Khams, and Zhongu, but does not correspond to any established branch of Tibetic.&lt;ref&gt;Katia Chirkova, 2008, "On the position of Báimǎ within Tibetan", in Lubotsky et al (eds), ''Evidence and Counter-Evidence'', vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The more divergent dialects such as this are spoken in the north and east near the [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] and [[Rgyalrongic languages]], and some, such as Khalong, may also be due to [[language shift]].

The Tibetic languages used for broadcasting within China are [[Standard Tibetan]] (based on the Ü dialect of [[Lhasa]] and used as a [[lingua franca]] throughout [[Ü-Tsang]]), Khams and Amdo.

Tournadre (2013) adds [[Tseku language|Tseku]] and [[Khamba language|Khamba]] to Khams, and groups Thewo-Chone, Zhongu, Baima as an Eastern branch of Tibetic.

===Bradley (1997)===
According to Bradley,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623162537/http://www.isw2.unibe.ch/tibet/Dialects.htm Bradley (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; the languages cluster as follows (dialect information from the ''Tibetan Dialects Project'' at the University of Bern):

*'''Western Archaic Tibetan''' (non-tonal), including [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], [[Balti language|Balti]] and [[Burig]]
*'''[[Amdo Tibetan]]''' (including [[Choni language|Thewo-Chone]]) (non-tonal)
*'''[[Khams Tibetan]]''' (tonal)
*'''[[Lahuli–Spiti language|Western Innovative Tibetan]]''' (Lahuli–Spiti) (slightly tonal)
*:Dialects of Upper [[Ladakh]] and [[Zanskar]], of the Northwest Indian Border Area ([[Lahaul and Spiti district]] and [[Uttarakhand]]), and of [[Zanda County]] (westernmost Tibet)
*'''[[Central Tibetan language|Central Tibetan]]'''&lt;!-- including but not synonymous with '''Dbus''' {{sc|aka}} '''Ü''']] (alternative romanisations of {{IPA-bo|wy˧˥˧ʔ|}}) in Bradley's classification --&gt; (slightly tonal)
*:Most dialects of [[Ngari Prefecture]] in western Tibet, of the northern Nepalese border area in Nepal, [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] dialects of [[Shigatse Prefecture]], and [[Ü (region)|Ü]] dialects ([[Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture|Lhokha]], [[Lhasa]], etc.). The basis of [[Standard Tibetan]]. 
*'''Northern Tibetan''' (slightly tonal)
*:Dialects of [[Gêrzê County|Gêrzê]], of [[Nagqu Prefecture]] in north-central Tibet, and of [[Nangqên County]] in South [[Qinghai]]&lt;br&gt;(Considered dialects of Khams by Tournadre)
*'''Southern Tibetan''' (slightly tonal)
*:[[Groma language]] of [[Chumbi Valley]] in southern Tsang, [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]] in India, [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]] and [[Jirel language|Jirel]] in Nepal, and various languages of [[Bhutan]]:&lt;br&gt;[[Dzongkha]], [[Brokkat language|Brokkat]], [[Brokpa language|Brokpa]], [[Chocangaca language|Chocangaca]], [[Lakha language|Lakha]], [[Laya dialect]], [[Lunana dialect]].

;Other
Some classifications group Khams and Amdo together as Eastern Tibetan (not to be confused with [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish]], whose speakers are not ethnically Tibetan). Some, like Tournadre, break up Central Tibetan. Phrases such as 'Central Tibetan' and 'Central Bodish' may or may not be synonymous: Southern (Central) Tibetan can be found as Southern Bodish, for example; 'Central Tibetan' may mean dBus or all tonal lects apart from Khams; 'Western Bodish' may be used for the non-tonal western lects while 'Western Tibetan' is used for the tonal lects, or 'Bodish' may even be used for other branches of the [[Tibeto-Kanauri languages]].

== Writing systems ==
{{Main|Tibetan script|Tibetan braille}}
Most Tibetic languages are written in one of two [[Indic script]]s. [[Standard Tibetan]] and most other Tibetic languages are written in the [[Tibetan script]] with a historically conservative orthography (see below) that helps unify the Tibetan-language area. Some other Tibetan languages (in India and Nepal) are written in the related [[Devanagari]] script, which is also used to write [[Hindi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and many other languages. However, some [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] and [[Balti language|Balti]] speakers write with the [[Urdu script]]; this occurs almost exclusively in [[Pakistan]]. The Tibetan script fell out of use in Pakistani [[Baltistan]] hundreds of years ago upon the region's adoption of [[Islam]]. However, increased concern among [[Balti people]] for the preservation of [[Balti language|their language]] and traditions, especially in the face of strong [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] cultural influence throughout Pakistan, has fostered renewed interest in reviving the Tibetan script and using it alongside the Arabic-Persian script. Many shops in Baltistan's capital [[Skardu]] in Pakistan's "Northern Areas" region have begun supplementing signs written in the Arabic-Persian script with signs written in the Tibetan script. Baltis see this initiative not as separatist but rather as part of an attempt to preserve the cultural aspects of their region which has shared a close history with neighbors like [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]] and Punjabis since the arrival of Islam in the region many centuries ago.

[[Old Tibetan]] phonology is rather accurately rendered by the script. The finals were pronounced devoiced although they are written as voiced, the prefix letters assimilated their voicing to the root letters. The graphic combinations ''hr'' and ''lh'' represent voiceless and not necessarily aspirate correspondences to ''r'' and ''l'' respectively. The letter ' was pronounced as a voiced guttural fricative before vowels but as homorganic prenasalization before consonants. Whether the gigu ''verso'' had phonetic meaning or not remains controversial.

For instance, ''Srongbtsan Sgampo'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[sroŋpʦan zɡampo]}} (now pronounced {{IPA|[sɔ́ŋʦɛ̃ ɡʌ̀mpo]}} in Lhasa Tibetan) and '''babs'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[mbaps]}} (pronounced {{IPA|[bapˤ]}}{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--I don't think Tibetan has pharyngeals--&gt; in Lhasa Tibetan).

Already in the 9th century the process of cluster simplification, devoicing and tonogenesis had begun in the central dialects can be shown with Tibetan words transliterated in other languages, particularly [[Middle Chinese]] but also [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].

The concurrence of the evidence indicated above enables us to form the following outline of the evolution of Tibetan. In the 9th century, as shown by the bilingual Tibetan–[[Chinese language|Chinese]] treaty of 821–822 found in front of [[Lhasa]]'s [[Jokhang]], the complex initial clusters had already been reduced, and the process of tonogenesis was likely well underway.

The next change took place in Tsang (Gtsang) dialects: The ''ra''-tags were altered into [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] consonants, and the ''ya''-tags became palatals.

Later on the superscribed letters and finals ''d'' and ''s'' disappeared, except in the east and west. It was at this stage that the language spread in Lahul and Spiti, where the superscribed letters were silent, the ''d'' and ''g'' finals were hardly heard, and ''as'', ''os'', ''us'' were ''ai'', ''oi'', ''ui''. The words introduced from Tibet into the border languages at that time differ greatly from those introduced at an earlier period.

The other changes are more recent and restricted to Ü and Tsang. In Ü, the vowel sounds  ''a'', ''o'', ''u'' have now mostly [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauted]] to ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'' when followed by the coronal sounds ''i'', ''d'', ''s'', ''l'' and ''n''. The same holds for Tsang with the exception of ''l'' which merely lengthens the vowel. The medials have become [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] tenues with a low intonation, which also marks the words having a simple initial consonant; while the former aspirates and the complex initials simplified in speech are uttered with a high tone, shrill and rapidly.

==Reconstruction==
===Proto-Tibetic===
Proto-Tibetic, the hypothetical [[proto-language]] ancestral to the Tibetic languages, has been reconstructed by Tournadre (2014).&lt;ref name="Tournadre2014"/&gt; Proto-Tibetic is similar to, but not identical to, written [[Classical Tibetan|Classical Literary Tibetan]]. The following phonological features are characteristic of Proto-Tibetic (Tournadre 2014: 113).
*The prefixes &lt;nowiki&gt;*s(ǝ)-, *d(ǝ)-/g(ǝ)-, *m(ǝ)-, and *b(ǝ)-&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which have been retained from [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman]]. *s(ǝ)- is primarily used with animals and body parts, as well as *d(ǝ)-/*g(ǝ)- and *m(ǝ)-/*r(ǝ)-.
*[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[alveolar consonant]]s before ''y'' (/j/).
*Consonant change from [[lateral consonant|lateral]] to [[dental consonant|dental]] position after /m/ (e.g., *ml &gt; *md).
*Distinctive aspirated initial stops. This phenomenon is attested by alternating aspirated and non-aspirated consonants in [[Old Tibetan]] orthography. Examples include gcig ~ gchig (གཅིག་ ~ གཆིག་) ‘one’; phyin-chad ~ phyin-cad (ཕྱིན་ཆད་ ~ ཕྱིན་ཅད་) ‘from now on’; ci ~ chi (ཅི་ ~ ཆི་) ‘what’; and cu ~ chu (ཅུ་ ~ ཆུ་) ‘water’.

Reconstructed Proto-Tibetic forms from Tournadre (2014) include:
{{refbegin|3}}
* *g(ǝ)-tɕik ‘one’
* *g(ǝ)-nyis ‘two’
* *g(ǝ)-su- ‘three’
* *b(ǝ)-ʑi ‘four’
* *l(ǝ)-ŋa ‘five’
* *d(ǝ)-ruk ‘six’
* *b(ǝ)-dun ‘seven’
* *b(ǝ)-rgyat ‘eight’
* *d(ǝ)-gu ‘nine’
* *b(ǝ)-tɕu ‘ten’
* *s(ǝ)-dik-pa ‘scorpion’
* *s(ǝ)-bal ‘frog’
* *s(ǝ)-tak ‘tiger’
* *s(ǝ)-b-rul ‘snake’
* *s(ǝ)-pra ‘monkey’
* *s(ǝ)-kra ‘hair’
* *s(ǝ)-nyiŋ ‘heart’
* *s(ǝ)-na ‘nose’
* *d(ǝ)-myik ‘eye’
* *m(ǝ)-go ‘head’
* *r(ǝ)-na ‘ear’
{{refend}}

===Pre-Tibetic===
Pre-Tibetic is a hypothetical pre-formation stage of Proto-Tibetic.&lt;ref name="Tournadre2014"/&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*ty, *ly, *sy&lt;/nowiki&gt; were not palatalized in Pre-Tibetic, but underwent [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] in Proto-Tibetic (Tournadre 2014: 113-114).&lt;ref name="Tournadre2014"/&gt; Posited [[sound change]]s from Pre-Tibetic to Proto-Tibetic include *ty &gt; *tɕ, *sy &gt; *ɕ, *tsy &gt; *tɕ, and *ly &gt; *ʑ. However, Tournadre (2014: 114) notes that many [[Bodish languages]] such as [[Basum language|Basum]], [[Tamang language|Tamang]], and [[Kurtöp language|Kurtöp]] ([[East Bodish languages|East Bodish]]) have not undergone these changes (e.g., Bake ([[Basum language|Basum]]) ''ti'' ‘what’ vs. Proto-Tibetic *tɕ(h)i and Bake ''tɨ'' ‘one’ vs. Proto-Tibetic *g(ǝ)-tɕ(h)ik; Kurtöp ''&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;la:'' ‘iron’ and [[Bumthang language|Bumthap]] ''lak'' ‘iron’ vs. Proto-Tibetic *ltɕaks).

'''Topping''' is a process by which a [[mower]] or similar implement is used to "top", or remove, the aerial part of a [[crop]], in order to prevent [[seed]] formation and [[Biological dispersal|distribution]] onto the soil. Typically, a set-aside [[cover crop]] is topped in July or August, to prevent seed production and subsequent soil contamination leading to [[germination]] and regrowth.  For example, controlling the spread of [[Juncus effusus|Soft rush or Juncus Effusus]] on wet land, such as [[Purple Moor and Rush Pastures]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">In [[manufacturing]], an '''undercut''' is a special type of recessed surface. In [[turning]], it refers to a recess in a diameter. In [[machining]], it refers to a recess in a corner. In [[molding (process)|molding]], it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In [[printed circuit board]], construction it refers to the portion of the copper that is [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] away under the [[photoresist]]. In [[welding]], it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead. 

==Turning==
[[File:Undercut turning.png|thumb|400px|An example of a turned part with and without an undercut]]

On turned parts an undercut is also known as a ''neck'' or "relief groove". They are often used at the end of the threaded portion of a shaft or [[screw]] to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as ''thread relief'' in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least {{convert|0.015|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the [[minor diameter]] of the thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Thread relief and chamfers | url = http://www.pmpa.org/technology/design/threadrelief.htm | work = PMPA's Designer's Guide | publisher = Precision Machined Products Association | accessdate = 2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread.  Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter.  They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on [[technical drawing]]s by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2004|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molding==
[[File:Ondersnijding.gif|thumb|left|A simple example of molding an external undercut]]
Undercut - Any indentation or protrusion in a shape that will prevent its withdrawal from a one-piece mold.

Undercuts on molded parts are features that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an [[injection molding machine]]. They are categorized into ''internal'' and ''external'' undercuts, where external undercuts are on the exterior of the part and interior undercuts are on the inside of the part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a ''[[side action]]'' or ''side pull''.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt; This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berins|Society of the Plastics Industry|1991|pp=325–326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosato|Plastics Institute of America|Schott|Rosato|2001|pp=1405–1406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the size of the undercut is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of [[stripper pin]]s so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Milling==
[[File:Undercut machining.png|thumb|400px|An example of a machining undercut]]

In milling the corners may be undercut to remove the radius that is usually left by the [[milling cutter]]. Examples of this use are linear bearings for square shafts (i.e. [[rack and pinion|racks]]) and machined hexalobular sockets.

{{clear}}

==Etching==
[[File:Etch anisotropy.png|thumb|left|upright|{{ordered list |An isotropic etchant that creates an undercut |An anisotropic etchant leaves no undercut}}]]
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}

Undercuts from etching are somewhat different than the undercuts explained above, because it is a side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the [[Chemical milling|etchant]] was applied too long. The second is due to an [[isotropic]] etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an [[anisotropic]] etchant is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Welding==
[[File:Welding undercut.svg|thumb]]

Undercutting is when the weld reduces the cross-sectional thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces the strength of the weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression along the length of the weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough [[filler metal]] along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater [[temperature gradient]]s between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rampaul|2003|pp=211–212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urkers''' is the local language of the municipality and former island of [[Urk]], located on the west coast of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Flevoland]]. Urk was an island until the middle of the 20th century. It was originally located in the [[Zuiderzee]], a bay of the [[North sea]], which became an inland sea called [[IJsselmeer]] when a dam was built to secure the Dutch coast against floods. Inhabitants of Urk had been mostly fishermen and still predominantly make their living from North Sea fishing.

Urkers is part of the [[dialect continuum]] that links [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects in the North and East of Urk to the [[Lower Franconian]] dialects, mainly in the South, West, and North-West of Urk. Standard Dutch, and [[Afrikaans]] are also part of the Lower Franconian group. Urkers is considered a part of the [[Low German|Low Saxon]] group of languages despite the fact that it is quite extreme in that group and both geographically and linguistically at its edge. Lower Saxon has its main distribution in Northern Germany in the federal states [[Lower Saxony]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. For native speakers from those areas, it is unlikely to understand Urkers well.

== Authors ==
The author Gerrit Pasterkamp has written books in Urkers, including translations of the Jewish and Christian [[Psalms]] and [[belletristic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gbugrafici.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=109&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is at least one band, Leuster, that publishes some of their songs sung in Urkers on CD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opurk.nl/nieuws/13166.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentation ==
There is a [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online dictionary of Urkers and Dutch. The Urkers Dialect Circle has a small website collecting data on Urkers, including sample texts. See [[#Websites|Websites]], below.

== Recognition ==
Urkers is not recognized as a minority language by the Dutch government. A request to have an [[ISO 639-3]] code assigned to Urkers was deferred due to incomplete treatment of the scope the rest of [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2009-039 ISO change request 2009-039]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian statistics list Vlach and Romanian languages separately depending on what people declared in the census. This, however, does not mean that Serbian government has official position whether Vlach and Romanian are separate languages. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] hadn't assigned it a separate language code to the [[ISO 639]] standard. In the 2002 census, 40,054 people in Serbia declared themselves ethnic Vlachs and 54,818 people declared themselves native speakers of the Vlach language.

The Vlach language does not have any official status and it is not standardized,&lt;ref name="Danas"&gt;''[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]'' [http://www.danas.rs/20070319/hronika3.html "Svedeni smo na vlaško kolo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725141405/http://www.danas.rs/20070319/hronika3.html |date=25 July 2011 }}, 19 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; thus some members of Vlach community ask for official usage of standard Romanian in the areas inhabited by Vlachs until the standardization of the Vlach language.&lt;ref name="Danas"/&gt;

For historical reasons connected with the multicultural region of [[Vojvodina]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is listed as a separate language in latest Serbian census, the number of its speakers was 34,515, while 34,576 people declared themselves as ethnic [[Romanians]]. The declared Vlach speakers are mostly concentrated in eastern Serbia, mainly in the [[Timočka Krajina]] region and adjacent areas, while declared Romanian speakers are mostly concentrated in [[Vojvodina]].

According to some sources in the media, Serbia recognized "Romanian" as the native language of the Vlach community, through the act of confirmation of the ''National Council of the Vlach (Roumanian) National Minority'' in August 2007; the organization had listed Romanian as the native language of the community in their statute.{{vn|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2007/08/070817_vlahi_serbia_minoritate.shtml "Vlachs of Serbia recognised as a national minority"] (''"Vlahii din Serbia recunoscuţi ca minoritate naţională"''), published by BBC on 17 August 2007: "Vlachs were finally recognised as a national minority and the Romanian language was accepted as their native language"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protv.ro/filme/limba-romana-recunoscuta-drept-limba-materna-in-serbia.html?id_file=27625#27625 Ştirile ProTV: "Romanian language recognised as native language in Serbia"] (''"Limba română recunoscută drept limbă maternă în Serbia"''], news report made by Ştirile [[ProTV]] on 19 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardianul.ro/2007/08/03/externe-c3/serbia_a_recunoscut_ca_vlahii_din_timoc_vorbesc_rom_neste-s98924.html "Serbia recognised that the Vlachs of Timoc speak Romanian"] (''"Serbia a recunoscut că «vlahii» din Timoc vorbesc româneşte"''), published in [[Gardianul]], 3 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Its two main variants, '''Ungurean''' and '''Țăran''', are subordonated forms of the Romanian varieties spoken in [[Banat]] and [[Oltenia]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The speakers have been isolated from Romania and their speech did not keep up with the neologisms (for some abstract notions, as well as technological, political and scientific concepts) borrowed by the Romanian speakers on the other shore of the Danube from French and Italian and as such, they're using Serbian counterparts instead, as Serbian has been the language of education for nearly two centuries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Name==
The term "''Vlach''" is the English transcription of the Serbian term used to describe this language (''vlaški''), while "''Romanian''" or "''Roumanian''" is the English transcription of its Vlach/Romanian counterpart (''român/rumân'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=147558&amp;data=2004-05-17 |title=Ziua.net |access-date=24 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218010157/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2004-05-17&amp;id=147558 |archive-date=18 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2004.rgnpress.ro/index.php?option=com_ab_calendar&amp;month=09&amp;year=2004&amp;day=02&amp;Itemid=1 Interview with Predrag Balašević, president of the Romanian/Vlach Democratic Party of Serbia]:  "We all know that we call ourselves in Romanian Romanians and in Serbian Vlachs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Further on, the Vlach Democratic Party of Serbia is called "Partidul Democrat al Rumânilor din Sârbia" and "Vlaška Demokratska Stranka" (Влашка демократска странка) in Serbian. This happens also with the others institutions of the [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlach minority]].
