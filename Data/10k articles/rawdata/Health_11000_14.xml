      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5058">The '''2009 Chinese lead poisoning scandal''' occurred in the [[Shaanxi]] province of [[China]] when pollution from a [[lead]] plant [[lead poisoning|poisoned]] children in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6832217.ece ''China uses fear to hush up poisoned children'']&lt;/ref&gt; Over 850 were affected. Villagers have accused the local and central governments of covering up the scandal.

==History==
In 2003 the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Company set up a factory in the Changqing [[Township (People's Republic of China)|township]]&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6061009/More-than-1300-children-fall-ill-near-Chinese-smelting-plants.html ''More than 1,300 children fall ill near Chinese smelting plants'']&lt;/ref&gt; near the city of [[Baoji]], describing it in brochures as "a garden-like factory".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Soon "100,000 [[ton]]s of lead and [[zinc]] a year and 700,000 tons of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]" were being produced. In 2008 it paid more than [[£]]10m in taxes to the local government,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; 17% of the administration's total income, and provided jobs for 2,000 households.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; Local parents however noticed that children were showing signs of illness - such as nose bleeds and memory problems.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; 851 children from seven villages surrounding the plant displayed up to 10 times the level of lead in their blood deemed safe by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Over 170 of the children had to be hospitalised.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSPEK183380 ''More parents protest against lead poisoning in China'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Local villagers protested to authorities but claim they were ignored. On 17 August 2009 they attacked the plant causing the managers to flee. The plant has now been closed down, but according to Western reports all coverage in the Chinese media of events has now been banned.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Chinese lead supplies the country's [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] industry, the world's largest.&lt;ref name=mnn/&gt; Lead poisoning can lead to [[anaemia]], [[muscle]] weakness and [[brain damage]]&lt;ref name=Reu/&gt; and damages the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[reproductive system]]s.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

[[The Times]] reported in September 2009 that "similar protests broke out in three other provinces, where horrified parents living near smelters of lead, [[copper]] and [[aluminium]] also learnt that their children had been poisoned—1,300 of them in one city alone".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Villages that suffer from such pollution are often dubbed '[[cancer village]]s".&lt;ref name=mnn&gt;{{cite web|title='Lead poisoning haunts Chinese smelter communities' |url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/health/stories/lead-poisoning-haunts-chinese-smelter-communities |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrTonuYe?url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/health/stories/lead-poisoning-haunts-chinese-smelter-communities |archivedate=17 September 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-09-14 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child health is an important issue in China, where many families are restricted to just one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/health/stories/2nd-lead-poisoning-case-hits-china-1300-sick |title=''2nd lead poisoning case hits China, 1,300 sick'' |access-date=14 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825214352/http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/health/stories/2nd-lead-poisoning-case-hits-china-1300-sick |archive-date=25 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nearly 2,000 children were poisoned in the Shaanxi and Hunan provinces.&lt;ref name="Watts09-Lancet"&gt;{{Cite journal

"Emergency wards and intensive care units were often strained, few health systems were overwhelmed ... Schools closed, but borders remained open, and disruptions to travel and trade were far less severe than feared," she told delegates from the agency's 193 member states.

==Biography==
Rama Rao was born on 2 April 1935&lt;ref name="IAS Fellow" /&gt; in [[Guntur]], a coastal city in the south Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]],&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arkat-usa.org/get-file/19842/ | title=Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction | publisher=Arkat USA | date=2015 | accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a government employee as one of his nine children.&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moneylife.in/article/interview-with-dr-av-rama-rao-of-avra-laboratories/4981.html | title=I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India | publisher=Money Life | date=26 April 2010 | accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his father had to work at various places due to frequent transfers, he stayed with his grand parents at Guntur during his school days. He graduated in chemistry (BSc) from A. C. College&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt; of [[Andhra University]] in 1956 and worked for one year at his alma mater as a demonstrator,&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt; before moving to Mumbai to secure his post graduate degree in Pharmaceuticals and Fine Chemicals from the [[University Department of Chemical Technology]] (UDCT) of [[Mumbai University]] in 1960. This was followed by doctoral studies under the guidance of K. Venkataraman, the first Indian director of the [[National Chemical Laboratory]] (NCL),&lt;ref name="Prof.George delivers Prof.Venkataraman memorial lecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hgxh.alljournal.ac.cn/cn/ch/industrynews/industrynews_view_list.aspx?id=201107120557193560 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002165354/http://hgxh.alljournal.ac.cn/cn/ch/industrynews/industrynews_view_list.aspx?id=201107120557193560 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=Prof.George delivers Prof.Venkataraman memorial lecture |publisher=All Journal |date=2015 |accessdate=September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain a PhD in 1965. He continued his research at NCL, working there as a B Grade Scientist, till 1975 when he joined [[Elias James Corey]], 1991 Nobel laureate in Chemistry, at [[Harvard University]] for a two-year stint at research along with the American organic chemist.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; He returned to India in 1977 and continued his researches at NCL for another eight years.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; In 1985, he was appointed as the director of the [[Indian Institute of Chemical Technology]] (IICT) (then known as Regional Research Laboratory) where he worked till 1995.&lt;ref name="Time line IICT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iictindia.org/(S(dtsl5ynfthe15f22pypssg45))/GProfile.aspx?opt=timeline |title=Time line IICT |publisher=Indian Institute of Chemical Technology |date=2015 |accessdate=September 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118003243/http://www.iictindia.org/%28S%283grrzc45ozcazs45eelmc545%29%29/GProfile.aspx?opt=timeline |archivedate=November 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his superannuation from IICT, he founded Avra Laboratories, at [[Hyderabad]], then capital of [[Andhra Pradesh]], for ''high end contract research'' and manufacture of intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients for the medical industry. The company operates out of three centres in Hyderabad and one in [[Visakhapatanam]].&lt;ref name="AVRA Lab" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Rao's researchers, in the beginning, was focused on synthetic dyes and advanced studies on plant and insect pigments.&lt;ref name="INSA profile" /&gt; His elucidation of the structure of the [[lac]] dye as a composition of four different constituents, A, B, C and D variants of the Laccaic acid was one of his early achievements.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; Working further on the biogenetic origin of the product, he explored other insect pigments such as Kermesic acid, Erythrolaccin, Ceroalbolinic acid which led to the revision of the established concepts of their origin.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; His researches led to the isolation of 100 new compounds from plants and insects.&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt; Association with [[Elias James Corey|Corey]] at Harvard University shifted his focus to studies related to the synthesis of biologically active natural products and he turned his attention to antitumor [[antibiotics]], [[macrolide]], [[immunosuppressants]] and [[cyclic peptides]].&lt;ref name="INSA profile" /&gt; After his return to India and resuming his career at NCL, he set up a school for synthesis of biofunctional molecules.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; Later, he guided the [[Indian Institute of Chemical Technology]] to become one of the top schools in India and introduced private and public sector industry participation in the research projects of the institution. The laboratory he established at IICT was fully funded by the members of the industry.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; He has mentored 109 research scholars in their doctoral studies as well as several post doctoral fellows.&lt;ref name="INSA profile" /&gt;

The contributions of Rama Rao are reported to be noteworthy in the area of [[organic synthesis]], especially asymmetric synthesis. He is known to have developed cheaper methodology for the synthesis of anti-tumour antibiotics such as [[Anthracyclines]], Fredericamycin-A, Cervinomycins A1 and A2, Aronorosin, and [[Lavendamycin]].&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; He evolved a new method for the construction of the spiro[2,2]-nonane system, a constituent of Fredericamycin A, a first time achievement in the world, and succeeded in its total synthesis.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; He proposed alternative methodologies for the synthesis of MeBmt, a variety of amino acid present in cyclosporin-A and of FK-506k, a 23-membered macrolide with 14-asymmetric carbons, which are reported to be noteworthy achievements in the field of asymmetric synthesis.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; His work also covered the synthesis of [[depsipeptides]] such as Jaspamide and Geodiamolides and [[macrolides]], namely [[Zearalenone]], [[Rifamycin]]-S, [[Rhizoxin]] and [[Rapamycin]].&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt;

Rao is the pioneer of [[Chiral synthesis]] and technology in India and is known to have synthesized compounds of high structural diversity like Coriolic acid, Dimorphicolic acid, β-Lactam antibiotics, Azamacrolides, [[Camptothecin]], Andrimid and [[Chrysanthemic acid]].&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; His work on K-13 has been adopted for the synthesis of [[Vancomycin]] and has helped in the synthesis of vancomycinic acid and the biphenyl segment of Vancomycin.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; [[Cipla]], an Indian drug manufacturer, utilised the cost effective methodology Rao introduced in the manufacture of [[Azidothymidine]] (AZT), the first curative drug in the disease management of [[AIDS]]. His researches have also helped in the synthesis of the HIV inhibitors namely Betzalladines, Calanolides, Mischellamines and Abbot's [[protease]] inhibitor.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; Cipla have acknowledged Rao's contributions in the formulations of several drugs such as [[Salbutamol]], [[Vinblastine]], [[Vincristine]] and [[Etoposide]], apart from AZT.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt;

In 1995, when Rao set out to establish his own research centre, Avra Laboratories, several agencies such as Dai-ichi Karkaria, [[G.D. Searle, LLC]] and [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] provided him financial and infrastructural assistance. He undertook several research assignments under the aegis of the centre for drug manufacturers like [[G.D. Searle, LLC|G. D. Searle]], [[Pfizer]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]];&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt; his successful assignment of stabilizing a molecule with anti-asthmatic properties for Cytomed, a US drug manufacturer, was one of them.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; His early researches on plant and insects have been documented in over 70 scientific papers&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt; and the latter day work by way of over 190 scientific papers, totalling 260 papers, published in peer reviewed journals.&lt;ref name="INSA profile" /&gt; Chemical Reviews, a known journal, invited him to contribute to their special issue on the synthesis of bio-functional molecules in 1995.&lt;ref name="Padmashree Rama Rao&amp;nbsp;— A man of distinction" /&gt; He holds 30 patents,&lt;ref name="Management" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Patents by Inventor Alla Venkata Rama Rao"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/alla-venkata-rama-rao | title=Patents by Inventor Alla Venkata Rama Rao | publisher=Justia Patents | date=2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patents Observer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patentsobserver.com/public/applicant/show?toShow=ALLA+VENKATA+RAMA+RAO | title=Patents Observer | publisher=Patents Observer | date=2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for chemical synthesis and isolation processes, many of which are in use with drug manufacturers in the US and India.&lt;ref name="I have always looked for ideas that are tough, relevant for the society and can make a name for India" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian spin-outs set to flourish"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2008/April/15040802.asp | title=Indian spin-outs set to flourish | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry | date=15 April 2008 | accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Tribute to Prof. A.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}'''Abortion in the Netherlands''' was fully legalized on November 1, 1984, allowing abortions to be done on-demand until the twenty-first week.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hollandnagykovetseg.hu/files/4486929507.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405222048/http://www.hollandnagykovetseg.hu/files/4486929507.pdf |date=April 5, 2008 }} Abortion in the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion for medical reasons can be performed until 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; There is a five-day waiting period for abortions.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Abortion]] was deemed illegal under the Penal Code of 1886. Convictions were all but precluded, however, by a requirement that the prosecution prove that the [[fetus]] had been alive until the abortion. The [[Morality Acts]] of 1911 closed this loophole, and strictly barred all abortions, except those performed to save the life of the pregnant woman. 

Legalization reached the forefront of public debate in the Netherlands during the 1970s as many other Western European countries liberalized their laws. The [[States-General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Staten-Generaal]], however, was unable to reach a consensus between those opposing legalization, those in favor of allowing abortion, and those favoring a compromise measure. A controversial [[abortion law]] was passed in 1981 with single swing votes: 76 pro and 74 against in the House of Representatives, and 38 pro and 37 against in the Senate. The law left abortion a crime, unless performed at a clinic or hospital that is issued an official abortion certificate by the Dutch government, and the woman who is asking for the abortion declares she considers it to be an emergency. The law came into effect on November 1, 1984.

Currently, there are a little over 100 Dutch general hospitals certified to perform abortions, and 17 specialized abortion clinics. More than 90% of abortions take place in the specialized clinics.

In the Netherlands, abortion performed by a certified clinic or hospital is effectually allowed at any point between [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and viability, subject to a five-day waiting period. After the first trimester, the procedure becomes stricter, as two doctors must consent to treatment. In practice, abortions are performed until approximately 24 weeks into pregnancy, although this limit is the topic of ongoing discussion among physicians in the Netherlands, since, due to recent medical advancements, a fetus can sometimes be considered viable prior to 24 weeks. As a result of this debate, abortions are only rarely performed after 22 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions must be performed in a hospital.

The number of abortions has been relatively stable in the 21st century, around 28,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ministry of General Affairs |title=Abortion |url=http://www.government.nl/issues/health-issues/abortion |accessdate=2008-07-05}}{{failed verification|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2011/2011-3322-wm.htm&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 9.7 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web |title = World Abortion Policies 2013 |publisher=United Nations |year = 2013 |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adipsia''', also known as '''hypodipsia''', is a symptom of inappropriately decreased or absent feelings of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/adipsia|title=adipsia {{!}} pathology|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lin2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=M|last2=Liu|first2=SJ|last3=Lim|first3=IT|title=Disorders of water imbalance.|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=August 2005|volume=23|issue=3|pages=749–70, ix|pmid=15982544|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2005.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves an increased [[osmolality]] or concentration of solute in the urine, which stimulates secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) from the [[hypothalamus]] to the kidneys. This causes the person to retain water and ultimately become unable to feel thirst. Due to its rarity, the disorder has not been the subject of many research studies.

Adipsia may be seen in conditions such as [[diabetes insipidus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crowley |first1=R. K. |last2=Sherlock |first2=M. |last3=Agha |first3=A. |last4=Smith |first4=D. |last5=Thompson |first5=C.

It is possible for hypothalamic dysfunction, which may result in adipsia, to be present without physical lesions in the hypothalamus, although there are only four reported cases of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayek |first1=A |last2=Peake |first2=GT |title=Hypothalamic adipsia without demonstrable structural lesion |journal=Pediatrics |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=275–8 |year=1982 |pmid=6808452 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6808452}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some cases of patients experiencing adipsia due to a psychiatric disease. In these rare psychogenic cases, the patients have normal levels of urine osmolality as well as typical ADH activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrington|first1=C.|last2=Grossman|first2=J.|last3=Richman|first3=K.|title=Psychogenic adipsia presenting as acute kidney injury: case report and review of disorders of sodium and water metabolism in psychiatric illness|journal=Psychosomatics|date=2014|volume=55|pages=289–295|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S003331821300128X/1-s2.0-S003331821300128X-main.pdf?_tid=f9b54af0-f600-11e5-b793-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1459292155_5d9b2ed184567b80c116b7ef4ea793a3|doi=10.1016/j.psym.2013.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
===Dopamine===
[[Dopamine]], a [[neurotransmitter]], has been linked with feeding behaviors. In an experiment, scientists measured how much food and water mice consumed when they were born without dopamine in their systems. They found that without dopamine, the mice would starve and be dehydrated to the point of death. The scientists then injected the mice without dopamine with its precursor, [[L-DOPA]], and the mice started eating again. But, even though the mice were born without dopamine in their systems, they still had the capacity to control their feeding and drinking behaviors, suggesting that dopamine does not play a role in developing those neural circuits. Instead, dopamine is more closely related to the drive for hunger and thirst. Although the lack of dopamine resulted in adipsia in these rats, low levels of dopamine do not necessarily cause adipsia.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Q.Y.|last2=Palmiter|first2=R.D.|title=Dopamine-deficient mice are severely hypoactive, adipsic, and aphagic|journal=Cell|date=1995|volume=83|pages=1197–1209|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nigrostriatal pathway.png|thumb|The Nigrostriatal Pathway (highlighted in blue) is crucial for dopamine production and transmission.|307x307px]][[File:1806 The Hypothalamus-Pituitary Complex.jpg|thumb|310x310px|Location of the hypothalamus in the brain.]]

Other findings in support of the role of dopamine in thirst regulation involved the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. After completely degenerating the pathway, the animal becomes adipsic, [[Aphagia|aphagic]], and loses its interest in exploring. Although dopamine plays a role in adipsia, there is no research involving exclusively the relationship between adipsia and dopamine, as changes in dopamine simultaneously mediate changes in eating and curiosity, in addition to thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ungerstedt|first1=U.|title=Adipsia and Aphagia after 6-Hydroxydopamine induced degeneration of the nigro-striatal dopamine system|journal=Acta Physiologica|date=2014|volume=82(S367)|pages=95–122|doi=10.1111/j.1365-201X.1971.tb11001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothalamus===
The area of the brain that regulates thirst is located in the anterior part of the [[hypothalamus]].  The anterior hypothalamus is in close proximity to osmoreceptors which regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).  ADH secretion  is one of the primary mechanisms by which sodium and osmolar homeostasis are regulated, ADH is also secreted when there are small increases in serum osmolality.  Thirst is triggered by increases in serum osmolality and along with increases ADH secretion.  Both serum osmolality and ADH maintain normal ranges of serum [[Molality|osmolality]].

Adipsia can tend to result from lesions to hypothalamic regions involved in thirst regulation.  These lesions can be congenital, acquired, trauma, or even surgery.  Lesions or injuries to those hypothalamic regions cause adipsia because the lesions cause defects in the thirst regulating center which can lead to adipsia. Lesions in that region can also cause adipsia because of the extremely close anatomical proximity of the hypothalamus to ADH-related osmoreceptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Symptoms===
Diagnosing adipsia can be difficult as there is no set of concrete physical signs that are adipsia specific.  Changes in the brain that are indicative of adipsia include those of [[hyperpnea]], muscle weakness, insomnia, lethargy, and convulsions (although uncommon except in extreme cases of incredibly rapid rehydration).  Patients with a history of brain tumors, or [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]], may have hypothalamic lesions, which could be indicative of adipsia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some adults with Type A adipsia are anorexic in addition to the other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Testing===
Initial testing for adipsia involves [[electrolyte]], [[blood urea nitrogen]] and creatinine levels, serum and urine [[osmolality]], blood hormone levels, like [[vasopressin]]. In patients who have defects in thirst regulation and vasopresin secretion, serum vassopresin levels are low or absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/981022-workup|title=Adipsia Workup: Laboratory Studies, Imaging Studies, Other Tests|website=emedicine.medscape.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of urine electrolytes and osmolality are critical in determining the central, rather than renal, nature of the defect in water homeostasis. In adipsia, the fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%, unless a coexisting defect in AVP secretion is present. In salt intoxication, the urine sodium concentrations are very high and fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1%. Initial test results may be suggestive of diabetes insipidus. The circulating AVP levels tend to be high, which indicate an appropriate response of the pituitary to [[hyperosmolality]].  Patients may have mild stable elevations of serum sodium concentrations, along with elevations in both  BUN and creatinine levels and in the BUN/creatinine ratio.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dharnidharka|first1=V.R.|last2=Langman|first2=C.B.|title=Adipsia treatment and management|journal=EMedicine|date=2014|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/981022-treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Characteristic===
====Type A====
Type A (essential hypernatremia syndrome) involves an increase of the level in which [[solvent]] molecules can pass through cell membranes (osmotic threshold) for [[vasopressin]] release and the activation of the feeling of thirst. This is the most characterized sub-type of adipsia, however there is no known cause for Type A adipsia. There is debate over whether osmoreceptor resetting could lead to the increase in threshold. Other studies have shown that it is the loss of [[osmoreceptor]]s, not resetting, that cause the change in threshold.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Patients with Type A adipsia can be at risk of seizures if they rapidly re-hydrate or quickly add a significant amount of sodium into their bodies. If not treated, Type A adipsia could result in both a decrease in the size of the brain and bleeding in the brain.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/0301/p299.html|title=Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia|last=Braun|first=Michael|last2=Barstow|first2=Craig|date=May 1, 2015|website=American Family Physician|publisher=American Academy of Family Physicians|others=|access-date=April 26, 2016|last3=Pyzocha|first3=Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Type B====
Type B adipsia occurs when vasopressin responses are at decreased levels in the presence of osmotic stimuli. Although minimal, there is still some secretion of AVP. This type may be due to some elimination of osmoreceptors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Type C====
[[File:Dopamine Pathways.png|thumb|310x310px|Dopamine pathways in the brain. The production of dopamine is concentrated in the Ventral Tegmental Area and the Substantia Nigra.]]
Type C adipsia (type C osmoreceptor dysfunction) involves complete elimination of osmoreceptors, and as a result have no vasopressin release when there normally would be. Type C is generally the adipsia type found in patients with adipsic [[diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Type D====
Type D is the least commonly diagnosed and researched type of adipsia. The AVP release in this subtype occurs with normally functioning levels of osmoregulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holley|first1=A.D.|last2=Green|first2=S.|last3=Davoren|first3=P.|title=Extreme hypernatraemia: a case report and brief review|date=2007|url=http://www.cicm.org.au/CICM_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/March%202007/12_2007_Mar_CR-Extreme-hypernatraemia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
People affected by adipsia lack the ability to feel thirst, thus they often must be directed to drink. Adipsic persons may undergo training to learn when it is necessary that they drink water. Currently, there is no medicine available to treat adipsia. For people with adipsia because of hypothalamic damage, there is no surgical or medicinal option to fix the damage. In some cases where adipsia was caused by growths on thirst centers in the brain, surgical removal of the growths was successful in treating adipsia. Although adipsic persons must maintain a strict water intake schedule, their diets and participation in physical activities are not limited.
People affected by diabetes insipidus have the option of using the intranasal or oral hormone [[desmopressin acetate]] (DDAVP), which is molecularly similar enough to vasopressin to perform its function. In this case, [[desmopressin]] helps the kidneys to promote reabsorption of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some doctors have reported success in treating psychogenic adipsic patients with [[electroconvulsive therapy]], although the results are mixed and the reason for its success is still unknown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, some patients who do not successfully complete behavioral therapy may require a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] in order to maintain healthy levels of fluids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''African Nutrition Leadership Programme (ANLP)''' is a 10 days training course that started in 2002 to assist the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa. The emphasis of the programme is on understanding and developing the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and understanding nutrition information in a broader context.  The long-term aim of the ANLP is to meet the demands for leadership in Africa to solve its nutritional challenges.

The programme is designed for individuals who have experience in various fields of nutrition. Preference will be given to candidates with a postgraduate qualification, postdoctoral fellows and candidates with comparable working experience in the broader human nutrition sciences, studying or working in Africa.

==Vision==
The ANLP is a leadership development and networking seminar aimed at assisting the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and nutrition information in a broader context, and to understanding the role of nutrition science in the world around us.

==Modules==
* [[Leadership]]
* [[Communication]]
* [[Self-awareness]]
* [[Social responsibility]]
* [[Advocacy]]

==Location==
The course is held each year at Elgro River Lodge, Free State, South Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">'''Biodistribution''' is a method of tracking where compounds of interest travel in an experimental animal or human subject.  For example, in the development of new compounds for PET ([[positron emission tomography]]) scanning, a [[radioactive isotope]] is chemically joined with a [[peptide]] (subunit of a [[protein]]).  This particular class of isotopes emits [[positron]]s (which are [[antimatter]] particles, equal in mass to the electron, but with a positive charge).  When ejected from the nucleus, positrons encounter an electron, and undergo [[annihilation]] which produces two [[gamma rays]] travelling in opposite directions.  These gamma rays can be measured, and when compared to a standard, quantified.

==Biodistribution imaging after dissection==

For example, a new compound would be injected intravenously into a group of 16-20 rodents (typically mice or rats).  At intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours, smaller groups (4-5) of the animals are euthanized, then dissected.  The organs of interest (usually: blood, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, fat, adrenals, pancreas, brain, bone, stomach, small intestine, and upper and lower large intestine, etc.) are placed in pre-weighed containers, then into a device that measures gamma radiation.  The results give a dynamic view of how the compound moves through the animal.
 
A useful compound is one that is used either for the [[medical imaging]] of certain body parts or tumors (at low doses of radioactivity) or treating tumors (at high doses of radioactivity).

==Non-invasive biodistribution imaging in gene therapy==

In [[gene therapy]], gene delivery vectors, such as viruses, can be imaged according either to their particle biodistribution or their [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] pattern. The former means labeling the viruses with a contrast agent, being visible in some imaging modality, such as [[MRI]] or [[SPECT]]/[[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and latter means visualising the [[marker gene]] of gene delivery vector to be visible by the means of immunohistochemical methods, [[optical imaging]] or even by [[PCR]]. Non-invasive imaging has gained popularity as the imaging equipment has become available for research use from clinics.

For example, [[avidin]]-displaying [[baculoviruses]] could be imaged in rat brain by coating them with biotinylated iron particles, rendering them visible in MR imaging. The biodistribution of the iron-virus particles was seen to concentrate on the [[choroid plexus]] cells of lateral ventricles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raty JK, Liimatainen T, Wirth T |date=October 2006 |title=Magnetic resonance imaging of viral particle biodistribution ''in vivo'' |journal=Gene Therapy |volume=13 |issue=20 |pages=1440–46 |pmid=16855615 |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302828|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9177">'''[[Cannibalism]] in [[poultry]]''' is the act of one individual of a poultry species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food.  It commonly occurs in flocks of [[Chicken|domestic hens]] reared for egg production, although it can also occur in [[domestic turkey]]s, [[pheasants]] and other [[poultry]] species. Cannibalism can occur as a consequence of [[feather pecking]] which has caused denuded areas and bleeding on a bird's skin.&lt;ref name="Savory, (2010)"&gt;Savory, J., (2010).  Nutrition, feeding and drinking behaviour, and welfare.  In ''The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds'', I.J.H. Duncan and P. Hawkins (Eds). Springer.  pp. 165-188&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannibalism can cause large mortality rates within the flock and large decreases in production due to the stress it causes.  [[Vent pecking]], sometimes called 'cloacal cannibalism', is considered to be a separate form of cannibalistic pecking as this occurs in well-feathered birds and only the [[cloaca]] is targeted.&lt;ref name="Savory et al., (1995)"&gt;Savory, C.J., (1995).  Feather pecking and cannibalism. World's Poultry Science Journal, 51: 215–219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg et al., (2008)"&gt;Rodenburg, T.B., Komen, H., Ellen, E.D., Uitdehaag, K.A., and van Arendonk, J.A.M., (2008).  Selection method and early-life history affect behavioural development, feather pecking and cannibalism in laying hens: A review.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 110: 217-228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational basis==
Poultry species which exhibit cannibalism are [[omnivore]]s. For example, hens in the wild often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, [[insects]] and even larger animals such as [[lizard]]s or young [[mice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gworrell.freeyellow.com/chickenfaq.html|title=Frequently asked questions about chickens &amp; eggs |accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=Ferry Landing Farm &amp; Apiary|author=Gerard P.Worrell AKA "Farmer Jerry"}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they are mainly herbivorous in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Savory, (2010)" /&gt;  Feather pecking is often the initial cause of an injury which then attracts the cannibalistic pecking of other birds – perhaps as re-directed foraging or feeding behaviour.  In the close confines of modern farming systems, the increased pecking attention is easily observed by multiple birds which join in the attack, and often the escape attempts of the cannibalised bird attract more pecking attention.

==Development==
Chicks [[avian incubation|brooded]] with a hen had lower mortality levels due to feather pecking and cannibalism compared to non-brooded chicks. This may indicate the hen guides the chicks to peck at more rewarding substrates, such as food or litter.&lt;ref name="Riber et al., (2007)"&gt;Riber, A.B., Nielsen, B.L., Ritz, C. and Forkman, B., (2007).  Diurnal activity and synchrony in layer hen chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus). Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 108: 276–287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Cannibalism among layer hen flocks is highly variable; when it is not problematic, mortalities among production systems are generally similar.&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)" /&gt;  Published data on the prevalence of cannibalism could be misleading due to the inclusion of vent-pecking by some researchers but not others. Mortalities, due mainly to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg-laying flocks housed in aviaries,&lt;ref name = "Hill, (1986)"&gt;Hill, J.A. (1986). Egg production in alternative systems - a review of recent research in the UK.  Research and Development in Agriculture, 3: 13-18&lt;/ref&gt; straw yards,&lt;ref name="Gibson et al., (1988)"&gt;Gibson, S.W., Dun, P. and Hughes, B.O., (1988).  The performance and behaviour of laying fowls in a covered strawyard system.   Research and Development in Agriculture, 5: 153-163&lt;/ref&gt; and free-range systems.&lt;ref name="Keeling et al., (1988)"&gt;Keeling, L.J., Hughes, B.O. and Dun, P., (1988).  Performance of free range laying hens in a polythene house and their behaviour on range.  Farm Building Progress, 94: 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Because egg-laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in cage systems, cannibalism is reduced,&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)"&gt;Appleby, M.C. and Hughes, B.O., (1991).  Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects.  World's Poultry Science Journal, 47:109-128&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems. In a study which examined 'skin damage' (most of which would have been cause by pecking) on hens at the end of their productive lives, damage was lowest in hens from [[free range]] systems, followed by barns, then [[furnished cages]], and highest in conventional or [[battery cages]].&lt;ref name="Sherwin et al., (2010)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J. and Nicol, C.J., (2010).  Comparison of the welfare of layer hens in 4 housing systems in the UK.  British Poultry Science, 51: 488-499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of control==
===Beak-trimming===
[[Debeaking|Beak-trimming]] is the most common method of preventing or reducing injuries by cannibalism. In a three-year study of floor-housed laying hens, death by cannibalism was reported as 7% in beak-trimmed birds but was increased to 18% in non-trimmed birds.&lt;ref name="Flock et al., (2005)"&gt;Flock, D.K., Laughlin K.F. and Bentley, J., (2005).  Minimizing losses in poultry breeding and production: how breeding companies contribute to poultry welfare. World's Poultry Science Journal, 61: 227–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group size===
Increased group sizes in larger cages or floor systems can elevate the risk of cannibalism and feather pecking, probably due to the spread of the behaviour through social learning.&lt;ref name ="Lay et al., (2011)"&gt;Lay Jr., D.C., Fulton, R.M., Hester, P.Y., Karcher, D.M., Kjaer, J.B., Mench, J.A., Mullens, B.A., Newberry, R.C., C.J., O’Sullivan, N.P. and Porter, R.E., (2011).  Hen welfare in different housing systems.  Poultry Science, 90: 278-294 {{doi|10.3382/ps.2010-00962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light manipulations===
Lights are sometimes provided in nest-boxes to attract hens to use the nests, but this practice has been correlated with an increased risk of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman et al., (2006)"&gt;Zimmerman, P.H., Lindberg, A.C., Pope, S.J., Glen, E., Bolhuis, J.E. and Nicol, C.J., (2006). The effect of stocking density, flock size and modified management on laying hen behaviour and welfare in a non-cage system.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 101: 111–124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perches===
Rearing chicks with access to perches by four weeks of age has been associated with increased use of perches, and reduced cannibalism, in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Gunnarsson et al., (1999)"&gt;Gunnarsson, S., Keeling, L.J. and Svedberg, J., (1999).  Effects of rearing factors on the prevalence of floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking in commercial flocks of loose housed laying hens. British Poultry Science, 40: 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective breeding and genetics===
A sibling-selection programme has genetically selected a low mortality line which shows decreased mortality from cannibalism compared to a control line.&lt;ref name="Nordquist et al., (2011)"&gt;Nordquist, R.E.,  Heerkens, J.L.T., Rodenburg, T.B., Boks, S., Ellen, E.D. and van der Staay, F.J., (2011).  Laying hens selected for low mortality: Behaviour in tests of fearfulness, anxiety and cognition.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 131: 110-122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyewear===
{{Main|Chicken eyeglasses}}
Cannibalism may be reduced by fitting hens with a range of eyewear. Rose-tinted [[chicken eyeglasses|spectacles]] or contact lenses have been used. Opaque spectacles, or [[Blinders (poultry)|blinders]], have also been used. For both spectacles and blinders, there are versions that are held in place by [[circlip]]s into the [[nares]] of the bird, or others in which a pin pierces through the [[nasal septum]]: this latter method is illegal in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb7274-laying-hens-020717.pdf|journal=Codes of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Laying Hens|author=Department of Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs|date=July 2002|page=21|title=Mutilations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is theorized that — as with placing red filters over windows, or keeping the birds in red light — the coloured lenses prevent the birds from recognising the blood or raw flesh of other hens, thereby diminishing cannibalistic behaviour.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1986"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-07-18/entertainment/8602220060_1_loyl-stromberg-barnyard-chicken-chicken-related|title=Blinders Make A Spectacle For Chicken-hearted Collectors|date=July 18, 1986|last=Gold|first=Anita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars who study compassion fatigue note that the condition is common among workers who work directly with victims of disasters, trauma, or illness, especially in the health care industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Professionals in other occupations are also at risk for experiencing compassion fatigue, e.g. attorneys&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;, child protection workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=David|last2=Kellar-Guenther|first2=Yvonne|date=2006|title=Compassion Fatigue, Burnout, and Compassion Satisfaction among Colorado Child Protection Workers|url=|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1071–1080|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and veterinarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holcombe|first=T.

People who experience compassion fatigue can exhibit several symptoms including [[hopelessness]], a decrease in experiences of pleasure, constant stress and anxiety, sleeplessness or nightmares, and a pervasive negative [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. This can have detrimental effects on individuals, both professionally and personally, including a decrease in productivity, the inability to focus, and the development of new feelings of incompetency and self-doubt.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |title=Compassion Fatigue - Because You Care |accessdate=February 2007 |work=St. Petersburg Bar Association Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225541/http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalism analysts argue that news media have caused widespread compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering. This has caused the public to become desensitized or resistant to helping people who are suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartcenter.org/training/selfstudy/3_photojournalism/04.php| title=Traumatic Stress &amp; The News Audience| accessdate=June 2008 | publisher=[[Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Compassion fatigue has been studied by the field of traumatology, where it has been called the "cost of caring" for people facing emotional pain. 
 
Compassion fatigue has also been called secondary victimization,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. (1982). Traumatization and comfort: Close relationships may be hazardous to your health. Keynote presentation at the Conference, Families and close relationships: Individuals in social interaction, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, February.&lt;/ref&gt; secondary traumatic stress,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. R. (1983). Catastrophes: A overview of family reactions. In C. R. Figley and H. I. McCubbin (Eds.), Stress and the Family: Volume II: Coping with Catastrophe. New York: Brunner/Mazel, 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[vicarious traumatization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisa McCann|first=I.|last2=Pearlman|first2=Laurie Anne|date=1990-01-01|title=Vicarious traumatization: A framework for understanding the psychological effects of working with victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490030110/abstract|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=131–149|doi=10.1002/jts.2490030110|issn=1573-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary survivor.&lt;ref&gt;Remer, R., &amp; Elliott, J. E. (1988). Characteristics of secondary victims of sexual assault. International Journal of Family Psychiatry, 9(4), 373-387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other related conditions are rape-related family crisis&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, C. A. (1989). Rape and the family. ''Treating stress in families'', 257-289.&lt;/ref&gt; and "proximity" effects on female partners of war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verbosky|first=S. J.|last2=Ryan|first2=D. A.|date=1988|title=Female partners of Vietnam veterans: stress by proximity|journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing|volume=9|issue=1|pages=95–104|issn=0161-2840|pmid=3356550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion fatigue has been called a form of [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] in some literature. However, unlike compassion fatigue, “burnout” is related to chronic tedium in careers and the workplace, rather than exposure to specific kinds of client problems such as trauma.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Secondary Traumatic Stress in Nurses: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = Archives of Psychiatric Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.apnu.2010.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI-rt research suggests the idea of compassion without engaging in real-life trauma is not exhausting itself. According to these, when [[empathy]] was analyzed with compassion through [[neuroimaging]], empathy showed brain region activations where previously identified to be related to pain whereas compassion showed warped neural activations.&lt;ref name="Altruism: Ricard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Matthieu|title=Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World|chapter=IV|chapter-url=http://info-buddhism.com/Empathy-Compassion-Neuroscience-Ricard-Altruism.html|pages=56–64|year=2015|publisher=Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthieuricard.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDYvMDQvMTBfMjNfNDNfNjIxX0tsaW1lY2tpX0xlaWJlcmdfUmljYXJkX1Npbmdlcl8yMDEzX1NDQU4ucGRmIl1d/Klimecki_Leiberg_Ricard_Singer_2013_SCAN.pdf Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training], Olga M. Klimecki, Susanne Leiberg, Matthieu Ricard, and Tania Singer, Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic literature, the more technical term ''secondary traumatic stress disorder'' may be used. The term "compassion fatigue" is considered somewhat [[euphemism|euphemistic]]. Compassion fatigue also carries sociological connotations, especially when used to analyse the behavior of mass donations in response to the media response to disasters. One measure of compassion fatigue is in the ProQOL, or Professional Quality of Life Scale. Another is the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale.

==Risk factors==

Several personal attributes place a person at risk for developing compassion fatigue.  Persons who are overly conscientious, perfectionists,&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, Egan, &amp; Rees, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and self-giving are more likely to suffer from secondary traumatic stress.  Those who have low levels of social support or high levels of stress in personal life are also more likely to develop STS.  In addition, previous histories of trauma that led to negative [[coping skills]], such as bottling up or avoiding emotions, having small support systems, increase the risk for developing STS.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meadors | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Compassion Fatigue and Secondary Traumatization: Provider Self Care on the Intensive Care Units for Children | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Health | volume = 22 | issue = 1| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizational attributes in the fields where STS is most common, such as the healthcare field, contribute to compassion fatigue among the workers.  For example, a “culture of silence” where stressful events such as deaths in an intensive-care unit are not discussed after the event is linked to compassion fatigue. Lack of awareness of symptoms and poor training in the risks associated with high-stress jobs can also contribute to high rates of STS.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

==In healthcare professionals==

Between 16% and 85% of [[Health care provider|health care workers]] in various fields develop compassion fatigue.  In one study, approximately 85% of emergency room nurses met the criteria for compassion fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooper | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and Compassion Fatigue Among Emergency Nurses Compared With Nurses in Other Selected Inpatient Specialties | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 420–427 | doi = 10.1016/j.jen.2009.11.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, more than 25% of ambulance paramedics were identified as having severe ranges of post-traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;  In addition, 34% of hospice nurses in another study met the criteria for secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

Healthcare professionals experiencing compassion fatigue may find it difficult to continue doing their jobs. They can be exposed to trauma while trying to deal with compassion fatigue, potentially pushing them out of their career field. If they decide to stay, it can negatively affect the therapeutic relationship they have with patients because it depends on forming an empathetic, trusting relationship that could be difficult to make in the midst of compassion fatigue. Because of this, healthcare institutions are placing increased importance on supporting their employees emotional needs so they can better care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorenson|first=Claire|last2=Bolick|first2=Beth|last3=Wright|first3=Karen|last4=Hamilton|first4=Rebekah|title=An Evolutionary Concept Analysis of Compassion Fatigue|journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=557–563|doi=10.1111/jnu.12312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caregiver]]s for dependent people can also experience compassion fatigue; this can become a cause of abusive behavior in caring professions. It results from the taxing nature of showing compassion for someone whose [[suffering]] is continuous and unresolvable.  One may still care for the person as required by policy, however, the natural human desire to help them is significantly diminished. This phenomenon also occurs for professionals involved with long-term [[health care]]. It can also occur for loved ones who have [[Institution#Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] family members. These people may develop symptoms of [[clinical depression|depression]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are [[primary care]] providers for patients with [[terminal illness]]es are at a higher risk of developing these symptoms. In the medical profession, this is often described as "[[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]": the more specific terms secondary traumatic stress and [[Vicarious traumatization|vicarious trauma]] are also used.  Some professionals may be predisposed to compassion fatigue due to personal trauma.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Mental health professionals are another group that often suffer from compassion fatigue, particularly when they treat those who have suffered extensive trauma.  A study on mental health professionals that were providing clinical services to Katrina victims found that rates of negative psychological symptoms increased in the group.  Of those interviewed, 72% reported experiencing anxiety, 62% experienced increased suspiciousness about the world around them, and 42% reported feeling increasingly vulnerable after treating the Katrina victims.&lt;ref&gt;Culver, L., McKinney, B., Paradise, L. (2011). Mental Health Professionals' Experiences of Vicarious Traumatization in Post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, 16(1), 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion fatigue, or vicarious trauma, refers to the secondary exposure to trauma seen in fields where workers are directly in contact with the sufferer(s). Symptoms manifest as visualizing the event, insomnia, fear, and avoiding anything that can remind someone of what happened. Those caring for people who have experienced trauma can experience a change in how they view the world; they see it more negatively. It can negatively affect the worker's sense of self, of safety, and of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hook | first1 = M.

R. (1995). Compassion fatigue as secondary stress disorder: An overview. Compassion fatigue: coping with secondary traumatic stress disorder in those who treat the traumatized (1-20). New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who experience compassion fatigue, or STS, can begin to exhibit patterns where they feel disengaged, inadequate, overwhelmed, parental, undervalued, over-involved, sexualized, or positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betan|first=Ephi|last2=Heim|first2=Amy Kegley|last3=Zittel Conklin|first3=Carolyn|last4=Westen|first4=Drew|date=2005-05-01|title=Countertransference Phenomena and Personality Pathology in Clinical Practice: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=5|pages=890–898|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another name and concept directly tied to compassion fatigue is moral injury. Moral injury in the context of healthcare was directly named in the ''Stat News'' article by Drs. Wendy Dean and Simon Talbot, entitled "Physicians aren’t ‘burning out.’ They’re suffering from moral injury."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/|title=Physicians aren't 'burning out.' They're suffering from moral injury - STAT|date=2018-07-26|work=STAT|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article and concept goes on to explain that physicians (in the United States) are caught in double and triple and quadruple binds between their obligations of electronic health records, their own student loans, the requirements for patient load through the hospital and number of procedures performed – all while working towards the goal of trying to provide the best care and healing to patients possible. However, the systemic issues facing physicians often cause deep distress because the patients are suffering, despite a physician's best efforts. This concept of Moral Injury in healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moralinjury.healthcare/|title=Moral Injury of Healthcare|last=Talbot, Dean|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the expansion of the discussion around compassion fatigue and 'burnout.'

== In lawyers ==

Recent research shows that a growing number of attorneys who work with victims of trauma are exhibiting a high rate of compassion fatigue symptoms. In fact, lawyers are four times more likely to suffer from depression than the general public. They also have a higher rate of [[suicide]] and [[substance abuse]]. Most attorneys, when asked, stated that their formal education lacked adequate training in dealing with trauma. Besides working directly with trauma victims, one of the main reasons attorneys can develop compassion fatigue is because of the demanding case loads, and long hours that are typical to this profession.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

==Prevention==
There is an effort to prepare those in the healthcare professions to combat compassion fatigue through resiliency training. Teaching workers how to relax in stressful situations, be intentional in their duties and work with integrity, find people and resources who are supportive and understand the risks of compassion fatigue, and focus on self-care are all components of this training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Patricia|last2=Pion|first2=Sarah|last3=Gentry|first3=J. Eric|title=Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Training: The Experience of Facilitators|journal=The Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=83–88|doi=10.3928/00220124-20151217-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal self-care===
[[Stress reduction]] and anxiety management practices have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating STS.  Taking a break from work, participating in breathing exercises, exercising, and other recreational activities all help reduce the stress associated with STS. Conceptualizing one's own ability with self-integration from a theoretical and practice perspective helps to combat criticized or devalued phase of STS.  In addition, establishing clear [[professional boundaries]] and accepting the fact that successful outcomes are not always achievable can limit the effects of STS.&lt;ref name="a4"&gt;Huggard, P. (2003). Secondary Traumatic Stress: Doctors at risk. New Ethicals Journal. http://home.cogeco.ca/~cmc/Huggard_NewEthJ_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social self-care===
[[Social support]] and emotional support can help practitioners maintain a balance in their worldview.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintaining a diverse network of social support, from colleagues to pets, promotes a positive psychological state and can protect against STS.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt;

'''Congenital insensitivity to pain''' ('''CIP'''), also known as '''congenital analgesia''', is one or more rare conditions in which a person cannot feel (and has never felt) physical [[pain]].&lt;ref name="Linton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Linton|title=Understanding Pain for Better Clinical Practice: A Psychological Perspective|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=0444515917|year=2005|page=14|accessdate=April 13, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc6F5R6GUpUC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions described here are separate from the [[Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy|HSAN]] group of disorders, which have more specific [[Medical sign|sign]]s and cause. Because feeling physical pain is vital for survival, CIP is an extremely dangerous condition.&lt;ref name="Linton"/&gt; It is common for people with the condition to die in childhood due to injuries or illnesses going unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Linton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellier"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer L. Hellier|title=The Five Senses and Beyond: The Encyclopedia of Perception|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1440834172|year=2016|pages=118–119|accessdate=April 13, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4sFCDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn injuries are among the more common injuries.&lt;ref name="Hellier"/&gt;
== Signs and symptoms  ==
[[File:No pain. Science Museum Painless Exhibition Series.webm|thumb|A patient and doctor discuss congenital insensitivity to pain]]
For people with this disorder, [[cognition]] and [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] are otherwise normal; for instance, patients can still feel [[Somatosensory system#Fine touch and Crude touch|discriminative touch]] (though not always temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|256800|Insensitivity to Pain, Congenital, with Anhidrosis; CIPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and there are generally no detectable physical abnormalities.

Because children with the disorder cannot feel pain, they may not respond to problems, thus being at a higher risk of more severe diseases. Children with this condition often sustain [[oral cavity]] damage both in and around the oral cavity (such as having bitten off the tip of their [[tongue]]) or fractures to bones.&lt;ref name="Hellier"/&gt; Unnoticed [[infection]]s and [[cornea]]l damage due to foreign objects in the eye are also seen.&lt;ref name="Hellier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C. Brodsky|title=Pediatric Neuro-Ophthalmology|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1493933841|year=2016|page=741|accessdate=April 13, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_mODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are generally two types of non-response exhibited:&lt;ref name="Linton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brodsky"/&gt;
* Insensitivity to pain means that the painful stimulus is not even perceived: a patient cannot describe the intensity or type of pain.
* Indifference to pain means that the patient can perceive the stimulus, but lacks an appropriate response: they do not flinch or withdraw when exposed to pain.

== Causes ==
It may be that the condition is caused by increased production of [[endorphin]]s in the [[Human brain|brain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In this case, [[naloxone]] may be a treatment, but it does not always work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manfredi M, Bini G, Cruccu G, Accornero N, Berardelli A, Medolago L | title = Congenital absence of pain | journal = Arch Neurol | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 507–11 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6166287 | doi=10.1001/archneur.1981.00510080069010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all cases, this disorder can be  in the [[voltage-gated sodium channel]] [[SCN9A]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7). Patients with such mutations are congenitally insensitive to pain and lack other neuropathies. There are three mutations in SCN9A: W897X, located in the P-loop of domain 2; I767X, located in the S2 segment of domain 2; and S459X, located in the linker region between domains 1 and 2. This results in a truncated non-functional protein. Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels are expressed at high levels in nociceptive neurons of the [[dorsal root ganglia]]. As these channels are likely involved in the formation and propagation of [[action potential]]s in such neurons, it is expected that a loss of function mutation in SCN9A leads to abolished nociceptive pain propagation.&lt;ref name=Cox_2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox JJ, Reimann F, Nicholas AK, Thornton G, Roberts E, Springell K, Karbani G, Jafri H, Mannan J, Raashid Y, Al-Gazali L, Hamamy H, Valente EM, Gorman S, Williams R, McHale DP, Wood JN, Gribble FM, Woods CG |title=An SCN9A channelopathy causes congenital inability to experience pain |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7121 |pages=894–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17167479 |doi=10.1038/nature05413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PRDM12]] gene is normally switched on during the development of pain-sensing nerve cells. People with homozygous mutations of the PRDM12 gene experience congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=YC|last2=Auer-Grumbach|first2=M|last3=Matsukawa|first3=S|last4=Zitzelsberger|first4=M|last5=Themistocleous|first5=AC|last6=Strom|first6=TM|last7=Samara|first7=C|last8=Moore|first8=AW|last9=Cho|first9=LT|last10=Young|first10=GT|last11=Weiss|first11=C|last12=Schabhüttl|first12=M|last13=Stucka|first13=R|last14=Schmid|first14=AB|last15=Parman|first15=Y|last16=Graul-Neumann|first16=L|last17=Heinritz|first17=W|last18=Passarge|first18=E|last19=Watson|first19=RM|last20=Hertz|first20=JM|last21=Moog|first21=U|last22=Baumgartner|first22=M|last23=Valente|first23=EM|last24=Pereira|first24=D|last25=Restrepo|first25=CM|last26=Katona|first26=I|last27=Dusl|first27=M|last28=Stendel|first28=C|last29=Wieland|first29=T|last30=Stafford|first30=F|last31=Reimann|first31=F|last32=von Au|first32=K|last33=Finke|first33=C|last34=Willems|first34=PJ|last35=Nahorski|first35=MS|last36=Shaikh|first36=SS|last37=Carvalho|first37=OP|last38=Nicholas|first38=AK|last39=Karbani|first39=G|last40=McAleer|first40=MA|last41=Cilio|first41=MR|last42=McHugh|first42=JC|last43=Murphy|first43=SM|last44=Irvine|first44=AD|last45=Jensen|first45=UB|last46=Windhager|first46=R|last47=Weis|first47=J|last48=Bergmann|first48=C|last49=Rautenstrauss|first49=B|last50=Baets|first50=J|last51=De Jonghe|first51=P|last52=Reilly|first52=MM|last53=Kropatsch|first53=R|last54=Kurth|first54=I|last55=Chrast|first55=R|last56=Michiue|first56=T|last57=Bennett|first57=DL|last58=Woods|first58=CG|last59=Senderek|first59=J|title=Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception.|journal=Nature Genetics|date=July 2015|volume=47|issue=7|pages=803–8|pmid=26005867|doi=10.1038/ng.3308}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uncomfortably numb: The people who feel no pain"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costandi|first1=Mo|title=Uncomfortably numb: The people who feel no pain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/25/the-people-who-feel-no-pain|website=the guardian|publisher=the guardian|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental disabilities such as [[Autism spectrum|autism]] can include varying degrees of pain insensitivity as a sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental-behavioral Pediatrics: Evidence and Practice|last=Wolraich|first=Mark|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2008|isbn=9780323040259|location=|pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since these disorders are characterized by dysfunction of the sensory system in general, this specific condition is not in itself an indicator of any of these conditions.

==Treatment==
The [[opioid antagonist]] [[naloxone]] allowed a woman with congenital insensitivity to pain to experience it for the first time.&lt;ref name="MinettPereira2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minett|first1=Michael S.|last2=Pereira|first2=Vanessa|last3=Sikandar|first3=Shafaq|last4=Matsuyama|first4=Ayako|last5=Lolignier|first5=Stéphane|last6=Kanellopoulos|first6=Alexandros H.|last7=Mancini|first7=Flavia|last8=Iannetti|first8=Gian D.|last9=Bogdanov|first9=Yury D.|last10=Santana-Varela|first10=Sonia|last11=Millet|first11=Queensta|last12=Baskozos|first12=Giorgios|last13=MacAllister|first13=Raymond|last14=Cox|first14=James J.|last15=Zhao|first15=Jing|last16=Wood|first16=John N.|title=Endogenous opioids contribute to insensitivity to pain in humans and mice lacking sodium channel Nav1.7|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|year=2015|pages=8967|issn=2041-1723|doi=10.1038/ncomms9967|pmid=26634308|pmc=4686868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects were observed in Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 null mice treated with naloxone.&lt;ref name="MinettPereira2015" /&gt; As such, opioid antagonists like naloxone and [[naltrexone]] may be effective in treating the condition.&lt;ref name="MinettPereira2015" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Congenital insensitivity to pain is found in [[Vittangi]], a village in [[Kiruna Municipality]] in northern [[Sweden]], where nearly 40 cases have been reported. Some Americans also have it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minde J |title=Norrbottnian congenital insensitivity to pain |journal=Acta Orthopaedica Supplementum |volume=77 |issue=321 |pages=2–32 |year=2006 |pmid=16768023 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/umu/abstract.xsql?dbid=746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minorca is a rocky island in the [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] archipelago in [[Spain]], consisting of eight [[municipalities]]. Featuring a [[Mediterranean climate]], the weather is milder in the south while in the north there are strong winds all year round. Marine salt, carried by the wind to the pastures where cows graze, is what gives the cheese its typical flavour. Fish is a certain source of food, but additionally there are horses, pigs (used for cold cuts) and cows (the skin of which is used to produce leather, and the milk to produce cheese). [[Agriculture]] is small-scale and varied, consisting of typical Mediterranean products. Within this typical [[Mediterranean cuisine]] there are also the influences of various invading people, particularly the English, who brought ''[[plum cake]]'', [[puddings]], and [[Punch (drink)|punch]]. The rural and marine cuisine is mostly based on greens and vegetables from one's own garden, locally produced meat, and fish and seafood caught in the same day.&lt;ref name="Menorca"&gt;AADD ''Menorca: una volta per l'illa'' Ed. Triangle Postals. {{ISBN|84-8478-214-X}} p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cold cuts]] are used as seasoning. [[Olive oil]], although not produced on the island, is also a fundamental ingredient in local dishes.

Minorcan cuisine is at times a survival cuisine, which preserves the original flavour of its high-quality products to the maximum. It is simple, with few complications, and above all seasonal. It is based on fishing, particularly [[longline fishing]], and on [[seafood]], especially [[crustaceans]], [[clams]] and [[squid]]. Fruits and vegetables are cultivated in as much variety as possible, and on a small scale, only for local consumption.

Until the second half of the twentieth century, goats were in such abundance that they were only eaten when there was a famine, caused by spoiled crops or insufficient fishing. Today, they are a luxury. The legs of Minorcan kids are particularly appreciated.

There were so many rabbits on the island that Roman emperor [[Augustus]] had to send [[ferrets]] to help with hunting them; for this reason, rabbit is a common element of the cuisine. In later times, there were periods when hunting them was forbidden. In the seventeenth century, The English unsuccessfully attempted to introduce deer and hares. Few are left nowadays, but rabbits and various fowl are still hunted or bred.

== General Aspects ==
The recipes and ways of Minorcan cuisine have been mostly transmitted through oral tradition, as opposed to [[Catalonia]], for example, where recipe books can be found even from the [[Middle Ages]]. In Minorca, the first written mentions of its cuisine are only found in 1891, in some notes belonging to [[Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria]], who references some typical cooking but without any recipes. There is nothing else until 1923, when ''De re cibaria,'' by Pedro Ballester, is published, a "major work" that collects a substantial part of popular wisdom and offers detailed anonymous recipes, which nevertheless require prior knowledge of local cuisine in order to be interpreted.&lt;ref name=menXII&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomía y cocina'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Minorcan cuisine is based on local products, from land or sea. Classic Mediterranean crops had a strong influence, encouraging the use of olive oil, [[wine]], [[legumes]] and foods pickled in salt. The substratum of [[Arabic culture|Arab culture]] is also important, as well as additions from French and English cuisine in particular, owing to their respective periods of domination in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=menXII/&gt;

Being a small island meant that the region passed through periods of scarcity, for various reaons, yet very flavourful dishes were still created despite also being very modest. Simpler versions of dishes that once belonged only to a minority were created, that were now accessible to everyone, under any circumstances. This is known as 'survival cuisine', and it is not absolutely exclusive to the island. Even during times of abundance, it is believed that a dish containing superfluous ingredients is not necessarily better, but actually the opposite, and the simplicity of a cuisine that would normally be considered 'poor and rural' is more appreciated.&lt;ref name=menXII/&gt;

Even today, when most products can be obtained all year round, Minorca has a seasonal cuisine, with seasonal ingredients and recipes, which follows the cycles of nature and marked holidays, according to its traditions.&lt;ref name=menXII/&gt;

== Specialties ==
[[File:Ingredients_maonesa.jpg|thumb|Basic ingredients of mayonnaise: eggs, olive oil and lemon juice.]]

=== Mayonnaise ===
{{See also|Mayonnaise}}Mayonnaise supposedly originates in the city of [[Mahón]].&lt;ref name="Mazas"&gt;{{cite book | first=Eduardo | last=Martín Mazas | year=2008 | title=Teodoro Bardají Mas, el precursor de la cocina moderna en España | publisher=Ciudad de edición}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soví"&gt;{{cite book | author=Anónimo | title=Llibre de Sent Soví | publisher=Ed. Barcino | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, this sauce - an emulsion of eggs and olive oil - became known as a consequence of the brief French occupation of the island, which would take it to [[France]]. According to a different theory, it was invented in a French town called Maiona, or perhaps Baiona. A third is based on the dislike of the French towards garlic. As they tasted the Minorcan [[aioli]], the French asked for the garlic to be removed, which left them with a white sauce made of olive and eggs: mayonnaise.&lt;ref name="pla"&gt;Pla, Josep, 1970, ''El que hem menjat'', Barcelona, (1997 Premsa catalana)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, mayonnaise, with or without garlic, is a product of frequent use in the traditional cuisine of the island since ancient times, on its own or as an ingredient in dishes.

=== Mahón Cheese ===
[[File:Mahon_Cheese.JPG|left|thumb|Mahón cheese.]]
A local cheese is produced in Minorca: [[Mahón cheese]]. It features [[Denominación de Origen|Denominación de Origen Protegida]] (Protected Demonination of Origin). It is pressed instead of boiled, and has a characteristic orange colourm, a parallelepiped shape, and rounded corners. It is made and matured only in Minorca, according to tradition and to the norms of the DO. In 1985, the definitve form of the Denomination of Origin was given as ''queso Mahón,'' and later, in 1998, the word ''Menorca ''was added, making the full name ''Mahón-Menorca''. There are four main varieties, according to maturation time: mild, semi-mature, mature and aged. Ricotta or fresh, high-quality cottage cheese is also made in the same dairy shops in Minorca, but it does not have a specific name and is not widely known, since it is consumed only locally.&lt;ref&gt;Fuster, Xim; Gómez, Manel. ''Menorca: gastronomía y cocina''. Sant Lluís: Triangle Postals, 2005. {{ISBN|84-8478-187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cold Cuts ==
[[File:Sobrassada.jpg|thumb|Minorcan sobrassada.]]
With the exception of the [[sobrassada]], the cold cuts made in Minorca are an evolution of the Roman legacy. Everything is made of pork. The slaughter of the pigs, usually undertaken in winter, is called ''porquejades'' or ''porquetjades''. Blood is added as an ingredient to some of these products, which gives them a black colour.

Similarly to the cuisine of the [[Catalan cuisine]], the [[spices]] used are few and not very varied, but they are the ones that give each product a distinct personality, and makes them different and flavourul. The spices normally used are [[black pepper]], white pepper, [[paprika]] (in [[sobrassada]]), [[anise]], [[cinnamon]] and [[salt]]. Some also add other typical Mediterranean spices such as [[thyme]], [[rosemary]] and oregano.
[[File:Plat_amb_dues_pilotes_d-una_escudella_i_carn_d-olla.jpg|thumb|''Piles'' and butifarras of ''escudella''.]]
•	'''White [[Botifarra]]''', of grayish clear brown color, since it does not contain blood, it has the form of the ball that is used for the [[Escudella i carn d'olla|escudella]]. It is made up of meat and other parts of the pig and it is surrounded by a fine membrane. It is generally eaten cooked, usually fried. &lt;div&gt;•	'''Black [[Botifarra]]''', it has the same ingredients and species that the white one, but contains in addition pig blood. Its shape is like the one of a fine [[Botifarra]]. It is often eaten fried with [[Sobrassada]] and it is sometimes eaten raw. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;•	'''Camot or cuixot in Ciudadela''', it is a cooked, black, and very greasy sausage, basically the same as Majorcan Camaiot but with less pellets. It usually contains pig minced meat, blood, black pepper, a pinch of Paprika and another one of anise. Its appearance is very different from the others, since it is inserted within a pig leg, where the name comes from. It is eaten raw, cut in very fine slices, or cooked. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;•	'''Carnixulla or meat-and-Xua''', it is a cured raw [[sausage]] of chopped lean meat mixed with bacon cut in small squares and marinated with salt, pepper and sometimes other species. The elaboration process goes through a drying process inside the intestine while other transformations take place. Contrary from the [[sobrassada]], fermentation does not take place. Its aspect reminds one of a whip. This cold cut  is the only specific one of Minorca and perhaps the oldest one of the island. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Minorcan [[Sobrassada]] , thinner and less spicy than the [[Majorcan]].  These cold cuts are elaborated in all the Balearic Islands. &lt;/div&gt;

== Traditional dishes ==

=== Vegetables, legumes and greens ===
[[File:Carbasso.png|thumb|Stuffed zucchini.]]
[[File:Tomàquets.GIF|thumb|&lt;span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="306"&gt;''Spinach Rubiol'' , traditional dish from the patronal feasts of the island. &lt;/span&gt;]]

[[File:Rubiol.jpg|thumb|''Spinach Rubiol'' , traditional dish from the patronal feasts of the island.]]
[[Minorcan]] cuisine is very [[Mediterranean]],  rich in vegetables of all types. The island has been very self-sufficient providing these type of fresh products, thus they have never gone missing, thanks to the [[farming]] activity as part of the [[economy]] even to this day, time in which the crops represent approximately half of the Minorcan territory.&lt;ref name=menXXIII&gt;''Menorca: gastronomia i cuina'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The salad, hanging, bouquet [[tomatoes]], etc. ,and other green vegetables to prepare [[salads]] and [[stir fry]] stand out—onions, Italian green peppers, red pepper, garlic—, Roman lettuce to prepare salads, Mediterranean green vegetables that are fried, stuffed or oven baked, like [[eggplant]], that in Minorca is small and very white in its interior, a variety of the summer season that cannot be cultivated in a greenhouse, [[zucchini]],  that is prepared in a similar way, or the [[artichoke]], that is also from a local variety, small, long, and purple colored, that is eaten mainly as a side dish, battered and fried, oven baked or in stews.

Fruits are also abundant, specially figs, that are also eaten in savoury dishes, like for example the ''oliaigua''.&lt;ref name=menXXIII/&gt;

Local green vegetables are prepared a "thousand ways",&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV&gt;''Menorca: gastronomia i cuina'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; some of the most common are the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|''guixons'']]'', the [[Vicia faba|habas]], the [[lentils]], and the chickpeas.''&lt;ref name="menorcaXXIV"/&gt;

Mushrooms are very much appreciated, oven baked, fried, with or without sauce to accompany meats, and the wild asparagus, very appreciated in the oliaigua (local soup) or simply with a tortilla.&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt;

[[Olive oil]] is the grease that is used to cook these dishes and is also common in [[pastry]], while [[olives]] themselves are appreciated in this cooking,&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt; just like local [[capers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca:gastronomia i cuina'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Until a few decades ago there were hundreds of olive trees in Minorca but nowadays these are not cultivated.&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt;

Some Minorcan dishes that contain these ingredients are:
* Oven baked [[eggplant]]: a species of local eggplant is used that is smaller and more tender, they are thinly laminated and oven baked in a single layer, covered in shredded bread, with minced garlic and basil. It is similar to the ''carbassonada'', made with [[zucchini]] instead of eggplant, and usually has chopped onion and is eaten in the other [[Balearic Islands]].  Oven baked tomates and stuffed zucchini are also traditional.
* ''Oliaigua'', which in its origin was the scantiest soup, food for when you were lacking ingredients. It is usually eaten with figs during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Cauldron|Perol]]'', consists of a layer of laminated [[potatoes]], another of laminated [[tomatoes]], covered with shredded bread, garlic, basil and grilled. You can add fish- [[gilt-head bream]] or [[striped red mullet]], for example, in between the layers of potatoes and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cuttlefish]] with ''fesols'' is a stew with fresh cuttlefish and [[peas]], it is very common that is also traditionally served as a [[tapas|tapa]]. Sometimes little balls of minced meat are added.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of salty products are made with [[wheat flour]], many of which the bread dough often encircles the land's produce, like for example, the ''rubiols'', the M''inorcan [[flaons]]''- salty pasta filled with cheese-, to the agujas or croissants- made with bread dough and shaped like a half moon- filled with [[sobrassada]].&lt;ref name=menorcaIIL&gt;Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The  ''formatjades ''stand out, common in [[Easter]] time.&lt;ref name=menorcaIIL/&gt; The salty ''cocas'' are usually rectangular, open or closed, and can be traditionally filled with a stir-fry, vegetables or pepper, even though some have meat or fish.&lt;ref name=menorcaIIL/&gt; On [[Christmas eve]] it is common to eat, before the [[Midnight Mass]], bread rolls filled with diced meat and soaked in milk and oven-cooked.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Caldereta.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Kaldera or as it's best known, ''lobster [[kaldereta]]. '']]

=== Fish and seafood ===
Sea products, for their insular condition, are widely consumed. Traditionally, [[Freshwater whitefish|Whitefish]] is used just the same- like for example, [[Goosefish]] or the  [[Hake]]- like the [[Oily fish]]- like the [[Atlantic mackerel]] or the [[sardine]], for example-, very fresh, bought the same day it is fished.  This type of cooking with fish is traditional because many Minorcans have a boat, in which they go fishing on weekends &lt;ref name=menXX/&gt; and in summer it was a customary, and it still happens,&lt;ref name=menXX/&gt; to go around the island on a boat, an excursion that forced you to eat the captured and cooked fish on board.&lt;ref name=menXX/&gt; The [[Scorpaena]] or  scrofa, among them,&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: gastronomia i cuina'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly appreciated and abundant fish. Another appreciated fish is the [[Rajiformes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; that can be oven-baked, grilled or in a paella.

A number of seafood, shells and mollusks are also used. These products, just like the earth products, change according to the season. They are cooked in pots or boilers, rice, and sometimes also in salty pies or puddings, oven-baked, grilled or in the oven.&lt;ref name=menXX/&gt; In Minorca there is a great tradition of eating varied fish, and even octopus or squid, in the form of meatballs.&lt;ref name=menXC/&gt; The cod'' ab burrida'',&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomía y cocina'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; that is prepared mixing [[cod]] sauce with garlic and oil dressing, is a dish that has the resemblance with others cooked in [[Catalonia]], [[Provence]],  and other nearby areas.

Some Minorcan dishes with fish and seafood are:  
* Stuffed [[calamari]], oven baked or in a saucepan, its an elaboration that has been established in the Minorcan cookbook and has an established reputation for its subtlety of aromas.&lt;ref name=menXX/&gt;
* Lobster stew: until not long ago this type of sauce or bread soup was a poor fisher's dish, since Minorcan's lobsters were easy to find. Add bits of lobster on top of onions, tomato, garlic, and  parsley and boil over high heat.  [[Kaldereta]] is the best known internationally Minorcan dish, and of all the Minorcan pots the most emblematic is lobster.&lt;ref name=menXX&gt;''Menorca: gastronomia i cuina'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other pots that are prepared a lot are made of fish, usually roca fish, like the [[grouper]] pot. 
* Baked [[common cockle]], covered with shredded bread, garlic, and parsley. 
* Cabracho ([[scorpion fish]]) [[meatballs]],&lt;ref name=menXC&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomía y cocina'', p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; with a sautéed and chopped sauce. Some put a little of grated Mahón cheese shredded in the meatballs, mixed with the fish. You can do it with other fish, for example, the ones used in soups. Meatballs in meat sauce are also prepared, which in this case contain pine nuts, it can be eaten as a tapa in bars and not only as a main dish.

===Meats===

Pig farming is common locally, because pigs are easy to raise and traditional sausages are very popular. There is also cattle farming, which is the traditional source of milk -to make cheese among other things, meat and hides; the latter being used as a raw material for the local traditional leather craftsmen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Menorca: gastronomia y cocina|last=Fuster|first=Xim|last2=Gomez|first2=Manel|publisher=Triangle Postals|year=2005|isbn=84-8478-187-9|location=Sant Lluis|page=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. A very old recipe is, for example, the ''Feixets'' or ''Chaplain’s Partridges'', thinly sliced veal rolls filled with boiled egg, bacon and ''sobrasada''.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lamb and mutton|Lamb]], [[chicken (food)|chicken]] and [[rabbit]] are also consumed. There are local varieties of chicken and lamb.&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt;

Game meats, which are currently very limited, are mainly rabbits and birds.&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt; Rabbits are hunted with the help of dogs, including an indigenous breed, the ''Rabbit’s Dog'', and shotguns, while for the haunting of birds, typical techniques are the use of decoy and the ''fencing in the neck''.&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt;

[[Snails]] are also part of this gastronomy, both in simple preparations, with [[alioli]], for example, and in many more sophisticated ones, such as snails with [[sea crab]].&lt;ref name=menorcaXXIV/&gt;

Some Minorcan dishes with meats or sausages are:

* ''Arroz de la Tierra'', Rice of the Land; which is not made with rice but with wheat, crushed in a mortar, and baked with assorted sausages. It resembles the African [[couscous]].&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fried lamb or fried pork, sometimes called ''Frit Menorquí'' by the islanders.
* "Macarrones" with [[gravy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; penne pasta and meat, cooked halfway between the typical Italian way - the pasta is cooked separately and then added to the rest of the ingredients - and the traditional Catalan way – the pasta is cooked at the end with the rest of ingredients, like the noodles’ casserole. It also has a British influence, where gravy is a kind of simple meat preparation serving as a bed for the pasta.

==Typical desserts and pastries==

[[File:coca bamba.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bamba (snack)|Coca bamba]].]]
[[File:Crespells menorquins.jpg|thumb|250px|''Crespells''.]]
[[File:Crespellets.jpg|thumb|250px|''Crespellets''.]]
[[File:Orelletes.JPG|thumb|250px|Plate of ''orelletes''.]]

The Minorcan bakery, pastry, and dessert making incorporates ideas, techniques and products from cultures as diverse as Jewish, Arabic and English. The brief stay of the French in the island served to create the "Gató", according to the technique of the French housewives of the moment, but incorporating [[almonds]] in the recipe. From the British the islanders took a taste for [[puddings]], they use [[Catalan cream]] abundantly; and they also use [[meringue]] in the Italian way, to take advantage of the egg whites to decorate desserts and cakes. This taste for very sweet recipes is shared in common with other neighbours in the southern Mediterranean.

* The "Amargos", or Bitters, are cookies made with egg whites and almonds, similar to Italian Amaretti with almonds, and to the French "Macarons".
* The ''Buñuelos de Todos las Santos'', Fritters of All Saints, are made with soft cheese from Mahon for [[All Saints' Day]], when the "panellets" are also cooked.
* The "Carquinyoli Menorquines", or "Carquinyols de Es Mercadal", which are square shaped unlike the continental "Carquinyoli"s. They are like chocolate tablets, and have a homogeneous texture, although they are also dry and hard. They are made with almonds, egg white, sugar and flour.
* The "Coca de Tomate de [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciudadela]]", flatbread with slices of tomato, garlic, parsley, sugar and chopped cookie.
* The "Coca Bamba", or "Coca de San Juan" in Ciudadela, thick and tall in the middle flatbread in the form of snail that contains boiled potato and is eaten for breakfast, as an afternoon snack or with hot chocolate during the local festivities. "Pudin" is made with the "Cocas" that get hard after a few days of non-consumption. With the same recipe for "Coca Bamba" are also made individual round small Cocas, or "Coquitas", covered with apricots, cherries or other seasonal fruit. With the same dough are also made the "Buñuelos de Pasta Bamba" fritters.
* The Crespells of Minorca are flower-shaped cookies with about twelve petals, covered with fine sugar and stuffed either with jam or with a paste made of [[cottage cheese]] and lemon. They have a round hole in the middle to see what they are stuffed with. In the other Balearic islands "Crespells" are very different.
* The Crespellets or "Crespellines" are dry, round, large and thin cookies with a toothed edge.
* The "Cuscussó" has the appearance of loaf of bread covered with candied fruit and pine nuts, like a "Coca de San Juan". The dough is made with Catalan style rustic bread, which is soaked in water with sugar; almonds are added, cinnamon, lemon peel, etc. And then it is kneaded again.
* The "Ensaimada" is made both in [[Majorca]] and in Minorca.
* The "Formatjades de Requesón" are sweet "Formatjades" stuffed with a mixture containing cottage cheese and lemon peel.
* "Alayor" cookies are a kind of round bun with a "closed hole" in the middle. The dough has a bit of anise in it. They are eaten mainly at breakfast and as an afternoon snack, dunked in milk. They can be opened in half and spread with jam or honey. They can be soft or hard inside, we can know depending on the appearance of the outer surface layer.
* "Gató" is a kind of cake where the flour is replaced with chopped almonds.
* The "Macarrones de la Ciudadela" are small white cookies made with egg white, lots of sugar and sometimes also bits of almonds. They have a six-pointed flower shape.
* "Orelletes", which are pronounced "oran" in Minorca,&lt;ref&gt;''Menorca: gastronomía y cocina'', p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; are fried dough. They are thin, irregular and crisp, aromatised with [[muscat wine]] and served with warm [[honey]].
* Minorcan "Pastissets", in Minorca are five or six-petalled flower shaped cookies, covered with fine sugar and made with lard, flour, egg, sugar, lemon zest.
* "Pudin de Requesón Menorquín", or Minorcan cottage cheese pudding; with Alayor cookies and traditionally garnished with raisins and pine nuts.
* Pudding of Coca Bamba, sometimes made with Ensaimadas; like a custard dessert consistent enough to be cut into pieces.
* Grapes and cheese, a simple dessert.
* The "Rubiol" is a sweet empanada similar to the sweet "Pastisset" of Valencia, typical of Majorca and Minorca.
* "Rissats", rectangular biscuits decorated with curled waves drawn on the surface with a fork. They are similar to the "Crespellines".
* "Tatis" are like the Catalan "Carquinyolis" but with chocolate.
* "Turrón Quemado'', from Mercadal. A peculiar kind of nougat.
* "Tortada", a cake made of chopped almonds, is frequent in the Spanish gastronomy, which in Minorca has the particularity of being usually covered completely with burnt egg yolk and meringue, and sometimes also sugar. This decoration is very typical of the island, and is usually found in the "Monas de Pascua" - Easter cakes, birthday cakes, and "Brazos de Gitano" – Swiss rolls - which, if not filled with Catalan cream, are usually also stuffed inside with egg yolk.

== Typical drinks ==
* "Calent", an artisan drink that is infused with herbs, cinnamon, anise and saffron, and it can be drunk hot or ice-cold.
* "Estomagale" is a soft herbs liquor, with a very particular flavor and texture.
* "Frigola" is [[thyme]] in Minorca. In the islands, it is also a traditional digestive made with thyme flowers.
* "Gin de Menorca" comes from the British presence on the island in the 18th century. The Xoriguer distillery, which produces the well-known Gin Xoriguer, is located in the port of Mahón.
* "Licor de Rosas". Liquor of roses, is a liquor of Greek origin that was brought to the island by Greek workers and merchants in the eighteenth century and that in Minorca is served in the baptisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illesbalears.es/cat/illesbalears/gastronomia2.jsp?SEC=GAS&amp;id=00001021&amp;lang=0002 Gastronomía en las Islas Baleares]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Pellofa", gin with lemon skin and a little siphon.
* "Pomada", gin with lemon juice.
* The Minorcan "Ratafia" is made by soaking herbs from the island in Aguardiente for eight days, it has lemon bark, green walnut, carnation, nutmeg and cinnamon in it. Other liquors are also made with Mahón chamomile, orange or lemon flower, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fàbrega, Jaume ''El llibre de la ratafia'' Cossetània Edicions, {{ISBN|84-9791-313-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Sengri", which is a kind of hot punch with aromatised wine, dating from the time of the British presence in the eighteenth century. In spite of the similarity of the word, it has nothing to do with the [[sangria]].
* Wine has been produced in Minorca since time immemorial. Currently, there are four wineries: Viña Sa Cudia, Viñas Binifadet, Ferrer de Muntpalau and the Bodega Vino de s'illa in Alayor, which have the distinctive name of "Wine of the Land of the Island of Minorca" and have obtained international distinctions.
* The "Malvasía" began to be produced in Minorca when commerce started with ancient Greece, especially in Alayor and San Luis, but later it was lost. Since 2005, it has been cultivated again with vines from Corsica, which has similar geological and climatic features to Minorca’s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illesbalears.es/cat/illesbalears/gastronomia2.jsp?SEC=GAS&amp;id=00000438&amp;lang=0002 Gastronomía en las Islas Baleares.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fruit liqueurs. They are made by macerating the fruits in brandy.

== Gastronomic fairs ==

CuinaArt Menorca is a gastronomic fair that is celebrated every April since 2007 as a showcase for Minorcan products. It consists of exhibitors, debates, tastings, conferences, etc. It is aimed at all types of public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">'''Dhivehi beys''' is the local [[Dhivehi people|Dhivehi]] name given to the Traditional Medicine of the [[Maldives]] and [[Minicoy]], [[Lakshadweep]] or the '''Dweep Unani''' / ''Dheebu Yoonaanee'', the islanders' system of herbal medicine. The term ''Dhivehi'' means Islanders' and ''beys'' means medicine. ''Dweep'' is another word used for islands and ''Unani'' is the term for Hippocratic humoral system of herbal medicine practiced in South Asia.

==History==

The [[Maldives|Maldive]] Islanders still rely on [[traditional medicine]] men and women. At the crossroads of the [[Indian Ocean]], healing secrets from Indians, Arabs, Persians, Malaysians, [[Sri Lanka]]ns and Chinese were acquired and synthesized, then used to develop local [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]].

Legends abound about the feats of such special healers as "Buraki Ranin", the sixteenth-century queen of Sultan Muhamed, who was said to cure sword wounds overnight with her own dressings. The treatise written by El-Sheikh El-Hakeem Ahmed Didi of [[Meedhoo (Seenu Atoll)]] who died in 1937 forms the foundation of today's traditional medicine. Known as hakeems, practitioners of this medicine are well respected by the village communities.

A basic tenet of their philosophy is that good health is a result of a proper balance between the hot, cold and dry "humours" in the body, so "cold food" is recommended for someone with fever, and dry fish for flu. Some hakeems are schooled in "Unani" medicine, which treats the whole person, combining ancient remedies with new drugs. In recent years there has been an attempt to integrate traditional and [[Medicine|modern medicine]].

Advice and training, for instance, is offered to local midwives who learned their skill from older practitioners. Arabic system of Graeco-[[Islamic medicine]] in Maldives was introduced by Arabs. [[Unani medicine]] soon got acceptance by the masses due to its efficacy and non toxicity of the drugs.

[[Aisaabeegedharu Ahmed Didi]] ( son of El-Allama El_Shaikh El-Hafiz Ibrahim Thakurufaanu, [[Aisaabeegedharu Dhonbeyya]]) died in 1938 was most dedicated scholar of Arabic system of medicine in Maldives. He was known for his book Tibbl Fuqara fee hikmathil Umarai based on his lifelong clinical experience. He referred to more than 20 books and encyclopedias of Arabic in his book. He was the first person who opened the research in old Dhivehi system of medicine. He examined Dhivehi medicine in the light of unani medicine.

'''Digeponics''' (pronounced die-jeh-ponics, as in digestion) is a method of [[agriculture]] which integrates the products of [[anaerobic digestion]], including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[digestate]], with greenhouse cultivation of vegetables.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoknes|first=K.|last2=Scholwin|first2=F.|last3=Krzesiński|first3=W.|last4=Wojciechowska|first4=E.|last5=Jasińska|first5=A.|date=2016-10-01|title=Efficiency of a novel "Food to waste to food" system including anaerobic digestion of food waste and cultivation of vegetables on digestate in a bubble-insulated greenhouse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X16303336|journal=Waste Management|volume=56|issue=Supplement C|pages=466–476|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2016.06.027|pmid=27425859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Digeponics was developed in Norway by the "Food to Waste to Food" (F2W2F) program, a part of the [[EU Eco-innovation Initiative]], in partnership with the waste management company Lindum AS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoknes |first1=Ketil |last2=Wojciechowska |first2=E. |last3=Jasińska |first3=A. |last4=Gulliksen |first4=A. |last5=Tesfamichael |first5=A. |title=Growing vegetables in the circular economy; cultivation of tomatoes on green waste compost and food waste digestate. |journal=Acta Hortic. |volume=1215 |pages=389-396 |doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |url=https://doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eco-innovation/projects/en/projects/f2w2f|title=Food to Waste to Food - Eco-Innovation - European Commission|website=Eco-Innovation|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overall concept ==
The method involves the use of various products of anaerobic digestion in the cultivation of vegetables in a greenhouse environment.  The more widely used aspects include the use of biogas for electricity production, which is used for lighting and heating the greenhouse in the winter months, as well as the introduction of carbon dioxide into the greenhouse, which is a byproduct of biogas combustion, for increased plant growth.  The more novel aspect of this method is the use of a "mix of [[vermicompost]] and garden waste compost fertilized by (non-separated) [[digestate]] in a circulating system including earth worms in the substrate and aeration in a biofilter buffer tank." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Performance ==
Research conducted on digeponics found that this method, and others like it, could meet or exceed the production rates of mineral fertilizers.  For [[tomato]] production, digeponics yielded 5430&amp;nbsp;g, compared to 4920&amp;nbsp;g for mineral fertilizers.  For [[cucumber]] production, digeponics yielded 19560g, compared to 8502g for mineral fertilizers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to increased yields, this method can provide decreased energy costs and very low carbon emissions, by producing energy on site from renewable carbon neutral sources that are readily available to the farmer, and could even provide an additional source of income by charging tipping fees for organic waste collection and selling excess electricity or gas back into the grid.  Methane emissions were shown to be reduced by 98%, compared to landfilling of organic waste, and carbon emissions were reduced 95%, compared with conventional tomato greenhouse production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Organization==

Spanish organization for medical emergencies is  a Public Health Integrated EMS (IEMS) that has a network of SAMU/IEMS Medical Emergency Regulation Centers (MERC = SAMU in international appellation). Emergency Primary Care and GP are fully integrated in Spanish IEMS.
[[File:Autonomous communities of Spain.svg|thumb|250px|Autonomous Communities (regions) of Spain]]
Spain has 17 [[Autonomous communities in Spain|autonomous communities]] with 17 regional Health Departments. The [[Spanish National Health System|National Health System]] is the agglomeration of these 17 Health Departments. So each autonomous community has its own regional IEMS that depend on Regional Health Department. Some EMS have their own staff and vehicles, others outsource the vehicles and staff to private companies. Public EMS departments usually outsource the vehicles and [[Basic life support|BLS]] staff. [[Advanced life support|ALS]] staff are usually government employees.


In addition, some cities have local EMS too (e.g. [[SAMUR]]-Madrid).

There are also Emergency Medical Services in some fire departments: cities of Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Malaga, Bilbao, and Catalonia community. In these EMS, doctors and nurses work with firefighters in advanced life support (ALS) ambulances or helicopters.

Furthermore, non-profit organizations ([[Red Cross|Spanish Red Cross]], [http://www.dya.es DYA]) and [[Civil Defense]] Groups provide ambulances (usually BLS) with [[Volunteering|volunteers]] for some situations (disasters, mass incidents, special events: sports, concerts,...)

===Usual types of ambulances and their staff===
Spanish EMS is a physician led system with physicians, emergency nurses and technicians in the field. It's a two-tiered response system (Advanced Life Support with physicians and nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Advanced life support units in Spain: the situation in 2008 E E.Pesqueira Alonso , P.  Juliano Izquierdo http://www.semes.org/revista/vol21_4/6_ing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Basic Life Support with technicians).

In addition there are fast vehicles (non-ambulance) for emergency interventions:
* RRU (Rapid Response Units / ''VIR: Vehículo de Intervención Rápida''), staffed by a driver/technician and a physician (sometimes an emergency nurse).
* Logistics and communications vehicles for disasters.

Before 2007 there was not a national standard for EMT (''TES/Técnico en Emergencias Sanitarias'') education, so each region had their own rules (courses from 60 to 600 hours or sometimes only a first aid course; no reciprocity between regions; different terms: ''TTS-Técnico de Transporte Sanitario, ATTS-Auxiliar de Transporte Sanitario, ATA-Auxiliar de Transporte en Ambulancia, TEM-Técnico en Emergencias Médicas,...'').

==Telephone number==
[[File:Centro 112 de la CAM - La Finca.JPG|thumb|180px|Madrid 112 Emergency Call Center Building]]

The emergency dial is [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112 (European Emergency Number)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991D0396:EN:NOT |title=Council Decision 91/396/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the introduction of a single European emergency call number |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all regions. However, the emergency number for medical services, 061, is available in several regions.

In Spain, the emergency dispatch is a physician regulated system. Each region has its own emergency call center with phone operators (''telefonistas''), emergency medical dispatchers (''gestores de recursos/coordinadores/locutores''), medical-regulators (physician) and sometimes nurses.

==Curiosities==
In Spain, until August, 1st 2018, the law (motor vehicle code) only allowed the police vehicles to use blue lights. Ambulances and fire engines had to use amber lights. However some ambulances used red/amber, white/amber, blue/amber, blue/red lights although this was illegal. Since that date, all emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, RRU, fire trucks,...) have to use blue lights. Vehicles that had amber lights have to change them within a maximum time period of two years. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dgt.es/es/prensa/notas-de-prensa/2018/20180731-vehiculos-prioritarios-luces-azules.shtml |title=Todos los vehículos prioritarios en servicio de emergencia llevarán luces azules|publisher=DGT|date=2010-08-08 |accessdate=2018-07-31| language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chikungunya]] is a mosquito-borne alpha virus that was first isolated after a 1952 outbreak in modern-day Tanzania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=Scott C.|last2=Lecuit|first2=Marc|date=2015-03-26|title=Chikungunya Virus and the Global Spread of a Mosquito-Borne Disease|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra1406035|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=13|pages=1231–1239|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1406035|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25806915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The virus has circulated in forested regions of sub-Saharan African in cycles involving nonhuman primate hosts and arboreal mosquito vectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Phylogenetic studies indicate that the urban transmission cycle—the transmission of a pathogen between humans and mosquitoes that exist in urban environments—was established on multiple occasions from strains occurring on the eastern half of Africa in non-human primate hosts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This emergence and spread beyond Africa may have started as early as the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Currently, available data does not indicate whether the introduction of chikungunya into Asia occurred in the 19th century or more recently, but this epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks in India and continues to circulate in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A number of '''chikungunya outbreaks''' have occurred since 2005.  An analysis of the chikungunya [[virus]]'s genetic code suggests that the increased severity of the 2005–present outbreak may be due to a change in the genetic sequence, altering the virus' [[viral coat]] protein, which potentially allows it to multiply more easily in mosquito cells.&lt;ref name="PLoS" /&gt; The change allows the virus to use  the [[Asian tiger mosquito]] (an [[invasive species]]) as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] in addition to the more strictly [[tropical]] main vector, ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''. In July 2006, a team analyzed the virus' [[RNA]] and determined the genetic changes that have occurred in various strains of the virus and identified those genetic sequences which led to the increased virulence of recent strains.&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuffenecker I, Iteman I, Michault A |title=Genome microevolution of chikungunya viruses causing the Indian Ocean outbreak |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e263 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16700631 |pmc=1463904 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030263 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005–06: Réunion==
The largest outbreak of chikungunya ever recorded at the time occurred on the island of [[Réunion]] in the  western rim  of the [[Indian Ocean]] from late March 2005 to February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRO/EDR&gt; Chikungunya - Mauritius and Reunion Island (09): Reunion 2006-02-14 23:50:00 Archive Number: 20060214.0491|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2209285|publisher=ProMED Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its height, the incidence peaked at about 25,000 cases per week or 3500 daily in early 2006. After an initial peak in May 2005, the incidence decreased and remained stable through the summer hemisphere winter, rising again at the beginning of October 2005. By mid-December, when southern hemisphere summer temperatures are favorable for the mosquito vector, the incidence began to rise dramatically into the first two months of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRO/EDR&gt; Chikungunya - Mauritius and Reunion Island (04): Reunion 2006-01-27 23:50:00 Archive Number: 20060127.0254|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2209201|publisher=ProMED Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reported cases was thought to be underestimated. The French government sent several hundred troops to help eradicate mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4674376.stm | work=BBC News | title=Island disease hits 50,000 people | date=2 February 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although confirmed cases were much lower, some estimates based on extrapolations from the number detected by sentinel physicians suggested that as many as 110,000 of Réunion's population of 800,000 people may have been infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRO/EDR&gt; Chikungunya - Indian Ocean update (02): Reunion 2006-02-24 23:50:00 Archive Number: 20060224.0609|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2209344|publisher=ProMED Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve cases of meningoencephalitis cases were confirmed to be associated with chikungunya infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quatresous |first1=I |title=Chikungunya outbreak in Reunion, a French overseas  departement |journal=Eurosurveillance |date=2006 |volume=11 |page=060126 |url=&lt;http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/060126.asp#1&gt;) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720153248/http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/060126.asp |archivedate=2014-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries in the southwest Indian Ocean reported cases as well, including [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_02_17a/en/index.html Chikungunya in La Réunion Island (France)], [[World Health Organization]], 17 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Madagascar]], the [[Comoros]], and [[Mayotte]].

==2006: India==
In 2006, there was a large outbreak in India. States affected by the outbreak were [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_10_17/en/index.html|title=Chikungunya in India|publisher=World Health Organization|date= 17 October 2006|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial cases were reported from Hyderabad and Secunderabad as well as from Anantpur district as early as November and December 2005 and is continue unabated. In Hyderabad alone an average practitioner saw anywhere between 10 and 20 cases every day. Some deaths have been reported but it was thought to be due mainly to the inappropriate use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory tablets. The major cause of mortality is due to severe dehydration, [[electrolyte imbalance]] and loss of glycemic control. Recovery is the rule except for about 3 to 5% incidence of prolonged arthritis. As this virus can cause [[thrombocytopenia]], injudicious use of these drugs can cause erosions in the gastric epithelium leading to exsanguinating upper GI bleed (due to thrombocytopenia). Also the use of steroids for the control of joint pains and inflammation is dangerous and completely unwarranted. On average there are around 5,300 cases being treated every day. This figure is only from public sector. The figures from the private sector combined would be much higher.

There have been reports of large scale outbreak of this virus in Southern India. At least 80,000 people in Gulbarga, Tumkur, Bidar, Raichur, Bellary, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Kolar and Bijapur districts in Karnataka state are known to have been affected since December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1482202.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Is Bangalore in the grip of chikungunya? | date=8 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate outbreak of chikungunya fever was reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, in the first two weeks of March 2006, resulting in over 2000 cases. In Orissa state, at most 5000 cases of fever with muscle aches and headache were reported between February 27 and March 5, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdtravelhealth.com/destinations/asia/india.html|title=MD Travel Health—India—vaccinations, malaria, safety, and other medical advice|publisher=MDtravelhealth.com|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bangalore]], the state capital of Karnataka (India), there seemed to be an outbreak of chikungunya in May 2006 with arthralgia/arthritis and rashes. As well as in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh. In the 3rd week of May 2006 the outbreak of chikungunya in North Karnataka was severe. All the North Karnataka districts specially Gulbarga, Koppal, Bellary, Gadag, Dharwad were affected. The people of this region are hence requested to be alert. [[Water stagnation|Stagnation of water]] which provides fertile breeding grounds for the vector (''[[Aedes aegypti]]'') should be avoided. The latest outbreak is in [[Tamil Nadu]], India - 20,000 cases have been reported in June 2006. Earlier it was found spreading mostly in the outskirts of Bangalore, but now it has started spreading in the city also (Updated 30/06/2006). More than 300,000 people are affected in Karnataka as of July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/10/stories/2006071007210400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Chikungunya wreaking havoc in most parts of State | date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported on 29/06/2006, Chennai—fresh cases of this disease has been reported in local hospitals. A heavy effect has been reflected in south TN districts like Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli. Residents of Chennai are warned against the painful disease.

June 2006—[[Andaman Islands]] (India) chikungunya cases had been registered virtually for the first time in the month of June 2006. In the beginning of the September cases have gone as much as in thousands.As reported in a local news magazine it has taken the state of epidemic in Andamans. Health authorities are doing their best to handle the situation. Relapsed cases have been noticed with severe pain and swelling in the lower limbs, vomiting and general weakness.

As of July 2006, nearly 50,000 people were affected in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/04/stories/2006070403940300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Salem struggles to contain chikungunya | date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2006, nearly 100,000 people were infected in Tamil Nadu.  [[Chennai]], capital of Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected.

On 24 August 2006, ''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper reported that the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, [[Gujarat]] and Kerala had reported 1.1 million (11 lakh) cases.  The government's claim of no deaths is questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/24/stories/2006082419390900.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Government claim on Chikungunya disputed | date=24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007: Italy==
In September 2007, 130 cases were confirmed in the province of Ravenna, Northern Italy, in the contiguous towns of [[Castiglione di Cervia]] and [[Castiglione di Ravenna]]. One person died. The source of the outbreak was an Indian from Kerala, India.&lt;ref&gt;(7 September 2007) [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2007/hpr3607.pdf Chikungunya outbreak in Italy] Health Protection Report, Volume 1, Number 36, UK NHS, Retrieved 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009: Thailand==

{{main article|2013–14 chikungunya outbreak}}

In December 2013, it was confirmed that chikungunya was being locally transmitted in the Americas for the first time in the French Caribbean dependency of St. Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mosquito virus spreads to Caribbean |newspaper=Caribbean Business |date=2013-12-17 |url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/mosquito-virus-spreads-to-caribbean-92039.html |accessdate=2013-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221214825/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/mosquito-virus-spreads-to-caribbean-92039.html |archivedate=2013-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 66 confirmed cases and suspected cases of around 181.&lt;ref name="cidrap.umn.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/12/caribbean-chikungunya-outbreak-grows-poses-threat-us|title=Caribbean chikungunya outbreak grows, poses threat to US |publisher= CIDRAP—Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota |accessdate=23 May 2014|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first time in the Americas that the disease has spread to humans from a population of infected mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mosquito-borne-health-alerts-issued-for-st-martin-1.2470221 |title= Mosquito-borne health alerts issued for St. Martin |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-January 2014, a number of cases had been confirmed in five countries: St. Martin, [[St. Barthelemy]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mosquito-borne-chikungunya-virus-infects-people-on-5-caribbean-islands-1.2504922 |title= Mosquito-borne chikungunya virus infects people on 5 Caribbean islands |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate= 2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of April, at least ten nations had reported cases.  By the start of May, there were more than 4,100 probable cases, and 31,000 suspected cases spanning 14 countries, including [[French Guiana]], the only non-island nation with at least one reported case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8798">The '''Expanded Program on Immunization''' is a [[World Health Organization]] program with the goal to make [[vaccine]]s available to all children.

== History ==

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) initiated the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in May 1974 with the objective to vaccinate children throughout the world. 

Ten years later, in 1984, the WHO established a standardized [[vaccination schedule]] for the original EPI vaccines: [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin]] (BCG), [[DTP vaccine |diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis]] (DTP), oral [[Polio vaccine|polio]], and [[measles]]. Increased knowledge of the immunologic factors of disease led to new vaccines being developed and added to the EPI’s list of recommended vaccines: [[Hepatitis B]] (HepB), [[yellow fever]] in countries endemic for the disease, and [[Haemophilus influenzae]] meningitis (Hib) conjugate vaccine in countries with high burden of disease.&lt;ref name= disease&gt;[http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP Jamison D, Breman J, Measham A, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans D, Jha P, Mills A, Musgrove P. ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', Second Edition. 2006, The World Bank Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123000000/http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |date=January 23, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] (GAVI) was created with the sole purpose of improving child health in the poorest countries by extending the reach of the EPI. The GAVI brought together a grand coalition, including the UN agencies and institutions (WHO, [[UNICEF]], the [[World Bank]]), public health institutes, donor and implementing countries, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], the vaccine industry, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) and many more. The creation of the GAVI has helped to &lt;!-- http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/benefits_of_immunization/en/ --&gt;renew interest and maintain the importance of immunizations in battling the world’s large burden of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gavialliance.org The GAVI Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current goals of the EPI are 
* to ensure full immunization of children under one year of age in every district, 
* to globally eradicate [[poliomyelitis]], 
* to reduce maternal and [[neonatal]] [[tetanus]] to an [[incidence rate]] of less than one case per 1,000 births by 2005, 
* to cut in half the number of [[measles]]-related deaths that occurred in 1999, and 
* to extend all new vaccine and [[preventive healthcare|preventative health]] interventions to children in all districts in the world.  

In addition, the GAVI has set up specific milestones to achieve the EPI goals: that by 2010 all countries have routine immunization coverage of 90% of their child population, that HepB be introduced in 80% of all countries by 2007, and that 50% of the poorest countries have Hib vaccine by 2005.&lt;ref name=chapter55&gt;Hadler S, Cochi S, Bilous J, Cutts F.  “Vaccination Programs in Developing Countries.” Chapter 55: ''Vaccines'', 4th ed. 2004, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

In each of the United Nations’ member states, the national governments create and implement their policies for vaccination programs following the guidelines set by the EPI. Setting up an immunization program is multifaceted and contains many complex components including a reliable cold chain system, transport for the delivery of the vaccines, maintenance of vaccine stocks, training and monitoring of health workers, outreach educational programs to inform the public, and a means of documenting and recording which child receives which vaccines. 
[[File:EPI Schedule in Pakistan.jpg|thumb|EPI Schedule implemented in Pakistan]]
Each region has slightly varying ways of setting up and implementing their immunization programs based on their level of health infrastructure. 

Some areas will have fixed sites for vaccination: health care facilities such as hospitals or health posts that include vaccination with many other health care activities. But in areas where the number of structured health facilities is small, mobile vaccination teams consisting of staff members from a health facility can deliver vaccines straight to individual towns and villages. These ‘outreach’ services are often scheduled throughout the year. However, in especially under-developed countries where proper communication and infrastructure is absent, cancellation of the planned immunization visits leads to deterioration of the program. A better strategy in such countries is the ‘pulse immunization’ technique, where ‘pulses’ of vaccines are given to children in annual vaccination campaigns.&lt;ref name=disease&gt;[http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP Jamison D, Breman J, Measham A, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans D, Jha P, Mills A, Musgrove P. ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', Second Edition. 2006, The World Bank Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123000000/http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |date=January 23, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;

Additional strategies are needed if the area of the program consists of poor urban communities because such areas tend to have low uptake of vaccination programs. Door-to-door canvassing, also referred to as channeling, is used to increase uptake in such hard to reach groups. Finally, periodic national-level mass vaccination campaigns are being increasingly included in the programs.&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;

== Evaluation ==

In each country, immunization programs are monitored using two methods: an administrative method and through community-based surveys. The administrative method uses immunization data from public, private, and NGO clinics. Thus, the accuracy of the administrative method is limited by the availability and accuracy of reports from these facilities. This method is easily performed in areas where government services deliver the immunizations directly or where the government supplies the vaccines to the clinics. In countries without the infrastructure to do this, community-based surveys are used to estimate immunization coverage.&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;

Community-based surveys are applied using a modified [[cluster sampling]] survey method developed by the World Health Organization. Vaccine coverage is evaluated using a two-stage sampling approach in which 30 clusters and seven children in each cluster are selected. Health care workers with no or limited background in statistics and sampling are able to carry out data collection with minimal training.&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“A simplified general method for cluster-sample surveys of health in developing countries.” ''World Health Statistics Quarterly''. 1991; 44(3):98-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a survey implementation provides a way to get information from areas where there is no reliable data source. It is also used to validate reported vaccine coverage (for example, from administrative reports) and is expected to estimate vaccine coverage within 10 percent.&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;

Surveys or questionnaires, though frequently considered inaccurate due to self-reporting, can provide more detailed information than administrative reports alone. If home-based records are available, vaccination status be determined and dates of vaccination can be reviewed to determine if they were given at an ideal age and in appropriate intervals. Missed immunizations can be identified and further qualified. Importantly, systems of vaccine delivery besides clinics used for administrative evaluation can be identified and included in the analysis.&lt;ref name=chapter55/&gt;

== Results ==

Before the initiation of the EPI, child vaccination coverage for tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and measles was estimated to be fewer than 5 percent. Now, not only has coverage increased to 79 percent,&lt;ref name=unicef&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/immunization/index_coverage.html UNICEF. “Expanding Immunization Coverage”]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been expanded to include vaccinations for hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B, [[rubella]], tetanus, and yellow fever. The impact of increased vaccination is clear from the decreasing incidence of many diseases. For example, measles deaths decreased by 60% worldwide between 1999 and 2005, and polio, although missing the goal of eradication by 2005, has decreased significantly as there were fewer than 2,000 cases in 2006.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;

[[File:Map-of-HIV-Prevalance-in-Africa.png|thumb|300px|right|Estimated HIV prevalence among adults aged 15-49 by country in 2007]]
HIV/AIDS is the most serious health concern in South Africa. The country has the fourth-highest adult HIV prevalence rate in the world, according to the 2016 United Nations statistics.&lt;ref name="databank.worldbank.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS&amp;country=ZAF#|title=World Development Indicators {{!}} DataBank|website=databank.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a UNAids dataset sourced from the World Bank, in 2016 the HIV prevalence rate for adults aged 15 to 49 was 27% in Swaziland, 25% in Lesotho, 25% in Botswana and 19% in South Africa.&lt;ref name="databank.worldbank.org"/&gt;

== Understanding HIV prevalence ==

[[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|HIV prevalence]] does not indicate that a country has an AIDS crisis, as HIV and AIDS are separate conditions. HIV prevalence, instead, indicates that people remain alive, despite the infection. South Africa has the largest HIV treatment programme in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://africacheck.org/reports/yes-south-africa-has-the-worlds-largest-antiretroviral-therapy-programme/|title=Yes, South Africa has the world’s largest antiretroviral therapy programme|last=Wilkinson|first=Kate|date=12 February 2018|website=Africa Check|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the correct medication, HIV is a manageable chronic condition, like diabetes or hypertension. A population with a larger proportion of diabetics, means more people are receiving treatment for the condition. Hence, a population with a larger proportion of HIV-positive people, means more people are receiving [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral treatment]].

[[World Bank]] [[Open data|Open Data]] explains the data it publishes on HIV prevalence as follows:

{{quote
|HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of HIV infection in each country's population. Low national prevalence rates can be misleading, however. They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable.

Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAids). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. The models, which are routinely updated, track the course of HIV epidemics and their impact, making full use of information in HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The models take into account reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy (which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer) and allow for changes in urbanization over time in generalized epidemics. The estimates include plausibility bounds, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS&amp;country=#

South Africa's HIV treatment programme was launched in earnest in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/infographics/infographic-hiv-aids-south-africa-1990-2016/|title=Infographic: HIV and Aids in South Africa 1990 to 2016 - South Africa Gateway|date=2018-02-20|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend in South Africa's HIV and AIDS statistics has changed significantly in the years since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/infographics/infographic-hiv-aids-south-africa-1990-2016/|title=Infographic: HIV and Aids in South Africa 1990 to 2016 - South Africa Gateway|date=2018-02-20|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latest data on HIV prevalence in South Africa ==
The [[World Bank]] and [[United Nations]] source their data on HIV prevalence from [[Statistics South Africa]].

According to [[Statistics South Africa]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/|title=Statistics South Africa {{!}} The South Africa I Know, The Home I Understand|last=Africa|first=Statistics South|website=www.statssa.gov.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; mid-year population estimates for 2017,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1854&amp;PPN=P0302|title=Mid-Year Population Estimates 2017 {{!}} Statistics South Africa|last=Staitistics South Africa|first=|date=|website=www.statssa.gov.za|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the total HIV prevalence rate for the country is 12.6%. The HIV prevalence rate for all adults aged 15 to 49 is 17.9%, for women aged 15 to 49 is 21.2%, and for youth aged 15 to 24 is 4.6%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Statistics South Africa estimates the number of deaths attributable to AIDS in 2017 as 126,755 or 25.03% of all South African deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/infographics/infographic-hiv-aids-south-africa-1990-2016/|title=Infographic: HIV and Aids in South Africa 1990 to 2016 - South Africa Gateway|date=2018-02-20|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other statistics ==

=== By race ===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in South African townships}}
A 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa was distinctly divided along racial lines: 13.6% of [[Black people|Black Africans]] in South Africa are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of [[Whites]] living in South Africa have the disease.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm|title=HIV and AIDS in South Africa|date=21 July 2015|website=Avert.org|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; False traditional beliefs about HIV/AIDS, which contribute to the spread of the disease, persist in townships due to the lack of education and awareness programmes in these regions. [[Sexual violence in South Africa|Sexual violence]] and local attitudes toward HIV/AIDS have also amplified the epidemic.

=== By gender===
HIV/AIDS is more prevalent among females, especially those under the age of 40. Women made up roughly 4 in every 5 people with HIV/AIDS aged 20–24, and 2 out of 3 of those aged 25–29. Although prevalence is higher among women in general, only 1 in every 6 HIV/AIDS infected people with multiple sex partners are women.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

Young boys and girls in South Africa are both highly affected by intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS. Research has found links between the two, as well as a relationship with drug use. It was found that problem drinking and marijuana use are mediating variables in the relationship between men who experienced [[childhood sexual abuse]] and who engage in HIV sexual risk behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Icard LD, Jemmott, John B., I., II, Teitelman A, O’Leary A, Heeren GA. Mediation effects of problem drinking and marijuana use on HIV sexual risk behaviors among childhood sexually abused South African heterosexual men. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 2014; 38(2): 234-242&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult and adolescent women, low relationship power and victimization by intimate partner violence were found to be linked to HIV risk. This lower relationship power affects interpersonal dynamics that increase sexual risk due to condom nonuse and the likelihood of a girl with low relationship power having more sexual partners. However, both boys and girls with lower relationship power were found to be more likely to have multiple partners. Regardless of gender, youths with lower power are more vulnerable to be pressured or coerced into transactional sex.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelman AM, Jemmott III, JB, Bellamy SL, Icard, LD, O’Leary A, Heeren GA, Ngwane Z. Ratcliffe SJ. Partner violence, power and gender differences in South African adolescents’ HIV/STI behaviors. Health Psychology. 2016; 35(7): 751–760. doi: 10.1037/hea0000351&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By pregnant women ===
HIV prevalence among pregnant women is highest in the populous [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province (37%), and lowest in the Western Cape (13%), Northern Cape (16%) and Limpopo (18%) provinces. In the five other provinces (Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West) at least 26% of women attending [[Prenatal care|antenatal clinics]] in 2006 tested HIV-positive.

The latest HIV data collected at antenatal clinics suggest that HIV infection levels might be levelling off, with HIV prevalence in pregnant women at 30% in 2007, 29% in 2006, and 28% in 2005. The decrease in the percentage of young pregnant women (15–24 years) found to be infected with HIV can be extrapolated to suggest a possible decline in the annual number of new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The national hiv and syphilis prevalence survey south africa 2007 |publisher=The South African Department of Health |url=http://www.health-e.org.za/resources/reports.php |accessdate=22 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010193647/http://www.health-e.org.za/resources/reports.php |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By age ===
Between 2005 and 2008, the number of older teenagers with HIV/AIDS has nearly halved.&lt;ref name="5890Setswe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrc.ac.za/research/output/outputDocuments/5890_Setswe_HIVandAIDSepidemicinSA.pdf|title=The HIV and AIDS epidemic in South Africa: Where are we?|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214206/http://www.hsrc.ac.za/research/output/outputDocuments/5890_Setswe_HIVandAIDSepidemicinSA.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=15 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2002 and 2008, prevalence among South Africans over 20 years old have increased whereas the figure for those under 20 years old have dropped somewhat over the same period.&lt;ref name=5890Setswe/&gt;

Condom use is highest among the youth and lowest among older people. More than 80% of men and more than 70% of women under 25 years old use condoms, and slightly more than half of men and women aged 25–49 claim to use condoms.&lt;ref name=5890Setswe/&gt;

More than 30% of young adults and more than 80% of older adults are aware of the dangers posed by HIV/AIDS. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS is lowest among people older than 50 years—less than two thirds know exactly what HIV/AIDS is.&lt;ref name=5890Setswe/&gt;

=== By province ===
{{Further|HIV/AIDS in South African townships}}
In 2008, more than half (55%) of all South Africans infected with HIV resided in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web| title = Sub-Saharan Africa AIDS epidemic update. Regional Summary| publisher = [[UNAIDS]]| url = http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2008/jc1526_epibriefs_ssafrica_en.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029182033/http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2008/jc1526_epibriefs_ssafrica_en.pdf| archivedate = 29 October 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2008, the total number of people infected with HIV/AIDS has increased in all of South Africa's provinces except KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Nevertheless, KwaZulu-Natal still has the highest infection rate at 15.5%  In the province with the lowest infection rate, the Western Cape, the total number of people with HIV/AIDS doubled between 2005 and 2008.&lt;ref name=5890Setswe/&gt;

Condom use has increased twofold in all provinces between 2002 and 2008. The two provinces where condoms were least used in 2002 were also the provinces where condoms are least used in 2008, namely the Northern Cape and the Western Cape.&lt;ref name=5890Setswe/&gt;

HIV/AIDS prevalence among sexually active South Africans by province are:

* KwaZulu-Natal: 25.8%.
* Mpumalanga: 23.1%
* Free State: 18.5%
* North West: 17.7%
* Gauteng: 15.2%
* Eastern Cape: 15.2%
* Limpopo: 13.7%
* Northern Cape: 9.2%
* Western Cape: 5.3%

== Awareness campaigns ==
The four main HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns in South Africa are [[Khomanani]] (funded by the government), [[loveLife South Africa|LoveLife]] (primarily privately funded), [[Soul City (HIV/AIDS campaign)|Soul City]] (a television drama for adults) and [[Soul Buddyz]] (a television series for teenagers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Document-3239.phtml |title=slide 33 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213925/http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Document-3239.phtml |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soul City and Soul Buddyz are the most successful campaigns although both campaigns experienced a slight loss of effectiveness between 2005 and 2008. Khomanani is the least successful campaign, although its effectiveness has increased by more than 50% between 2005 and 2008.

The dubious quality of condoms which are distributed is a setback to these efforts. In 2007, the government recalled more than 20 million locally manufactured condoms which were defective. Some of the contraceptive devices given away at the ANC's centenary celebrations in 2012 failed a water test conducted by the [[Treatment Action Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper = The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/south-africa-recalls-anc-condoms| date = 31 January 2012| title = South Africa recalls 1m ANC condoms: Scores of people given free condoms at the party's centenary celebrations have complained that they are faulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-infection with tuberculosis ==
In 2007, it was estimated that one third of HIV infected people will develop TB ([[tuberculosis]]) in their lifetimes. In 2006, 40% of TB patients were tested for HIV. It has been the government policy since 2002 to cross-check all new cases of TB for HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2008/progress/part2.pdf |title=South Africa – Country Progress Report |website=Doh.gov.za |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620024839/http://doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2008/progress/part2.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although STI prevention is part of the government's HIV/AIDS programmes, as is that of most countries, in South Africa HIV/AIDS prevention is done in conjunction with TB prevention. Most patients who die from HIV-related causes die from TB or similar illnesses. In fact the Health Department's programme of prevention is called the "National HIV and AIDS and TB Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/aids/docs/aids_unit.html |title=National HIV/AIDS and TB Unit, National Department of Health, Pretoria |publisher=Doh.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619141340/http://doh.gov.za/aids/docs/aids_unit.html |archivedate=19 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with United Nations requirements, South Africa has also drawn up an "HIV &amp; AIDS and STI Strategic Plan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2007/aidsplan2007/background.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907071435/http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2007/aidsplan2007/background.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1983, AIDS was diagnosed for the first time in two patients in South Africa.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ras GJ, Simson IW, Anderson R, Prozesky OW, Hamersma T. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A report of 2 South African cases. S Afr Med J 1983 Jul 23; 64(4): 140–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recorded AIDS-related death occurred in the same year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===1990===
In 1990, the first national antenatal survey to test for HIV found that 0.8% of pregnant women were HIV-positive. It was estimated that there were between 74,000 and 6,500,135 people in South Africa living with HIV.

===1993===
In 1993, the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women was 4.3%. By 1993, the National Health Department reported that the number of recorded HIV infections had increased by 60% in the previous two years and the number was expected to double in 1993.

===1995===
In August 1995, the [[Department of Health (South Africa)|Department of Health]] awarded a R14.27-million contract to produce a sequel to the musical, ''[[Sarafina! (musical)|Sarafina!]]'', about AIDS, in order to reach young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthlink.org.za/pphc/Phila/sarafina.htm |title=The Sarafina II Controversy |publisher=Healthlink.org.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007163642/http://www.healthlink.org.za/pphc/Phila/sarafina.htm |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was dogged by controversy, and was finally shelved in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/pr/1996/pr0605.html |title=Zuma'S Response To Sarafina Ii |publisher=Doh.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619184301/http://doh.gov.za/docs/pr/1996/pr0605.html |archivedate=19 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 to 10 March 1995, the 7th International Conference for People Living with HIV and AIDS was held in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aids.org/atn/a-215-07.html |title=International Conference for People Living with HIV and AIDS, Cape Town, South Africa, March&amp;nbsp;6–10; Pre- Conference for Wo |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719170032/http://www.aids.org/atn/a-215-07.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was opened by then-Deputy President [[Thabo Mbeki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/1995/news0304] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996===
In January 1996, it was decided that South Africa's national soccer team, [[Bafana Bafana]], would contribute to the AIDS Awareness Campaign by wearing red ribbons to all their public appearances during the [[Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Nations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1996/96j15_0w825.htm |title=Bafana Endorses Aids Awareness Campaign |publisher=Info.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103322/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1996/96j15_0w825.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She said:

: ''Most people infected with HIV live in Africa, where therapies involving combinations of expensive [anti-retroviral] drugs are out of the question.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukzn.ac.za/heard/research/ResearchReports/2005/Environment+Report/APPENDIXES.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 January 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=26 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119180300/http://www.ukzn.ac.za/heard/research/ResearchReports/2005/Environment%20Report/APPENDIXES.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997===
In February 1997, South African government's Health Department defended its support for the controversial AIDS drug [[Virodene]] by stating that "the 'cocktails' that are available [for the treatment of HIV/AIDS] are way beyond the means of most patients [even from developed countries]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1997/02070x44397.htm |title=Dr. N C Zuma On Virodene Controversy |publisher=Info.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103407/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1997/02070x44397.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament had previously launched an investigation into the procedural soundness of the clinical trials for the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1997/03030w67697.htm |title=Response To Virodene Investigation |publisher=Info.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103418/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1997/03030w67697.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1999 ===
In 1999, the South African HIV prevention campaign [[loveLife South Africa|LoveLife]] was founded.

=== 2000 ===
In 2000, the Department of Health outlined a five-year plan to combat AIDS, HIV and STIs. A National AIDS Council (SANAC) was set up to oversee these developments.

===2001===
The South African government successfully defended against a legal action brought by [[Transnational compaines|transnational]] [[pharmaceutical companies]] in April 2001 of a law that would allow cheaper locally produced medicines, including anti-retrovirals, although the government's roll-out of anti-retrovirals remained generally slow.

In 2001, [[Right to Care]], an NGO dedicated to the prevention and treatment of HIV and associated diseases, was founded. Using [[USAID]]'s [[PEPFAR]] funding, the organisation expanded rapidly and after ten years (2011) had over 125,000 HIV-positive patients in clinical care.

===2002===
In 2002, South Africa's [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] ordered the government to remove restrictions on the drug [[nevirapine]] and make it available to pregnant women in all state hospitals and clinics to help [[HIV and pregnancy#Prevention of mother-to-child transmission|prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/people/hiv-aids-south-africa/|title=HIV and Aids in South Africa - South Africa Gateway|date=2018-02-12|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a court challenge by [[Treatment Action Campaign]] and others.

== Aids denialism under Thabo Mbeki ==
: ''See also [[HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa]].''

=== 2000 ===
On 9 July 2000, then President [[Thabo Mbeki]] opened the [[International AIDS Society|International AIDS Conference]] in Durban with a speech not about HIV or AIDS but about extreme poverty in Africa. In the speech, he confirmed his belief that immune deficiency is a big problem in Africa but that one can't possibly attribute all immune deficiency-related diseases to a single virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2000/000714451p1001.htm |title=MBEKI: 13TH INTERNATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE |publisher=Info.gov.za |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103303/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2000/000714451p1001.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm |title=Controversy dogs Aids forum |publisher=BBC News  |date=10 July 2000 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2000, Thabo Mbeki acknowledged during an interview with Time Magazine (South African edition) that HIV can cause AIDS but confirmed his opinion that HIV should not be regarded as the sole cause of immune deficiency. He said:

: ''...the notion that immune deficiency is only acquired from a single virus cannot be sustained. Once you say immune deficiency is acquired from that virus, your response will be anti-retroviral drugs. But if you accept that there can be a variety of reasons ... then you can have a more comprehensive treatment response.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tac.org.za/newsletter/2000/ns000908.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201215432/http://www.tac.org.za/newsletter/2000/ns000908.txt |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vos |first=Pierre De |url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/?p=1079 |title=Thabo Mbeki’s strange relationship with the truth continues – Constitutionally Speaking |publisher=Constitutionallyspeaking.co.za |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki responded to a question in [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] about his views. He said:

: ''All HIV/AIDS programmes of this government are based on the thesis that HIV causes AIDS. [But...] can a virus cause a syndrome? ... It can't, because a syndrome is a group of diseases resulting from acquired immune deficiency. Indeed, HIV contributes [to the collapse of the immune system], but other things contribute as well.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aegis.com/news/woza/2000/IC000906.html |title=How can a virus cause a syndrome? asks Mbeki |publisher=Aegis.com |date=21 September 2000 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526083439/http://www.aegis.com/news/woza/2000/IC000906.html |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 ===
In 2001 the government appointed a panel of scientists, including a number of [[AIDS denialist]]s, to report back on the issue. The report suggested alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS, but the South African government responded that unless alternative scientific proof is obtained, it will continue to base its policy on the idea that the cause of AIDS is HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1260941.stm |title=South African split over Aids |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 April 2001 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003===
Despite international drug companies offering free or cheap anti-retroviral drugs, the Health Ministry remained hesitant about providing treatment for people living with HIV. Only in November 2003 did the government approve a plan to make anti-retroviral treatment publicly available. Prior to 2003, South Africans with HIV who used the public sector health system could get treatment for opportunistic infections but could not get anti-retrovirals.&lt;ref name=TheSouthAfricanDepartmentofHealthStudy/&gt;

=== 2006 ===
The effort to improve treatment of HIV/AIDS was damaged by the attitude of many figures in the government, including [[Thabo Mbeki|President Mbeki]]. The then health minister, [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]], advocated a diet of garlic, olive oil and lemon to cure the disease.&lt;ref name=drbeetroot&gt;{{cite news

=== 2007 ===
In August 2007, President Mbeki and Health Minister Tshabalala-Msimang dismissed Deputy Health Minister [[Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge]].

== Role of the media in South Africa's epidemic ==
The South African press took a strong advocacy position during the [[denialism]] era under Thabo Mbeki.&lt;ref name=mmalan&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous examples of journalists taking the government to task for policy positions and public statements that were seen as irresponsible.&lt;ref name=mmalan /&gt;{{rp|44}} Some of these examples include: attacks on Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang’s “garlic and potato” approach to treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/123054-040215st |title=Zapiro cartoon |publisher=Zapiro.com |date=15 February 2004 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718151203/http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/123054-040215st |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; outrage at Mbeki’s statement that he never knew anyone who had died of AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/printformat/single/2003-09-29-we-dont-need-red-herrings |title=We don't need red hrrings |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=29 September 2003 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coverage of the humiliating 2006 International AIDS Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-08-21-manto-defends-aids-policies |title=Manto defends AIDS policies |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It could be claimed that the news media have taken a less aggressive stance since the end of Mbeki’s presidency and the death of Tshabalala Msimang. The emergence of Jacob Zuma as party and state leader heralded what the press saw as a new era of AIDS treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2009/november/20091101southafrica/ |title=President heralds new era |publisher=Unaids.org |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this also means that HIV is afforded less news coverage. A recent study by the HIV/AIDS and the Media Project has shown that the quantity of HIV-related news coverage has declined dramatically from 2002/3 (what could be considered the pinnacle of government denialism) to the more recent “conflict resolution” phase under Zuma. Perhaps HIV has fallen into the traditional categories of being impersonal, undramatic, "old" news.&lt;ref name="afinlay" /&gt; The number of health journalists has also declined considerably.&lt;ref name=cduncan&gt;{{cite news

A '''Health Equity Impact Analysis''' is a decision support tool which walks users through the steps of identifying how a program, [[policy]] or similar initiative will impact [[populations|population groups]] in different ways. HEIAs are meant to show, ''inter alia'', unintended potential impacts. The goal is to maximize positive impacts and reduce negative impacts that could potentially widen [[health]] [[health disparity|disparities]] between population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/heia/|title=Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) - Ministry Programs - Health Care Professionals - MOHLTC|work=gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health in Afghanistan''' is unsatisfactory but slowly improving. The [[Ministry of Public Health (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Public Health]] oversees all matters concerning the health of [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's population]]. According to the [[Human Development Index]], [[Afghanistan]] is the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|15th least developed country in the world]]. Its average [[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]] at birth is reported at around 60 years.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/136852/1/ccsbrief_afg_en.pdf |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; The country's [[maternal mortality]] rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its [[infant mortality]] rate is 66&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt;

There are over 100 government-run and private or internationally-administered [[List of hospitals in Afghanistan|hospitals in Afghanistan]]. The most advanced medical treatments are available in [[Kabul]]. The [[French Medical Institute for Children]] and [[Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital]] in Kabul are the leading [[children's hospital]]s in the country. The Kabul Military Hospital and the [[Jamhuriat Hospital]] are two of the popular hospitals in the country. In spite of all this, many Afghans still travel to [[Medical tourism in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Medical tourism in India|India]] for advanced treatment.

==History==
The decades of war have destroyed Afghanistan's already-poor health care system. Most medical professionals left the country by 1992, and all medical training programs ceased. In 2003, there were 11 [[physicians]] and 18 [[nurses]] per 100,000 population, and the per capita health expenditure was $28 [[US dollar]]s. The nation had one medical facility for every 27,000 people in 2004, and some centers were responsible for as many as 300,000 people. An estimated one-quarter of the population had no access to health care. The international organizations provided a large share of medical care. The drought of 1999–2002 exacerbated these conditions. 

[[File:1960s Afghanistan - Infant ward in a Kabul hospital.jpg|thumb|200px|Infant ward at a Kabul hospital, 1960s]]
It was reported in 2006 that an estimated 800,000 Afghans are [[disabled]].&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (May 2006).

[[Malnutrition]] and poor nutrition also are pervasive.

User fees have been a major deterrent to accessing health care. Various interventions have been devised to improve uptake of health care services, including the distribution of waiver cards to very poor and female-headed households&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhardt|first=Laura|author2=David Peters|title=Targeting accuracy and impact of a community-identified waiver card scheme for primary care user fees in Afghanistan|journal=International Journal for Equity in Health|year=2010|volume=9|issue=28|doi=10.1186/1475-9276-9-28|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/targeting-accuracy-and-impact-of-a-community-identified-waiv.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of community-based health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=K|title=An Experiment with Community Health Funds in Afghanistan|journal=Health Policy and Planning|date=27 May 2009|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/an-experiment-with-community-health-funds-in-afghanistan.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical and psychological effects of war have substantially increased the need for medical care. In the last decade a number of new [[List of hospitals in Afghanistan|hospitals]] were established, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The [[French Medical Institute for Children]] and [[Indira Gandhi Childrens Hospital]] in Kabul are the leading [[children's hospital]]s in the country. Some of the other main hospitals in Kabul include the 350-bed [[Jamhuriat Hospital]], the [[Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan]] Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/world/asia/22afghanistan.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Ray | last1=Rivera | first2=Sharifullah | last2=Sahak | title=Blast Hits Military Hospital in Afghan Capital | date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Jinnah Hospital (Kabul)|Jinnah Hospital]], which is under construction. There are also a number of [[Afghan Armed Forces|military]]-controlled hospitals in different regions of the country. A new 350-bed hospital is under construction in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pajhwok.com/en/node/486178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health status==
2011 surveys show that 57 percent of Afghans say they have good or very good access to clinics or hospitals,&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt; and Afghans themselves pay approximately 75% of [[health care costs]] directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=NPR|author=Renee Montagne|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2012-01-16|title=USAID Helps To Improve Medical Care In Afghanistan|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/22/144111949/usaid-improves-medical-care-in-afghanistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuberculosis===
Tuberculosis is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Afghanistan, with over 76,000 cases reported per year. The United States Agency for International Development is engaged in promulgating [[DOTS]] ([[directly observed therapy, short course]]) treatments, as well as TB awareness and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/stories/afghanistan/ss_af_tb.html|title=Bringing Hope to Tuberculosis Patients|work=|publisher=United States Agency for International Development (USAID)|accessdate=2010-10-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528072441/http://www.usaid.gov/stories/afghanistan/ss_af_tb.html|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] is a development organisation that focuses on the alleviation of poverty through the empowerment of the poor to improve their lives. BRAC Afghanistan is involved in assisting [[Afghan Ministry of Public Health]] in the implementation of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) in Kabul, Badghis, Balkh and Nimroz. This implementation is mainly funded by the World Bank and the USAID-REACH (United States Agency for International Development - Rural Expansion of Afghanistan Community-based Healthcare).

Tuberculosis is a serious public health problem in Afghanistan. In 2007, 8,200 people in the country died from tuberculosis and, in the WHO's Global Tuberculosis Control Report 2009, an annual estimated figure of 46,000 new cases of tuberculosis were in Afghanistan. As such, Afghanistan is ranked 22nd in amongst highly affected Tuberculosis countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Thomas, Global Health/Health Infectious Diseases and Nutrition |url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/id/tuberculosis/countries/asia/afghanistan_profile.html |title=USAID Health: Infectious Diseases, Tuberculosis, Countries, Afghanistan |publisher=USAID |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805163803/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/id/tuberculosis/countries/asia/afghanistan_profile.html |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help control tuberculosis, BRAC Afghanistan started the community-based [[TB DOTS]] under the ''Fund for Innovative DOTS Expansion through Local Initiatives to Stop TB (FIDELIS)'' project in 2006. In the first phase of this programme, diagnostic facilities for tuberculosis were expanded through the setting up of 50 TB microscopy centres. This phase lasted from January 2006 and up to March 2007. Over the next two years, facilities were further expanded and 92 more Tuberculosis Microscopy Centres were set up under the FIDELIS programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbalert.org/worldwide/DOTS.php |title=DOTS |publisher=Tbalert.org |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728083404/http://www.tbalert.org/worldwide/DOTS.php |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuberculosis Control Assistance Programme (TB CAP) is another project taken up between BRAC Afghanistan, [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and Management Sciences for Health (MSH) in a bid to fight TB in Afghanistan. In this project, BRAC Afghanistan supports the BPHS (Basic Package of Health Services) project by replicating the CB-DOTS model into health systems of four provinces: Baghlan, Jawzjan, Badakshan and Herat. BRAC Afghanistan was selected as Principal Recipient (PR) for malaria and TB components of the Global Fund 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SWiSH v2.0 |url=http://www.bracafg.org/cbh1.php |title=BRAC Afghanistan (Bangladesh)- Community Based Health Program |publisher=Bracafg.org |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830022328/http://www.bracafg.org/cbh1.php |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, 2,143,354 patients received treatment under the health programs mentioned. As of August 2010, BRAC Afghanistan had covered 388 districts and 25 million of the total population are under the BRAC Afghanistan Health Program. Health facilities also include six District Hospitals, 26 Comprehensive Health Centres, 53 Basic Health Centres, 18 Sub Health Centres as well as 533 Mobile Clinics every month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bracafg.org/report/At%20A%20Glance%20of%20BRAC%20Afghanistan%20as%20of%20August2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV===
The prevalence of HIV in Afghanistan is 0.04%.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt; According to Afghanistan's National Aids Control Program (NACP), 504 cases of HIV/AIDS were documented in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/afghanistan_46717.html Children at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in Afghanistan]. December 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012, the numbers reached 1,327. Afghanistan's healthy ministry stated that most of the HIV patients were among [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[drug user]]s and that 70% of them were men, 25% women, and the remaining 5% children. They belonged to Kabul, Kandahar and Herat, the provinces from where people make the most trips to neighboring or other foreign countries.&lt;ref name="over-1300-hiv-cases-registered-afghanistan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/12/01/over-1300-hiv-cases-registered-afghanistan |title=Over 1,300 HIV cases registered in Afghanistan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=December 1, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Kandahar, 22 cases were reported in 2012. "AIDS Prevention department head Dr Hamayoun Rehman said 1,320 blood samples were examined and 21 were positive. Among the 21 patients, 18 were males and three were females who contracted the deadly virus from their husbands. He said four people had reached a critical stage while three had died. The main source of the disease was the use of [[syringe]]s used by drug addicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/12/02/aids-patients-have-doubled-kandahar-official |title=AIDS patients have doubled in Kandahar: Official |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=December 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 23,000 addicts in the country who inject drugs into their bodies using syringes. As of 2015, as much as 6,900 people are living in Afghanistan with HIV and about 300 have died in from the disease.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt;

'''Poliomyelitis'''

The Afghan Ministry of Public Health along with [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] are engaged in a campaign to eliminate polio in the country. Wild poliovirus is present in Afghanistan, though in limited areas. Reported cases were on the decline, from 63 in 1999 to 17 in 2007, until increased violence in 2008 impeded vaccination efforts, causing cases to climb to 20 for the first nine months of 2009. Afghanistan, the remaining country where polio is endemic. Most of Afghanistan is polio-free. The country has not yet interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus. While most cases in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were due to poliovirus imported from neighbouring Pakistan, there is also ongoing transmission of virus within Afghanistan. In 2015 and from January/2016 to September/ 2016. Afghanistan had a major reduction in WPV cases. The majority of cases were reported from Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan, and were genetically linked to cases in Pakistan. Afghanistan reported 20 cases in 16 districts in 2015, compared with 28 cases in 19 districts in 2014, and 8 cases in 2016, The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 8 August/2016, from Kabul.

===Leprosy===
Despite anti-leprosy initiatives by [[Leprosy Control]] (LEPCO) dating to 1984, [[leprosy]] is present in Afghanistan, with 231 cases reported in the 2001-2007 period. Just over three-quarters of the cases were the MB-type, with the rest PB-type. Leprosy has been reported in the central [[Hindu Kush]] mountain area of the country. Mainly in the provinces of [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]], [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]], [[Balkh Province|Balkh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilep.org.uk/fileadmin/uploads/Country_Pages/Afghanistan/Afghanistan.pdf Leprosy Situation in Afghanistan in 2001-2006]. [[Afghan Ministry of Public Health|Ministry of Public Health]] (MoPH) National Leprosy Control Program. 7–9 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typhoid fever===
Being the 15th least developed country in the world, Afghanistan faces difficulties in sanitation. In urban areas 40% of the population have unimproved access to sanitation facilities. Because of this many Afghanistan natives are forced to combat typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is one of Afghanistan's major infectious diseases in terms of food/waterborne diseases. This infectious disease occurs when fecal material comes into contact with food or water. Symptoms vary from case to case but often mild fever is present and if left untreated death may occur.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt;

===Hepatitis A===
Sanitation issues place the Afghanistan population at risk of contracting hepatitis A through the consumption of food and water that has been contaminated by fecal material. Hepatitis A works by inhibiting the liver from functioning properly. Symptoms generally include jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, while some victims may experience diarrhea. Furthermore, symptoms will appear 2–6 weeks after an individual has come into contact with the hepatitis A virus.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt; Efforts have been made to fight hepatitis through efforts by the Pashtun community. Tribal leader Davud Suleimankhel is credited with establishing an organization that teaches people about Hepatitis, Tuberculosis, and other diseases. In a speech to the Jalalabad Pashtun League, he said that "the red-blooded vigor of the Pashtuns and the iron soul of Afghanistan shall not falter in the face of disease".{{cn|date=April 2018|reason=Supporting cite required for direct quotations}} Various aid organizations have also started to work in Afghanistan to combat Hepatitis.

===Leishmaniasis===
[[Visceral leishmaniasis]] infections are often recognised by fever, swelling of the liver and spleen, and [[anemia]].  They are known by many local names, of which the most common is probably ''[[Kala azar]]''.&lt;ref name=humber&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/film/4171/Kala-Azar Kala Azar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kala-azar&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/K0005100.html kala-azar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210143548/http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/K0005100.html |date=2009-02-10 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 21 cases of VL acquired in Afghanistan, all in the 1980s according to CDC reporting.&lt;ref name=cdc-kala-azar&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5312a5.htm]. Two Cases of Visceral Leishmaniasis in U.S. Military Personnel&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal and child health care===
{{Further information|Afghanistan Midwifery Project}}
[[File:Recovery area of a hospital in Kabul.jpg|thumb|Mothers and infants receiving [[health care]] at a hospital in [[Kabul]].]]

Afghanistan made significant improvement in the last decade to its maternal and child health care. According to [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), Afghanistan's [[mortality rate]] has decreased by about 25% since 2003. It was reported in 2006 that nearly 60% of the population lives within two hours walking distance of the nearest health facility.&lt;ref name="USAID-Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/health |title=Health |work=[[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) |publisher=www.usaid.gov |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[maternal mortality]] rate is currently 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its [[infant mortality]] rate is 66&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uis.unesco.org/country/af |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=www.cia.gov |accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Public Health wants to further improve these higher rates by making them normal. 

The country has more than 3,000 [[midwifery|midwives]], with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/childbirth-maternal-health-improve-afghanistan-160657704.html |title=Childbirth and maternal health improve in Afghanistan |first=Tom A. |last=Peter |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231002243/http://news.yahoo.com/childbirth-maternal-health-improve-afghanistan-160657704.html |archivedate=31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sima Ayubi, a maternity doctor in Kabul who advocates hospital births, explains: "Now pregnant women have more information about health. This mortality rate is still a problem. There's just a decrease. The problem is not completely eliminated or under control."&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;

According to a 2012 report by [[Save the Children]], improved healthcare and the rise of females attending school have made Afghanistan climb up from its position as the worst place on earth to be a mother. "More mothers are surviving and fewer children are dying and this is something we need to be celebrating," said Rachel Maranto, Advocacy and Mobilisation senior Manager at Save the Children in Kabul.

Ford Jr.]] characterized Bolton as a "''kiss-up, kick-down'' sort of guy", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-12-bolton_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Critic says Bolton a 'kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy' | first1=Barbara | last1=Slavin | date=April 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
Calum Paton, Professor of Health Policy at [[Keele University]], describes ''kiss up kick down'' as a prevalent feature of the UK [[National Health Service]] culture. He raised this point when giving evidence at the [[Stafford_Hospital_scandal#Public_inquiry|Stafford Hospital scandal public inquiry]]. Credit is centralised and blame devolved. "''Kiss up kick down'' means that your middle level people will ''kiss-up'', they will please their masters, political or otherwise, and they will ''kick down'' to blame somebody else when things go wrong."
&lt;ref name=Paton1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Francis (barrister)|Robert Francis]] (Nov 29, 2011) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwnVE4GPbhs Organisational Culture seminar: opening statement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, NHS Trust bosses are nervous of reporting deficits and seek to under-report until it's too late. They seek to please their political superiors in the short term and shift blame down the line.&lt;ref name=Paton2/&gt;

==Blame in organizations==
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of [[blame]] in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicates organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg (March 5, 2006) [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kick up kiss down===
''Kick up kiss-down'' has been suggested as a viable more healthy dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Schachter (Jul. 25 2011) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/kicking-up-kissing-down/article616182/ Kicking up, kissing down]  The Globe and Mail&lt;/ref&gt; Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs.&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;

==In workplace bullying==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their [[abusive]] behavior hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against the bully's. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;Petrecca, L. (December 27 2010) Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. ''USA Today'' &lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;(15 Oct 2010) [http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Donohue (2 Oct 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager] The Huffington Post Csnada&lt;/ref&gt; The bully may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
the bully's fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt; DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a bully’s mistakes are always concealed or blamed on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* a bully keeps the target under constant [[Occupational stress|stress]]
* a bully’s power base is fear, not respect
* a bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* a bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate’s lack of competence, poor attitude, and/or character flaws
* a bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not.

This is a list of notable people who '''died either from the effects of excessive alcohol consumption or alcohol poisoning'''. The [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] defines [[alcoholism]] as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JAMA – Abstract: The definition of alcoholism. The Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine to Study the Definition and Criteria for the Diagnosis of Alcoholism, August 26, 1992, Morse and Flavin 268 (8): 1012 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/268/8/1012 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of people in this list died from causes brought on by alcoholism. In some cases, they died of multiple causes, with alcoholism being a major factor. Exceptions to this are those who died from [[accidental death]], such as [[alcohol poisoning]] caused by [[binge drinking]]. In these cases, misuse of [[drug]]s sometimes contributed to the person dying. Deaths caused indirectly by alcohol, such as in a [[car accident]] are not listed here. The table below lists people who died as a direct result of alcohol misuse. Dates of death are listed instead of dates of birth.

| [[Torsten Carleman]] || 25 January 1949|| [[Stockholm]], Sweden || [[Alcoholism]]&lt;ref&gt;
"He died of drink&lt;!-- — not the social drinking which leads so often to ruin here—but the fiery, passionate dipsomania which is a common disease even in the very best circles of the Scandinavian countries --&gt;.... During meetings he was often a&amp;nbsp;bit&amp;nbsp;drunk, and afterwards in&amp;nbsp;Paris I saw him come to Mandelbrojt's apartment for an advance on the travel&amp;nbsp;money due&amp;nbsp;him, red-eyed, with a three-day beard."&lt;p&gt;

[[William Feller]] wrote to [[Richard Courant]]: "Carleman is of the touching [rührend] opinion that one should execute [an die Wand stellen] all Jews
and immigrants (which, however, he only tells his assistant after consuming a
nonnegative [nichtnegativ] amount of alcohol)".

Almost all spiders produce venom but only a few are classified as "venomous" and able to cause significant harm to humans.&lt;ref name="GFD2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/search/GFDSearch.asp?itemNum=12031&amp;ContType=HDA|title=Global Family Doctor - Wonca Online &amp;#124; Item search|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313195505/http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/search/GFDSearch.asp?itemNum=12031&amp;ContType=HDA|archivedate=2012-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two medically important spider genera have a worldwide distribution—''Latrodectus'' and ''Loxosceles''. Others have a limited distribution.

Medical reports have been criticized for poor evidence. In the last century, both white tailed and wolf spiders were considered medically significant, only to be recanted.{{Citation needed|reason=needs source showing that the claims are no longer valid|date=April 2018}} Only four genera (''[[Phoneutria]]'', ''[[Atrax]]'', ''[[Latrodectus]]'', and ''[[Loxosceles]]'') are considered medically significant.{{Citation needed|reason= a very specific statement like this should include a source|date=April 2018}} Bites of these spiders have a range of severity, with only a minority having severe symptoms. Deaths by verified spider bites are exceedingly rare (e.g. one in Australia for 40 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney family mourns death of second son in eight months after redback spider bite|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sydney-family-mourns-death-of-second-son-in-eight-months-after-redback-spider-bite-20160412-go3z4d.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazilian wandering spider]] (a [[ctenidae|ctenid]] spider) is a large brown spider similar to North American [[wolf spider]]s in appearance, although somewhat larger. It has a highly toxic venom and is regarded (along with the [[Australian funnel-web spiders]]) as among the most dangerous spiders in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costa SK, Brain SD, Antunes E, De Nucci G, Docherty RJ |title=Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom activates 5-HT4 receptors in rat-isolated vagus nerve |journal=Br.

Based on one of the few [[pharmacological]] studies performed in the 1970s, ''Phoneutria'''s venom toxicity was more virulent than both ''Atrax'' and ''Latrodectus''.

As their name suggests, Brazilian wandering spiders are active ground hunters. If the spider has a reason to be alarmed, it will bite in order to protect itself, but unless startled or provoked, most bites will be without venom. Venom bites will occur if the spider is pressed against something and hurt. In this case, the high levels of [[serotonin]] contained in the venom, plus at minimum strong chelicera, will contribute to deliver a very painful bite.

Children are more sensitive to the venom of wandering spiders. The spiders often make threat gestures, such as raising up their legs, or hopping sideways on the ground, which might amuse a child to the point of reaching towards the spider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/37245-apes-infants-use-common-gestures.html Pick Me Up!

==Australian funnel-web spiders==
{{Main|Australian funnel-web spiders}}
[[File:Atrax robustus.jpg|thumb|Threat display by a [[Sydney funnel-web spider]] (''Atrax robustus'').]]
The [[Australian funnel-web spider]]s, such as the [[Sydney funnel-web spider]] ''Atrax robustus'' (a [[mygalomorph]] spider not to be confused with the [[araneomorph]] funnel-weaver or grass spiders) are regarded as among the most venomous in the world. They react vigorously to threats and, reputedly, will more often attempt to bite than run away. ''A. robustus'', a large black spider, is found within a radius of about 100&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sydney]]. Its venom contains a compound known as [[atracotoxin]] which is highly toxic to primates. Approximately 10% of bites lead to serious symptoms for a total of 3-4 severe envenomations annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Graham M.|last2=Graudins|first2=Andis|title=Antivenoms for the Treatment of Spider Envenomation|journal=Toxin Reviews|date=January 2003|volume=22|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1081/TXR-120019019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/772401-treatment Funnel Web Spider Envenomation Treatment &amp; Management], Retrieved December 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acem.org.au/media/media_releases/Media_release_Wednesday_2__281107.pdf Funnel-web spider now in greater Brisbane area ... emergency departments urged to get antivenom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204033722/http://www.acem.org.au/media/media_releases/Media_release_Wednesday_2__281107.pdf |date=2013-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:approxrange.png|thumb|right|Range of the two genera (''Hadronyche'' and ''Atrax'') of venomous Australian funnel-web spiders]]
''A. robustus'' is one of three designated species of the genus ''Atrax''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray M R and Sutherland S K, cited by Meier J and White J in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L14VSjEAAK4C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=%22only+A.robustus+and+two%22 Handbook of clinical toxicology of animal venoms and poisons]'' (The other two species are ''A. infestus'' and ''A. formidabilis''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman I. Platnick|Platnick N I]], Merrett P and Brignoli P M ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MAQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22only+A.robustus+and+two%22 Advances in spider taxonomy, 1981-1987]'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The related genus ''Hadronyche'' is represented by about 40 other dangerous species in eastern Australia, including [[Queensland]] and [[Tasmania]]. The males in this case have somewhat more potent venom than females and they also wander, making them more likely to be encountered in summer. Bites by males of two large species, the Sydney funnel-web and northern tree funnel-web, have resulted in death.&lt;ref name="csiro1"&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/resources/Funnelweb-Spider-Facts.html Fact sheet: Funnel-web spider] [[CSIRO]]&lt;/ref&gt; One specific case denoted an individual being bitten on the heel through his leather footwear after provoking the spider, indicating the great strength of the spider's chelicerae.

One other genus in the [[Hexathelidae]] family has been reported to cause severe symptoms in humans. Severe bites have been attributed to members of the genus ''[[Macrothele]]'' in [[Taiwan]], but no fatalities.&lt;ref name="Taiwan"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other mammals, such as rodents, for example, the effects of funnel web spider venom are much less severe.

Funnel web spiders are related to other mygalomorphs such as tarantulas and trapdoor spiders. These spiders are similar to funnel-webs in size and general appearance and also have huge chitinous fangs that can deliver painful bites, but their venom is usually extremely mild or harmless to humans.

==Tangle-web spiders==
Two genera of the [[tangle web spider]]s have venom which is known to be medically significant. One genus, the [[widow spider]]s of genus ''Latrodectus'', has caused human fatalities. The other genus, the false widow spiders of ''Steatoda'', has a far less serious bite.

===Widow spiders===
{{Main|Latrodectism}}
[[File:Redback frontal view.jpg|thumb|left|''Latrodectus hasselti'', the [[Redback spider]]]]
The widow spiders (genus ''[[Latrodectus]]''), such as the black widow, [[redback spider]], and [[katipo]] are spiders that carry a [[neurotoxic]] [[Venom (poison)|venom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jone SC |title=Ohio State University Fact Sheet: Black Widow Spider |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-Fact/2000/2061A.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110821084524/http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2061A.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-21 |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=2008-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can cause a set of symptoms known as [[Latrodectism]].

Widow spiders are large, shiny house spiders with relatively spindly legs and deep, globular abdomens. Mature females have dark and shiny abdomens with one or several red spots, either above and/or below. The spots may take the form of an hourglass, or two triangles, point-to-point. They seldom leave their webs, but if they have to, they can run fast enough over short distances. Male widows and immature females may have a variety of streaks and spots on a browner, less globular abdomen. The males are generally too small to be dangerous. Widows tend to be non-aggressive. Some species, especially those in North America, have no spot on their backs, with the hourglass becoming visible only when the spider hangs upside-down, and can thus be mistaken for their less dangerous cousins, which is especially true in males.

The Australian red-back and North American widow species live near humans and bites are frequent, numbering thousands yearly. The venom produces very painful effects including muscle spasms, 'tetanus-like' contractions, nausea and vomiting, and severe generalized pain. A serious bite will often require a short hospital stay to control pain. Children may be less sensitive to severe effects of redback venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MEAD|first1=H.

The previous record of a red-back fatality in Australia was 1955.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/12/young-man-dies-after-spider-bite-during-australian-bushwalk/&lt;/ref&gt;

===False black widows===
{{Main|Steatoda}}
[[File:Steatoda bipunctata female (aka).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Steatoda bipunctata]]'']]
The false black widow spiders (also known as false katipo, false button spider, cupboard spider, and in Australia, brown house spider) are spiders of the genus ''Steatoda.'' They resemble [[widow spider]]s in size and physical form, due to being members of the same family. While the bite of ''Steatoda'' spiders are never as serious as can be for true widow spiders, several have been often reported to give general symptoms away from the bite site, indicating the action of venom. The bite of ''[[Steatoda grossa]]'' may cause nausea, widespread but short lived pain, muscle spasms, and malaise; the medical community now refers to the symptoms of ''Steatoda'' bites as steatodism. Other spiders in this genus with potentially symptomic venom include two chiefly European varieties, ''S. paykulliana'' and ''[[Steatoda nobilis|S. nobilis]]'', and a species found mainly in New Zealand and South Africa, ''[[Steatoda capensis|S. capensis]]''

Use of widow spider [[antivenom]] has been shown effective in treating steatodism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graudins A, Gunja N, Broady K, Nicholson G | title = Clinical and in vitro evidence for the efficacy of Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) antivenom in the treatment of envenomation by a Cupboard spider (Steatoda grossa) | journal = Toxicon | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 767&amp;ndash;75 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12175614 | doi = 10.1016/S0041-0101(01)00280-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genera ''Steatoda'' and ''Latrodectus'' are biologically close relatives; both belonging to the same family [[Theridiidae]]. There are over 100 species in this genus ''Steatoda'', but only several species have been associated with symptomatic bites, and many alleged reports have not been confirmed as actual bites (actual bite event not seen, etc.) nor can be directly attributed to certain species (no specimen collected and examined by an arachnologist, etc.).

Members of this genus are characterized by the "D" shape of the cephalothorax, and the way the relatively straight line thus formed is mirrored by the blunt forward surface of the abdomen. Other genera in this family generally have cephalothoraxes that are more oval in shape or even rather round, and that give the appearance of two body parts that are joined by a small connector.

==Sicariidae spiders==
The family [[Sicariidae]] includes three genera which can potentially inflict [[cytotoxic]] bites. One genus, ''Loxosceles'', comprises the recluse spiders (below). The other genera, ''Sicarius'' and ''Hexophthalma'', are found only in the southern hemisphere, an example being ''[[Hexophthalma hahni]]''.

===Recluse spiders===
{{Main|Recluse spider}}
[[File:Brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Brown recluse]]. Note the darker brown "fiddle head" on the cephalothorax (center of the image).]]
Recluse spiders (''Loxosceles'' spp.), such as the [[brown recluse spider]], also known as "violin spiders", "fiddlers", or "fiddlebacks", from the dark violin-shaped marking on the cephalothorax, are retiring spiders which wander about in dim areas and under things. Large populations can infest a house without any bites reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=Richard S.|last2=Barger|first2=Diane K.|title=An Infestation of 2,055 Brown Recluse Spiders (Araneae: Sicariidae) and No Envenomations in a Kansas Home: Implications for Bite Diagnoses in Nonendemic Areas|journal=Journal of Medical Entomology|date=1 November 2002|volume=39|issue=6|pages=948–951|doi=10.1603/0022-2585-39.6.948|pmid=12495200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to small fangs, bites happen when trapped against one's skin by clothing, bed sheets, etc. Most encounters with this spider occur from moving boxes or rooting about in closets or under beds. The range of the brown recluse, ''L. reclusa'' in the U.S. is limited to the central and southern states. A number of related recluse spiders (some non-native introductions) are found in the western deserts. Reports of recluse bites far outnumber the number of spiders found in much of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=Richard S|last2=Cushing|first2=Paula E|last3=Crawford|first3=Rodney L|last4=Royce|first4=Lynn A|title=Diagnoses of brown recluse spider bites (loxoscelism) greatly outnumber actual verifications of the spider in four western American states|journal=Toxicon|date=September 2003|volume=42|issue=4|pages=413–418|doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00173-9|pmid=14505942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiders.ucr.edu/myth.html Myth of the Brown Recluse Fact, Fear, and Loathing], [[Regents of the University of California]], Retrieved December 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7468.html Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders], The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus, Retrieved December 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recluse spider bites are minor with a small area of redness. However, a small number of bites produce severe dermonecrotic lesions, and, sometimes, severe systemic reaction known as hemolytic anemia. Brown recluse bites have been suspected in several fatalities.

A minority of bites form a necrotizing [[Skin ulcer|ulcer]] that destroys soft tissue and may take months and, on very rare occasions, years to heal, leaving deep [[scar]]s. The damaged tissue will become black and eventually slough away. Bites occur commonly during dressing as spiders are trapped in the sleeve or pant leg. Bites usually become painful and itchy within 2 to 8 hours, pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite with the necrosis developing over the next few days.&lt;ref name="ClinTox-Wasserman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wasserman G, Anderson P | title = Loxoscelism and necrotic arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 21 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 451&amp;ndash;72 | year =1983–1984 | pmid = 6381752 | doi = 10.3109/15563658308990434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the face, swelling is common.

Serious systemic effects known as visceral loxoscelism may occur before this time, as the venom spreads throughout the body.

Fortunately, this specimen rarely interacts with humans, and is seldom known to bite. This spider buries itself in sand in order to ambush prey that wanders nearby. Sand particles adhere to cuticles on its abdomen, thus acting as a natural camouflage if uncovered.

==Mouse spiders==
{{Main|mouse spider}}
[[File:Mouse spider.jpg|thumb|[[Mouse spider]]]]
The mouse spiders of the genus ''Missulena'' are a type of primitive burrowing spider found primarily in Australia. Several species of this genus are known to possess a venom which contains compounds similar to [[atracotoxin]], the substance in funnel-web venom which can be fatal. However, most bites suffer only local pain and bleeding, a few more have limited neurotoxic symptoms (tingling, racing heart, more widespread pain) and there have been several recorded bites by this spider producing severe symptoms requiring medical treatment.&lt;ref name="MJA2005-Isbister"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Isbister G, Gray M, Balit C, [[Robert Raven|Raven R]], Stokes B, Porges K, Tankel A, Turner E, White J, Fisher M | title = Funnel-web spider bite: a systematic review of recorded clinical cases | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 182 | issue = 8 | pages = 407&amp;ndash;11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15850438}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no recorded human fatalities due to mouse spider bites.

==Tarantulas==
{{Main|Tarantula}}
The tarantulas of the family [[Theraphosidae]] are fearsome-looking spiders and a favorite of movies and television. The fangs deliver a weak venom and simultaneously crush the insect. The Sydney Funnel web is a relative with a much more potent neurotoxic venom. Trapdoor spiders, many of which resemble tarantulas but are shinier and less hairy, also have large fangs that deliver painful bites, but have very mild venom.

[[File:Brachypelma edit.jpg|thumb|left|Mexican Red Knee tarantula (''[[Brachypelma]]'' sp.), a new-world species]]

===New-world tarantulas===
New-world tarantulas&amp;mdash;those indigenous to the Americas&amp;mdash;have bites that generally pose little threat to humans (other than causing localized pain). The primary defense deployed by these spiders is by means of [[urticating hair]]s, which can cause irritant symptoms in humans.

[[File:Haplopelma lividum1.jpg|thumb|right|Cobalt blue tarantula (''Haplopelma lividum''), an old-world species]]

===Old-world tarantulas===
Old-world tarantulas, especially those indigenous to [[Asia]], lack [[urticating hair]]s and may bite as a defensive mechanism. They are far less docile than new-world tarantulas, and are more likely to bite when provoked.

Hobbyists report bites by ''[[Poecilotheria]]'' species, occasionally resulting in hospitalization. Symptoms include localized pain and swelling, exhaustion, moderate to severe muscle cramping, labored breathing and fever, sometimes delayed days after the initial bite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Myths ==
There are several species of spider (and related [[arachnid]]s), which have had false historical reputations for being harmful to humans.

===Hobo spiders===
[[File:Male-hobo.gif|thumb|right|Male Hobo Spider ‒ note the large [[pedipalps]]]]

Many brown recluse bites have been reported in the U.S. west coast states ([[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and northern [[California]]) where populations of [[brown recluse spider]]s have not been found.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/ewjm.173.5.357 | last1 = Vetter | first1 = R.

Many agricultural authorities have published the advice that this species is potentially harmful, and medical personnel in the western United States and Canada have been advised to consider hobo spider bites when patients present with necrotic wounds.

However, in Europe, where the spider originates, the species is considered a harmless outdoor relative of the common house spider (''Tegenaria domestica''), and no other spider in the genus ''[[Tegenaria]]'' is considered to be harmful to people. Attempts to replicate Vest's study that reported necrotic effects of the venom have failed, thus casting the "dangerous" status of this spider into doubt. In addition, Vest's methodologies have been questioned; he has been accused of incorrectly attributing symptoms to hobo spider bites when no positive identification of the spider was made. The one fatality attributed to the spider by medical authorities has also been questioned, and there are no documented cases where an otherwise-healthy person has developed a necrotic lesion from a positively identified hobo spider bite. Many scientists now question whether or not the spider is harmful at all.&lt;ref name="Annemergmed2004-Vetter"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vetter R, Isbister G | title = Do hobo spider bites cause dermonecrotic injuries? | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 605&amp;ndash;7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15573036 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = R.

===''Lycosa tarantula''===
[[File:Lycosa Tarantula.jpg|thumb|[[Lycosa tarantula|''Lycosa'' tarantula]]. Its back is covered with recently hatched spiderlings.]]
''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'', a species of [[wolf spider]] which is found near [[Taranto]], [[Italy]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] (and the origin of the name [[tarantula]], which today refers to a completely different kind of spider), was once blamed for a condition known as [[tarantism]]. A bitten young woman would be forced to dance wildly in the central plaza—the tarantella. Cultural interpretations report sexuality as an important aspect of the "spider bite". Originally thought to be mass hysteria, some scholars point to a culturally accepted means of exhibitionism. History of medicine believe the confusion came from workers in the fields would suffer bites, and observe large, conspicuous, hairy spiders in the area. That spider, ''L. tarantula'', was blamed for the pain and suffering (and occasional death) associated with tarantism. It is known that the bite of ''L. tarantula'', while sometimes painful, has no serious medical consequences for humans. It is also suspected that the real culprit was another spider, ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', the European [[widow spider]], which causes latrodectism. A similar mass hysteria surrounds purported brown recluse bites.
''Lycosa raptoria'' of South America has been reported to have caused a painful bite followed by intense tissue swelling and in some cases either mild systemic effects or a necrotic lesion. Subsequent investigation removed the species from suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ribeiro L. A. |author2=Jorge M. T. |author3=Piesco R.

===White-tailed spiders===
[[White-tailed spider]]s (''[[Lampona]]'' spp.), indigenous to [[Australia]] and present as an invasive pest in [[New Zealand]], have been blamed for a necrotic bite, producing symptoms similar to a [[brown recluse]]. The white-tailed spider (Lampona) was implicated for decades in necrotic lesions but has been exonerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isbister|first1=GK|last2=White|first2=J|title=Clinical consequences of spider bites: recent advances in our understanding.|journal=Toxicon|date=April 2004|volume=43|issue=5|pages=477–92|pmid=15066408|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 130 white-tailed spider bites found no necrotic ulcers or confirmed infections only a red mark, local swelling and itchiness. Very occasionally [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[malaise]] or [[headache]] may occur.&lt;ref name="WhiteTail"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dornfinger fg5.jpg|thumb|Yellow Sac spider ''[[Cheiracanthium punctorium]]'']]

===Yellow sac spider===
The Yellow Sac spiders, ''Cheiracanthium sp.'', were reported to produce a necrotic skin lesions.&lt;ref&gt;Furman, D. P., &amp; Reeves, W. C. (1957). Toxic bite of a spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum Hentz. California medicine, 87(2), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The few reports were cited many times. New analyses of numerous verified bites demonstrate no skin lesions but some local pain and redness.&lt;ref&gt;Vetter, R. S., Isbister, G. K., Bush, S. P., &amp; Boutin, L. J. (2006). Verified bites by yellow sac spiders (genus Cheiracanthium) in the United States and Australia: where is the necrosis?. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 74(6), 1043-1048.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foradori, M. J., Smith, S. C., Smith, E., &amp; Wells, R. E. (2005). Survey for potentially necrotizing spider venoms, with special emphasis on Cheiracanthium mildei. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part C: Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, 141(1), 32-39.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also very common in households and like to wander, which suggests a higher probability of the bites.

===Harvestman===
[[File:Opiliones harvestman.jpg|thumb|Opiliones (harvestman)]]
The spider-like arachnids known as [[Opiliones]] (also known as "[[harvestmen]]" or "daddy-long-legs"), are a species often handled by humans. They are the subject of an [[urban legend]] which not only claims that harvestmen are venomous, but are in fact more venomous than any of the spiders but are incapable of biting humans due to their lack of penetration. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species have venom glands or [[Glossary of spider terms#chelicera|chelicerae]] bearing [[Glossary of spider terms#fang|fangs]], instead having smaller, pincer-like chelicerae that cannot usually penetrate human skin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arachnology.be/pages/Opilio_QandA.html Answers to commons questions about harvestmen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307112517/http://www.arachnology.be/pages/Opilio_QandA.html |date=2012-03-07 }} - The Arachnology Home Page. Accessed 2008-04-01&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, incidents of opiliones biting people are rare, and no reported bites by these species have had any lasting effects.

The term "daddy-long-legs" also can refer to the similar-looking [[cellar spider]]. This species (a true spider) can bite humans, but its venom is not known to have any effects beyond mild discomfort at the site of the bite.

===Camel spiders===
The arachnids of the order [[Solifugae]], also known as wind scorpions, camel or sun spiders, are neither spiders nor [[scorpion]]s. In the [[Middle East]], it is common belief among some American soldiers stationed there that Solifugae will feed on living human flesh. The urban myth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/c/camel-spider/|title=Camel Spider}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the creature will inject some anesthetizing venom into the exposed skin of its sleeping victim, then feed voraciously, leaving the victim to awaken with a gaping wound. Solifugae, however, do not produce such an [[anesthetic]], and do not attack prey larger than themselves unless threatened.

Further, Solifugae are known to not possess any venom (other than one species in [[India]], which may possess venom according to one study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Aruchami, M.  |author2=G. Sundara Rajulu

 | journal=Natl. Acad. Sci. Lett.
 | volume=1
 | pages=191&amp;ndash;192
}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, due to the large size of their jaws, bites by Solifugae can cause significant wounds, which should be treated accordingly to avoid infection.&lt;ref name="CamelSpider"&gt;{{cite book|author=Punzo, Fred|title=The Biology of Camel-Spiders|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1998|isbn=0-7923-8155-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5224">'''Marilyn Miller''' is an American [[pediatric ophthalmologist]] specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of [[congenital]] [[eye disease]]s and  [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=Howe /&gt;  She has held leadership positions in her field, often as the first female in those positions.

== Training ==
Miller graduated from the [[University of Illinois School of Medicine]]  in 1959, and subsequently completed her [[internship]], [[ophthalmology]] [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] and [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in pediatric ophthalmology at [[University of Illinois Hospital]].  She was a student of [[strabismus]] expert [[Eugene R. Folk]].&lt;ref name=Folk&gt;"DR. EUGENE R. FOLK, 78", ''Chicago Tribune'' (2003-03-05): "He was well known as an excellent and experienced teacher and physician and pediatric ophthalmologist said Dr Marilyn Miller a former student and a pediatric ophthalmologist."&lt;/ref&gt; Miller received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[microbiology]] from [[Purdue University]] in 1954 and [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in the same subject from the University of Illinois in 1966.

==Contributions to medicine==
Miller's contributions include descriptions of ocular findings in [[Möbius syndrome]], [[Parry–Romberg syndrome]], and [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].  She described associations of [[Duane syndrome]] with [[craniofacial abnormalities]], as well as [[dyslexia]], [[thalidomide]] toxicity, and other first-[[Pregnancy|trimester]] anomalies.  In the 1990s, her study of eye motility problems in people affected by thalidomide contributed to research into the causes of [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, Adam. ''A History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oRgVuaXPPjQC&amp;pg=PA208 page 208] (John Wiley and Sons 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

During her long career, Miller became known particularly for her interest in international ophthalmology.  Along with administrative and educational work in this area, she has cared for thousands of patients around the world, and particularly in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;"[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/201330.php UIC Physician Honored By Ophthalmology Society]", ''Medical News Today'' (2010-09-16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rod R. Blagojevich PATH (People are Today’s Heroes) Award to Marilyn T. Miller, MD. Dr. Miller received the award in recognition of the care she has provided to children for the past 30 years, Mrs. Blagojevich said."&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female to serve as president of the [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://bmctoday.net/glaucomatoday/2010/10/article.asp?f=university-of-illinois-at-chicago-professor-awarded-howe-medal University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Awarded Howe Medal]", ''Glaucoma Today'' (October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and also the first female board member of the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]].&lt;ref name=Howe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/116/9/1227 Celebrating Women in Ophthalmology]", ''Archives of Ophthalmology'', Vol. 116 (September 1998): "In 1988, Dr Marilyn Miller became the first woman to join the board of directors of the American Academy of Ophthalmology."&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical education agencies are a specialty subset of advertising agencies that develop educational content for the [[Healthcare]], [[Life Science]] and [[Biotechnology]] industries. Medical education agencies are divided into two categories:

== CME ==
Medical education agencies that develop [[Continuing medical education]] (most commonly referred to as CME) programs in the United States, do so within the strict guidelines{{ref|http://www.accme.org/dir_docs/doc_upload/68b2902a-fb73-44d1-8725-80a1504e520c_uploaddocument.pdf}} set forth by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME) and the [[Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education]] (SACME). Those who wish to offer CME courses, and thus employ the services of a medical education agency, must receive accreditation from the ACCME. Accreditation allows organizations, such as the [[American Nursing Certification Center]] (ANCC) to develop educational course content that physicians and other professional medical staff may use to satisfy annual CME requirements.{{ref|http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/455/licensurerereg-06.pdf}}

To avoid the risk of undue bias from commercial sponsorship, all accredited organizations must follow the commercial disclosure rules set out by the ACCME. Medical education agencies must familiarize themselves with these regulations in order to receive CME accreditation from one or more ACCME accredited organizations.

== Non-CME ==

Medical education agencies that develop Non-[[continuing medical education|CME]], also referred to as [[Promotional education]], programs specialize in developing content whose commercial sponsorship is clearly outlined, and course content focuses on specific products or therapies in which the sponsoring organization has a financial interest.

== Delivery Mechanisms ==

The majority of content developed by medical education agencies supports one of two types of delivery mechanism: Instructor Led Training (ILT) and Self Directed Training (SDT).

=== Instructor Led Training ===

Instructor led training, ILT, is the practice of face-to-face delivery of information and learning material between an instructor and learners. Instructor lead training can take the form of didactic training, laboratory demonstration and/or clinical application.

Hospitals, Universities, Pharmaceutical and Medical device manufacturers may employ medical education agencies to develop specific content, or to apply [[Instructional Design]] principles to existing content to make it more readily understood by an instructor led audience. This will include developing informational structures to follow [[learning theory (education)|learning theories]], targeting content toward a specific audience or set of audiences and

=== Self Directed Training ===
Self Directed Training, is the practice of gaining information from learning materials without an instructor present. Self-directed training takes many forms, including deployed eLearning content, textbooks, searchable databases of information and viewing of training presentations at one's own pace. Self-directed training often takes place through a web portal, a [[SCORM|SCORM compliant]] Learning Management System (LMS) or a webcast engine.

Hospitals, Universities, Pharmaceutical and Medical device manufacturers may employ medical education agencies to develop specific content, or to apply [[Instructional Design]] principles to existing content, to make a product, technology or concept more readily understood by a self-directed audience. Medical education agencies also help learners to better understand complex content through interactivity, animation and virtual simulations of training content.

{{Politics of Ghana}}

The '''Ministry of Health''' ('''MoH''') is the [[government ministry]] of [[Ghana]] that is responsible for the [[Health in Ghana|health of Ghana]].  It is involved in providing [[public health|public health services]], managing Ghana's [[healthcare industry]], and building Ghana's [[hospital]]s and [[medical education|medical education system]].

Ministry [[main offices]] are located in [[Accra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moh-ghana.org/moh/contact_us/ Ministry, Contact us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry is responsible for all health related issues in Ghana. It was responsible for direct public health service delivery or provision in the country. However, with the enactment of an ACT 525 of parliament, the functions of promotion, preventive, curative and rehabilitative care has been delegated to the Ghana Health Service and Teaching hospitals. Hence, the ministry is now responsible for only policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation, resource mobilization and regulation of the health service delivery in the country.

[[Image:Apis mellifera - Prunus padus - Keila.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|'''Honey bee on [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]]'''&lt;br&gt;[[Honey bee]]s are especially well adapted to collecting and moving pollen, thus are the most commonly used crop pollinators.  Note the light brown [[pollen]] in the [[pollen basket]].]]

'''Pollination management''' is the label for horticultural practices that accomplish or enhance [[pollination]] of a crop, to improve yield or quality, by understanding of the particular crop's pollination needs, and by knowledgeable management of [[pollenizer]]s, [[pollinator]]s, and pollination conditions.

While people think first of the [[European honey bee]] when pollination comes up, in fact there are many different means of pollination management that are used, both other insects and other mechanisms. There are other insects commercially available that are more efficient, like the [[blue orchard bee]] for fruit and nut trees, local [[bumblebee]]s better specialized for some other crops, [[hand pollination]] that is essential for production of hybrid seeds and some greenhouse situations, and even pollination machines.

==Pollinator decline==
{{main|Pollinator decline}}

With the decline of both wild and domestic pollinator populations, pollination management is becoming an increasingly important part of [[horticulture]]. Factors that cause the [[pollinator decline|loss of pollinators]] include [[pesticide misuse]], unprofitability of [[beekeeping]] for [[honey]], rapid transfer of pests and diseases to new areas of the globe, urban/suburban development, changing crop patterns, [[clearcutting|clearcut logging]] (particularly when mixed forests are replaced by [[monoculture]] pine), clearing of hedgerows and other wild areas, bad diet because of loss of floral biodiversity,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8467746.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and a loss of nectar corridors for migratory pollinators.

==Importance==
{{See also|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}

The increasing size of fields and orchards ([[monoculture]]) increase the importance of pollination management. Monoculture can cause a brief period when pollinators have more food resources than they can use (but monofloral diet can reduce their immune system&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;) while other periods of the year can bring starvation or pesticide contamination of food sources.  Most [[nectar source]] and [[pollen source]] throughout the growing season to build up their numbers.

Crops that traditionally have had managed pollination include [[apple]], [[almond]]s, [[pear]]s, some [[plum]] and [[cherry]] varieties, [[blueberries]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[cucumber]]s, [[cantaloupe]], [[watermelon]], [[alfalfa]] seeds, [[onion]] seeds, and many others. Some crops that have traditionally depended entirely on chance pollination by wild pollinators need pollination management nowadays to make a profitable crop. Many of these were at one time universally turning to honeybees, but as science has shown that honeybees are actually inefficient pollinators, demand for other managed pollinators has risen. While honeybees may visit dozens of different kinds of flowers, diluting the orchard pollen they carry, the [[Blue orchard bee]] will visit only the intended tree, producing a much higher fertilization rate. The focus on the specific tree also makes the orchard bee 100 times more efficient at pollinating, per bee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofga.org/Publications/The-Maine-Organic-Farmer-Gardener/Spring-2013/Blue-Orchard-Bee The Blue Orchard Bee]&lt;br/&gt;A female lives about 20 days and provisions about two to six nests. So 1,800 flower trips x 7 eggs x 6 nests = more than 75,000 flower trips in her life, making BOBs about 100 times more efficient than honeybees. BOBs pollinate 97 percent of the flowers they visit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some crops, especially when planted in a monoculture situation, require a very high level of pollinators to produce economically viable crops, especially if depending on the more generalized honeybee. This may be because of lack of attractiveness of the blossoms, or from trying to pollinate with an alternative when the native pollinator is extinct or rare. These include crops such as alfalfa, cranberries, and [[kiwifruit]]. This technique is known as [[saturation pollination]]. In many such cases, various native bees are vastly more efficient at pollination (e.g., with blueberries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javorek SK, Mackenzie KE, Vander Kloet SP |year=2002 |title=Comparative pollination effectiveness among bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) on Lowbush Blueberry (Ericaceae: ''Vaccinium angustifolium'') |journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=345–351 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095%5B0345:CPEABH%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0345:cpeabh]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but the inefficiency of the honey bees is compensated for by using large numbers of hives, the total number of foragers thereby far exceeding the local abundance of native pollinators. In a very few cases, it has been possible to develop commercially viable pollination techniques that use the more efficient pollinators, rather than continued reliance on honey bees, as in the management of the [[alfalfa leafcutter bee]]. 

In the case of the kiwifruit, its flowers do not even produce nectar, so that honeybees are reluctant to even visit them, unless present in such overwhelming numbers that they do so incidentally. This has led bumblebee pollination companies to begin offering their services for kiwifruit, as they appear to be far more efficient at the job than honeybees, even more efficient than hand pollination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hortidaily.com/article/33886/Bumblebees-can-help-in-Kiwi-pollination Bumblebees can help in Kiwi pollination]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that about one hive per acre will sufficiently pollinate watermelons. In the 1950s when the woods were full of wild bee trees, and beehives were normally kept on most [[South Carolina]] farms, a farmer who grew ten acres (4&amp;nbsp;ha) of watermelons would be a large grower and probably had all the pollination needed. But today's grower may grow 200 acres (80&amp;nbsp;ha), and, if lucky, there might be one bee tree left within range. The only option in the current economy is to bring beehives to the field during blossom time.&lt;ref&gt;Delaplaine et al. 1994, Bee pollination of Georgia crop plants. ''CES Bulletin 1106''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of pollinators==
Organisms that are currently being used as pollinators in managed pollination are [[honey bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, [[alfalfa leafcutter bee]]s, and [[orchard mason bee]]s. Other species are expected to be added to this list as this field develops. Humans also can be pollinators, as the gardener who [[Hand pollination|hand pollinates]] her [[Squash (vegetable)|squash]] blossoms, or the [[Middle East]]ern farmer, who climbs his [[date palm]]s to pollinate them.

The [[Cooperative extension service]] recommends one honey bee hive per acre (2.5 hives per hectare) for standard watermelon varieties to meet this crop's pollination needs. In the past, when fields were small, pollination was accomplished by a mix of bees kept on farms, bumblebees, carpenter bees, feral honey bees in hollow trees and other insects. Today, with melons planted in large tracts, the grower may no longer have hives on the farm; he may have poisoned many of the pollinators by spraying blooming cotton; he may have logged off the woods, removing hollow trees that provided homes for bees, and pushed out the hedgerows that were home for solitary native bees and other pollinating insects.

==Planning for improved pollination==
[[Image:Bee migration 9045.JPG|right|thumb|US migratory commercial beekeeper moving spring bees from South Carolina to Maine for blueberry pollination]]
Before pollination needs were understood, orchardists often planted entire blocks of apples of a single variety. Because apples are self-sterile, and different members of a single variety are genetic [[cloning|clone]]s (equivalent to a single plant), this is not a good idea. Growers now supply pollenizers, by planting [[crab apple]]s interspersed in the rows, or by grafting crab apple limbs on some trees. Pollenizers can also be supplied by putting drum bouquets of crab apples or a compatible apple variety in the orchard blocks.

The field of pollination management cannot be placed wholly within any other field, because it bridges several fields. It draws from [[horticulture]], [[beekeeping|apiculture]], [[zoology]] (especially [[entomology]]), [[ecology]], and [[botany]].

==Improving pollination with suboptimal bee densities==
Growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, to less than 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% in the same time period. To make matters worse, in the past five years we have seen a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honeybees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15084">While [[needle phobia]] is not age-specific, it is more common in children than in adults.  The latest research from all fields indicates that needle-fear is predominant among children fears with some research claiming that up to 93% of children experience [needle-related] stress."&lt;ref name="Ives"&gt;Ives, Mary and Sherri Melrose. "Immunizing Children Who Fear and Resist Needles: Is It a Problem for Nurses?" Nursing Forum (2010): 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have been performed investigating psychosocial methods of helping children cope with their fear.  Current research in this area has investigated several types of non-invasive treatments to aid children in their needle phobia.  These can be categorized into distraction techniques and other methods.  These techniques offer safer, cheaper alternatives to drug or anesthetic treatments (see [[Fear of needles#Treatment|Treatment]]).

== Distraction treatments ==
Distraction treatments take advantage of the brain's inability to pay full attention to two things at once.  Distraction works by passively or actively redirecting the child's attention away from the needle in the medical procedure at hand, leaving "less attention available to perceive pain."&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, Gemma. "Distraction techniques for venepuncture: a review." Paediatric Nursing (2009): 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking the child's attention from the needle also lessens his or her ability to feel anxiety; this is important because a large part of needle phobia is the anticipatory stress caused by the needle.  This phenomenon is referred to as an "analgesic effect," meaning "pain-relieving effect."   Distraction treatments can be divided into passive and active distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Elizabeth. "Psychosocial management of fear of needles in children." Haemophilia (2009): 635-636.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passive distraction ===
Passive distraction is defined for the following studies as a form of distraction that commands the child's attention but does not require any participation on the child's part.  The following studies used television to display movies or cartoons as a form of passive distraction.  Several studies have investigated the analgesic effect that these can provide during [[venipuncture]].&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;

=== Active distraction ===
Active distraction is defined as a form of distraction that requires the patient's participation.  Most of the studies investigating active distraction and its effect on children's fear of needles had the children play with a toy.  Several also used nurses and the child's caregiver(s) to actively distract the child.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;

=== Studies investigating distraction treatments ===
''Paediatric Nursing Magazine'' reviewed several studies that investigated distraction techniques for children during venipuncture.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;  In one of the covered studies, Cohen concluded in a study that watching a children's movie decreased the child's stress, more so than having the child play with an "interactive toy.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, L., R. Manimala and R. Blount. "Easier said than done: What parents say they do and what they do during children's immunizations." Children's Health Care (2000): 79-87.&lt;/ref&gt;"  
Bellieni ''et al'' performed a comprehensive study on active and passive distraction at the University of Siena, Italy.  They studied 69 children aged 7–12 that were scheduled to undergo venipuncture.  To be included in the study, children had to fit all of the following criteria: 
*be between 7 and 12 years old
*have eaten their last meal three hours or more prior to venipuncture
*have no neurodevelopmental delay, including verbal difficulty
*have had venipuncture less than once per year
Children were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: the control group, where venipuncture was performed without distraction (Group C); the active distraction experimental group, where venipuncture was performed while the mother distracted the child (Group M); and the passive distraction experimental group, where venipuncture was performed while the child watched a TV cartoon (Group TV).  There were 23 children in each group; the average age and gender ratios of each group are shown in Table 1.  The mothers in Group M were instructed to "actively distract their children during the venipuncture by speaking, caressing, and soothing them."  The children in Group TV were placed in a room in front of a television; the cartoon started at least two minutes before the venipuncture took place, and the only distraction offered was an invitation for the child to watch the cartoon when it started playing.&lt;ref name="Bellieni"&gt;Bellieni, C. V., et al. "Analgesic effect of watching TV during venipuncture." Archives of Diseased Children (2006): 1015-1017.&lt;/ref&gt;

This study used the Oucher scale to assess pain in the children.  The Oucher scale, a "validated visual pain scale scoring from 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum pain)," has two separate scales to help children identify their pain level.  The scale from 0 to 100 is placed alongside six photographs of children in various levels of discomfort; children in the report were asked to use the pictures as an aid for choosing a numerical value to represent their pain level.  Parents of the children were also asked to assess their child's pain levels on the same scale, basing their assessment on the child's external indication of pain and not the child's reported score.&lt;ref name="Bellieni" /&gt;

The results of Bellieni's study suggest that passive distraction is more effective than active distraction in lessening perceived pain from venipuncture, although active distraction does have some effect in lessening perceived pain.  The average scores on the Oucher scale for Group C, Group M, and Group TV were 23.04, 17.39, and 8.91, respectively; with standard deviation 24.57, 21.36, and 8.65,  also respectively.  Even taking these fluctuations in data into account, it is apparent that the passive distraction technique significantly lowered the perceived pain when compared to the control group and the active distraction group, according to both parents and children.

These results show that distraction by television had a greater analgesic effect than active distraction performed by the mothers.  This is shown by both the children's self-reported scores and the mothers' scores.  Mason ''et al'', who published a study in ''The Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings'', suggested that while both mothers and television are effective distraction techniques, the mothers may have been less effective because the children's fear and distress could have affected their ability to interact with their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, S., M. H. Johnson and C. Wooley. "A comparison of distractors for controlling distress in young children during medical procedures." Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings (1996): 239-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of caregivers ===

In the ''Journal of Holistic Nursing'', Cavendar ''et al'' performed a study investigating the effect of parents as active distraction to the child.  Children in the experimental group received standard care, but the parents were given instruction in how to distract the child.  Also, they were given a choice between three distraction items. The control group received standard care, and mothers were present in the room but were not coached on distraction techniques nor given distraction items.  The researchers concluded that "fear was rated as significantly lower" in the experimental group, though there was "no statistical difference between the two groups with regard to pain and distress.&lt;ref name="Cavendar"&gt;Cavendar, K et al. "Parents' positioning and distracting children during venipuncture effects on children's pain, fear and distress." Journal of Holistic Nursing (2004): 32-56.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The way parents act and react in situations where their child is undergoing venipuncture can have an effect on children and their fear of needles.  In ''The Journal of Family Practice'', James G. Hamilton hypothesized that "needle phobia is learned as well as inherited."  He observed that "negative experiences associated with immunization, laboratory work, dental visits, and other medical procedures can condition children … toward becoming fearful of needles."  Other factors, such as physical and verbal restraint during children's medical procedures, can influence children to fear needles and associated medical situations.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;Hamilton, James G. "Needle phobia: A neglected diagnosis." Journal of Family Practice (1995): 169-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''Nursing Forum'' by Ives ''et al'' outlined several helpful and unhelpful caregiver behaviors during venipuncture.  Unhelpful behaviors included overly reassuring children, overly empathizing with children, apologizing, and criticizing children.  It was also noted that giving the child control of the procedure from the beginning or asking the child to "indicate readiness to receive the needle" increased distress in the children.  Other unhelpful responses included "inadequate or overly forceful restraint by the parent; shaming, threatening, yelling, slapping, lying; or, alternately, pitying, placating, bribing, and helpless parent behaviors."  The researchers identified a need to provide instruction to parents on what not to say to their child.&lt;ref name="Ives" /&gt;

Nurses identified lack of explanation to the child as a major problem in many immunization procedures.  One nurse reported "getting kicked and hit by a struggling child" whose parents had not explained the purpose of the visit to the child.  Despite the fear that the prospect of venipuncture may invoke, nurses agree that it is better to tell the child exactly what is going to happen beforehand.&lt;ref name="Ives" /&gt;  Nurses also reported that children's fear seemed to correlate with parents' anxiety, and cited parental anxiety as an obstacle in performing venipuncture.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, A. "Incorporating psychological approaches into routine paediatric venipuncture." Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003): 931-937&lt;/ref&gt;

Klieber found several helpful parent behaviors as a part of active distraction in his study published in the ''Journal of Pain and Symptom Management''. These included using a calm voice, giving children permission to cry, remaining firm but not threatening, and using stickers to celebrate effort.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiber, C. et al. "Parents as distraction coaches during IV insertion: a randomized study." Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001): 851-861.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Nursing Forum'' article also found active and passive distraction by way of toys and television cartoons to be helpful.  The researchers agreed that effective coaching and successful clinical visits involving venipuncture could provide children with an opportunity to practice and master "adaptive coping skills.&lt;ref name="Ives" /&gt;"

== Other techniques ==
Kettwich ''et al'' of the Department of International Medicine of the University of New Mexico conducted an experiment published in the ''Journal of Family Practice'' comparing decorated and plain syringes (see picture).  The research hypothesis was that "adding decorative designs or stickers to medical devices before a procedure [would] significantly reduce aversion, fear, and anxiety…[in] needle-phobic patients."  The experimental syringes were made with conventional 10-milliliter syringes, decorated so that the "markings of the barrel could still be seen".&lt;ref name="Kettwich"&gt;Kettwich, Sharon C., et al. "Patients with needle phobia? Try stress-reducing medical devices." The Journal of Family Practice (2006): 697-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the experiment, "the presentation of individual devices to each subject was randomized to eliminate the possibility of a consistent bias."  To determine emotional responses to the medical devices, the researchers used the validated [[Visual analogue scale]] where 0 denotes lowest response and 10 shows the strongest response.  The Visual Analogue Scale for Aversion, Fear, and Anxiety were used.  The study defined "significant needle phobia" as an "aversion, fear, or anxiety score of greater than or equal to 5."  
The results of this study showed that the stress-reducing medical devices are effective in reducing aversion, fear, and anxiety towards the medical needles.  The results are shown in the table, in the form (Visual Analogue Score) ± (standard deviation).&lt;ref name="Kettwich" /&gt;

For all three Visual Analogue tests, the mean score was much lower for the stress-reducing syringes; on average, the scores for the aversion, fear, and anxiety tests were 79%, 53%, and 51% lower, respectively.

== Future research ==
Gemma Murphy, a staff nurse at the neonatal unit of University College London Hospital, suggested that future research should investigate types of passive distraction other than cartoons and movies.  Murphy suggested studies comparing the effect of books, guided imagery, music, and virtual reality video glasses as other forms of passive distraction.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;

'''Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous''' ('''SLAA''') is a [[twelve-step program]] for people recovering from [[sexual addiction|sex addiction]] and [[Codependence|love addiction]]. SLAA was founded in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1976, by a member of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Though he had been a member of AA for many years, he repeatedly [[acting out|acted out]] and was serially unfaithful to his wife. He founded SLAA as an attempt to stop his compulsive sexual and romantic behavior.&lt;ref name="GRIFFIN1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Griffin-Shelley |first1=Eric |title=Adolescent Sex and Love Addicts |date=1994 |isbn=0275946819 |oclc=29843754 |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRIFFIN1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffin-Shelley |first=Eric |title=Sex and Love: Addiction, Treatment and Recovery |year=1997 |isbn=027596065X |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Praeger |oclc=22662376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRVINE1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irvine |first=Janice M. |title=Regulated Passions: The Invention of Inhibited Sexual Desire and Sex Addiction |journal=Social Text |volume=37 |issue=37 |date=Winter 1993 |pages=203–226 |issn=0164-2472 |doi=10.2307/466269 |jstor=466269}}&lt;/ref&gt; SLAA is also sometimes known as the '''Augustine Fellowship''', because early members saw many of their shared symptoms described by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] in his work ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''.&lt;ref name="TERRY1995"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Terry |first1=Jennifer |last2=Urla |first2=Jacqueline |title=Deviant Bodies: Critical Perspectives on Difference in Science and Popular Culture |isbn=0253209757 |oclc=42854482 |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''COSLAA''' is another twelve-step fellowship created to support the family members and friends of sex and love addicts.

SLAA encourages members to identify their own "bottom-line behaviors." The organization identifies these behaviors as "any sexual or emotional act, no matter what its initial impulse may be, which leads to loss of control over rate, frequency, or duration of its occurrence or recurrence, resulting in spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, and moral destruction of oneself and others." Maintaining "[[sobriety]]" in the SLAA program requires abstaining from one's bottom-line behaviors. However, these behaviors are never set in stone and may change as SLAA members continue in the program.&lt;ref name="GRIFFIN1997"/&gt; Examples of bottom line behaviors might include sexual or romantic activity outside the scope of [[monogamy|monogamous relationships]], anonymous or casual sex, compulsive avoidance of intimacy or emotional attachment, one-night stands, compulsive masturbation, obsessive fantasy, compulsive attraction to unavailable or abusive partners, and a wide variety of addictive sexual, romantic, or avoidant behaviors.

Many of those practicing the SLAA recovery program develop the ability to engage in a healthy committed relationship.&lt;ref name="GRIFFIN1994"/&gt; SLAA encourages recovery from [[sexual anorexia]], emotional anorexia and social anorexia, three related areas of self-deprivation that lead to isolation and often accompany patterns of addictive behavior.&lt;ref name="CARNES1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carnes |first1=Patrick J. |last2=Moriarity |first2=Joseph |title=Sexual Anorexia: Overcoming Sexual Self-hatred |publisher=[[Hazelden]] |location=[[Center City, Minnesota]] |year=1997 |isbn=1568381441 |oclc=45733339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SLAA publishes the book ''Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.'' It is approved by the organization for use in their fellowship.&lt;ref name="SLAABIGBOOK"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine Fellowship |title=Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous |isbn=0961570113 |date=June 1986 |publisher=Augustine Fellowship |oclc=13004050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sievert''' (symbol: '''Sv'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not be confused with the [[sverdrup]] or the [[svedberg]], two non-SI units that sometimes use the same symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] of [[ionizing radiation]] dose in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body. The sievert is of importance in [[dosimetry]] and [[radiation protection]], and is named after [[Rolf Maximilian Sievert]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.

The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as [[equivalent dose]] and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, and [[committed dose]] which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. The sievert is intended to represent the [[stochastic]] health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of [[radiation-induced cancer]] and genetic damage. One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the [[linear no-threshold model]].&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says, "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues." ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt;

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] into equivalent dose and effective dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these. These are under continual review, and changes are advised in the formal "Reports" of those bodies.

Conventionally, the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, such as [[acute radiation syndrome]]; these effects are compared to the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] measured by the unit [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

One sievert equals 100 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]]. The rem is an older, non-SI unit of measurement.

==Definition==

===CIPM definition of the sievert===

The SI definition given by the [[CIPM|International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM)]] says:

"The quantity dose equivalent ''H'' is the product of the absorbed dose ''D'' of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor ''Q'' (quality factor) defined as a function of [[linear energy transfer]] by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|ICRU]]"

:''H'' = ''Q'' × ''D''&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"&gt;{{citation |title=CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ |year=2000 |publisher=BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of ''Q'' is not defined further by CIPM, but it requires the use of the relevant ICRU recommendations to provide this value.

The CIPM also says that "in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose ''D'' and the dose equivalent ''H'', the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose ''D'' and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent ''H''".&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"/&gt;

In summary:

'''The gray''' – quantity ''D''
:1&amp;nbsp;Gy = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a physical quantity. 1&amp;nbsp;Gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kg of matter or tissue.

'''The sievert''' – quantity ''H''
:1&amp;nbsp;Sv = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a biological effect. The sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue.  The equivalence to absorbed dose is denoted by Q.

===ICRP definition of the sievert===
The ICRP definition of the sievert is:&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;
: "The sievert is the special name for the SI unit of equivalent dose, effective dose, and operational dose quantities. The unit is joule per kilogram."

The sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the ICRP and ICRU.

===Naming conventions===
The ICRU/ICRP dose quantities have specific purposes and meanings, but some use common words in a different order. There can be confusion between, for instance, ''equivalent dose'' and ''dose equivalent''.

Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function (Q) of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 60 published in 1991&lt;/ref&gt; developed the "protection" dose quantities ''effective'' and ''equivalent'' dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase ''dose equivalent'' in their name. Only the operational dose quantities which still use Q for calculation retain the phrase ''dose equivalent''. However, there are joint ICRU/ICRP proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities. These were outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015, and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing "dose to lens of eye" and "dose to local skin" as ''equivalent doses''.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

In the [[United states of america|USA]] there are differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2009/pdfs/9444.pdf "The confusing world of radiation dosimetry"] - M.A. Boyd, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009. An account of chronological differences between US and ICRP dosimetry systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External dose quantities==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External radiation dose quantities used in radiological protection]]
The sievert is used to represent the biological effects of different forms of external ionizing radiation on various types of human tissue. Some quantities cannot be practically measured, but they must be related to actual instrumentation and dosimetry measurements. The resultant complexity has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the ICRU working with the ICRP.

The external dose quantities and their relationships are shown in the accompanying diagram. The ICRU is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities, based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology, and the ICRP is primarily responsible for the protection quantities, based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body.

===Physical quantities===
These are directly measurable physical quantities in which no allowance has been made for biological effects. Radiation [[fluence]] is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time, [[Kerma (physics)|kerma]] is the ionising effect of the radiation field, and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass.

===Protection quantities===
Protection quantities are calculated models, and are used as "limiting quantities" to specify exposure limits to ensure, in the words of ICRP, "that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration"&gt;{{citation |title=Calibration of Radiation Protection Monitoring Instruments |series=Safety Reports Series 16 |quote=In 1991, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [7] recommended a revised system of dose limitation, including specification of primary ''limiting quantities'' for radiation protection purposes. These protection quantities are essentially unmeasurable |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/P074_scr.pdf |year=2000 |publisher=IAEA |isbn=92-0-100100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These quantities cannot be measured in practice but their values are derived using models of external dose to internal organs of the human body, using [[Computational human phantom|anthropomorphic phantom]]s. These are 3D computational models of the body which take into account a number of complex effects such as body self-shielding and internal scattering of radiation. The calculation starts with organ absorbed dose, and then applies radiation and tissue weighting factors.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B64&lt;/ref&gt;

As protection quantities cannot practically be measured, operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational quantities===
Operational quantities can be measured in practice, and are the means of measuring dose uptake due to exposure or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment, in relation to protection dose values. In this way they are used for practical dose control, by providing an estimate or upper limit for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure. They are used in practical regulations and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B147&lt;/ref&gt;

The calibration of individual and area dosemeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision "air kerma free in air" under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium. Then the appropriate operational quantity is derived applying a conversion coefficient that relates the air kerma to the appropriate operational quantity. The conversion coefficients for photon radiation are published by the ICRU.&lt;ref&gt;''Measurement of H*(10) and Hp(10) in Mixed High-Energy Electron and Photon Fields.''  E. Gargioni, L. Büermann and H.-M. Kramer Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple (non-anthropomorphic) "phantoms" are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation. The ICRU sphere phantom is based on the definition of an ICRU 4-element tissue-equivalent material which does not really exist and cannot be fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;"Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure,  Actual Shortcomings and Alternative Options", G. Dietze, D.T.  Bartlett, N.E. Hertel, given at IRPA 2012, Glasgow, Scotland. May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRU sphere is a theoretical 30&amp;nbsp;cm diameter "tissue equivalent" sphere consisting of a material with a density of 1 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and a mass composition of 76.2% oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen and 2.6% nitrogen. This material is specified to most closely approximate human tissue in its absorption properties. According to the ICRP, the ICRU "sphere phantom" in most cases adequately approximates the human body as regards the scattering and attenuation of penetrating radiation fields under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B159&lt;/ref&gt; Thus radiation of a particular energy fluence will have roughly the same energy deposition within the sphere as it would in the equivalent mass of human tissue.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

To allow for back-scattering and absorption of the human body, the "slab phantom" is used to represent the human torso for practical calibration of whole body dosimeters. The slab phantom is {{nowrap|300 mm × 300 mm × 150 mm}} depth to represent the human torso.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

The joint ICRU/ICRP proposals outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015 to change the definition of operational quantities would not change the present use of calibration phantoms or reference radiation fields.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

===Instrument and dosimetry response===
This is an actual reading obtained from such as an ambient dose [[gamma ray|gamma]] monitor, or a personal [[dosimeter]]. Such instruments are calibrated using radiation metrology techniques which will trace them to a national radiation standard, and thereby relate them to an operational quantity. The readings of instruments and dosimeters are used to prevent the uptake of excessive dose and to provide records of dose uptake to satisfy radiation safety legislation; such as in the [[UK]], the [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]].

==Calculating protection dose quantities==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of "protection dose" quantities in [[SI]] units]]
The sievert is used in external radiation protection for [[equivalent dose]] (the external-source, whole-body exposure effects, in a uniform field), and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] (which depends on the body parts irradiated).

These dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the [[stochastic]] health effects of radiation, and use of the sievert implies that appropriate [[Relative biological effectiveness|weighting factors]] have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation (expressed in grays).&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=2007 |volume=37 |series=ICRP publication 103 |issue=2–4 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP calculation provides two weighting factors to enable the calculation of protection quantities.
:&amp;nbsp;1. The radiation factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for radiation type ''R'' – This is used in calculating the equivalent dose ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; which can be for the whole body or for individual organs.
:&amp;nbsp;2. The tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for tissue type T being irradiated. This is used with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate the contributory organ doses to arrive at an effective dose ''E'' for non-uniform irradiation.

When a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used, and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose. But if the irradiation of a body is partial or non-uniform the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is used to calculate dose to each organ or tissue. These are then summed to obtain the effective dose. In the case of uniform irradiation of the human body, these summate to 1, but in the case of partial or non-uniform irradiation, they will summate to a lower value depending on the organs concerned; reflecting the lower overall health effect. The calculation process is shown on the accompanying diagram. This approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body, taking into account complete or partial irradiation, and the radiation type or types.
The values of these weighting factors are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types, based on averages of those obtained for the human population.

===Radiation type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{Main article|equivalent dose}}

Since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy, a corrective [[Relative biological effectiveness|radiation weighting factor]] ''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue, is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose.  The result is given the unit sievert.

The equivalent dose is calculated by multiplying the absorbed energy, averaged by mass over an organ or tissue of interest, by a radiation weighting factor appropriate to the type and energy of radiation. To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy dose.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_T = \sum_R W_R \cdot D_{T,R}\ &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue ''T''
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorbed dose in tissue ''T'' by radiation type ''R''
:''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1&amp;nbsp;Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20&amp;nbsp;Sv.

[[File:Neutron radiation weighting factor as a function of kinetic energy.gif|thumb|300px|The radiation weighting factor for neutrons has been revised over time and remains controversial.]]

This may seem to be a paradox. It implies that the energy of the incident radiation field in [[joule]]s has increased by a factor of 20, thereby violating the laws of [[Conservation of energy]]. However, this is not the case. The sievert is used only to convey the fact that a gray of absorbed alpha particles would cause twenty times the biological effect of a gray of absorbed x-rays. It is this biological component that is being expressed when using sieverts rather than the actual energy delivered by the incident absorbed radiation.

===Tissue type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;===

{{Main article|effective dose (radiation)}}
The second weighting factor is the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it is used only if there has been non-uniform irradiation of a body. If the body has been subject to uniform irradiation, the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose, and only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used. But if there is partial or non-uniform body irradiation the calculation must take account of the individual organ doses received, because the sensitivity of each organ to irradiation depends on their tissue type. This summed dose from only those organs concerned gives the effective dose for the whole body. The tissue weighting factor is used to calculate those individual organ dose contributions.

The ICRP values for ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; are given in the table shown here.

The article on [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] gives the method of calculation. The absorbed dose is first corrected for the radiation type to give the equivalent dose, and then corrected for the tissue receiving the radiation. Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

In summary, the sum of tissue-weighted doses to each irradiated organ or tissue of the body adds up to the effective dose for the body. The use of effective dose enables comparisons of overall dose received regardless of the extent of body irradiation.

==Operational quantities==
The operational quantities are used in practical applications for monitoring and investigating external exposure situations. They are defined for practical operational measurements and assessment of doses in the body.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;  Three external operational dose quantities were devised to relate operational dosimeter and instrument measurements to the calculated protection quantities. Also devised were two phantoms, The ICRU "slab" and "sphere" phantoms which relate these quantities to incident radiation quantities using the Q(L) calculation.

===Ambient dose equivalent===
This is used for area monitoring of penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H''*(10). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found 10&amp;nbsp;mm within the ICRU sphere phantom in the direction of origin of the field.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B163 - B164&lt;/ref&gt; An example of penetrating radiation is [[gamma ray]]s.

===Directional dose equivalent===
This is used for monitoring of low penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H'''(0.07). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found at a depth of 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm in the ICRU sphere phantom.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B165- B167&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of low penetrating radiation are alpha particles, beta particles and low-energy photons. This dose quantity is used for the determination of equivalent dose to such as the skin, lens of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Mattsson |first1=Sören |last2=Söderberg |first2=Marcus |title=Radiation Protection in Nuclear Medicine |chapter=Dose Quantities and Units for Radiation Protection |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642311666-c2.pdf |publisher=Springer Verlag |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31167-3 |isbn=978-3-642-31166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In radiological protection practice value of omega is usually not specified as the dose is usually at a maximum at the point of interest.

===Personal dose equivalent===
This is used for individual dose monitoring, such as with a personal dosimeter worn on the body. The recommended depth for assessment is 10&amp;nbsp;mm which gives the quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(10).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B168 - B170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals for changing the definition of protection dose quantities==
In order to simplify the means of calculating operational quantities, and assist in the comprehension of radiation dose protection quantities, ICRP Committee 2 &amp; ICRU Report Committee 26 started in 2010 an examination of different means of achieving this by dose coefficients related to Effective Dose or Absorbed Dose.

Specifically;

1. For area monitoring of effective dose of whole body it would be:

''H'' = Φ × conversion coefficient

The driver for this is that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(10) is not a reasonable estimate of effective dose due to high energy photons, as a result of the extension of particle types and energy ranges to be considered in ICRP report 116. This change would remove the need for the ICRU sphere and introduce a new quantity called ''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;

2. For individual monitoring, to measure deterministic effects on eye lens and skin, it would be:

''D'' = Φ × conversion coefficient for absorbed dose.

The driver for this is the need to measure the deterministic effect, which it is suggested, is more appropriate than stochastic effect. This would calculate equivalent dose quantities ''H''&lt;sub&gt;lens&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;skin&lt;/sub&gt;.

This would remove the need for the ICRU Sphere and the Q-L function. Any changes would replace ICRU report 51, and part of report 57.&lt;ref name= "endo"&gt;"Operational Quantities and new approach by ICRU" – Akira Endo. The 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection, Seoul, Korea – October 20–22, 2015 [http://www.icrp.org/docs/icrp2015/18%20Akira%20Endo%202015.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A final draft report was issued in July 2017 by ICRU/ICRP for consultation. &lt;ref&gt;ICRP draft "Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure" [http://www.icrp.org/docs/ICRU%20and%20ICRP%20Draft%20Joint%20Report%20Operational%20Quantities%20for%20External%20Radiation%20Exposure.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal dose quantities==
{{Main article|Committed dose}}
The sievert is used for human internal dose quantities in calculating [[committed dose]]. This is dose from radionuclides which have been ingested or inhaled into the human body, and thereby "committed" to irradiate the body for a period of time. The concepts of calculating protection quantities as described for external radiation applies, but as the source of radiation is within the tissue of the body, the calculation of absorbed organ dose uses different coefficients and irradiation mechanisms.

The ICRP defines Committed effective dose, E(''t'') as the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;

The ICRP further states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

A committed dose from an internal source is intended to carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of effective dose applied to part of the body.

==Health effects==
Ionizing radiation has [[deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] effects on human health. Deterministic (acute tissue effect) events happen with certainty, with the resulting health conditions occurring in every individual who received the same high dose.  [[Stochastic]] (cancer induction and genetic) events are inherently [[random]], with most individuals in a group failing to ever exhibit any [[causal]] negative health effects after exposure, while an indeterministic random minority do, often with the resulting subtle negative health effects being observable only after large detailed [[epidemiology]] studies.

The use of the sievert implies that only stochastic effects are being considered, and to avoid confusion deterministic effects are conventionally compared to values of absorbed dose expressed by the SI unit gray (Gy).

===Stochastic effects===
Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. The consensus of nuclear regulators, governments and the [[UNSCEAR]] is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per sievert.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;  This is known as the [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT model). Some commentators such as the French Academy of Sciences (2005, ''Dose-effect relationships and...''Tubiana, M. and Aurengo, A.  Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie Nationale de Médecine. (2005) www.researchgate.net/publication/277289357) and Oxford University (Wade Allison, 2015, Nuclear is for Life, pp79–80, {{ISBN|978-0-9562756-4-6}}) argue that this LNT model is now outdated and should be replaced with a threshold below which the body's natural cell processes repair damage and/or replace damaged cells. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peck |first=Donald J. |title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk |url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208060102/http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 December 2010 |publisher=Image Wisely |accessdate=18 May 2012 |last2=Samei |first2=Ehsan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Effects of ionizing radiation: UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes |year=2008 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=978-92-1-142263-4 |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html |accessdate=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic effects===

The blue line is for cells which were not given a chance to recover; the radiation was delivered in one session, the red line is for cells which were allowed to stand for a time and recover. With the pause in delivery conferring [[radioresistance]].]]
The deterministic (acute tissue damage) effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of acute high doses (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h) and are conventionally not measured using the unit sievert, but use the unit gray (Gy).
A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose.

===ICRP dose limits===

The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of report 103. These limits are "situational", for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for the following groups;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Table 8, section 6.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public 
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – All persons exposed

For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period, and for the public to an average of 1&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

For comparison, natural radiation levels inside the US [[United States Capitol|capitol building]] are such that a human body would receive an additional dose rate of 0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the [[granite]] structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program |title=Radiation in the Environment |url=http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211162419/http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conservative ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk (calculated as: 20&amp;nbsp;a·0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a·0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv/mSv·5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%). However, that "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a 10% chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation (see natural [[Epidemiology of cancer]] and [[cancer rates]]).  These estimates are, however, unmindful of every living cell's natural repair mechanisms, evolved over a few billion years of exposure to environmental chemical and radiation threats that were higher in the past, and exaggerated by the evolution of [[oxygen metabolism]].

Significant radiation doses are not frequently encountered in everyday life. The following examples can help illustrate relative magnitudes; these are meant to be examples only, not a comprehensive list of possible radiation doses. An "acute dose" is one that occurs over a short and finite period of time, while a "chronic dose" is a dose that continues for an extended period of time so that it is better described by a dose rate.

==History==
The sievert has its origin in the [[roentgen equivalent man|röntgen equivalent man]] (rem) which was derived from [[CGS units]]. The [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) promoted a switch to coherent SI units in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=Round table on SI units: ICRU Activities |conference=International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association |date=April 1977 |url=http://www.irpa.net/irpa4/cdrom/VOL.2/P2_101.PDF |accessdate=18 May 2012 |location=Paris, France }}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in 1976 that it planned to formulate a suitable unit for equivalent dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=The New Special Names of SI Units in the Field of Ionizing Radiations |journal=British Journal of Radiology |date=May 1976 |volume=49 |pages=476–477 |url=http://bjr.birjournals.org/content/49/581/476.2.full.pdf |accessdate=18 May 2012 |issn=1748-880X |pmid=949584 |last2=Allisy |first2=A. |last3=Lidén |first3=K. |issue=581 |doi=10.1259/0007-1285-49-581-476-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICRP pre-empted the ICRU by introducing the sievert in 1977.&lt;ref name="ICRP26"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recommendations of the ICRP |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=1977 |volume=1 |series=ICRP publication 26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%2026 |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sievert was adopted by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 1980, five years after adopting the gray. The CIPM then issued an explanation in 1984, recommending when the sievert should be used as opposed to the gray. That explanation was updated in 2002 to bring it closer to the ICRP's definition of equivalent dose, which had changed in 1990. Specifically, the ICRP had introduced equivalent dose, renamed the quality factor (Q) to radiation weighting factor (W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), and dropped another weighting factor 'N' in 1990. In 2002, the CIPM similarly dropped the weighting factor 'N' from their explanation but otherwise kept other old terminology and symbols. This explanation only appears in the appendix to the SI brochure and is not part of the definition of the sievert.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{SIbrochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common SI usage==
{{SI unit lowercase|Rolf Maximilian Sievert|sievert|Sv}}

Frequently used [[SI prefixes]] are the millisievert (1&amp;nbsp;mSv = 0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and microsievert (1&amp;nbsp;μSv = 0.000001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and commonly used units for [[time derivative]] or "dose rate" indications on instruments and warnings for radiological protection are μSv/h and mSv/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mSv/a or Sv/a, where they are understood to represent an average over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual limits. The conversion from hours to years varies because of leap years and exposure schedules, but approximate conversions are:

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 8.766&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 114.1&amp;nbsp;μSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

Conversion from hourly rates to annual rates is further complicated by seasonal fluctuations in natural radiation, decay of artificial sources, and intermittent proximity between humans and sources. The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units |year=1950 |publisher=US Department of Commerce |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2012 |series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook |volume=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 8&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;day
: 40&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;week
: 50&amp;nbsp;weeks = 1&amp;nbsp;year

Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 2&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 500&amp;nbsp;µSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

==Ionizing radiation quantities==

The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
{{Radiation related quantities}}

Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units [[curie]], [[rad (unit)|rad]], and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1004|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]] [[European units of measurement directives]] required that their use for "public health ... purposes" be phased out by 31 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rem equivalence===
An older unit for the dose equivalent is the [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]],&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation: Risks and Realities |url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/402-k-07-006.pdf |work=Radiation: Risks and Realities |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 March 2011 |author=Office of Air and Radiation |author2=Office of Radiation and Indoor Air |page=2 |format=PDF |date=May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; still often used in the United States.

[[File:Taste bud.svg|thumb|right|Taste bud]]
'''Taste''', '''gustatory perception''', or '''gustation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Adjectival form]]: [[wikt:gustatory|gustatory]]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the five traditional [[sense]]s that belongs to the '''gustatory system'''.

Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth [[biochemistry|reacts chemically]] with [[taste receptor]] cells located on [[taste bud]]s in the [[oral cavity]], mostly on the [[tongue]]. Taste, along with smell ([[olfaction]]) and [[trigeminal nerve]] stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines [[flavor]]s of [[food]] and/or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the [[tongue]] and the [[epiglottis]].&lt;ref name=kids&gt;[http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/taste_buds.html What Are Taste Buds?] kidshealth.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;ots=D2KQ-D740L&amp;dq=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;f=false Human biology (Page 201/464)] Daniel D. Chiras. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gustatory cortex]] is responsible for the perception of taste.

The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name = Schacter169&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"&gt;Boron, W.F., E.L. Boulpaep. 2003. Medical Physiology. 1st ed. Elsevier Science USA.&lt;/ref&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Taste#Saltiness|saltiness]],  [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitterness]], and [[umami]].&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|title=The science of satisfaction|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-science-of-satisfaction|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072592/|title= How does our sense of taste work?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 January 2012 |website= PubMed |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savory, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to [[G protein-coupled receptors]] on the [[cell membrane]]s of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when [[alkali metal]] or [[hydrogen]] [[ions]] enter taste buds, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th Edition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include [[Odor|smell]],&lt;ref name=kids/&gt; detected by the [[olfactory epithelium]] of the nose;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/nosek.html Smell - The Nose Knows] washington.edu, Eric H.

As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=two-great-tastes-not-great-together Why do two great tastes sometimes not taste great together?] scientificamerican.com.

Among [[human]]s, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in [[saliva]] production.&lt;ref name="SeidelBall2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry M Seidel|author2=Jane W Ball|author3=Joyce E Dains|title=Mosby's Guide to Physical Examination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7HSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303|date=1 February 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-07357-8|page=303|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can also have distortion of tastes through [[dysgeusia]]. Not all [[mammal]]s share the same taste senses: some [[rodent]]s can taste [[starch]] (which humans cannot), [[cat]]s cannot taste sweetness, and several other [[carnivores]] including [[hyena]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[sea lion]]s, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scully|first1=Simone M.|title=The Animals That Taste Only Saltiness|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-animals-that-taste-only-saltiness|website=Nautilus|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tastes==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. [[Digestive enzyme]]s in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name="Schacter169"/&gt; The exception to this are the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"/&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

[[Bitter (taste)|Bitter]] foods are generally found unpleasant, while [[sour]], [[saltiness|salty]], [[sweet]], and [[umami]] tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation.  The five specific tastes received by [[taste receptor]]s are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and ''[[umami|savoriness]]'', often known by its Japanese term "umami" which translates to ‘delicious’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | title=New Seasonings | journal=Chemical Senses |origyear=First published 1909 | year= 2002 | volume=27 | issue=9 | pages= 847–849 |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/27/9/847|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1093/chemse/27.9.847 | pmid=12438213}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.

One study found that both salt and sour taste mechanisms detect, in different ways, the presence of [[sodium chloride]] (salt) in the mouth, however, acids are also detected and perceived as sour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lindemann | first=Bernd | title=Receptors and transduction in taste| journal=Nature |date=13 September 2001 | volume=413 |pages= 219–225|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6852/pdf/413219a0.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1038/35093032| pmid=11557991 | issue=6852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of salt is important to many organisms, but specifically mammals, as it serves a critical role in ion and water [[homeostasis]] in the body.  It is specifically needed in the mammalian [[kidney]] as an osmotically active compound which facilitates passive re-uptake of water into the blood.{{citation needed|reason=Which studies purport this?|date=September 2016}} Because of this, salt elicits a pleasant taste in most humans.

Sour and salt tastes can be pleasant in small quantities, but in larger quantities become more and more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals [[acids]], which can cause serious tissue damage.

The bitter taste is almost universally unpleasant to humans. This is because many [[nitrogenous]] [[organic compound|organic molecules]] which have a [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effect on humans taste bitter. These include [[caffeine]], [[nicotine]], and [[strychnine]], which respectively compose the stimulant in [[coffee]], addictive agent in [[cigarettes]], and active compound in many [[pesticides]]. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. Many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.

Sweet taste signals the presence of [[carbohydrates]] in solution. Since carbohydrates have a very high calorie count ([[saccharides]] have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy ([[sugars]]) and storage of energy ([[glycogen]]). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including [[saccharin]], [[sucralose]], and [[aspartame]]. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.

The [[umami|savory]] taste (known in Japanese as "umami") was identified by Japanese chemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]] of [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], which signals the presence of the [[amino acid]] [[L-glutamate]], triggers a pleasurable response and thus encourages the intake of [[peptides]] and [[proteins]]. The amino acids in proteins are used in the body to build muscles and organs, transport molecules ([[hemoglobin]]), [[antibodies]], and the organic catalysts known as [[enzymes]]. These are all critical molecules, and as such it is important to have a steady supply of amino acids, hence the pleasurable response to their presence in the mouth.

In [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of mainly [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] cultural influence, [[pungency]] (piquancy or hotness) had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In 2015, researchers suggested a new basic taste of fatty acids called fat taste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keast|first=Russell SJ|last2=Costanzo|first2=Andrew|date=2015-02-03|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

===Sweetness===

The increased Ca+ concentration activates neurotransmitter vesicles. 7. The neuron connected to the taste bud is stimulated by the neurotransmitters.]]
Sweetness, usually regarded as a pleasurable sensation, is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]]. Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein coupled receptor]]s coupled to the [[G protein]] [[gustducin]] found on the [[taste bud]]s. At least two different variants of the "sweetness receptors" must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhao |first=Grace Q. |author2=Yifeng Zhang |author3=Mark A.

For [[lactose]] it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3,&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt; and [[5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline]] 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as [[saccharide]]s activate the GPCR, which releases [[gustducin]]. The gustducin then activates the molecule [[adenylate cyclase]], which catalyzes the production of the molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as [[saccharin]] activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.

===Sourness===

Sourness is the taste that detects [[acid]]ity. The sourness of substances is rated relative to dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], which has a sourness index of 1. By comparison, [[tartaric acid]] has a sourness index of 0.7, [[citric acid]] an index of 0.46, and [[carbonic acid]] an index of 0.06.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee/&gt;

Sour taste is detected by a small subset of cells that are distributed across all taste buds in the tongue. Sour taste cells can be identified by expression of the protein [[PKD2L1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060823184824.htm| title=Biologists Discover How We Detect Sour Taste |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this gene is not required for sour responses. There is evidence that the protons that are abundant in sour substances can directly enter the sour taste cells through apically located ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= A proton current drives action potentials in genetically identified sour taste cells|author1=Rui Chang, Hang Waters  |author2=Emily Liman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date= 2010 | volume=107 | issue=51 | pages=22320–22325 | pmc= 3009759
  | pmid=21098668 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1013664107|bibcode=2010PNAS..10722320C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of positive charge into the cell can itself trigger an electrical response.  It has also been proposed that weak acids such as acetic acid, which is not fully dissociated at physiological pH values, can penetrate taste cells and thereby elicit an electrical response. According to this mechanism, intracellular hydrogen ions inhibit potassium channels, which normally function to hyperpolarize the cell.
By a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions (which itself depolarizes the cell) and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The K+ channel KIR2.1 functions in tandem with proton influx to mediate sour taste transduction | author=Ye, W., Chang, R.

The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is [[fruit]], such as [[lemon]], [[grape]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tamarind]], and sometimes [[melon]]. [[Wine]] also usually has a sour tinge to its flavor, and if not kept correctly, [[milk]] can spoil and develop a sour taste.

Many of these candies contain citric acid or [[malic acid]].

===Saltiness===
{{Redirect|Saltiness|the saltiness in the water|Salinity}}
The simplest receptor found in the mouth is the [[sodium chloride]] (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily by the presence of [[sodium ion]]s. Other ions of the [[alkali metals]] group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is.  A [[sodium channel]] in the taste cell wall allows sodium [[cation]]s to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to [[neurotransmitter]] release. This sodium channel is known as an [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug [[amiloride]] in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.

The size of [[lithium]] and [[potassium]] ions most closely resemble those of sodium, and thus the saltiness is most similar. In contrast, [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]] ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The saltiness of substances is rated relative to sodium chloride (NaCl), which has an index of 1.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee /&gt; Potassium, as [[potassium chloride]] (KCl), is the principal ingredient in [[salt substitute]]s and has a saltiness index of 0.6.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g. [[ammonium]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g. calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an [[action potential]]. But the chloride of calcium is saltier and less bitter than potassium chloride, and is commonly used in pickle brine instead of KCl.

===Bitterness===
{{See also|Bitter taste evolution}}
[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Bitter.svg|thumb|The diagram depicted above shows the signal transduction pathway of the bitter taste. Bitter taste has many different receptors and signal transduction pathways. Bitter indicates poison to animals. It is most similar to sweet. Object A is a taste bud, object B is one taste cell, and object C is a neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of a molecule.1. A bitter substance such as quinine, is consumed and binds to G Protein-coupled receptors.II. Part II is the transduction pathway 2. Gustducin, a G protein second messenger, is activated. 3. Phosphodiesterase, an enzyme, is then activated. 4. Cyclic nucleotide, cNMP, is used, lowering the concentration 5. Channels such as the K+, potassium, channels, close.III. Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron.]]

Bitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various [[bittering agent]]s. Common bitter foods and beverages include [[coffee]], unsweetened [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]], South American [[Mate (beverage)|mate]], [[bitter gourd]], [[Olive (fruit)|olives]], [[Peel (fruit)|citrus peel]], many plants in the family [[Brassicaceae]], [[dandelion]] greens, wild [[chicory]], and [[escarole]]. The ethanol in [[alcoholic beverages]] tastes bitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scinska A, Koros E, Habrat B, Kukwa A, Kostowski W, Bienkowski P |title=Bitter and sweet components of ethanol taste in humans |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |date=August 2000  |pmid=10940547 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00149-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including [[hops]] in [[beer]] and orange in [[bitters]]. [[Quinine]] is also known for its bitter taste and is found in [[tonic water]].

Bitterness is of interest to those who study [[evolution]], as well as various health researchers&lt;ref name="textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psychologyofeating&amp;drinking"&gt;Logue, A.W.

Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as [[TAS2R38]] coupled to the [[G protein]] [[gustducin]] are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maehashi, K., M.

Gustducin is made of three subunits. When it is activated by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate [[phosphodiesterase]], a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes potassium ion channels.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.

This causes the G-protein complex to activate a secondary receptor, which ultimately leads to neurotransmitter release. The intermediate steps are not known.

==Measuring relative tastes==
Measuring the degree to which a substance presents one basic taste can be achieved in a subjective way by comparing its taste to a reference substance.

'''Sweetness''' is subjectively measured by comparing the threshold values, or level at which the presence of a dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances.&lt;ref name=Tsai2007&gt;{{citation |date=14 May 2007 |author=Tsai, Michelle |title=How Sweet It Is?

In the human body a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] refers to a form of energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. [[Sensory receptors]] are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical [[action potential]] which can be understood by the brain, the body’s control center. Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory [[neurons]]; modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from sensory receptors all over the body.

Taste is a form of [[chemoreception]] which occurs in the specialised [[taste receptor]]s in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of [[sensory transduction]]: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, [a]lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers{{who|date=September 2016}} believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make "keep or spit out" decisions when there is more than one tastant present. "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As well, [[serotonin]] is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of [[microvilli]] of the taste cells.

;Sweetness
Sweetness is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s, some proteins, and a few other substances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s coupled to a [[G protein]] that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, [[gustducin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/04/science/how-the-taste-bud-translates-between-tongue-and-brain.html?pagewanted=all How the Taste Bud Translates Between Tongue and Brain] nytimes.com, 4 August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, etal |title=The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=255–66 |date=October 2003  |pmid=14636554 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Saltiness
Saltiness is a taste produced best by the presence of [[ion|cations]] (such as {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|K|+}} or {{chem|Li|+}})&lt;ref name=ion/&gt; and is directly detected by cation influx into glial like cells via leak channels causing depolarisation of the cell.&lt;ref name=ion/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g., [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}, and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g., calcium, {{chem|Ca|2+}}, ions, in general, elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through [[ion channel]]s in the tongue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

;Sourness

;Bitterness
Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as [[TAS2R38]] are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maehashi K, Matano M, Wang H, Vo LA, Yamamoto Y, Huang L |title=Bitter peptides activate hTAS2Rs, the human bitter receptors |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=365 |issue=4 |pages=851–5 |date=January 2008  |pmid=18037373 |pmc=2692459 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.070}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are identified not only by their ability to taste certain bitter ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindemann B |title=Receptors and transduction in taste |journal=Nature |volume=413 |issue=6852 |pages=219–25 |date=September 2001  |pmid=11557991 |doi=10.1038/35093032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glutamic acid binds to a variant of the G protein-coupled receptor, producing a [[umami|savory]] taste.&lt;ref name="Lindemann B 99–100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD 113–9"/&gt;

==Further sensations and transmission==
The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the [[somatosensory]] system. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves.  The [[facial nerve]] (VII) carries taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the [[tongue]], the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) carries taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity.

The [[trigeminal nerve]] (cranial nerve V) provides information concerning the general texture of food as well as the taste-related sensations of peppery or hot (from [[spices]]).

===Pungency (also spiciness or hotness)===
{{Main|Pungency|Scoville scale}}

Substances such as [[ethanol]] and [[capsaicin]] cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat is caused by the food's activating nerves that express [[TRPV1]] and [[TRPA1]] receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from [[chili pepper]]s, [[piperine]] from [[black pepper]], [[gingerol]] from [[ginger root]] and [[allyl isothiocyanate]] from [[horseradish]]. The [[pungency|piquant]] ("hot" or "spicy") sensation provided by such foods and spices plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world—especially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as [[Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]], [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Cuisine of Korea|Korean]], [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Cuisine of Laos|Lao]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], [[New Mexican cuisine|New Mexican]], [[Singaporean cuisine|Singaporean]], [[Southwest China|Southwest Chinese]] (including [[Szechuan cuisine]]), [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], and [[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] cuisines.

This particular sensation, called [[chemesthesis]], is not a taste in the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and a different set of nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as "hot" results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, [[Cornea|surface of the eye]] or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to hotness agents. [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of, mainly,  [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] cultural influence, often wrote of [[pungency]] as a fifth or sixth taste.

===Coolness===
Some substances activate cold [[trigeminal]] receptors even when not at low temperatures. This "fresh" or "minty" sensation can be tasted in [[peppermint]], [[spearmint]], [[menthol]], ethanol, and [[camphor]]. Caused by activation of the same mechanism that signals cold, [[TRPM8]] ion channels on [[neuron|nerve cells]], unlike the actual change in temperature described for sugar substitutes, this coolness is only a perceived phenomenon.

===Numbness===
Both Chinese and [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] cooking include the idea of 麻 (''má'' or ''mati rasa''), a tingling numbness caused by spices such as [[Sichuan pepper]]. The cuisines of [[Sichuan]] province in China and of the Indonesian province of [[North Sumatra]] often combine this with [[chili pepper]] to produce a 麻辣 ''málà'', "numbing-and-hot", or "mati rasa" flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Zant_pip.html|title=Spice Pages:  Sichuan Pepper (Zanthoxylum, Szechwan peppercorn, fagara, hua jiao, sansho 山椒, timur, andaliman, tirphal)|first=Gernot|last=Katzer|website=gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensations although not taste fall into a category of [[Chemesthesis]].

===Astringency===
Some foods, such as unripe fruits, contain [[tannins]] or [[calcium oxalate]] that cause an astringent or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include [[tea]], [[red wine]], [[rhubarb]], some fruits of the genus ''[[Syzygium]]'', and unripe [[persimmon]]s and [[banana]]s.

Less exact terms for the astringent sensation are "dry", "rough", "harsh" (especially for wine), "tart" (normally referring to sourness), "rubbery", "hard" or "styptic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peleg|first1=Hanna|last2=Gacon|first2=Karine|last3=Schlich|first3=Pascal|last4=Noble|first4=Ann C|title=Bitterness and astringency of flavan-3-ol monomers, dimers and trimers|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|date=June 1999|volume=79|issue=8|pages=1123–1128|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199906)79:8&lt;1123::AID-JSFA336&gt;3.0.CO;2-D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to wine, ''dry'' is the opposite of ''sweet,'' and does not refer to astringency. Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as "dry", and "dry" wines are not necessarily astringent.

In the Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic tradition]], one of the six tastes is astringency (''kasaaya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008083229/http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html|date=8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sinhala Language|Sinhala]] and [[Sri Lankan English]] it is referred to as ''kahata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirisgala.net/Updates/SL_English_Updates_K.html|title=Sri Lankan English - Updates K|website=www.mirisgala.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tamil it is referred to as thuvarppu.

===Metallicness===
A metallic taste may be caused by food and drink, certain medicines or [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste may be caused by [[Galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toothbody.com/art-battery-in-your-mouth.php|title=Is there a Battery in your Mouth? |publisher=www.toothbody.com |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the [[TRPV1]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Riera |first1=Céline E. |last2=Vogel |first2=Horst |last3=Simon |first3=Sidney A. |last4=le Coutre |first4=Johannes |title=Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate TRPV1 receptors. |date=2007 |journal=American Journal of Physiology |volume=293 |number=2 |pages=R626-R634 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00286.2007 |pmid=17567713 |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/293/2/R626 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people consider [[blood]] to have a metallic taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willard|first=James P.|year=1905|title=Current Events|journal=Progress: A Monthly Journal Devoted to Medicine and Surgery|volume=4|pages=861–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xygAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monosson|first=Emily|title=Evolution in a Toxic World: How Life Responds to Chemical Threats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqtrn8iwtecC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2012|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781597269766|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms [[dysgeusia]] or [[parageusia]], referring to distortions of the sense of taste,&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=E.

Proposed alternate names to fat taste include oleogustus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Running |first1=Cordelia A. |last2=Craig |first2=Bruce A. |last3=Mattes |first3=Richard D. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Oleogustus: The Unique Taste of Fat |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract?sid=f45a0d90-7258-44e9-ac06-35ffde1b9bb1 |journal=Chemical Senses |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages= 507–516|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjv036 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pinguis,&lt;ref name="Reed 353S–360S"/&gt; although these terms are not widely accepted. The main form of fat that is commonly ingested is [[triglycerides]], which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids via lipases. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, a high concentration of fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible.&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html |title=Research confirms fat is sixth taste; names it oleogustus |last1=Neubert |first1=Amy Patterson |date=23 July 2015 |website=Purdue News |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish fat taste from other tastes, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual "creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of [[fatty acids]] is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as "more of a warning system" that a certain food should not be eaten.&lt;ref name="oleogustus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/2044-7248-4-5|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities. Foods whose flavor to which fat taste makes a small contribution include olive oil and fresh butter, along with various kinds of vegetable and nut oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldhausen |first=Teresa Shipley |date=31 July 2015 |title=The five basic tastes have sixth sibling: oleogustus |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-basic-tastes-have-sixth-sibling-oleogustus |newspaper=[[Science News]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heartiness (''kokumi'')===
Some Japanese researchers refer to the ''kokumi'' of foods. This sensation has also been described as mouthfulness,&lt;ref name="foodprot"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hettiarachchy |editor1-first=Navam S. |editor2-last=Sato |editor2-first=Kenji |editor3-last=Marshall |editor3-first=Maurice R. |title=Food proteins and peptides: chemistry, functionality interactions, and commercialization |date=2010 |publisher=CRC |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |isbn=9781420093414 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h8UEImN7SAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=kokumi |accessdate=26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}} and appears to be related to a number of {{nowrap|[[alpha and beta carbon|γ]]-[[dextrorotation and levorotation|L]]-[[glutamic acid|glutamyl]] peptides}}, which activate a [[calcium-sensing receptor]] which is also sensitive to [[glutathione]].&lt;ref name="foodprot"/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can be an essential element of the taste experience. Food and drink that—in a given culture—is traditionally served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, with a few exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups—again, with exceptions—are usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are [[soft drinks]]. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season.

===Starchiness===
A 2016 study suggested that humans can taste [[starch]] (specifically, a [[glucose]] [[oligomer]]) independently of other tastes such as sweetness. However, no specific chemical receptor has yet been found for this taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapis|first=Trina J.|last2=Penner|first2=Michael H.|last3=Lim|first3=Juyun|date=23 August 2016|title=Humans Can Taste Glucose Oligomers Independent of the hT1R2/hT1R3 Sweet Taste Receptor|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/lapis-etal-2106.pdf|journal=Chemical Senses|language=en|pages=bjw088|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjw088|issn=0379-864X|pmid=27553043|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alexa J.|last1=Pullicin|first2=Michael H.|last2=Penner|first3=Juyun|last3=Lim|title=Human taste detection of glucose oligomers with low degree of polymerization|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|journal=PLOS ONE|date=29 August 2017|issn=1932-6203|pages=e0183008|volume=12|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1283008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104244-there-is-now-a-sixth-taste-and-it-explains-why-we-love-carbs/|title=There is now a sixth taste – and it explains why we love carbs|last=Hamzelou|first=Jessica|date=2 September 2016|website=[[New Scientist]]|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pterygopalatine ganglion|pterygopalatine ganglia]] are ganglia (one on each side) of the [[soft palate]]. The [[greater petrosal nerve|greater petrosal]], [[lesser palatine nerve|lesser palatine]]  and [[zygomatic nerve]]s all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the [[nasal cavity]]; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the [[lacrimal nerve]] that activate the [[lacrimal gland]]; which is the reason that spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are [[maxillary nerve]]s (from the [[trigeminal nerve]]).

The [[special visceral afferent]]s of the [[vagus nerve]] carry taste from the [[epiglottis|epiglottal]] region of the tongue.

The lingual nerve (trigeminal, not shown in diagram) is deeply interconnected with chorda tympani in that it provides all other sensory info from the ⅔ of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Mu, Liancai, and Ira Sanders.

==Other concepts==
===Taste as a philosophical concept===
{{See also|Philosophy of perception}}

Taste can be objective in terms of the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) but it can also be subjective in terms of what we deem "good" and "bad." Taste is "subjective, objective, and qualitative".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"/&gt; We cannot tell someone they do not ''think'' something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement &lt;ref&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supertasters===
{{Main|Supertaster}}

A supertaster is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartoshuk L. M. |author2=Duffy V. B. | year = 1994 | title = PTC/PROP tasting: anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects." 1994 | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1165–71 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90361-1 | pmid=7878086|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food to get the same satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Amanda|title=Love salt? You might be a 'supertaster'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/16/salt.taste/index.html|publisher=CNN Health|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftertaste===
{{Main|Aftertaste}}

Aftertastes arise after food has been swallowed. An aftertaste can differ from the food it follows. [[Medicine]]s and tablets may also have a lingering aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as [[aspartame]] (artificial sweetener).

===Acquired taste===
{{Main|Acquired taste}}

An acquired taste often refers to an appreciation for a food or beverage that is unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it, usually because of some unfamiliar aspect of the food or beverage, including bitterness, a strong or strange odor, taste, or appearance.

==Clinical significance==
Patients with [[Addison's disease]], pituitary insufficiency, or [[cystic fibrosis]] sometimes have a hyper-sensitivity to the five primary tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK385/|title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations|last=Walker|first=H. Kenneth|year=1990|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders of taste===
* [[ageusia]] (complete loss of taste)
* [[hypogeusia]] (reduced sense of taste)
* [[dysgeusia]] (distortion in sense of taste)
* [[hypergeusia]] (abnormally heightened sense of taste)

==History==
In [[The Western world|the West]], [[Aristotle]] postulated in [[Circa|c.]] 350 [[BCE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/soul.html On the Soul] Aristotle. Translated by J. A. Smith.

Oxford University Press US, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayurveda]], an ancient [[India]]n healing science, has its own tradition of basic tastes, comprising [[sweetness|sweet]], [[salt]]y, [[sour]], [[Pungency|pungent]], bitter &amp; [[astringent]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2hsBJAp5fYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Ayurvedic%20balancing%3A%20an%20integration%20of%20Western%20fitness%20with%20Eastern%20wellness&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20six%20tastes&amp;f=false Ayurvedic balancing: an integration of Western fitness with Eastern wellness (Pages 25-26/188)] Joyce Bueker. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Chinese regarded [[spiciness]] as a basic taste.

==Research==
The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for the basic tastes of bitter, sweet and savory have been identified. They are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bachmanov | first1 = AA. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = GK. | title = Taste receptor genes. | journal = Annu Rev Nutr | volume = 27 | issue =  1| pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 | PMID = 17444812 | pmc=2721271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells that detect sourness have been identified as a subpopulation that express the protein [[PKD2L1]]. The responses are mediated by an influx of protons into the cells but the receptor for sour is still unknown. The receptor for [[amiloride]]-sensitive attractive salty taste in mice has been shown to be a sodium channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chandrashekar J, Kuhn C, Oka Y, etal |title=The cells and peripheral representation of sodium taste in mice |journal=Nature |volume=464 |issue=7286 |pages=297–301 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20107438 |pmc=2849629 |doi=10.1038/nature08783 |url=|bibcode=2010Natur.464..297C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, researchers found bitter [[taste receptor]]s in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered.  They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = D.

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} It has been known for some time that these categories may not be comprehensive. In Guyton's 1976 edition of ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'', he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the basis of physiologic studies, there are generally believed to be at least four ''primary'' sensations of taste: ''sour'', ''salty'', ''sweet,'' and ''bitter''. Yet we know that a person can perceive literally hundreds of different tastes.

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies.

Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation.

As for the assignment of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points. Glucose remains about three-quarters as sweet as sucrose whether displayed as 75 or 0.75.

'''The Heart Truth''' is a campaign meant to raise awareness of the risk of [[heart disease]] in women.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; The campaign is sponsored in the United States by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]], an organization of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]];&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/press/nhlbi_04_campaign.htm |title=The Heart Truth Campaign Overview |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103427/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/press/nhlbi_04_campaign.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar campaign is promoted in Canada by the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada]]. It focuses mainly on educating women aged forty to sixty, as that is the time when the risk of heart disease begins to increase.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

== Campaign history ==
The campaign began in March 2001 on recommendation from over seventy experts on the health of women.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; The research stressed the need to communicate to women about the risk of heart disease, and endorsed The Heart Truth as a means of doing so.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

== Logo and marketing ==
The [[logo]] of the campaign is a red dress. It came into being as a way to attract attention to the Heart Truth, and eliminate perceptions that heart disease is an issue only for men.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; The dress reminds women to focus on their "outerselves", as well as their "innerselves", especially heart health.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

The campaign has also conjured a [[National Wear Red Day]], meant to take place on the first Friday of February annually.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

== Events ==
[[File:Group Shot Red Dress Collection 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Group shot of the models from the 2005 Red Dress Collection]]
The Heart Truth has joined with the [[United States Federal Government]] and fashion industries, in an attempt to appeal to female audiences.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; Red dresses have been displayed across the country, primarily at New York's Fashion Week.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; The first Red Dress Collection Fashion Week took place in 2003 when nineteen designers, including [[Vera Wang]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], and [[Carmen Marc Valvo]] contributed dresses that were displayed in the Byrant Park Tents.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; Many fashion shows have been put on in recent years during the Fashion Week festivities; many famous celebrities have participated in walking the aisle, including [[Jenna Fischer]], [[Sheryl Crow]], Natalie Morales, [[Kelly Ripa]], [[Deborah Harry]], [[Venus Williams]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Rachael Ray]], [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Thalía]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]], [[Raven-Symoné]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Sara Ramirez]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Katie Couric]], [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Christina Milian]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]], [[Rose McGowan]] and [[Eartha Kitt]].&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

[[Laureen Harper]], the Wife of Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] has been a great supporter and has served as guest of honour at the event at [[Nathan Phillips Square]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] for many consecutive years.

=== Laura Bush's involvement ===
Former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]] has been the ambassador for the Heart Truth since 2003. She has led the federal government in giving women more information relating to heart disease.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; Bush has coordinated many events relating to the Heart Truth, including a [[White House]] ceremony in 2004, the Kennedy Center exhibit, the Reagan Library exhibit, and has participated in all Fashion Week events dating to 2003.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

A signature component of Mrs. Bush's involvement is her communication with women at hospital events featuring those living with heart disease.&lt;ref name="lb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/ambassador/index.htm|title=The Heart Truth Ambassador|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085726/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/ambassador/index.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She promotes the campaign through various media interviews as well.&lt;ref name="lb"/&gt;

=== First Ladies Red Dress Collection ===
In May 2005, the Heart Truth constructed a special exhibition at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], known as the First Ladies Red Dress Collection. The collection featured seven red dresses worn by America's first ladies [[Lady Bird Johnson]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Rosalynn Carter]], [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Barbara Bush]], [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Laura Bush]]. The exhibit was unveiled by Laura Bush, in the presence of many Congressional spouses and Cabinet secretaries.&lt;ref name="flrdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/first_ladies.htm#|title=First Ladies Red Dress Collection|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514201231/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/first_ladies.htm|archivedate=2008-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the Heart Truth moved that exhibit to the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Simi Valley, California]]. There, the exhibit was opened by former First Lady Nancy Reagan along with television personality [[Larry King]] and Laura Bush.&lt;ref name="flrdc"/&gt; A conference was held at the library with leaders of the heart disease awareness movement as well as Bush and Reagan.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

=== Heart Truth Red Dress Fashion Show 2013 ===
In February 2013, the Heart Truth presented a fashion show at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom. Celebrities who walked the runway included [[Minka Kelly]], [[Soledad O'Brien]], [[Wendy Williams]], [[Brenda Strong]], [[Kris Jenner]], [[Jamie Chung]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Kelly Osbourne]] and others.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msfabulous.com/2013/02/heart-truth-red-dress-show-2013.html#|title=Heart Truth Red Dress Show 2013|accessdate=2013-02-07|publisher=Ms. Fabulous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobacco control''' is a field of international [[public health]] science, policy and practice dedicated to addressing [[tobacco use]] and thereby reducing the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] it causes. [[Tobacco]] control is a priority area for the World Health Organization ([[WHO]]), through the [[FCTC|Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]]. References to a '''''tobacco control [[social movement|movement]]'''''  may have either positive or negative connotations, both briefly covered here.

==Connotations==

===Positive===
The tobacco control field comprises the activity of disparate health, policy and legal research and reform advocacy bodies across the world. These took time to coalesce into a sufficiently organised coalition to advance such measures as the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], and the first article of the first edition of the ''[[Tobacco Control (journal)|Tobacco Control]]'' journal suggested that developing as a diffusely organised movement was indeed necessary in order to bring about effective action to address the health effects of tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ronald|date=March 1992|title=The slow growth of a movement|journal=[[Tobacco Control (journal)|Tobacco Control]]|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/1/1/1.full.pdf|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative===
The tobacco control movement has also been referred to as an ''anti-smoking movement'' by some who disagree with the movement, as documented in internal [[tobacco industry]] memoranda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2503001914-1927.html|title=The Anti-Smoking Movement in Global Perspective|author=P.L. Berger|publisher = [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] memorandum, accessed through tobaccodocuments.org | year = 1991 | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history of tobacco control ==
The first attempts to respond to the health consequences to tobacco use followed soon after the introduction of tobacco to Europe. Pope [[Urban VII]]'s thirteen-day papal reign included the world's first known tobacco use restrictions in 1590 when he threatened to excommunicate anyone who "took tobacco in the porchway of or inside a church, whether it be by chewing it, smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henningfield, Jack E. |title=Nicotine: An Old-Fashioned Addiction |publisher=Chelsea House |year=1985 |pages=96–8 |isbn=0-87754-751-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest citywide European smoking restrictions were enacted in [[Bavaria]], [[Kursachsen]], and certain parts of [[Austria]] in the late 17th century.

In Britain, the still-new habit of smoking met royal opposition in 1604, when [[King James I]] wrote ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', describing smoking as: "A custome loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmeful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible [[Styx (mythology)|Stigian]] smoke of the pit that is bottomeless."  His commentary was accompanied by a doctor of the same period, writing under the pseudonym "Philaretes", who as well as explaining tobacco's harmful effects under the system of the four humours ascribed an infernal motive to its introduction, explaining his dislike of tobacco as grounded upon eight 'principal reasons and arguments' (in their original spelling):

{{Quote|
# First, that in their use and custom, no method or order is observed.  Diversitie and distinction of persons, times and seasons considered.
# Secondly, for that it is in qualitie and complexion more hot and drye then may be conveniently used dayly of any man: much lesse of the hot and cholerique constitution.
# Thirdly, for that it is experimented and tried to be a most strong and violent purge.
# Fourthly, for that it witherete and drieth up naturall moisture in our bodies, thereby causing sterrilitie and barrennesses: In which respect it seemeth an enemy to the continuance and propagacion of mankinde.
# Fiftly, for that it decayeth and dissipateh naturall heate, that kindly warmeth in us, and thereby is cause of crudities and rewmes, occasions of infinite maladies.
# Sixtly, for that this herb is rather weeed, seemethe not voide of venome and poison, and thereby seemeth an enemy to the lyfe of man.
# Seventhly, for that the first author and finder hereof was the Divell, and the first practisers of the same were the Divells Preiests, and therefore not to be used of us Christians.
# Last of all, because it is a great augmentor of all sorts of melancholie in our bodies, a humor fit to prepare our bodies to receave the prestigations and hellih illusions and impressions of the Divell himselfe: in so much that many Phisitions and learned mean doe hold this humour to be the verie seate of the Divell in bodies possessed.
}}

Later in the seventeenth century, Sir [[Francis Bacon]] identified the addictive consequences of tobacco use, observing that it "is growing greatly and conquers men with a certain secret pleasure, so that those who have once become accustomed thereto can later hardly be restrained therefrom".&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon, Francis]] ''Historia vitae et mortis''(1623)&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking was forbidden in [[Berlin]] in 1723, in [[Königsberg]] in 1742, and in [[Stettin]] in 1744. These restrictions were repealed in the revolutions of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Proctor |first=RN |authorlink=Robert N. Proctor |date=Fall 1997 |title=The Nazi war on tobacco: ideology, evidence, and possible cancer consequences |journal=[[Bull Hist Med]] |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=435–88 |pmid=9302840 |doi=10.1353/bhm.1997.0139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930s Germany, scientific research for the first time revealed a connection between lung cancer and smoking, so the use of cigarettes and smoking was strongly discouraged by a heavy [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|government sponsored anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref name="PHCM252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2005|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Proctor RN |title=Commentary: Schairer and Schöniger's forgotten tobacco epidemiology and the Nazi quest for racial purity |journal=[[Int J Epidemiol]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=31–4 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11171846 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/1/31 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of modern tobacco control==
After the Second World War, the German research was effectively silenced due to perceived associations with Nazism.  However, the work of [[Richard Doll]] in the UK, who again identified the causal link between smoking and [[lung cancer]] in 1952, brought this topic back to attention. Partial controls and regulatory measures eventually followed in much of the developed world, including partial advertising bans, minimum age of sale requirements, and basic health warnings on tobacco packaging.  However, smoking prevalence and associated ill health continued to rise in the developed world in the first three decades following Richard Doll's discovery, with governments sometimes reluctant to curtail a habit seen as popular as a result - and increasingly organised disinformation efforts by the tobacco industry and their proxies (covered in more detail below).  Realisation dawned gradually that the health effects of smoking and tobacco use were susceptible only to a multi-pronged policy response which combined positive health messages with medical assistance to cease tobacco use and effective marketing restrictions, as initially indicated in a 1962 overview by the British [[Royal College of Physicians]]&lt;ref&gt;Royal College of Physicians "Smoking and Health.  Summary and report of the Royal College of Physicians of London on smoking in relation to cancer of the lung and other diseases"(1962)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States|1964 report of the U.S. Surgeon General]].

The 1964 report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General represented a landmark document that included an objective synthesis of the evidence of the health consequences of smoking according to causal criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anthony J. Alberg, Donald R. Shopland, K. Michael Cummings; The 2014 Surgeon General's Report: Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the 1964 Report of the Advisory Committee to the US Surgeon General and Updating the Evidence on the Health Consequences of Cigarette Smoking, ''American Journal of Epidemiology'', Volume 179, Issue 4, 15 February 2014, Pages 403–412, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwt335&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer in men and sufficient in scope that “remedial action” was warranted at the societal level. The Surgeon General report process is an enduring example of evidence-based public health in practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Comprehensive tobacco control==
The concept of multi-pronged and therefore 'comprehensive' tobacco control arose through academic advances (e.g. the dedicated Tobacco Control journal), not-for-profit advocacy groups such as [[Action on Smoking and Health]] and government policy initiatives. Progress was initially notable at a state or national level, particularly the pioneering smoke-free public places legislation introduced in New York City in 2002 and the Republic of Ireland in 2004, and the UK efforts to encapsulate the crucial elements of tobacco control activity in the 2004 'six-strand approach' (to deliver upon the joined-up approach set out in the white paper 'Smoking Kills'  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm41/4177/4177.htm |title=Smoking Kills. A White Paper on Tobacco |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=archive.official-documents.co.uk |publisher=HM Government [[The Stationery Office]] |access-date= |quote=published 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and its local equivalent, the 'seven hexagons of tobacco control'.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, Keith. [http://www.14wctoh.org/abstract/abstract/NCPA/10%20-%20March/1330%20-%201500%20hrs/West%20Room%201/56_6_Keith_Burnett_Mumbai.pdf "Empowering local action on international priorities; a framework for action on the ground"], ''14th World Conference on Tobacco or Health'', Mumbai, 2009. Accessed 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; This broadly organised set of health research and policy development bodies then formed the [[Framework Convention Alliance]] to negotiate and support the first international public health treaty, the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], or FCTC for short.

The FCTC compels signatories to advance activity on the full range of tobacco control fronts, including limiting interactions between legislators and the tobacco industry, imposing taxes upon tobacco products and carrying out demand reduction, protecting people from exposure to [[second-hand smoke]] in indoor workplaces and public places through [[smoking ban]]s, regulating and disclosing the contents and emissions of tobacco products, posting highly visible health warnings upon tobacco packaging, removing deceptive labelling (e.g. 'light' or 'mild'), improving public awareness of the consequences of smoking, prohibiting all tobacco advertising, provision of cessation programmes, effective counter-measures to smuggling of tobacco products, restriction of sales to minors and relevant research and information-sharing among the signatories.

WHO subsequently produced an internationally-applicable and now widely recognised summary of the essential elements of tobacco control strategy, publicised as the mnemonic [[MPOWER tobacco control]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/en/ "MPOWER"]. Accessed 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  The six components are:

:'''M'''onitor tobacco use and prevention policies
:'''P'''rotect people from tobacco smoke
:'''O'''ffer help to quit tobacco use
:'''W'''arn about the dangers of tobacco
:'''E'''nforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship
:'''R'''aise taxes on tobacco

In 2003, [[India]] passed the [[Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003]] restricted advertisement of tobacco products, banning smoking in public places and other regulation on trade of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandrupatla|first=Siddardha G.|last2=Tavares|first2=Mary|last3=Natto|first3=Zuhair S.|date=27 July 2017|title=Tobacco Use and Effects of Professional Advice on Smoking Cessation among Youth in India|journal=Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention: APJCP|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1861–1867|doi=10.22034/APJCP.2017.18.7.1861|issn=2476-762X|pmid=28749122|pmc=5648391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Bhutan]], passed the [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010]]  to regulate tobacco and tobacco products, banning the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco and tobacco products in Bhutan.

=== Tobacco Control Policies in United States ===

==== Age Restriction ====
Tobacco policies that limit the sale of cigarettes to minors and restrict smoking in public places are important strategies to deter youth from accessing and consuming cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Maria T. Botello-Harbaum, Denise L. Haynie, Ronald J. Iannotti, Jing Wang, Lauren Gase, Bruce Simons-Morton; Tobacco control policy and adolescent cigarette smoking status in the United States, ''Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research'', Volume 11, Issue 7, 1 July 2009, Pages 875–885,&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst youth in the United States, for example, when compared with students living in states with strict regulations, young adolescents living in states with no or minimal restrictions, particularly high school students, were more likely to be daily smokers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These effects were reduced when logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and cigarette price, suggesting that higher cigarette prices may discourage youth to access and consume cigarettes independent of other tobacco control measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Graphic Warning Labels ====
Smokers are not fully informed about the risks of smoking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hammond D, Fong GT, McNeill A'', et al.'' Effectiveness of cigarette warning labels in informing smokers about the risks of smoking: findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey ''Tobacco Control'' 2006;15:iii19-iii25.&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings that are graphic, larger, and more comprehensive in content are more effective in communicating the health risks of smoking. Smokers who noticed the warnings were significantly more likely to endorse health risks, including lung cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In each instance where labelling policies differed between countries, smokers living in countries with government mandated warnings reported greater health knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Amira Osman, James F Thrasher, Hua-Hie Yong, Edna Arillo-Santillin and David Hammond,Disparagement of health warning labels on cigarette packages and cessation attempts: results from four countries, ''Health Education Research'', 32, 6, (524), (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic warning labels on cigarette packs are noticed by the majority of adolescents, increase adolescents’ cognitive processing of these messages and have the potential to lower smoking intentions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sarah D. Kowitt, Kristen Jarman, Leah M. Ranney and Adam O. Goldstein, Believability of Cigar Warning Labels Among Adolescents, ''Journal of Adolescent Health'', 60, 3, (299), (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on extensive research of adolescents in the United States, the introduction of graphic warning labels has greatly reduced smoking among adolescents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==International collaboration==
The tobacco control community is internationally organized - as is its main opponent, the tobacco industry (sometimes referred to as 'Big Tobacco').  This allows for sharing of effective practice (both in advocacy and policy) between developed and developing states, for instance through the World Conference on Tobacco or Health held every three years.  However, some significant gaps remain, particularly the failure of the US and Switzerland (both bases for international tobacco companies and, in the former case, a tobacco producer) to ratify the FCTC.

==Reception==
Now an accepted element of the public health arena, tobacco control policies and activity are seen to have been effective in those administrations which have implemented them in a co-ordinated fashion. England, for instance, met its target to reduce its adult smoking prevalence to 21% or lower by 2010 through such an approach.&lt;ref&gt;HM Government [http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_111789.pdf "A Smokefree Future"], 2010. Accessed 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct and indirect opposition from the tobacco industry continue, for instance through the tobacco industry's efforts at misinformation via suborned scientists &lt;ref&gt;HM Government [http://www.globalink.org/tobacco/docs/secretdocs/whitecoat.shtml "Industry Recuritment of Scientific Experts"], Tobacco Industry Documents in the Minnesota Depository: Implications for Global Tobacco Control Briefing Paper No. 3 (February 1999) . Accessed 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'astroturf' counter-advocacy operations such as [[FOREST]].

==Journal==
''[[Tobacco Control (journal)|Tobacco Control]]'' is also the name of a journal published by [[BMJ Group]] (the publisher of the [[British Medical Journal]]) which studies the nature and implications of tobacco use and the effect of tobacco use upon health, the economy, the environment and society.  Edited by [[Ruth Malone]], Professor and Chair, Department of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, it was first published in 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14256">'''Transvaginal oocyte retrieval''' ('''TVOR'''), also referred to as '''oocyte retrieval''' ('''OCR'''), is a technique used in [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in order to remove [[oocyte]]s from the [[ovary]] of a woman, enabling [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] [[Extracorporeal|outside the body]].&lt;ref name=RCN2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Performing ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval: RCN guidance for fertility nurses |publisher=Royal College of Nursing |location=London |year=2004 |url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/publications/pdf/ultrasound-guided-oocyte-retrieval.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924190351/http://www.rcn.org.uk/publications/pdf/ultrasound-guided-oocyte-retrieval.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transvaginal oocyte retrieval is more properly referred to as '''transvaginal ovum retrieval''' when the oocytes have matured into [[Egg cell|ova]], as is normally the case in IVF.

==Procedure==
Under [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasound]] guidance, the operator inserts a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] through the vaginal wall and into an [[ovarian follicle]], taking care not to injure organs located between the [[vagina]]l wall and the ovary. The other end of the needle is attached to a [[Aspirator (medical device)|suction device]]. Once the follicle is entered, suction is gently applied to aspirate [[follicular fluid]] and with it, hopefully, cellular material including the oocyte. The follicular fluid is delivered to a technician in the IVF laboratory to identify and quantify the ova. Next, other follicles are aspirated. Once the ovarian follicles have been aspirated on one ovary, the needle is withdrawn, and the procedure repeated on the other ovary. It is not unusual to remove 20 oocytes as women are generally [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|hyperstimulated]] in advance of this procedure. After completion, the needle is withdrawn, and [[hemostasis]] is achieved. The procedure usually lasts 20{{ndash}}60 minutes.

Initially performed using [[Abdominal ultrasonography|transabdominal ultrasonography]], TVOR is currently performed with a [[gynecologic ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] transducer with an attached needle.&lt;ref name=Bates2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Killick |first=S |editor-last=Bates |editor-first=J |title=Practical gynaecological ultrasound |edition=2nd |chapter=Ultrasound and fertility |pages=120–5 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |year=2006 |isbn=9780521674508 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5PV2RWOl42EC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=%22Vaginal+ultrasound+is+the+method+of+choice%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vaginal%20ultrasound%20is%20the%20method%20of%20choice%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVOR is performed in an [[Operating theater|operating room]] or a physician's office, with the (female) subject in the [[lithotomy position]].

===Adjunctive procedures===
Follicular flushing has not been found to increase [[pregnancy rate]]s, nor result in an increase in oocyte yield. On the other hand, it requires a significantly longer operative time and more analgesia.&lt;ref name="Farquhar2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Rishworth|first2=J.

[[Semen|Seminal fluid]] contains several proteins that interact with epithelial cells of the [[cervix]] and [[uterus]], inducing active [[gestational immune tolerance]]. There are significantly improved outcomes when women are exposed to seminal plasma around the time of oocyte retrieval, with statistical significance for [[clinical pregnancy]], but not for ongoing pregnancy or [[live birth rate]]s with the limited data available.&lt;ref name="CrawfordRay2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crawford |first1=G. |last2=Ray |first2=A. |last3=Gudi |first3=A. |last4=Shah |first4=A. |last5=Homburg |first5=R. |title=The role of seminal plasma for improved outcomes during in vitro fertilization treatment: review of the literature and meta-analysis |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=21 |issue=2 |year=2014 |pages=275–284 |issn=1355-4786 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu052 |pmid=25281684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing==
TVOR is typically performed after [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]], where oocytes are pharmacologically stimulated to mature. When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, [[Ovulation induction#final maturation|induction of final oocyte maturation]] is performed, generally by an [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] or [[subcutaneous injection]] of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG).&lt;ref name=Stelling2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stelling JR, Chapman ET, Frankfurter D, Harris DH, Oskowitz SP, Reindollar RH |title=Subcutaneous versus intramuscular administration of humanchorionicgonadotropin during an in vitro fertilization cycle |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=881–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12749424 |pmc= |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(02)04918-X |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVOR is typically performed 34{{ndash}}36 hours after hCG injection, when the eggs are fully mature but just prior to [[ovulation|rupture of the follicles]].&lt;ref name=Stelling2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medscape2004&gt;{{cite web |last=Kovacs |first=P |title=HCG injection after ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate |publisher=Medscape |location= |year=2004 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
Injection of hCG as a trigger for ovulation confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]], especially in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] who have been hyperstimulated during previous assisted reproduction cycles.&lt;ref name=Oyawoye2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyawoye OA, Chander B, Hunter J, Gadir AA |title=Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome by Early Aspiration of Small Follicles in Hyper-responsive Patients With Polycystic Ovaries During Assisted Reproductive Treatment Cycles |journal=Medscape General Medicine |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=60 |year=2005 |pmc=1681679 |pmid=16369286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications of TVOR include injury to pelvic organs, [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], and infection. Occurring more often in lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hemorrhage after TVOR is a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication.&lt;ref name=Liberty2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liberty G, Hyman JH, Eldar-Geva T, Latinsky B, Gal M, Margalioth EJ |title=Ovarian hemorrhage after transvaginal ultrasonographically guided oocyte aspiration: a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication among lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=874–9 |year=2008 |pmid=19064264 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.028 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional complications may result from the administration of intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. These include [[asphyxia]] caused by [[airway obstruction]], [[apnea]], [[hypotension]], and [[pulmonary aspiration]] of stomach contents.

[[Propofol]]-based anesthetic techniques result in significant concentrations of propofol in follicular fluid. As propofol has been shown to have deleterious effects on oocyte fertilization (in a mouse model), some authors have suggested that the dose of propofol administered during anesthesia should be limited, and also that the retrieved oocytes should be washed free of propofol.&lt;ref name=Christiaens1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christiaens |first=F |last2=Janssenswillen |first2=C |last3=Verborgh |first3=C |last4=Moerman |first4=I |last5=Devroey |first5=P |last6=Van Steirteghem |first6=A |last7=Camu |first7=F |title=Propofol concentrations in follicular fluid during general anaesthesia for transvaginal oocyte retrieval |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=345–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10099976 |pmc= |doi=10.1093/humrep/14.2.345 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/345.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain airborne chemical contaminants and particles, especially [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC), may be toxic to and impair the [[Embryogenesis|growth and development]] of [[embryo]]s if present in sufficient concentrations in the ambient atmosphere of an IVF [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].&lt;ref name=Cohen1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen J, Gilligan A, Esposito W, Schimmel T, Dale B |title=Ambient air and its potential effects on conception in vitro |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=1742–9 |year=1997 |pmc= |pmid=9308805 |doi=10.1093/humrep/12.8.1742 |url=http://www.humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/8/1742.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen J, Gilligan A, Willadsen S |title=Culture and quality control of embryos |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=13 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=137–44 |year=1998 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_3.137 |url=http://www.humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/suppl_3/137.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This technique was first developed by Pierre Dellenbach and colleagues in [[Strasbourg]], France, and reported in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dellenbach P, Nisand I, Moreau L, Feger B, Plumere C, Gerlinger P, Brun B, Rumpler Y |title=Transvaginal, sonographically controlled ovarian follicle puncture for egg retrieval |journal=[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]]| pmid=6145902| volume=1 |date=June 30, 1984 |pages=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steptoe and Edwards used [[laparoscopy]] to recover oocytes when IVF was introduced, and laparoscopy was the major method of oocyte recovery until TVOR was introduced.

'''Vision Aid Overseas''' ('''VAO''') is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1081695}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]], which provides optical aid and services to developing countries in [[Africa]].

==History==
In 1985, a group of British [[optometrist]]s and dispensing [[optician]]s each took two weeks out of their businesses to establish clinics in [[Tanzania]], where they tested the eyes of local people and dispensed second-hand spectacles collected in UK. After the project gained publicity via the media and resultant public support, they formalised their efforts by registering the charity Vision Aid Overseas in 1987.&lt;ref name="StaFind"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stafffinders.co.uk/vision-aid/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=Stafffinders|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded on the delivery of direct service to patient, since registering as a charity, VAO has operated direct service clinics in 23 countries and tested the eyes of over 600,000 patients, helping over 350,000 people to see with a pair of spectacles.&lt;ref name="StaFind"/&gt;

In the 1997 [[New Year Honours 1997|New Years Honours]] list, founder Brian Ellis was awarded the [[MBE]].

==Operations==
VAO today focuses it operations around three core services:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionaidoverseas.smartchange.org/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=SmartChange|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Optical Training:''' Establish International Vision Centres where high quality spectacles can be manufactured and sold at an affordable price following a thorough eye examination
*'''Optical Workshop Development:''' Train local healthcare workers in practical eye testing and vision health skills that equips them to work as primary eyecare workers in their local communities
*'''Direct Service Deliver:''' Utilize the expertise of UK optical professionals who develop outreach services in areas away from existing facilities and who undertake teaching programmes across the developing world

VAO presently runs sustainable projects in five target countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[Malawi]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name="StaFind"/&gt;

===Support===
VAO Honorary Vice Presidents include competing newsreaders [[Fiona Bruce]] of the BBC, and [[Trevor MacDonald|Sir Trevor MacDonald]] of [[ITV News]]. In February 2005 Bruce did the voice over for VAO's Lifeline Appeal, and in 2007 launched VAO's Annual Review.

The charity has formalised its relationship with the UK eye care industry, and is often the chosen charity supported by many dispensing opticians, and professionals via the [[Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers]], who collect old spectacles from customers for [[recycling]] via VAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandacharity.co.uk/tag/vision-aid-overseas/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=Dollond &amp; Aitchison|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.selectspecs.com/info/vision-aid-overseas/|title=Supporting Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=SelectSpecs|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vision-Aid-Overseas-and-Specsavers/39396635209|title=Vision Aid Overseas and Specsavers|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity gained publicity in 2005 after the death of ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' game show host [[Richard Whiteley]]. After his death, his longtime partner [[Kathryn Apanowicz]] donated three pairs of Whiteley's spectacles to VAO, who sent them with a team of optical professionals to Ethiopia, where they were fitted to three locals with the same prescription. The [[BBC]] followed this story on their ''Inside Out'' programme, which was broadcast on 19 September 2007.

Public '''water supply and sanitation in England and Wales''' has been characterised by universal access and generally good service quality. Salient features of the sector in the United Kingdom compared to other developed countries is the full [[privatisation]] of service provision and the pioneering of independent economic regulation in the sector in Europe. There has been a substantial increase in real tariffs between 1989 and 2005, whilst independent assessments place the cost of water provision in the UK as higher than most other major countries in the EU. The government body responsible for water regulation, together with the water companies, have claimed improvements in service quality during the same period.

== Water resources and uses ==

On average, only about 10 percent of freshwater resources in England and Wales are abstracted. Water companies abstract almost half of this amount. The remainder is used for cooling power plants, other industries, fish farming and other uses. Water companies use mainly surface water (two thirds), but also groundwater (one third).

The amount of water available in England and Wales to meet the needs of people and to sustain the water environment varies greatly between different places and seasons, and from one year to another. Parts of Wales and the [[English Lake District]] are well endowed with water, while water is scarce in parts of Eastern and Southeastern England. Parts of England were affected by severe drought in 1976, 1995 and 2005-2007.&lt;ref&gt;BBC:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456972/html/nn1page1.stm Drought in England]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Environment Agency:[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO1208BPAS-e-e.pdf Water resources in England and Wales - current state and future pressures], December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Household water use in England and Wales stood at about 145 litres/capita/day in 2008/09.&lt;ref name="Household water use"&gt;Environment Agency:[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/data/112180.aspx Household water use in England and Wales, 1998/99 to 2008/09], accessed on October 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Total water supply for domestic and commercial customers in England and Wales was 14.5 million cubic metres per day in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK:[http://www.water.org.uk/home/resources-and-links/waterfacts/waterindustry Waterfacts: The water industry today], accessed on October 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of service ==

The quality of water and sanitation services in England and Wales is regularly and comprehensively monitored by the economic regulator, [[OFWAT]]. OFWAT statistics show that service quality has improved since the early 1990s, i.e. shortly after services were privatised. For example, the number of unplanned interruptions, properties at risk of low pressure, the share of complaints that were not answered within five days and combined sewer overflows have all declined, while sewage treatment works compliance has increased and river water quality has improved.&lt;ref name="OFWAT Facts and Figures"&gt;OFWAT: [http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/legacy/aptrix/ofwat/publish.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/water_regfacts_figs.pdf/$FILE/water_regfacts_figs.pdf Water industry facts and figures], June 2008, accessed on SEptember 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison with service quality in other areas of the European Union is difficult, since in few other countries such comprehensive water and sanitation service quality data are being published as it is being done by OFWAT.

Drinking water quality is also universally high, although isolated incidents where quality falls have occurred. For example, in June 2008 about 250,000 people in [[Northamptonshire]] were being told to boil tap water for drinking after routine tests by [[Anglian Water]] found [[cryptosporidium]]&lt;ref&gt;BBC:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/northamptonshire/7472619.stm Sickness bug found in tap water], 25 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==

Physical assets of private water and sanitation companies in England and Wales include 1,000 reservoirs, over 2,500 water treatment works and 9,000 sewage treatment works. More than 700,000 kilometres of mains and sewers are buried beneath the ground – that’s enough to stretch to the moon and back, or a distance 200 times greater than the UK’s entire motorway network.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK [http://www.water.org.uk/home/resources-and-links/waterfacts-2005/water-services-in-the-uk Water services in the UK], accessed on October 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===
[[Image:City of London Skyline from Canary Wharf - Sept 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Most of the population of [[London]] is served by [[Thames Water]], one of 10 private regional water and sewerage companies in England]]
Within the government the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has the responsibility for policy in the water and sanitation sector. The economic regulator of water companies in England and Wales is the Water Services Regulation Authority, [[OFWAT]]. The [[Environment Agency]] is responsible for environmental regulation, and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] for regulating drinking water quality. Drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards in the U.K., as in other countries of the [[European Union]], are determined by the EU (see [[EU water policy]]).

=== Service provision ===

{{details|United Kingdom water companies}}

In '''England and Wales''' water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 16 mostly smaller private "water only" companies.

== History and recent developments ==

=== Local government service provision (before 1973) ===

Before 1973 water and sanitation services were provided by water undertakings and sewerage and sewage disposal authorities respectively. Until the 1950s there existed over a thousand water undertakings, with administrative boundaries similar to those of local government boundaries. By the early 1970s their number had been reduced to 198 by a gradual consolidation process aimed at achieving [[economies of scale]]. Out of the 198 water undertakings 64 were run by individual local government authorities, 101 by joint boards comprising several local government authorities, and 33 were statutory privately owned water companies, some of which date back to the Victorian era. At the same time there were over 1,300 sewerage and sewage disposal authorities, most of them run by individual local government authorities. The sector thus was highly fragmented.

Water resources management was entrusted to 29 river authorities created in 1965. Their responsibilities included water conservation, land drainage, fisheries, control of river pollution and, in some cases, navigation.&lt;ref name="Vickers"&gt;Vickers, John and George Yarrow: Privatization:An Economic Analysis, MIT Press, 1988, Chapter 11: The Water Industry, p. 389-393&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public regional companies (1973–1989) ===

Through the Water Act 1973 the government established 10 Regional Water Authorities in order to achieve even greater economies of scale, especially in sanitation, compared to the prior gradual consolidation of water undertakings. The reform was also aimed at putting in practice the principle of integrated river basin management, especially concerning the planning of investments in wastewater treatment. Given the small size of many river basins in England and Wales, in practice the area covered by each of the Regional Water Authorities typically contained more than one river basin.&lt;ref name="Vickers"/&gt;

The Regional Water Authorities were not only in charge of water supply and sanitation, but also of water resources management, thus opening the possibility of conflicts of interest since the same institution was in charge of abstracting water and discharging wastewater on the one hand, and controlling these same abstractions and discharges on the other hand. The Water Act left open the possibility to contract out water supply and sanitation services to local authorities. However, in practice this did not happen, and substantial assets were transferred from local governments to the new water authorities. Since the transfer was internal to the public sector, no compensation was paid to local authorities. Local authorities also initially held a majority of the Board seats of the new organisations. The private statutory water companies, which provided water to 25% of the population, escaped reorganisation and were left to operate as before.&lt;ref name="Vickers"/&gt;

With the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 the water and sanitation sector initially remained public, but the government attempted to make the enterprises operate more along commercial lines. As a result, the number of employees in the sector declined from 61,000 in 1976 to 52,000 in 1985, real operating costs declined, tariffs were increased above the inflation rate and the share of self-financing of investments increased. However, government regulators also cut back on investments. While the industry became profitable, the rate of return on assets based on replacement cost values remained low at less than 2%. As part of the attempt to commercialise the service providers, the Water Act 1983 reduced the number of Board members of the water authorities. However, it also eliminated the local government representation on the Boards and made all Board members appointed by Ministers, thus further centralising the sector.&lt;ref name="Vickers"/&gt;

=== Privatisation (1989) ===

{{details|Water privatisation in England and Wales}}
In 1989 the government privatised the ten public regional water authorities through divestiture (sale of assets). The authorities' functions related to water resources management were separated and retained by the public sector. At the same time the regulatory agency [[OFWAT]] was created, following the model of infrastructure regulatory agency set up in other sectors such as telecommunications and energy.

===Water Industry Act 1999===
The Water Industry Act 1999 banned the disconnection of water and sewerage services for non-payment by domestic customers. It also allows the continuation of water charges based on rateable property value, as opposed to volumetric rates based on metering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Industry Act 1991, 1999 Summary|url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=19406&amp;id=19408|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (defra)|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail market for businesses===
From 1 April 2017, most businesses and organisations in England will be able to choose which company will supply their retail water services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-water.org.uk/ Open Water], accessed 21 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs ===

'''Tariff level'''. Water and sanitation tariffs in England and Wales have increased by 44% in real terms between 1989 and 2008–09 and are among the highest in the world. The average household water and sewage bill in England and Wales was £330 in 2008-09.&lt;ref name="OFWAT"&gt;OFWAT. 2008. [http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulating/prs_lft_factsandfigs.pdf Water industry facts and figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325004609/http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulating/prs_lft_factsandfigs.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 survey by NUS Consulting Group the average water tariff (price) without sewerage in the U.K. for large consumers was the equivalent of US$1.90 per cubic metre. This was the third-highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD countries covered by the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vewin.nl/SiteCollectionDocuments/.../2006WaterSurvey-NUS.pdf NUS Consulting]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, compared the average household water and sanitation bill (as opposed to the tariff per cubic metre that the NUS study used as a comparator) in four EU countries. This study showed that water bills in England and Wales were the highest among the four countries. Average water bills (excluding sanitation) were 295 euro per year in England and Wales, higher than in Germany, France (85 euro) or Italy (59 euro).

Taking into account differences in subsidies and service quality, the cost of supplying water at an equalised service level would be 84 euros in Germany, 106 euro in both France and England/Wales, and 74 euro in Italy.&lt;ref name="VEWA"/&gt; Concerning sanitation, unequalised tariffs are the highest in Germany at 111 euro per year, 93 euro in England and Wales, €90 in France and only €40 in Italy. Equalised costs net of subsidies are, however, highest in England and Wales with €138, followed by France (€122), Germany (119 euro) and Italy (85 euro).

'''Tariff structure and cross subsidies'''. Metered connections are charged at a volumetric rate, while unmetered connections are charged at a flat rate based on the rateable value of the property. The rateable value system was intended as a cross subsidy from wealthier to poorer households. However, since rateable values are often outdated, the subsidy is poorly targeted. Since more and more highly rated households opt for metering, flat rates for the remaining unmetered customers are being increased to compensate for the lost revenue. As a result, the already imperfect cross-subsidy system is unwinding. An Independent Report on Charging for Household Water and Sewerage Services published in 2009 by [[Anna Walker (civil servant)|Anna Walker]] recommended a package of help to ensure that "the transition to metering is not to cause real problems of affordability to those on low incomes".&lt;ref&gt;Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs:(Defra)[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/industry/walkerreview/documents/final-report-press-release.pdf Publication of Independent Final Report on Charging for Household Water and Sewerage Services], 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tariff review procedures''' Water and sanitation tariffs are regulated by OFWAT, which sets caps for tariff changes over five-year [[asset management plan period]]s. In the 2000–2005 review period OFWAT mandated an average annual reduction of tariffs of 1.6%. However, in the 2006–2010 review period it has allowed an average annual increase of 4.2%.&lt;ref name="OFWAT Facts and Figures"/&gt;

'''Affordability''' As a proportion of income, in England and Wales the cost of water and sewerage together works out at less than 1.5% of weekly earnings.&lt;ref name="Water UK Prices"/&gt; More details on tariffs in England and Wales are provided in OFWAT's annual reports on water and sewerage charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/content?id=4a1c34da-79ca-11dd-a587-f5f5d2040fe6 OFWAT Annual report on water and sewerage charges 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment and financing ===

Average annual investments in water and sewerage in England and Wales were £3.3 billion in 2000–2005 and £3.6bn in 2005–2010, according to OFWAT,&lt;ref name="OFWAT Facts and Figures"/&gt; which corresponds to £61 per capita per year.&lt;ref&gt;Based on 54 million inhabitants for England and Wales, in 2006-07 prices&lt;/ref&gt; According to the industry association Water UK, between 1980 and 2010 the water and wastewater industry in England and Wales will have invested over £88bn.&lt;ref name="Water UK"&gt;[http://www.water.org.uk/home/resources-and-links/waterfacts/waterindustry Water UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments are financed primarily through self-financing and borrowing in the capital market. In March 2006 overall borrowing stood at £23.5bn for England and Wales. Net returns on this borrowing in 2006 were 6.6%.&lt;ref name="Water UK"/&gt;

== Efficiency (water losses) ==

Efficiency of service provision has many dimensions, of which only one (water losses) is treated here.

According to OFWAT leakage in England and Wales has declined significantly from 228 litres/property/day in 1994-95 to 141 l/p/d in 2006–07, enough to supply the needs of 10 million people.&lt;ref name="OFWAT Facts and Figures"/&gt; According to the Environment Agency, many companies in the UK have reduced their water loss to the economic level of leakage. This is the level at which, in the long-term, the marginal cost of leakage control is equal to the marginal benefit of the water saved. The rate of reduction in leakage has slowed for many companies because the most obvious causes of leakage have been detected and addressed, leaving only less apparent leakage problems.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Agency [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/432430/432434/432451/446237/?version=1&amp;lang=_e] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111000456/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/432430/432434/432451/446237/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |date=January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Models have been developed and fine-tuned to assess the economic level of leakage. A summary of the debate on these models can be found in a recent report by OFWAT. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/legacy/aptrix/ofwat/publish.nsf/Content/navigation-leakage.html  OFWAT, Security of supply, leakage and water efficiency, 2006, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a comparative study commissioned by the German water industry association BGW average water losses in the distribution network in England and Wales have been estimated at 19 percent.  They are lower than in France (26 percent) or Italy (29 percent), but higher than in Germany, where they are apparently only 7 percent.&lt;ref name="VEWA"/&gt; The study states that its methodology allows for an accurate comparison, including water used to flush pipes and for firefighting. This is consistent with the International Water Association's definition of [[non-revenue water]], which includes authorised non-metered consumption such as for flushing and firefighting.

OFWAT does not use percentage figures when it assesses leakage levels. Also it assesses only leakage and not broader losses. It is thus difficult to compare figures from the comparative study cited above with OFWAT figures for England and Wales.

== Metering ==

A particularity of water tariffs in England and Wales is the low share of metering. Most users are not billed on a volumetric basis and have no financial incentive for water conservation. Since the 1990s efforts have been made to increase the share of household metering, which reached 33% in 2008 for the UK.&lt;ref name="Water UK Prices"/&gt; The Environment Agency would like to see 75% of households metered by 2025. Studies show that water meters lead to a 5-15% reduction in household water use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41229.aspx Environment Agency:Water metering]&lt;/ref&gt; Meters are typically only installed at the request of customers.

In 2006 the Environment Agency announced it favours compulsory metering in water-scarce southern England. The measure is controversial. Consumer groups fear it will penalise poorer families with lots of children, and the disabled, who use more water. The announcement also represents a U-turn for Labour, which fiercely opposed compulsory water meters when in opposition, describing them as a 'tax on family life'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money-savers/article.html?in_article_id=407318&amp;in_page_id=5 Water meters for millions?] by Sean Poulter, Daily Mail, 1 March 2006, quoting WaterWatch&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006 the company [[Folkestone &amp; Dover Water Services]] was granted the power to install compulsory water meters in a landmark ministerial ruling under which it was given 'water scarcity status' by Environment Minister [[Elliot Morley]]. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Morley said: 'In many parts of the country, water is a precious resource which we can no longer simply take for granted.' The company says that Folkestone and Dover are in one of the driest areas in the UK. Many parts of the Middle East had more rain than this area, and it is getting even drier and warmer due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=407323&amp;in_page_id=2 Water meters made compulsory].

== Environmental criticisms ==
In July 2011, the think tank [[Policy Exchange]] reported a significant decline in river quality due to abstraction carried out by water companies. The report calls for water companies to be charged more for using the most environmentally vulnerable rivers and aquifers in drier parts of the country, with cheaper rates where water is more abundant. It also called for higher water charges during droughts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/britains-rivers-being-ruined-by-demands-of-water-companies-2305993.html Britain's rivers 'being ruined by demands of water companies'], [[The Independent]], 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an investigation conducted by the [[BBC]]'s Panorama concluded that the operation of more than 20,000 Combined Sewer Overflow pipes (CSO) was leading to the routine spillage of untreated wastes around Britain's coastline, potentially leading to very dirty water around some of the most popular beaches in the UK. The CSOs, intended for use in very rare occasions, were not covered by the existing legislation for waste emissions.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8236000/8236957.stm Britain's Dirty Beaches], 7 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operational criticisms ==

A 2001 study by the [[Public Services International]] Research Unit, which is affiliated with trade unions and opposes privatisation, stated that 
* tariffs increased by 46% in real terms during 1990-2000
* operating profits have more than doubled (+142%) in eight years, between 1991-2000 
* investments were reduced and
* public health was jeopardised through cut-offs for non-payment.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David and Emanuele Lobina (PSIRU):[http://www.psiru.org/reports/2001-02-W-UK-over.doc UK Water privatisation - a briefing], February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
