'''Amager Boulevard''' is a street on [[Amager]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It It begins at [[Langebro|Langebro Bridge]] and initially follows [[Stadsgraven]] east to a Y-junction from where it continues inland to [[Amagerbrogade]] while the street '''Ved Stadsgraven''' contintues along the water to the [[Christmas Møllers Plads]].

==History==
[[File:Amager Boulevard 1915.jpg|thumb|200px|Amager Boulevard seen from Langebro in 1915]]
The southernmost portion of [[Christianshavns Enveloppe]], a low rampart in front of [[Christianshavns Vold]] and [[Stadsgraven]], was formerly located at the site where Amager Boulevard runs today. In front of it was a shallow-watered area. Amager's shoreline was then located approximately where Artillerivej runs today. In the 1880s, it was decided to build a new arsenal at the site as a replacement for [[Christian IV's Arsenal]] on [[Slotsholmen]] which had become too small. The southernmost portion of Christianshavns Enveloppe was removed and the area reclaimed and New Arsenal (Ny Tøjhus) was inaugurated in 1888. It was joined by the Army's Rifle Gactory in 1991 and the Army's Technical Corps in 1909.

Amager Boulevard was constructed in 1906-07. When the new [[Langebro]] was constructed in 1954, Amager Boulevard was connected directly to it by a ramp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianshavnernet.dk/RendezVous_Christianshavn/Minedepotet.html|title=Søminedepotet|language=Danish|website=christianshavnernet.dk|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Freissler''', aka '''Anton Freißler''' (March 13, 1838 in Klantendorf ({{lang-cs|Kujavy}}, [[Moravian–Silesian Region]]) – February 29, 1916) invented and developed a number of paternoster and elevators.

== Biography ==
[[Image:Anton Freissler P.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Oldest Paternoster in Austria by Freissler, installed in 1911]]
Freissler was born in [[Kujavy]] in northern Moravia, which was a part of Austrian empire. Freissler developed [[paternoster]]s and [[elevator]]s, which were sold very successfully throughout the empire and abroad. One of the oldest paternosters, installed in 1911, is still in use in the House of Industry in Vienna.

Freissler was also issued an [[imperial warrant]] as a Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Court.

The company existed until the 1970s until it was incorporated into [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]] Austria.

[[File:Stefanik Bratislava hl.s..JPG|thumb Stefanik Bratislava hl.s. |thumbnail|right|Restored armored train Štefánik]]

The '''Armored train Štefánik''' was a military train used during [[World War II]] (during the [[Slovak National Uprising]]) in [[Slovakia]].

The building of the armored train started on September 4, 1944. It was finished on September 18, 1944 in a Railway Manufacture in [[Zvolen]], [[Slovakia]].

It was equipped with:
* the 75mm Czechoslovak mountain [[cannon]] vz. 15 in a cannon carriage
* 2 37mm [[cannon]]s in a tank carriage
* 10 7.92mm machineguns

The [[commander]] of the train was Captain F. Adam, and his assistant was Lieutenant A. Tököly. The [[crew]] was 70 men. Its first action was on September 27, 1944 at the line [[Hronská Dúbrava]] – [[Kremnica]]. Near [[Stará Kremnička]] it was fighting against a [[Nazi Germany|German]] army advancing to [[Zvolen]]. When moving to [[Hronská Dúbrava]], the German [[Luftwaffe]] destroyed the train's [[locomotive]]. After repair, it successfully fought at [[Žiar nad Hronom]], [[Jalná]] and [[Hronská Dúbrava]], from where it moved on October 18, 1944 to [[Krupina]], where it fought against [[SS Schill]]. Two days later, it moved to [[Dobrá Niva]], where it was attacked several times by the German [[Luftwaffe]]. After a German attack on October 25, 1944 it left [[Zvolen]] as the last train, moved to [[Banská Bystrica]] and then moved to [[Ulmanka]], where it was blocked by a retired train. After discarding all weapons the crew continued fighting as a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] battalion.

A '''biodiversity hotspot''' is a [[Biogeography|biogeographic region]] with significant levels of [[biodiversity]] that is threatened with destruction. For example forests are considered as biodiversity hotspots.The Status is designated by Conservation International. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsienvis.nic.in/Database/Biodiversity-Hotspots-in-India_20500.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.conservation.org/How/Pages/Hotspots.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Myers]] wrote about the concept in two articles in “The Environmentalist” (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 8 187-208 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; 1990&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 10 243-256 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; revised after thorough analysis by Myers and others “Hotspots: Earth’s Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions”&lt;ref&gt;Russell A. Mittermeier, Norman Myers and Cristina Goettsch Mittermeier, ''Hotspots: Earth's Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions,'' Conservation International, 2000 {{ISBN|978-968-6397-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper published in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"/&gt;

To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers 2000 edition of the hotspot-map, a region must meet two strict criteria: it must contain at least 0.5% or 1,500 species of [[vascular plant]]s as [[Endemism|endemics]], and it has to have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Norman|last2=Mittermeier|first2=Russell A.|last3=Mittermeier|first3=Cristina G.|last4=da Fonseca|first4=Gustavo A.

==Hotspot conservation initiatives==
Only a small percentage of the total land area within biodiversity hotspots is now protected. Several international organizations are working in many ways to conserve biodiversity hotspots.
* [[Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund]] (CEPF) is a global program that provides funding and technical assistance to nongovernmental organizations and participation to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity including: biodiversity hotspots, high-biodiversity wilderness areas and important marine regions.
* The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has derived a system called the "[[Global 200|Global 200 Ecoregions]]", the aim of which is to select priority Ecoregions for conservation within each of 14 terrestrial, 3 freshwater, and 4 marine habitat types. They are chosen for their species richness, endemism, taxonomic uniqueness, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity.

'''Critiques of "Hotspots"'''

The high profile of the biodiversity hotspots approach has resulted in some criticism. Papers such as Kareiva &amp; Marvier (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kareiva, P. and M. Marvier (2003) ''Conserving Biodiversity Coldspots'', [[American Scientist]], 91, 344-351.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} have argued that the biodiversity hotspots:
* Do not adequately represent other forms of species richness (e.g. total species richness or threatened species richness).
* Do not adequately represent taxa other than vascular plants (e.g. vertebrates, or fungi).
* Do not protect smaller scale richness hotspots.
* Do not make allowances for changing [[land use]] patterns. Hotspots represent regions that have experienced considerable habitat loss, but this does not mean they are experiencing ongoing habitat loss. On the other hand, regions that are relatively intact (e.g. the [[Amazon Basin]]) have experienced relatively little [[land loss]], but are currently losing habitat at tremendous rates.
* Do not protect [[ecosystem services]].
* Do not consider [[phylogenetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daru | first1 = Barnabas H. | last2 = van der Bank | first2 = Michelle | last3 = Davies | first3 = T. Jonathan | year = 2014 | title = Spatial incongruence among hotspots and complementary areas of tree diversity in southern Africa | url = | journal = [[Diversity and Distributions]] | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1111/ddi.12290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent series of papers has pointed out that biodiversity hotspots (and many other priority region sets) do not address the concept of cost.&lt;ref&gt;Possingham, H. and K. Wilson (2005) ''Turning up the heat on hotspots'', [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 436, 919-920.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of biodiversity hotspots is not simply to identify regions that are of high biodiversity value, but to prioritize conservation spending. The regions identified include some in the developed world (e.g. the [[California Floristic Province]]), alongside others in the developing world (e.g. [[Madagascar]]). The cost of land is likely to vary between these regions by an order of magnitude or more, but the biodiversity hotspot designations do not consider the conservation importance of this difference. However, the available resources for conservation also tend to vary in this way.

'''"Buchmendel"''' is a 1929 short story by the Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]]. It tells the tragic story of an eccentric but brilliant [[book peddler]], Jakob Mendel, who spends his days trading in one of [[Vienna]]'s many [[coffeehouses]]. With his encyclopaedic mind and devotion to literature, the Poland-born Russian-Jewish immigrant is not only tolerated but liked and admired by both the owner of his local Café Gluck and the cultured Viennese clients with whom he interacts in the pre-war period. In 1915, however, he is falsely accused of collaborating with Austria's enemies and is dispatched to a [[concentration camp]]. On his return, towards the end of the war, everything has changed. His mind no longer remembers, his eyes can no longer read, the café undergoes new, brittle ownership, and his clientele have disappeared. Jacob Mendel finally dies, destitute, incapacitated and forgotten.

What initially reads as another of the many modest human dramas that Zweig made his speciality, this small tale actually has a far more panoramic sub-plot, for it is a metaphor of [[World War I]]'s impact on Viennese life and culture. It is also particularly interesting to the historian for understanding the strategies by which post-war writers re-imagined pre-war Vienna, how they conceptualised the war itself, and how memory and myth deeply influenced their conception of history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Botswana]]'''. It is one of a few [[democracies]] which continue to enforce it. The death sentence is usually issued upon [[murder]] under aggravated circumstances and is carried out by [[hanging]]. There is on average one execution per year, and the execution usually takes place few years after trial. One execution was carried out in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two so far{{when|date=November 2018}} in 2018.

A widely recognized case was that of [[Mariette Bosch]], a [[South African]] [[immigrant]] who was sentenced to death for murdering her lover's wife. She was sentenced in 1999 and executed two years later, one of the few white women ever officially executed in [[Africa]].

'''Cerise''' (French for "cherry") was a [[France|French]] military [[reconnaissance satellite]]. Its main purpose was to intercept [[HF radio]] signals for French intelligence services.&lt;ref name=nssdc20090816&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx501.html |title=SPACEWARN Bulletin Number 501 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kg, it was launched by an [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane rocket]] from [[Kourou]] in [[French Guiana]] at 17:23 UT, 7 July 1995.&lt;ref name=nssdc20090816/&gt; Cerise's initial orbital parameters were [[Orbital period|period]] 98.1 min, [[apogee]] 675&amp;nbsp;km, [[perigee]] 666&amp;nbsp;km, and [[inclination]] 98.0 deg.&lt;ref name=nssdc20090816/&gt;

It was hit by a catalogued [[space debris]] object from an [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane rocket]] in 1996, making it the first verified case of an accidental collision between two artificial objects in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4486049.stm |title=CO2 prolongs life of space junk |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=8 March 2006 |date=5 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision tore off a 2.8-2.9 metre (9.2-9.5 foot) portion of Cerise's [[gravity-gradient stabilization]] boom, which left the satellite severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations |url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/SatelliteFragHistory/TM-2008-214779.pdf |publisher=NASA Orbital Debris Program Office |pages=368–369 |date=June 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''European Ramblers Association''' - ERA; Europäische Wandervereinigung – EWV; Fédération Européenne de la Randonnée Pédestre - FERP is a network organisation working for promotion of walking, creating trails, exchange of the know-how over the borders and secure the rights of free access to nature for the walkers. Through this work, ERA also cares for protecting and developing of European cultural heritage and for strengthening of mutual understanding between European citizens.

Already at the beginning of its existence, ERA started creating a network of [[European long-distance paths]] maintained by its member organisations to make it possible to walk all over Europe on foot to strengthen the connection people to people over the borders. From 2017 the network consists of 12 '''E-paths''' and covers more than 70.000&amp;nbsp;km crisscrossing Europe. An E-path is a long-distance path crossing a minimum of 3 European countries. Marking and maintenance of the path is the responisiblity of the member organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.era-ewv-ferp.com/walking-in-europe/e-paths/ | title=What are "E-Paths"? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To bring walkers in Europe together, ERA organizes every 5 years a pan-European walking event '''EURORANDO'''. Next edition is in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.era-ewv-ferp.com/events/eurorando-2021/ | title=EURORANDO 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to secure a high standard of European paths, ERA developed a transparent system of criteria for the improvement of trail quality: '''Leading Quality Trails – Best of Europe'''. These criteria assess the trail surface format, the marking, signposting and network with other walking trails. Part of the criteria is also the service for walkers along the trail or access points for a transport.

The '''Leading Quality Trails (LQT)''' are certified walking routes in Europe. Certification is only available for complete trails. Prerequisite is a distance of at least 50km with three daily stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.era-ewv-ferp.com/programs/lqt/ | title=Leading Quality Trails - Best of Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, through its programme '''Walk Leader''' ERA provides certification for the training of voluntary walk leaders performed by its member organisations.

ERA was founded in 1969. In 2018 its members are 58 walking organisations from 33 different European countries representing more than 3 mill registered walkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.era-ewv-ferp.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumenter/Organisation/Conferences/2018_Echternach/2018_Meeting_documents.pdf | title= Meeting documents ERA 49th General Meeting | page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">The '''European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation''' (ETRTO) exists to specify and harmonise sizes of rims and their associated [[pneumatic tyre]]s across the [[European Union]].  ETRTO sizes apply to rims for vehicles of all types, including bicycles.  The great advantage of ETRTO sizing is that it is unambiguous; previously, nominal dimensions were used which were interpreted in different ways by different countries and manufacturers - a problem for the end user.

ETRTO works in liaison with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] to develop relevant standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/about/organizations_in_liaison/organizations_in_liaison_details.htm?id=9056&amp;LiaisonList=True List of ISO committees in liaison with ETRTO]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referred to as [[Financial compensation|compensation]] for the "transfer of the place of business", remuneration for taking over functions, [[Asset|assets]], risks and [[Customer base|contracts with customers]], payment for the take-over of part of the business, remuneration for the transfer of production and sales capabilities or transfer of profit potential.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czerwiński|first=Marcin|last2=Wieśniak-Wiśniewska|first2=Anna|date=2016|title=Glosa do wyroku NSA z dnia 5 kwietnia 2016 r., II FSK 308/14|url=https://borg.wolterskluwer.pl/|journal=LEX/el.|volume=|pages=|via=Wolters Kluwer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationaltaxreview.com/Article/3132162/Business-restructuring-Exit-charges-for-restructurings-in-Europe.html|title=Business restructuring: Exit charges for restructurings in Europe {{!}} International Tax Review|website=www.internationaltaxreview.com|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligation to pay the exit fee corresponds to the responsibility of the other party to cease a certain type of economic activity and it is often linked to other types of benefits, such as the transfer of [[ownership]] of [[Production machinery|production machines]] or the transfer of [[industrial property rights]] or [[know-how]]. However, the fee for these assets is usually calculated separately, so in reality it is a remuneration for the transfer of functions or risks excluding assets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:IBAS - G3.png|right|thumb|300px|[[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]]]]
[[File:IBSA-leaders-2011.jpg|thumb|300px|Pretoria (South Africa) - [[Dilma Rousseff]], [[President of Brazil]], [[Jacob Zuma]], [[President of South Africa]] and [[Manmohan Singh]], [[Prime Minister of India]] pose for photo.]]
The '''IBSA Dialogue Forum''' ([[India|'''I'''ndia]], [[Brazil|'''B'''razil]], [[South Africa|'''S'''outh '''A'''frica]]) is an international tripartite grouping for promoting [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] among these countries. It represents three important poles for galvanizing [[South-South cooperation]] and greater understanding between three important continents of the developing world namely, Africa, Asia and South America. The forum provides the three countries with a platform to engage in discussions for cooperation in the field of agriculture, trade, culture, and defence among others.

The IBSA Dialogue Forum plays an increasingly important role in the foreign policies of [[Foreign relations of India|India]], [[Foreign relations of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Foreign relations of South Africa|South Africa]]. It has become instrumental for promoting ever closer coordination on global issues between three large multicultural and multiracial democracies of Asia, South America and Africa, and contributed to enhancing trilateral India-Brazil-South Africa cooperation in sectoral areas.

==Origin==
After the failperation between India (South Asia), Brazil (South America) and South Africa. The Declaration at the trilateral meeting in [[Brasilia]], called for removing protectionist policies and trade distorting practices by improving the multilateral trade system.

On 6 June 2003, [[Yashwant Sinha]] (External affairs minister of India), [[Celso Amorim]] (Foreign minister of Brazil) and [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]] (Foreign minister of South Africa) met in Brasilia, where the IBSA Dialogue forum was formalized through the adoption of the "Brasilia Declaration".&lt;ref name=aboutibsa&gt;{{cite web|title=About IBSA |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/about_us.html |accessdate=17 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913163515/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/about_us.html |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBSA Dialogue forum facilitates regular consultations at senior officials level, government (summit) levels as well as amongst academics, intellectuals and other members of the [[civil society]].&lt;ref name=aboutibsa/&gt; By some experts, it is also seen as an endeavor to challenge the international system by Pivotal Middle Powers through peaceful convincing, instead of other means.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sam.gov.tr/perceptions/volume%20xi/spring/mehmetozkan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brasilia Declaration===
[[File:IBSA-leaders.jpg|thumb|250px|Indian PM [[Manmohan Singh]] with South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during the IBSA Summit, 2007.]]
On 6 June 2003, the Brasilia declaration was signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa. They agreed on the urgent need for reforms in the United Nations, especially the [[Security Council]]. The declaration was of the view that the United Nations Security Council should reflect the current world scenario. It also touched upon the subjects of [[international terrorism]], trans-national crime and illegal arms dealing, stating that such threats to international peace must effectively tackled with respect for the sovereignty of States and for International Law.&lt;ref name=brasilia&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasilia Declaration |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/brasil_declaration.htm |accessdate=17 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915141009/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/brasil_declaration.htm |archivedate=15 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministers highlighted their priorities on promotion of social equity and inclusive growth by reiterating the need for tackling hunger and poverty by means of effective implementation of government schemes. The declaration also highlights the need for promoting family-run farms, [[food security]], health, education, human rights and [[environmental protection]]. They recalled that social empowerment makes better use of human potential, contributing to economic development in a significant manner.&lt;ref name=brasilia/&gt; The ministers also stressed the importance of elimination of [[racial discrimination]] and [[gender bias]] while framing

While welcoming the benefits that have been achieved through [[globalization]] and free market trade in the developing countries, the ministers expressed their concerns that a large part of the world has not benefited from it. In this context, they reiterated their commitment to pursue and implement policies which are inclusive, integrative and equitable. Toward this end, they reaffirmed their stand to carry out negotiations on [[Doha Development Round|Doha round of talks]], through which the developed countries might eliminate some of their protectionist and trade-distorting practices, thereby providing a level playing field for the developing countries in the field of international trade.&lt;ref name=brasilia/&gt;

The Ministers recommended to their respective Chiefs of State and/or Government the convening of a summit-level meeting of the three countries. They also decided to further intensify dialogue at all levels, when needed, to organize meetings of top officials and experts responsible for issues of mutual interest. They agreed to hold regular meetings and dialogues on issues of common interest. They further agreed to establish a Trilateral Joint Commission. The Foreign Ministries will be the pivots of the Trilateral Joint Commission and the meetings will be co-chaired by the three Foreign Ministers. The secretariat facilities shall be coordinated by the Secretary in charge of this area in the Foreign Ministry of the host country.&lt;ref name=brasilia/&gt;

==Objectives==
The IBSA Dialogue Forum aims to promote South-South cooperation and build consensus on issues of international importance. It also aims at increasing the trade opportunities among the three countries, as well as facilitate the trilateral exchange of information, technologies and skills to complement each other strengths. Subsequently, it promotes the international [[poverty alleviation]] and [[social development]] with main focus being on equitable development. It also aims to explore avenues to promote cooperation in broad range of areas, which include agriculture, [[climate change]]/[[global Warming]], culture, [[Defense (military)|defence]], education, energy, health, [[information society]], [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]], [[social development]], trade and investment, tourism and transport.&lt;ref name=aboutibsa/&gt;

==Areas of cooperation==

===Agriculture===
A Joint Development Project has been undertaken in [[Guinea Bissau]]. It aims to improve production, promote and develop small-scale agro-industry. It also seeks to improve and diversify horticultural crops. IBSA Ministers of Agriculture met in Rome on 22 November 2005 on the margins of a [[FAO]] Conference. This was followed by a meeting of IBSA Senior Officials in Agriculture in New Delhi on 18 &amp; 19 January 2006. The meeting discussed a preparation of a draft [[Memorandum of Understanding]] which provides for development of plans for research and capacity building.&lt;ref name=areacoop&gt;{{cite web|title=Areas of Cooperation |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/areas_cooperation.htm |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913025432/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/areas_cooperation.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The three countries have recognised Education as a vital instrument for achieving social equity. India is the lead country in the education sector.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt; Three major areas of cooperation have been identified for collaboration namely, Open and [[distance education]], higher and professional education and finally, universal education with focus on [[gender equality]]. Each of the three countries are to host one Round Table conference on one of the themes. India chose universal education, Brazil chose higher and professional education while South Africa chose open and distance education.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt;

===Energy===
The working group aims to promote clean and efficient sources of energy such as [[Biofuel|bio-fuels]]. It also gives an opportunity to exchange information about renewable energy and use of [[non-conventional energy]] sources.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt;

===Science &amp; technology===
Science &amp; technology has been identified as one of the key areas of tri-lateral cooperation. The following is a list of approved areas of research cooperation and the corresponding lead countries:
*HIV/AIDS and [[Nanotechnology]]- India
*[[Malaria]] and [[Oceanography]]- Brazil
*[[Tuberculosis]] and [[Biotechnology]]- South Africa
Activities in each area are implemented by Area coordinators, who are experts in their respective disciplines. Workshops in the above-mentioned disciplines have been held in the three countries regularly.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt;

===Trade===
The IBSA economic ministers met in New Delhi in March 2005 and agreed on a mechanism to identify and eliminate non-tariff barriers which impede mutual trade.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt; Some of the mechanisms considered include customs cooperation, sharing of expertise in the field of energy, agriculture, [[food processing]], tourism and financial and banking services. It has been decided to promote cooperation in the [[Small and medium enterprise|SME]] sector. For this purpose, common terms of reference have been developed which can aid in development of this sector. As, all the three countries have a large number of small-scale enterprises, it is expected that cooperation in this sector can have profound development implications.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt;

===Transport===
The Working group aims at cooperation between the three countries in the areas of air link expansions, training and knowledge exchange in airports and airspace management, port management, including capacity building in [[shipbuilding]]. Discussions on air and maritime agreements are also being considered. Development of trans-shipment facilities for creation of a South-South highway, which integrates sub-regional connection between [[Mercosur]], [[Southern African Customs Union]] and Indian regions, is a priority area for the Working group.&lt;ref name=areacoop/&gt;

==Declarations and communiqué==

===New Delhi agenda for cooperation===
Yashwant Sinha, Celso Amorim and Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa respectively, met in New Delhi on 4 and 5 March 2003 for the first meeting of the Trilateral Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The following issues were discussed:

====United Nations reforms====
The ministers were of the view that the current composition of the UN Security Council is not representative of the current world scenario. They highlighted the need for bringing about reforms which would make the Security council reflect the contemporary realities. Toward this end, they emphasised the need for expansion of Security council membership in the permanent as well as non-permanent categories.&lt;ref name=ndcoop&gt;{{cite web|title=New Delhi declaration |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/n_delhi_agen_annexure_c.htm |accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913163243/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/n_delhi_agen_annexure_c.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peace and security====
The ministers took stock of the global security situation and renewed their commitments towards non-proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. They agreed to intensify their cooperation at the [[IAEA]] with a view to ensure growth and development of use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under appropriate safeguards. On the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine issue]], the three countries urged an early resumption of dialogue on the basis of UN Security council resolutions, [[Arab League]] peace Initiative and the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] roadmap. They reaffirmed their support to the settlement postulated in the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1937|UN Security Council Resolution 1397]] of two sovereign states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secured and recognised borders.&lt;ref name=ndcoop/&gt;

The three countries also had common views with respect to [[Iraq]]. They stressed the need to maintain the unity &amp; integrity of Iraq and called for transfer of full sovereignty to the Iraqi people. They were of the view that United Nations need to play a vital role in this context. They also emphasised the urgency of reconstruction in Iraq under a democratically elected sovereign government.&lt;ref name=ndcoop/&gt;

====Social Development====
The three countries recognised the need to put people in the centre of development. Toward this end, the ministers emphasised the need to formulate people-centric policies which would ensure equitable development. As the three countries have a rich cultural history, strengthening of cultural ties by organising a trilateral cultural fair of music, dance and cinema in Brazil was also discussed.&lt;ref name=ndcoop/&gt; Recalling the Brasilia declaration, the ministers agreed upon the sharing of expertise in diverse areas such as food security, health, education, human rights etc. The Ministers also endorsed a proposal by Brazil to host a seminar on "Economic Growth with Social Equity" with the aim to promote better knowledge among IBSA members of their national policies and strategies to promote economic and social development.&lt;ref name=ndcoop/&gt;

===Cape Town ministerial communiqué===
The foreign ministers of the three countries met in Cape Town on 10 and 11 March 2005 for the second meeting of the Trilateral Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The following issues were discussed:

The ministers emphasised that South-South cooperation was essential for achievement of MDGs and they reaffirmed their cooperation under the auspices of IBSA to achieve these targets.&lt;ref name=capetown&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town Ministerial Communiqué |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/cape_town_ministerial.htm |accessdate=2007-09-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914120518/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/cape_town_ministerial.htm |archivedate=14 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Partnership for Africa's Development====
The ministers resolved to support the economic development of the African Union and strengthen the IBSA partnership in the implementation of New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Numerous opportunities exist in the fields of trade &amp; commerce, energy, education, health and the ministers pledged to explore opportunities for trilateral cooperation in these areas.&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt;

====Latin and South American integration====
The ministers expressed their support for creation of an Asian-African business summit which would focus on promoting and strengthening the African private sector. They also made a decision to explore ways for closer cooperation with South America. The ministers also welcomed the efforts towards integration in the Latin America and Caribbean region and in this regard recognised the significance of the creation of the South American Community of Nations (CASA).&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt;

====World trade organisation====
The ministers agreed to intensify their cooperation in the WTO multilateral trade negotiations in the lead-up to the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]] held in Hong Kong.

In the context of Information Technology, the ministers were of the view that their governments had many [[e-governance]] schemes which had many similarities, because of which they might share some information, best practices and identify projects for cooperation.&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt;

The ministers agreed for strengthening consultations between the Ministries and Departments of Agriculture in support of IBSA and G-20 trade consultation processes. They decided that a meeting of IBSA experts would be convened in India to define areas for research and training in the field of agriculture.&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt; The ministers welcomed the launch of IBSA Business Council, which would work in tandem with the Working group jointly in the areas such as Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises. With regard to promote tourism between the three countries, a mechanism is being explored to examine the possibility of visa waiver or the issuing of visas on arrival for IBSA nationals.&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt; Apart from this cooperation in various other sectors were also explored during this meeting.

====IBSA facility for hunger and poverty alleviation====
The Ministers reviewed the progress made with regard to the operationalisation of the ''IBSA Facility for Hunger and Poverty Alleviation''. They also agreed to commit an additional amount of US$ 1 million to the IBSA fund and launch of the facility in [[Guinea-Bissau]], which they hoped would raise the profile of the fund amongst private sector and members of [[civil society]]. The Ministers agreed that IBSA would approach the Palestinian Authority with an offer to assist it with its reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name=capetown/&gt;

===Rio de Janeiro ministerial communiqué===
[[Anand Sharma]], Celso Amorim and Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa respectively, met in Rio de Janeiro on 30 March 2006 for the third meeting of the Trilateral Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The following issues were raised and discussed:

====United Nations reforms====
The IBSA countries exchanged their views on UN security council reforms and reiterated their stand that representation of developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America as permanent members in the council was essential. They welcomed the creation of [[Peacebuilding commission]] and [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], adding further that now UN reform process must include Security Council reform.&lt;ref name=riocoop&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio de Janeiro declaration |url=http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/rioministerial.htm |accessdate=2007-09-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913163421/http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org/rioministerial.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control====
The ministers were of the view that multilateral institutions established under various disarmament agreements should be the primary mechanism to achieve the desired objective of disarmament and non-proliferation. They agreed to continue cooperation at IAEA and other forums with regard to peaceful use of atomic energy under suitable safeguards. They also agreed to consider enhancing international civilian nuclear cooperation, with other nations who share similar objectives of non-proliferation. The ministers also hoped for a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear program, within the context of IAEA.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

====International trade====
The ministers emphasised the need to unite on the issue of Doha round of negotiations. This is supported by increased consultations, by IBSA delegations, in order to strengthen [[NAMA (WTO)|Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA)]], as well as the establishment of the [[NAMA-11]] whose two main principles are supporting flexibilities for developing countries and balance between NAMA and other areas under negotiation.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt; The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH)]] Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade|Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT)]].&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

====IBSA facility fund for hunger and poverty alleviation====
The fundamental character IBSA fund is to disseminate the best practices in alleviation of poverty and hunger. The ministers reaffirmed the importance of participation of institutions— governmental as well as non-governmental—in projects financed by the fund. They also recommended that UNDP, as an administrator of the fund, find means to make it possible.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

The ministers also received and accepted the recommendations of Technical Monitoring Committee (TMC) to Guinea Bissau. It urged the UNDP Office in Bissau to work closely with the UNDP Special Unit for South-South Cooperation in New York, the Coordinator of the project and the Guinean Bissau national authorities. The ministers agreed with the committee's recommendation of signing additional agreements with UNDP in order to clarify rights and obligations of both parties.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

====IBSA sectoral cooperation====
The member countries made a pledge to promote the production and use of biofuels as a clean and ecofriendly alternative. More emphasis will be placed on exchange of information in areas of energy conservation and hydrogen energy. The ministers stressed the need to boost trade relations among the three nations. Keeping this in perspective, they expressed their satisfaction that Mercosur will be proposing to Southern African Customs Union and India the creation of a Working Group to explore the modalities of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (T-FTA) among them. Specific areas of agriculture have also been identified for trilateral cooperation. These include research and capacity building, agricultural trade, rural development and poverty alleviation.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

====IBSA trade and investment forum====
The attending delegations were of the opinion that trade relations between the three nations can strengthen the South-South union. Substitution of imports from northern countries by imports from southern countries was suggested as a feasible solution towards attaining the said objective. Logistics, custom procedures, lack of information and distances were identified as main barriers which needed to be eliminated for the trilateral trade to flourish.&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

The logistics problem was sought to be solved by suggestion of a study to further address the issue. Problems regarding customs procedures were sought to be tackled by ensuring more cooperation among the governmental institutions in order to simplify many regulations and streamlining the process. The private sector was also of the view that number of flights between India, Brazil and South Africa need to be increased, which eliminate the barrier of distances and lack of information no problem..&lt;ref name=riocoop/&gt;

The '''International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association''' ('''IBMA''') is the worldwide association of the [[biocontrol]] industry, with its head office in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/team Webpage IBMA Team 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The association sponsors the [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]] held in [[Basel]], Switzerland.

== History ==
In 1995, the IBMA was founded in [[Brighton]] (England), whose founding president was [[Bernard Blum]]. In his honour the Bernard Blum Award was launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/bernard-blum-award Webpage Bernard-Blum-Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728184804/http://www.ibma-global.org/en/bernard-blum-award |date=2016-07-28 }} requested on 27. July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBMA presidents have been: Michel Guillon, Denise Munday, Owen Jones and Willem Ravensberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/upload/attach-image/ibmanewsletterabim2015.pdf Information of Willem Ravensberg concerning IBMA-Presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The association sees itself representing the manufacturers of biocontrol products mainly within the [[European Union]], the OECD, and FAO.

In workshops, the experiences of the members is to be exchanged, in particular at the annual [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting|ABIM Congress]] in [[Basel]].

In contrast to the chemical crop protection industry (Agricultural Industry Association) the IBMA members produce [[Bioeffector]]s, i.e. botanicals, pheromones, invertebrate biocontrol agents and micro-organisms as a basis for plant protection products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/professional-groups IBMA product groups]&lt;/ref&gt; These biocontrol products against plant diseases and pests are created that can be used in the organic production of food as well as in IPM production systems.

Although the products sold produce general Pflanzenvitalisierung, so the aim of the group is yet to fight specific diseases and pests in plants and food production with biological systems. In European politics promotion of organic vegetable production increases greatly. The organization makes a significant contribution with their members' products.

The '''International Scientific Optical Network''' or '''ISON''' ({{lang-ru|Международная научная оптическая сеть, Пулковская кооперация оптических наблюдателей}}) is an international project, currently consisting of about 30 telescopes at about 20 observatories in about ten countries (Russia, Ukraine ([[Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory|Andrushivka]]), Georgia ([[Georgian National Astrophysical Observatory|Abastumani]]), Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Moldova, Spain ([[Teide Observatory|Teide]]), Switzerland ([[Zimmerwald Observatory|Zimmerwald]]), Bolivia (Tarija), USA ([[RAS (Remote Astronomical Society) Observatory of New Mexico|Mayhill]]), Italy (Collepardo))&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2009/Orbital_Debris/Molotov.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which have organized to detect, monitor and track objects in space. Other observatories include the "ISON-Kislovodsk Observatory", located near [[Kislovodsk]], North Caucasus, Russia, with the observatory code [[IAU code#D00–D99|D00]].

ISON is managed by the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]], part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Al-Rodhan2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Rodhan|first=Nayef R.F. R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2190">'''Kreće se lađa francuska''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Креће се лађа француска}}; [[English language|English]]: ''The French Boat is Sailing'') is a Serbian war song from the [[First World War]], first sung in a [[Salonika]] harbor, where the Serbian army was recuperating after a long and painful withdrawal through the Albanian mountains. The author of the original text of the poem is Serbian officer colonel [[Branislav Milosavljević]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Branislav Milosavljević]], ''Mač i lira'' [Sword and Lyre], [[Brod na Savi]] 1922, p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; The song was frequently performed in both [[France]] and [[Serbia]] after the war and is commonly used as a symbol of Serbian and French friendship.

==Lyrics==
Silno je more duboko,      (Mighty is the deep sea)&lt;br&gt;
Duboko, plavo široko.      (Deep, blue and wide)&lt;br&gt;
Nigde mu kraja videti,     (Its end is nowhere in sight)&lt;br&gt;
Ne mogu misli podneti.     (I cannot bear the thought.)

Kreće se lađa francuska,   (The French ship is departing) &lt;br&gt;
Sa pristaništa solunska,   (From the harbor of Salonika)&lt;br&gt;
Transport se kreće srbadi, (Transport of Serbs moves)&lt;br&gt;
Ratnici, braća bolesni.    (Warriors, wounded brothers)

Svaki se vojnik borio,     (Every soldier fought)&lt;br&gt;
U rovu slavu slavio,       (And celebrated his [[slava]] in the trench)&lt;br&gt;
Srećan se Bogu molio,      (He prayed to God happily)&lt;br&gt;
Da bi se kući vratio.      (Hoping to return home)

Polazim tužan, bolestan,   (I depart sad and ill)&lt;br&gt;
Pomislih: Bože, nisam sam, (Thought: "God, I am not alone")&lt;br&gt;
I moja braća putuju,       (My brothers are traveling too)&lt;br&gt;
Da sa mnom skupa tuguju. (To mourn, together, with me)

Radosti nema ni za tren,   (There is no joy even for a moment)&lt;br&gt;
Naiđe švapski sumaren,     (For a Kraut sub is approaching)&lt;br&gt;
Svi mole svetog Nikolu,    (And all pray to [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]])&lt;br&gt;
Njegovu silu na moru.      (For his force at sea)

The name is derived from the word [[wikt:melomania|melomania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latviansonline.com/reviews/article/1821/ |title=Instrumental cello rock may not be for all |first=Andris |last=Straumanis |date=February 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929022520/http://latviansonline.com/reviews/article/1821/ |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cello Trio Melo-M 2013.jpeg|thumb|Melo-M in 2013]]
They are known for their instrumental cover versions of various [[English language]] songs, most notably "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]", the theme from "[[Mission Impossible]]" and the [[Ghostbusters (song)|theme from ''Ghostbusters'']]. Cello trio Melo-M emerged in 2005 when academically trained musicians Karlis Auzans, Miķelis Dobičins and Janis Pauls decided to unite their musical talents and create a band.
 
Melo-M play cello versions of variety of well-known music: from classical to ethno, pop and rock.
 
The trio released four LPs so far: self-entitled Melo-M album (2005) consisting of cello covers of popular Latvian songs, Singalongs (2007) with their interpretations of world’s modern classics, Around The World (2009) – an album of ethno and world music melodies covered by the band and Phantasy Of The Opera (2010). All four albums were entirely produced by founder of Melo-M Karlis Auzans.
 
Melo-M are also well known outside Latvia. Throughout eight years of their musical career the band toured in USA twice, played a variety of concerts in Russia, France, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Turkey and elsewhere.
 
Melo-M shared the stage with such artists as vocalist of Boney M Maizie Williams, Swedish multi-instrumentalist Robert Wells, Finnish metal band Apocalyptica, popular Latvia-born singer Laima Vaikule, legendary composer Raimonds Pauls and many more.
 
The band has a rich experience in classical music: they played a number of concerts with symphonic orchestras and collaborated with famous Latvian dance ensemble Dzirnas while working on modern theatre play called Apstājies! Classical concerts of Melo-M often include soprano singer Sonora Vaici.
 
In 2009, Canadian skater Jeremy Ten included Melo-M cover of The Beatles song Come Together in his skating program.
 
Melo - M are laureates of first Terem Crossover Competition (bronze medal) in 2010 Saint Petersburg, Russia.
 
Every band member has a significant academic music background. Each of the three played at international contests and performed with orchestras at notable symphonic music concerts. Melo-M members have strengthened their academic education by learning from such world-class cello players as: Mstislav Rostropovich, Klauss Kangiser, Misha Maiski, Frans Helmerson, Maksim Utkin and Natalia Shovskaya.
 
Uniqueness of Melo-M performances lies in their ability to combine foundations of the classical music with energy and drive of pop and rock shows.

'''Naftal''' ([[Arabic]]: نفطال) is the principal company selling [[petroleum]]-based fuels for domestic consumption in [[Algeria]]; its [[gas station]]s are a familiar sight throughout the country. Founded in 1981 by government decree, it was responsible for refining and distribution until 1987. In 1998, it became a subsidiary of [[Sonatrach]]. It employs about 30,000 workers, and has about 10,000 gas stations (as of 2005.)

It is also sometimes called '''population axiology''', which is "the theory of when one state of affairs is better than another, ''where the states of affairs may differ over the number of people who ever live''".&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Hilary. "Comparing existence and nonexistence". http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/talks/existence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the special problems that arise when actions or policies cannot be said to affect individual persons but merely to substitute one group of people with another. Such problems usually only arise when our actions affect future generations. Perspectives in population ethics include [[natalism]] (encouraging childbearing and population growth) and [[antinatalism]] (which sees birth as undesirable).

“Most discussion in population ethics has concentrated on how to evaluate populations in regard to their goodness, that is, how to order populations by the relations “is better than” and “is as good as”. This field has been riddled with paradoxes which purport to show that our considered beliefs are inconsistent in cases where the number of people and their welfare varies.”&lt;ref&gt;Arrhenius Gustav, 2004, The paradoxes of future generations and normative theory, in The repugnant conclusion, essays on population ethics, p.201, Dordrecht, Holland: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population ethics is especially important when making large-scale decisions like those regarding climate policy.&lt;ref name="populationethics-org"&gt;''Population Ethics: Theory and Practice''. Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford. http://www.populationethics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Population ethics may be also applied to evaluate scenarios that influence how people value averting deaths in [[charitable organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/12/amf-population-ethics/|title=AMF and Population Ethics|last=Cotra|first=Ajeya|date=2016-12-12|website=The GiveWell Blog|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schalun Castle''' ([[German language|German]] ''Burg Schalun'' or ''Ruine Schalun''), also known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as '''Wildschloss''' ("Castle in the wild"), is a castle ruin located in the [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|municipality]] of [[Vaduz]], [[Liechtenstein]]. It lies in the mountains, roughly 1 kilometer to the northeast from the town centre of [[Vaduz]], the capital of Liechtenstein. It is freely open to tourists and accessible by foot or mountain bike via a local footpath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismus.li/en/culture-cuisine/places-of-cultural-interest/cultural-places-of-historical-interest/Wildschloss.html |title=Liechtenstein : The Official Tourism Site - Culture &amp; Cuisine - Places of historical interest : The Wildschloss (Schalun Castle) |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christian-tanner.com/burgruinen/burgen-von-f%C3%BCrstentum-liechtenstein/burg-schalun-wildschloss-vaduz/ |title=Photos of Schalun Castle |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212083552/http://www.christian-tanner.com/burgruinen/burgen-von-f%C3%BCrstentum-liechtenstein/burg-schalun-wildschloss-vaduz/ |archivedate=2013-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://picasaweb.google.com/100236546751027306466/LichtensteinBurgen#5739337084885025842 |title=A photo of the castle on Picasaweb.google.com |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schalun Castle is one of the five existing castles in Liechtenstein and one of the three ruined ones in the country.

==History==
The castle was constructed probably around the end of the 12th century. The first written record about the castle comes from 1237. In it, it was also first referred to by name, as "Schalun". Archeological digs made in recent decades have revealed only small amounts of artefacts from the medieval and early modern period, suggesting that the castle might have been cleared and burned down at a later point in its history.

In the 18th century, the castle came into the possession of the then Prince Regnant of [[Liechtenstein]]. The ownership of the castle ruin was handed over to the [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|Municipality]] of [[Vaduz]] in 1933.

Today, the best preserved parts of the castle are its grand hall and the remaining section of its keep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelia Herrmann |title=''Die Kunstdenkmäler des Fürstentums Liechtenstein.

'''Torta Tre Monti''' (from {{lang-it|“three mountain cake”}}) is a traditional [[San Marino|Sammarinese]] cake made of layers of thin waffled wafers cemented together by [[chocolate]] or [[hazelnut]] creme. The final product is covered in chocolate [[Fondant icing|fondant]]. It is similar to other layered desserts common to [[San Marino]], this one being representative of the [[Three Towers of San Marino]].&lt;ref name=ALG3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adribarrcrocetti.com/main/2011/04/12/torta-tre-monti/|title=Cake Review|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Marino, the ''torta'' has been commercially produced by La Serenissima since 1942. The bakery markets both a full-size cake and snack-size version, in addition to a variation that includes coffee.&lt;ref name=PLG3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laserenissima.sm/eng/index.asp|title=Producer's website|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325233211/http://www.laserenissima.sm/eng/index.asp|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
