[[File:STS-125 RSS Retract LA1.jpg|thumb|The STS-125, shown here on the launchpad went on to repair the Advanced Camera for Surveys and returned the crew safely back to Earth]]

The '''Advanced Camera for Surveys''' (ACS) is a third-generation axial instrument aboard the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST). The initial design and scientific capabilities of ACS were defined by a team based at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. ACS was assembled and tested extensively at [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]] and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and underwent a final flight-ready verification at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] before integration in the cargo bay of the Columbia orbiter. It was launched on March 1, 2002 as part of Servicing Mission 3B ([[STS-109]]) and installed in HST on March 7, replacing the [[Faint Object Camera]] (FOC), the last original instrument. ACS cost 86 million USD at that time.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9457-nasa-attempts-to-revive-hubbles-main-camera/]&lt;/ref&gt;

ACS is a highly versatile instrument that became the primary imaging instrument aboard HST. It offered several important advantages over other HST instruments: three independent, high-resolution channels covering the [[ultraviolet]] to the [[near-infrared]] regions of the [[spectrum]], a large detector area and [[quantum efficiency]], resulting in an increase in HST's discovery efficiency by a factor of ten, a rich complement of [[filter (optics)|filter]]s, and [[coronagraphy|coronagraphic]], [[polarimetry|polarimetric]], and [[grism]] capabilities. The observations undertaken with ACS provided astronomers with a view of the Universe with uniquely high sensitivity, as exemplified by the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]], and encompass a wide range of astronomical phenomena, from comets and planets in the [[Solar System]] to the most distant [[quasars]] known.

==ACS problems and fixes 2006–2009==
[[File:STS-125 crew portrait.jpg|thumb|The astronaut crew that repaired ACS on its 2009 space shuttle mission, STS-125]]
On 25 June 2006 ACS went out of action due to electronic failure. It was powered up successfully after switching to its redundant (Side-2) set of electronics. The instrument sub-systems, including the CCD detectors, all seemed to be working well and after some engineering tests, ACS resumed science operations on July 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=STScI |title=Advanced Camera for Surveys Update |date=2006-06-30 |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/ACSBack |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805180436/http://www.stsci.edu/hst/ACSBack |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STScI"&gt;{{cite press|publisher=STScI|title=Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys Resumes Exploring the Universe|date= 12 July 2006 |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/36/full/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2006, the ACS again failed, though by 9 October the problem had been diagnosed and resolved.&lt;ref name="Hubble ACS Status Report #3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/resources/acs.html |title=Hubble ACS Status Report #3 |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |accessdate=2007-01-10 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530063453/http://www.stsci.edu/resources/acs.html |archive-date=2012-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 2007 the ACS failed due to a short circuit in its backup power supply.&lt;ref name=acsnews07&gt;{{cite press | date=January 29, 2007 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jan/HQ_0715_Hubble_ACS.html |title=Engineers Investigate Issue on One of Hubble's Science Instruments |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2007-05-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070514132230/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jan/HQ_0715_Hubble_ACS.html| archivedate= 14 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was returned to operation on 19 February 2007 using the side-1 electronics.

The High Resolution Channel (HRC), however, remains offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William | last=Harwood| date=May 17, 2009 | url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090517fd7/index.html |title=Part of camera in newly repaired instrument revived |publisher=Spaceflight Now |accessdate=2009-05-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090520152548/http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090517fd7/index.html| archivedate= 20 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels and detectors==

ACS includes three independent channels (one now disabled), each optimized for specific scientific tasks:

===Wide Field Channel (WFC)===
The WFC is the most utilized channel of ACS. Its detector consists of two butted 2048x4096, 15&amp;nbsp;µm/pixel [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) for a total of 16 [[megapixel]]s manufactured by Scientific Imaging Technologies (SITe). The WFC plate scale is 0.05″ per pixel and it has an effective field-of-view of 202″×202″. The spectral range of the WFC detector is 350–1100 [[nanometer|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACS Detectors |publisher=STScI |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/Detector/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a use of this channel was [[Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search|SWEEPS]], which found 16 candidate exoplanets in the Galactic core.

===High-Resolution Channel (HRC)===
[[File:Mars close encounter (captured by the Hubble Space Telescope).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hubble's ACS/HRC captures [[Mars]] during its 2003 opposition, yielding the sharpest visible-light color [[RGB color model|(RGB)]] photo yet taken from Earth. At about 8 km / pixel, various martian craters and markings are revealed. The ACS "[[William George Fastie|Fastie finger]]" is blocking light on the left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/22/image/i/ Hubblesite – Sharpest Ever Color View of Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The HRC, which has been permanently disabled since 2007 due to an electrical fault, provided ultra-sharp views over a smaller field-of-view. The channel used two light suppression options for imaging faint objects around bright stars, improving the contrast of targets close to bright sources by tenfold. The first was a commandable coronagraphic mask that included two occulting spots, one of diameter 1.8" at the center of the field and the other of diameter 3.0" nearer to a corner. The first spot was the most popular of the two, for example, for imaging circumstellar disks around nearby bright stars or the host galaxies of luminous quasars. The second was the so-called [[William George Fastie|Fastie]] Finger, 0.8" in width and 5" in length, located at the entrance of the HRC dewar window.  The HRC detector was a 1024×1024 SITe CCD  which had a smaller field-of-view (26"×29") than the WFC but twice the spatial sampling (0.025" per pixel). This detector was also significantly more sensitive than the WFC at near-ultraviolet wavelengths (&lt;350&amp;nbsp;nm).

===Solar Blind Channel (SBC)===
The Multi Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) of the SBC is a low-background photon-counting device optimized for the ultraviolet in the wavelength range of 115–170&amp;nbsp;nm. It consists of a photocathode, a microchannel plate, and an anode array. Its spatial sampling is 0.030" per pixel and its field-of-view is 25"×25". The ACS SBC is in fact a flight spare from the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Filters and dispersers==
ACS possesses a set of 38 filters and dispersers distributed among three wheels. Two of these wheels are shared by the HRC and WFC light paths while the third is dedicated to the SBC. The HRC and WFC elements consist of eleven broad-band filters, one medium-band filter, five narrow-band filters, three visible and three ultraviolet polarizers, one prism for the HRC, and one [[grism]] (580–1100&amp;nbsp;nm). Four of the filters have bandpasses in the near-ultraviolet and so can be used with the HRC only.  The primary broad-band filters are equivalent to the ''u'', ''g'', ''r'', ''i'', and ''z'' filters of the ground-based [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS). Five linear ramp filters divided into three individual segments each provide continuous imaging capability from 380&amp;nbsp;nm to 1070&amp;nbsp;nm and so ensure adequate sampling of [[emission lines]] over a large range in redshift. Only the middle segment is accessible to the HRC. The SBC wheel is populated with one medium-band filter (Lyα), five long-pass filters, and two objective prisms.

[[File:152 mm shell production SA-Kuva 88285.jpg|thumb|152 mm shells being filled with liquid amatol. Finland, 1942]]
'''Amatol''' is a highly [[explosive material]] made from a mixture of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and [[ammonium nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| publisher = Bureau of Ordnance

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British name originates from the words [[ammonium]] and [[toluene]] (an ingredient of TNT). Similar mixtures (1 part dinitronaphthalene and 7 parts ammonium nitrate) were known as '''Schneiderite''' in France.  Amatol was used extensively during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], typically as an [[explosive]] in military weapons such as aircraft [[bomb]]s, [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[depth charge]]s, and [[naval mine]]s.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, G.I. (1998) The Big Bang: a History of Explosives'' Sutton Publishing {{ISBN|0-7509-1878-0}} pp.158-163&lt;/ref&gt;  It was eventually replaced with alternative explosives such as [[composition B]], [[torpex]], and [[tritonal]].

==Manufacture and use==
Amatol exploits [[synergy]] between TNT and ammonium nitrate. TNT has higher [[explosive velocity]] and [[brisance]], but is deficient in oxygen. Oxygen deficiency causes black smoke residue&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb3y6m-buco&lt;/ref&gt; from a pure TNT explosion. The [[oxygen]] surplus of ammonium nitrate increases the energy release of TNT during [[detonation]]. Depending on the ratio of ingredients used, amatol leaves a residue of white or grey smoke after detonation. Amatol has a lower explosive velocity and correspondingly lower brisance than TNT but is cheaper because of the lower cost of ammonium nitrate. 

Amatol allowed supplies of TNT to be expanded considerably, with little reduction in the destructive power of the final product, so long as the amount of TNT in the mixture did not fall below 60%. Mixtures containing as little as 20% TNT were for less demanding uses.

TNT is 50% deficient in oxygen. Amatol is oxygen balanced and is therefore more effective than pure TNT when exploding underground or underwater. RDX also has a negative oxygen balance. 

Relatively unsophisticated [[cannery]] equipment can be adapted to amatol production. TNT is gently heated with steam or hot water until it melts, acquiring the physical characteristics of a syrup. Then the correct weight ratio of powdered ammonium nitrate is added and mixed in. Whilst this mixture is still in a [[Melting|molten]] state, it is poured into empty bomb casings and allowed to cool and solidify. The lowest grades of amatol could not be produced by casting molten TNT. Instead, flaked TNT was thoroughly mixed with powdered ammonium nitrate and then compressed or extruded.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The colour of amatol ranges from off-white to slightly yellow or pinkish brown, depending on the mixture used, and remains soft for long periods of storage. It is also [[hygroscopic]], which complicates long-term storage.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Tenney L. (1943) ''The Chemistry of Powder &amp; Explosives'' Angriff Press {{ISBN|0-913022-00-4}} pp.141-153&amp;494&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent moisture problems, amatol charges were coated with a thin layer of pure molten TNT or alternatively [[bitumen]]. Long-term storage was rare during wars because [[munitions]] charged with amatol were generally used soon after manufacture.

Amatol should not be stored in containers made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. [[Primary and secondary explosives|Primary explosives]] such as [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] were often used as a [[detonator]], in combination with an [[explosive booster]] charge such as [[tetryl]].

The explosive charges hidden in [[HMS Campbeltown (I42)|HMS ''Campbeltown'']] during the [[St. Nazaire Raid]] of 1942 contained amatol. The British [[X class submarine|X class]] [[midget submarine]]s which planted explosive charges beneath the German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] in September 1943 carried two "saddle charges" containing four [[Long ton|tons]] of amatol. Warheads for the German [[V-1 flying bomb]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s also contained amatol.

A derivative of amatol is [[amatex]], consisting of 51% ammonium nitrate, 40% TNT, and 9% [[Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine|RDX]].

==Ammonite==
Amatol is rare today, except in legacy munitions or [[unexploded ordnance]]. A form of amatol exists under a different name&amp;nbsp;— '''ammonite'''. Ammonite is a civilian explosive, generally comprising a 20/80 mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate. Typically, it is used for [[quarrying]] or [[mining]] purposes. It is a popular civil engineering explosive in [[Eastern Europe]] and China. 

Because the proportion of TNT is significantly lower than in its military counterpart, ammonite has much less destructive power; given ammonite's use, this is not a problem. In general, a 30 kilogram charge of ammonite is roughly equivalent to 20 kilograms of TNT.

==Amatol, New Jersey==

Amatol was the name given to a munitions factory and planned community built by the United States government in [[Mullica Township, New Jersey]] during [[World War I]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the town was dismantled. The [[Atlantic City Speedway]] was built on part of the Amatol site in 1926.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60811">'''Artificial general intelligence''' ('''AGI''') is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a [[human]] being can. It is a primary goal of some [[artificial intelligence]] research and a common topic in [[science fiction]] and [[Futures studies|future studies]]. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as "'''strong AI'''",&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] where he defines strong AI as "machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt; "'''full AI'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Age-of-Artificial-Intellige The Age of Artificial Intelligence: George John at TEDxLondonBusinessSchool 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; or as the ability of a machine to perform "general intelligent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}}. This is the term they use for "human-level" intelligence in the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic sources reserve "strong AI" to refer to machines capable of experiencing [[Chinese room#Strong AI|consciousness]].

Some references emphasize a distinction between strong AI and "applied AI"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219086/artificial-intelligence Strong AI, applied AI, and cognitive simulation] or Jack Copeland [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/www.AlanTuring.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/what_is_AI/What%20is%20AI02.html What is artificial intelligence?] on AlanTuring.net&lt;/ref&gt; (also called "narrow AI"&lt;ref name=K/&gt; or "[[weak AI]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/nextbigthing/ai/ai_in_depth/in_depth.htm The Open University on Strong and Weak AI]&lt;/ref&gt;): the use of software to study or accomplish specific [[problem solving]] or [[reason]]ing tasks. Weak AI, in contrast to strong AI, does not attempt to perform the full range of human [[cognitive]] abilities.

As of 2017, over forty organizations worldwide are doing active research on AGI.&lt;ref name=baum/&gt;

Various criteria for [[intelligence]] have been proposed (most famously the [[Turing test]]) but to date, there is no definition that satisfies everyone.&lt;ref&gt;AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes: "we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent." {{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html |title=Basic Questions| last=McCarthy |first=John| authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist)| publisher=[[Stanford University]]| year=2007}} (For a discussion of some definitions of intelligence used by [[artificial intelligence]] researchers, see [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there ''is'' wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;

== Problems requiring AGI to solve ==
{{Main|AI-complete}}

The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as "AI-complete" or "AI-hard", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness. In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3–17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to repel [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security].

== Classical AI ==
{{Main|History of artificial intelligence}}
Modern AI research began in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of AI researchers was convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. As AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their predictions were the inspiration for [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s character [[HAL 9000]], who accurately embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. Of note is the fact that AI pioneer [[Marvin Minsky]] was a consultant&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two1.html Scientist on the Set: An Interview with Marvin Minsky]&lt;/ref&gt; on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time; Crevier quotes him as having said on the subject in 1967, "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved,"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky to {{Harvtxt|Darrach|1970}}, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Minsky states that he was misquoted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful "applied AI".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Lighthill report]] specifically criticized AI's "grandiose objectives" and led the dismantling of AI research in England. ({{Harvnb|Lighthill|1973}}; {{Harvnb|Howe|1994}}) In the U.S., [[DARPA]] became determined to fund only "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". See {{Harv|NRC|1999}} under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment". See also {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=115–117}} and {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1980s began, Japan's [[Fifth Generation Computer]] Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like "carry on a casual conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=211}}, {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=24}} and see also {{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|McCorduck|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and the success of [[expert systems]], both industry and government pumped money back into the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier| 1993|pp=161–162,197–203,240}}; {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}; {{harvnb|NRC|1999|loc=under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who had predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been shown to be fundamentally mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had gained a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all&lt;ref&gt;As AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes "it would be a great relief to the rest of the workers in AI if the inventors of new general formalisms would express their hopes in a more guarded form than has sometimes been the case." {{cite web| url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/reviews/lighthill/lighthill.html | title=Reply to Lighthill | last=McCarthy | first=John | authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) | publisher=Stanford University |year=2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid any mention of "human level" artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled "wild-eyed dreamer[s]."&lt;ref&gt;"At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |title=Behind Artificial Intelligence, a Squadron of Bright Real People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/14/technology/14artificial.html?ei=5070&amp;en=11ab55edb7cead5e&amp;ex=1185940800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1185805173-o7WsfW7qaP0x5/NUs1cQCQ |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current narrow AI research==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}

In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved far greater commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as [[artificial neural networks]], [[computer vision]] or [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "applied AI" systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is very heavily funded in both academia and industry.

Most mainstream AI researchers hope that strong AI can be developed by combining the programs that solve various sub-problems using an integrated [[agent architecture]], [[cognitive architecture]] or [[subsumption architecture]]. [[Hans Moravec]] wrote in 1988: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]] that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical [[golden spike]] is driven uniting the two efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even this fundamental philosophy has been disputed; for example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton concluded his 1990 paper on the [[Symbol grounding problem|Symbol Grounding Hypothesis]] by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The expectation has often been voiced that "top-down" (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet "bottom-up" (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Artificial general intelligence research==
Artificial general intelligence{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} (AGI) describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action. The term was introduced by Mark Gubrud in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.  The research objective is much older, for example [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]] project (that began in 1984), and [[Allen Newell]]'s [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] project are regarded as within the scope of AGI. AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and [[Ben Goertzel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goertzel|Wang|2006}}. See also {{harvtxt|Wang|2006}} with an up-to-date summary and lots of links.&lt;/ref&gt; as "producing publications and preliminary results". As yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

A 2017 survey of AGI categorized forty-five known "active R&amp;D projects" that explicitly or implicitly (through published research) research AGI, with the largest three being [[DeepMind]], the Human Brain Project, and OpenAI.&lt;ref name=baum&gt;Baum, Seth. "A Survey of Artificial General Intelligence Projects for Ethics, Risk, and Policy." (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing power needed to simulate a brain ==

===Whole brain emulation===
{{main|Mind uploading}}
A popular approach discussed to achieving general intelligent action is [[whole brain emulation]]. A low-level brain model is built by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer runs a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;
{{Harvnb|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}. "The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain."&lt;/ref&gt; Whole brain emulation is discussed in [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]], in the context of [[brain simulation]] for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.

===Early estimates ===
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; computations per second (cps).&lt;ref&gt;In "Mind Children" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cps is used. More recently, in 1997, &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&gt; Moravec argued for 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not "cps", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, if a "computation" was equivalent to one "[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]" –  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s – then 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; "computations" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.

===Modelling the neurons in more detail===
The [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently only understood in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Discover2011JanFeb"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia—the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan–Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current research===
There are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures. The [[Artificial Intelligence System]] project implemented non-real time simulations of a "brain" (with 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) in 2005. It took 50 days on a cluster of 27 processors to simulate 1 second of a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izhikevich |first=Eugene M. |last2=Edelman |first2=Gerald M. |date=March 4, 2008 |title=Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |journal=PNAS |publisher= |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=3593–3598 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0712231105|access-date=23 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612095651/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2009 |pmid=18292226 |pmc=2265160|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3593I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Brain]] project used one of the fastest supercomputer architectures in the world, [[IBM]]'s [[Blue Gene]] platform, to create a real time simulation of a single rat [[Neocortex|neocortical column]] consisting of approximately 10,000 neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer term goal is to build a detailed, functional simulation of the physiological processes in the human brain: "It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years," [[Henry Markram]], director of the Blue Brain Project said in 2009 at the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away' 2009 BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been controversial claims to have simulated a [[cat intelligence#Computer simulation of the cat brain|cat brain]]. Neuro-silicon interfaces have been proposed as an alternative implementation strategy that may scale better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/10343 University of Calgary news], [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12037941/ MSNBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Moravec]] addressed the above arguments ("brains are more complicated", "neurons have to be modeled in more detail") in his 1997 paper "When will computer hardware match the human brain?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He measured the ability of existing software to simulate the functionality of neural tissue, specifically the retina.  His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.

===Complications and criticisms of AI approaches based on simulation===
A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree&lt;/ref&gt; If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like [[Second Life]]), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.

Desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit "computations per second", see above) have been available since 2005. According to the brain power estimates used by Kurzweil (and Moravec), this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain, but despite some interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setiai.com/archives/cat_honey_bee_brain.html some links to bee brain studies]&lt;/ref&gt; no such simulation exists {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. There are at least three reasons for this:
* Firstly, the neuron model seems to be oversimplified (see next section).
* Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes{{refn|In Goertzels' AGI book ([[#CITEREFYudkowsky2006|Yudkowsky 2006]]), Yudkowsky proposes 5 levels of organisation that must be understood – code/data, sensory modality, concept &amp; category, thought, and deliberation (consciousness) – in order to use the available hardware}} to establish accurately what the brain's neural activity, observed using techniques such as [[Neuroimaging#Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging]], correlates with.
* Thirdly, even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently, early simulation programs are likely to be very inefficient and will, therefore, need considerably more hardware.
* Fourthly, the brain of an organism, while critical, may not be an appropriate boundary for a cognitive model.  To simulate a bee brain, it may be necessary to simulate the body, and the environment. [[The Extended Mind]] thesis formalizes the philosophical concept, and research into [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]] has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralized system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15829594 | doi=10.1152/jn.00684.2004 | volume=94 | issue=2 | title=Dynamic model of the octopus arm.

In addition, the scale of the human brain is not currently well-constrained. One estimate puts the human brain at about 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|Herrup|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-75525 "nervous system, human."] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 9 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate is 86 billion neurons of which 16.3 billion are in the [[cerebral cortex]] and 69 billion in the [[cerebellum]].{{sfn|Azevedo et al.|2009}} [[Glial cell]] synapses are currently unquantified but are known to be extremely numerous.

Although the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].

==Relationship to "strong AI"==
{{See also|philosophy of artificial intelligence|Chinese room}}

In 1980, philosopher [[John Searle]] coined the term "strong AI" as part of his [[Chinese room]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence:&lt;ref&gt;As defined in a standard AI textbook: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis." {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An artificial intelligence system can ''think'' and have a ''mind''.  (The word "mind" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in "the [[mind body problem]]" or "the [[philosophy of mind]]".)
* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.
The first one is called "the ''strong'' AI hypothesis" and the second is "the ''weak'' AI hypothesis" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the "strong AI hypothesis" as "strong AI". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;For example:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] (quoted in "High Beam Encyclopedia"),
* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] (quoted in "AITopics")
* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math]
* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] Anthony Tongen
&lt;/ref&gt;

The weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}

In contrast to Searle, Kurzweil uses the term "strong AI" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,&lt;ref name=K/&gt; regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.

==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==
{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}

Since the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

While most AI researchers believe that strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] that deny the possibility of achieving AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}

Conceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: "the framework starts from Weizenbaum’s observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

Furthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do {{Examples|date=September 2017}}.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem that is described by David Gelernter is that some people assume that thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}

The problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Other possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Clocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}

The practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}

A possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.

There have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, "No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion."{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.

==Consciousness==
There are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:
* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it "feels like" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask "what does it feel like to be a bat?" However, we are unlikely to ask "what does it feel like to be a toaster?" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.
* [[sentience]]: The ability to "feel" perceptions or emotions subjectively.
* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.
These traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. Also, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | magazine=Wired |date=April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.

In science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to philosopher [[John Searle]], it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. "Strong AI" (as defined above by [[Ray Kurzweil]]) should not be confused with Searle's "'[[strong AI hypothesis]]". The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.

==Controversies and dangers==

===Feasibility===
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". However, this prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require "unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs" and a "scientifically deep understanding of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Paul|title=The Singularity Isn't Near|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[The Guardian]], roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI experts' views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when they'd be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. It is also interesting to note 16.5% of the experts answered with "never" when asked the same question but with a 90% confidence instead.&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raffi Khatchadourian|title=The Doomsday Invention: Will artificial intelligence bring us utopia or destruction?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V.

===Potential threat to human existence{{anchor|Risk_of_human_extinction}}===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{See also|Technological singularity}}

The creation of artificial general intelligence may have repercussions so great and so complex that it may not be possible to forecast what will come afterwards.  Thus the event in the hypothetical future of achieving strong AI is called the [[technological singularity]], because theoretically one cannot see past it.  But this has not stopped philosophers and researchers from guessing what the smart computers or robots of the future may do, including forming a utopia by [[friendly artificial intelligence|being our friends]] or overwhelming us in an [[AI takeover]]. The latter potentiality is particularly disturbing as it poses an [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk for mankind]].

==== Self-replicating machines ====
Smart computers or robots would be able to design and produce improved versions of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Hein, Andreas Makoto, and Hélène Condat. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02091 "Can Machines Design? An Artificial General Intelligence Approach."] arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02091 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; A growing population of intelligent robots could conceivably out-compete inferior humans in job markets, in business, in science, in politics (pursuing [[robot rights]]), and technologically, sociologically ([[Group mind (science fiction)|by acting as one]]), and militarily.

==== Emergent superintelligence ====
If research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself – a feature called "recursive self-improvement". It would then be even better at improving itself, and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to an [[intelligence explosion]] and the emergence of [[superintelligence]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and might be able to invent or discover almost anything.

Hyper-intelligent software might not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and might be extremely difficult to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Yudkowsky, Eliezer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of [[risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth]].

One proposal to deal with this is to make sure that the first generally intelligent AI is a [[friendly AI]] that would then endeavor to ensure that subsequently developed AIs were also nice to us. But friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI, and therefore it is likely, in a race between the two, that non-friendly AI would be developed first. Also, there is no guarantee that friendly AI would remain friendly, or that its progeny would also all be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beltel''' was the name and [[trademark]] used by the [[South Africa]]n Department of Posts and Telecommunications (later [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]]) for its [[Videotex]] system between the mid eighties and 1999&lt;ref name="refname1" /&gt;.

The system used telephone lines and [[modems]] connected to [[Personal Computer|personal computers]] or to [[dumb terminals]] which had built in modems and no processing functionality. Telkom's dedicated terminal was named the [[Minitel]].

The system incorporated a [[Payment system|billing system]] which enabled [[content provider|information providers]] and [[service provider]]s to receive payment for information and services provided to [[User (telecommunications)|users]]. The billing system was capable of handling very small transactions, and referred to as [[Micro-billing]]. Today all of the functionality of the Beltel system, and more, is delivered by handheld [[mobile phone]]s or [[cellphone]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]'s which utilize [[mobile payment]].

'''Benefield Anechoic Facility''' (BAF) is an [[anechoic chamber]] located at the southwest side of the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] main base. It is currently the world's largest anechoic chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2000/00-20_pf.html X-43A VEHICLE TESTED IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST ANECHOIC CHAMBER] - NASA Dryden News Releases&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiojunkies.com/blog/503/the-worlds-largest-anechoic-chamber Audio Junkies, August 22, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409024521/http://www.audiojunkies.com/blog/503/the-worlds-largest-anechoic-chamber |date=April 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAF supports installed systems testing for [[avionics]] test programs requiring a large, shielded chamber with [[radio frequency]] (RF) absorption capability that simulates [[free space]].

The facility is named after [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] test pilot and flight commander Tommie Douglas "Doug" Benefield who was killed in a crash 22 miles northeast of Edwards Air Force Base in the desert east of Boron on August 29, 1984 during a USAF [[B-1 Lancer]] [[flight test]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/safety_lessons_spotlight.html NASA, Dryden Flight Research Center, July 31, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?page=198 City of Lancaster 2002 Honorees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625225445/http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?page=198 |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/b_1_lancer.htm Ejection History.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The BAF is a ground test facility to investigate and evaluate anomalies associated with EW systems, avionics, tactical missiles and their host platforms. Tactical-sized, single or multiple, or large vehicles can be operated in a controlled [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] (EM) environment with emitters on and sensors stimulated while RF signals are recorded and analyzed. The largest platforms tested at the BAF have been the B-52 and C-17 aircraft. The BAF supports testing of other types of systems such as spacecraft, tanks, satellites, air defense systems, drones and armored vehicles.

The BAF equipment generates RF signals with a wide variety of characteristics, simulating red/blue/gray (unfriendly/friendly/unknown) surface-based, sea-based, and airborne systems. With the combination of signals and control functions available, a wide variety of test conditions can be emulated. Many conditions that are not available on outdoor ranges can be easily generated from the aspect of signal density, pulse density and number of simultaneous types.

Through the use of environmental monitoring systems, an independent agency captures, records, and verifies RF generated signals. These systems have the capabilities for real-time and post-test RF signal parameter measurement, instrument display recording, data analysis and test coordination, as well as providing the data for signal verification.

Some [[aircraft]] tested at the BAF include:
*[[F-22 Raptor]]
*[[C-130 Hercules]]
*NC-130H
*[[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]
*[[B-1 Lancer]]
*[[X-43A]]
*[[CH-47 Chinook|MH-47 Chinook]]
*[[V-22 Osprey]]
*[[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus|KC-46A Tanker]]
*F-15SG Eagle
*F-15SA Saudi Advanced Eagle

==Special use==
In 2003, [[BMW]] tested levels of electromagnetic interference on then-upcoming 2004 models of the 530i, 545i and debut model, 645i.

The '''Broadband Forum''' is a non-profit industry [[consortium]] dedicated to developing [[broadband network]] specifications. Members include telecommunications networking and service provider companies, broadband device and equipment vendors, consultants and independent testing labs (ITLs).  Service provider members are primarily wire-line service providers (non-mobile) [[telephone company|telephone companies]].

==History==
The DSL Forum was founded in 1994 with about 200 member companies in different divisions of the [[telecommunication]] and [[information technology]] sector.  It is used as a platform for companies that operate in the broadband market.  Its initial main purpose was the establishment of new standards around [[Digital Subscriber Line]] communication products such as [[provisioning]]. This cooperation has brought different standardizations for [[ADSL]], [[SHDSL]], [[VDSL]], [[ADSL2+]] and [[VDSL2]]. 

The group  was established in 1994 as the ADSL Forum, but became the DSL Forum in 1999, named after the [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) family of technology.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web |title= About the Broadband Forum: Forum History |url= http://www.broadband-forum.org/about/forumhistory.php |accessdate= September 24, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111009003434/http://www.broadband-forum.org/about/forumhistory.php |archivedate= October 9, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its early design documents, the Forum created TR-001 (1996) system reference model, which together with later TR-012 (1999) core network architecture, recommended [[Point-to-point protocol|PPP]] over an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] transport layer as the best practice for a DSL ISP. This was subsequently refined in TR-025 and TR-059.&lt;ref name="HellbergBoyes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Hellberg|author2=Truman Boyes|author3=Dylan Greene|title=Broadband Network Architectures: Designing and Deploying Triple-Play Services|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-270451-9|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2004, the Forum expanded its work into other [[last mile]] technologies including [[optical fiber]].  On 17 June 2008 it changed its name to "Broadband Forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Q1 2006 Report |date= March 12, 2006 |url= http://www.broadband-forum.org/news/download/pressreleeases/q106_annualrelease.pdf |accessdate= September 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSL-related specifications, while still a key part of the forum's work, are no longer its only work. For instance, the forum produced work specific to [[passive optical network]]ing (PON). Its Auto-Configuration Server specification [[TR-069]], originally published in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= CPE WAN Management Protocol |work= TR-069 Amendment 3 |date= November 2010 |publisher= Broadband Forum |url= http://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-069_Amendment-3.pdf |accessdate= September 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was adapted for use with [[set-top box]] and [[Network Attached Storage]] units.

The Forum's TR-101 specification (2006) documents migration toward an [[Ethernet]]-based DSL aggregation model (Ethernet [[DSLAM]]s).&lt;ref name="HellbergBoyes2007"/&gt;

In May 2009, IP/MPLS Forum merged with the Broadband Forum. It had promoted the [[frame relay]] and [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] technologies.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;
Technical work of IP/MPLS Forum continued in a newly created "IP/MPLS and Core" Working Group of the Broadband Forum. The historical specifications from the IP/MPLS Forum's predecessors, [[ATM Forum]], Frame Relay Forum, MFA Forum, and MPLS Forum, are archived on the Broadband Forum's website, under IP/MPLS Forum specifications.

Broadband Forum issued [[Femtocell|Femto Access]] Point Service Data Model [[TR-196]] during April 2009 and version 2 released during November 2011.

Broadband Forum specified in TR-348&lt;ref name="BBF-TR348"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-348.pdf |title=TR-348 Hybrid Access Broadband Network Architecture|last=Broadband Forum|date=2016-07-01|accessdate=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for [[Hybrid Access Networks]] an architecture that enables network operators to efficiently combine [[XDSL]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]].

A '''comb generator''' is a [[signal generator]] that produces multiple [[harmonic]]s of its input signal. The appearance of the output at the [[spectrum analyzer]] screen, resembling teeth of a [[comb]], gave the device its name.

Comb generators find wide range of uses in [[microwave]] technology. E.g., synchronous signals in wide frequency bandwidth can be produced by a comb generator. The most common use is in broadband [[frequency synthesizer]]s, where the high frequency signals act as stable references correlated to the lower energy references; the outputs can be used directly, or to synchronize [[phase-locked loop]] [[oscillator]]s. It may be also used to generate a complete set of substitution channels for testing, each of which carries the same baseband audio and video signal.

Comb generators are also used in [[radio frequency interference|RFI]] testing of [[consumer electronics]], where their output is used as a simulated [[radio frequency|RF]] emissions, as it is a stable broadband noise source with repeatable output. It is also used during compliance testing to various government requirements for products such as medical devices (FDA), military electronics (MIL-STD-461), commercial avionics (Federal Aviation Administration), digital electronics (Federal Communications Commission), in the USA.

An '''optical comb generator''' can be used as generators of [[terahertz radiation]]. Internally, it is a [[nonlinear optics|resonant electro-optic modulator]], with the capability of generating hundreds of [[sideband]]s with total span of at least 3 terahertz (limited by the [[optical dispersion]] of the [[lithium niobate]] crystal) and frequency spacing of 17&amp;nbsp;GHz. Other construction can be based on erbium-doped [[fiber laser]] or [[Ti-sapphire laser]] often in combination with [[carrier envelope offset control]].

'''Crunchbase''' is a platform for finding business information about private and public companies.

Crunchbase information includes investments and funding information, founding members and individuals in leadership positions, mergers and acquisitions, news, and industry trends. Originally built to track startups, the Crunchbase website contains information on public and private companies globally.

Crunchbase sources their data in four ways: the venture program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/30/announcing-the-crunchbase-venture-network/|title=Announcing The CrunchBase Venture Program|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; machine learning, an in-house data team, and the Crunchbase community. Members of the public can submit information to the Crunchbase database. These submissions are subject to registration, social validation, and are often reviewed by a moderator before being accepted for publication. 

== History ==
[[File:CrunchBase.svg|thumb|right|Crunchbase's former logo, used before the name was changed from CrunchBase to Crunchbase]]
Crunchbase was originally founded in 2007 by entrepreneur [[Michael Arrington]], as a place to track the startups that parent company [[TechCrunch]] featured in articles. From 2007 to September 2015, TechCrunch maintained control of the Crunchbase database.

In September 2010, [[AOL]] acquired TechCrunch and subsequently Crunchbase as one of TechCrunch's portfolio companies. In November 2013, AOL was in dispute with start-up Pro Populi over the company’s use of the entire Crunchbase dataset in apps that Pro Populi developed. One of these apps, known as People+ Pro Populi, was represented by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/11/aol-crunchbase-cc-flap/|title=AOL Smacks Startup for Using CrunchBase Content It Gave Away|last=Kravets|first=David|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Crunchbase added incubators, venture capital partners, and a new leaderboard feature to the startup database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/crunchbase-grows-its-global-reach-adding-incubators-vc-partners-and-a-new-leaderboard-feature/|title=CrunchBase Grows Its Global Reach, Adding Incubators, VC Partners And A New Leaderboard Feature|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, Crunchbase separated from AOL/Verizon/TechCrunch to become a private entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/aolverizon-completes-spinout-of-crunchbase-funded-by-emergence-capital/|title=AOL/Verizon Completes Spinout Of CrunchBase Funded By Emergence Capital|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, in conjunction with the spin out, Crunchbase announced $6.5 million in funding raised from Emergence Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emergence-capital-partners-aol-spin-182000457.html|title=Emergence Capital Partners With AOL to Spin Out CrunchBase and Invests in Stand-Alone Company|publisher=Yahoo!|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly followed with a follow-up round of $2 million in November 2015.

In 2016, the company rebranded from CrunchBase to Crunchbase and launched their first product: Crunchbase Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/crunchbase-pro-brings-new-search-and-analysis-features-for-power-users/|title=CrunchBase Pro brings new search and analysis features for power users|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Crunchbase announced an $18 million Series B from [[Mayfield Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170406005095/en/18-Million-Series-Funding-Crunchbase-Accelerates-Development|title=With $18 Million Series B Funding, Crunchbase Accelerates Development of New SaaS Business Products and Focuses on Diversity in Hiring to Grow|agency=BusinessWire|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Crunchbase launched two new products – Crunchbase Enterprise and Crunchbase for Applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/crunchbase-expands-paid-services-raises-18-million-1491478202|title=Crunchbase Expands Paid Services, Raises $18 Million|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|date=2017-04-06|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, Crunchbase launched Crunchbase Marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/crunchbase-opens-a-marketplace-for-3rd-party-data-in-bid-to-be-the-master-database-for-companies/|title=Crunchbase opens a marketplace for 3rd-party data in bid to be the 'master database for companies'|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cryogenic current comparator (CCC)''' is used in the electrical precision measurements to compare   [[electric current]]s with highest accuracy. This device exceeds the accuracy of other current comparators around several orders of magnitude and is used in electrical [[metrology]] for highly precise comparative measurements of [[electrical resistance|electric resistances]] or for the amplification and measurement of extremely small electric currents.

The CCC principle goes back on ''Harvey'' and is based substantially on the properties of [[superconductivity|superconductors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harvey |first=I K |title=A precise low temperature DC ratio transformer |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |url=http://www-bd.gsi.de/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=projects:ccc:revsciinstrum_43_1626.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-07 |volume=43 |issue=11 |date=November 1972 |pages=1626–39 |doi=10.1063/1.1685508}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCCs make use of macroscopic quantum effects that occur in superconducting materials or circuits underneath their [[critical temperature]] of typically a few [[kelvin]]s. The term “Cryogenic Current Comparator” stems from ''κρυος'' ([[Greek language|Gr.]] ''frost'', ''ice'') and ''comparare'' ([[Latin language|Lat.]] ''compare''). The two quantum effects used in a CCC are the ideal [[diamagnetism]] of the superconductor, caused by the [[Meissner effect]], and the macroscopic quantum interference of currents in a superconducting quantum sensor.

For the comparison of two currents these are fed through two wires which are led through a superconducting tube. The Meissner effect induces a screening current on the inner surface of the tube, flowing opposite to and being exactly as large as the sum of the currents inside the tube. Thus, this shielding current exactly cancels the [[magnetic field]] inside the tube produced by the currents in the wires. The screening current flows back across the outer surface of the tube, giving rise to a magnetic field in the room outside of the tube. This field is detected by a highly sensitive [[magnetometer]], acting as a null detector. The signal of this null detector thus is a measure for the equality of the currents; in particular it is zero if the two currents are of exactly equal magnitude. The important and crucial point characterizing the CCC is the fact that the magnitude of the screening current and its distribution on the surface of the superconducting screen are independent of the position and the path of the wires inside the tube.

Typical for a CCC is the use of a [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometer]] as null detector for the magnetic field (SQUID = '''S'''uperconducting '''Qu'''antum '''I'''nterference '''D'''evice). These are capable of detecting extremely small changes of the magnetic field corresponding to fractions of the [[magnetic flux quantum]] = ''h''/2''e'' ≈ 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V·s (''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''e'' the [[elementary charge]]). The function principle of a SQUID is based on macroscopic quantum interferences of electric currents, arising in superconducting circuits (loops) with tunnel junctions.

Resistance bridges based on CCCs are used for the comparison of electrical resistances, in particular if highest-precision measurements are required, as there is the [[traceability]] of the resistance unit to the [[quantum Hall effect]] (QHE). In this way, measurements connecting standard resistors ranging within 1&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]] up to 10&amp;nbsp;kΩ to a QHE resistor of 12.9&amp;nbsp;kΩ are performed at several national institutes of metrology as, for instance, the [http://www.nist.gov National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA)] or the [http://www.ptb.de Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, D)]. Here, electrical resistance comparisons using CCCs are accomplished with relative [[measurement uncertainty|measurement uncertainties]] of only about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Digital electronics''' or '''digital (electronic) circuits''' are [[electronics]] that operate on [[digital signal]]s. In contrast, [[analog circuits]] manipulate [[analog signal]]s whose performance is more subject to [[Engineering tolerance|manufacturing tolerance]], [[Path loss|signal attenuation]] and [[Noise (electronics)|noise]]. Digital techniques are helpful because it is a lot easier to get an electronic device to switch into one of a number of known states than to accurately reproduce a continuous range of values.

Digital [[electronic circuit]]s are usually made from large assemblies of [[logic gate]]s (often printed on [[integrated circuit]]s), simple electronic representations of [[Boolean logic#Digital electronic circuit design|Boolean logic functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Null |first1=Linda |last2=Lobur |first2=Julia |title=The essentials of computer organization and architecture |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+essentials+of+computer+organization+and+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=121 |year=2006 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=0-7637-3769-0 |quote=We can build logic diagrams (which in turn lead to digital circuits) for any Boolean expression...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[binary number system]] was refined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (published in 1705) and he also established that by using the binary system, the principles of arithmetic and logic could be joined. Digital logic as we know it was the brain-child of [[George Boole]] in the mid 19th century. In an 1886 letter, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits.&lt;ref name="P2M"&gt;Peirce, C. S., "Letter, Peirce to [[Allan Marquand|A. Marquand]]", dated 1886, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'', v. 5, 1993, pp. 541–3. Google [https://books.google.com/books?id=DnvLHp919_wC&amp;q=Marquand Preview]. See [[Arthur W. Burks|Burks, Arthur W.]], "Review: Charles S. Peirce, ''The new elements of mathematics''", ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society'' v. 84, n. 5 (1978), pp. 913–18, see 917. [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183541145 PDF Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[vacuum tube]]s replaced relays for logic operations. [[Lee De Forest]]'s modification, in 1907, of the [[Fleming valve]] can be used as an [[AND gate]]. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] introduced a version of the 16-row [[truth table]] as proposition 5.101 of ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' (1921). [[Walther Bothe]], inventor of the [[coincidence circuit]], shared the 1954 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics, for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924.

[[Mechanical computer|Mechanical]] [[analog computer]]s started appearing in the first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations. In [[World War II]], mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first electronic [[Digital data|digital]] computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern [[personal computer]]s (PCs).&lt;ref&gt;In 1946, [[ENIAC]] required an estimated 174&amp;nbsp;kW. By comparison, a modern laptop computer may use around 30&amp;nbsp;W; nearly six thousand times less. {{cite web |url = http://www.upenn.edu/computing/provider/docs/hardware/powerusage.html |title = Approximate Desktop &amp; Notebook Power Usage |publisher = University of Pennsylvania |accessdate = 20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] was an [[electromechanical computer]] designed by [[Konrad Zuse]]. Finished in 1941, it was the world's first working [[Computer programming|programmable]], fully automatic digital computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = A Computer Pioneer Rediscovered, 50 Years On|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/news/20iht-zuse.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = April 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its operation was facilitated by the invention of the vacuum tube in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]].

At the same time that digital calculation replaced analog, purely [[electronic circuit]] elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents. The [[bipolar junction transistor]] was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.

At the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Lavington|first = Simon|title = A History of Manchester Computers|year = 1998|edition = 2|publisher = The British Computer Society|location = Swindon|pages = 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first [[Transistor computer|transistorised computer]] and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]], and a second version was completed there in April 1955.

While working at [[Texas Instruments]] in July 1958, [[Jack Kilby]] recorded his initial ideas concerning the [[integrated circuit]] then successfully demonstrated the first working integrated on 12 September 1958.&lt;ref name="TIJackBuilt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml |title=The Chip that Jack Built |date=2008 |publisher=Texas Instruments |access-date=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new technique allowed for quick, low-cost fabrication of complex circuits by having a set of [[electronic circuit]]s on one small plate ("chip") of [[semiconductor material]], normally [[silicon]].

In the early days of integrated circuits, each chip was limited to only a few transistors, and the low degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple. Manufacturing yields were also quite low by today's standards. As the technology progressed, millions, then billions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Peter Clarke |title=Intel enters billion-transistor processor era |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172301051 |work=EE Times |date=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; of transistors could be placed on one chip, and good designs required thorough planning, giving rise to [[Integrated circuit design|new design methods]].

==Properties==
An advantage of digital circuits when compared to analog circuits is that signals represented digitally can be transmitted without degradation caused by [[noise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Horowitz]] and Winfield Hill, ''The Art of Electronics 2nd Ed.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989 {{ISBN|0-521-37095-7}} page 471&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a continuous audio signal transmitted as a sequence of 1s and 0s, can be reconstructed without error, provided the noise picked up in transmission is not enough to prevent identification of the 1s and 0s.

In a digital system, a more precise representation of a signal can be obtained by using more binary digits to represent it.  While this requires more digital circuits to process the signals, each digit is handled by the same kind of hardware, resulting in an easily [[Scalability|scalable]] system. In an analog system, additional resolution requires fundamental improvements in the linearity and noise characteristics of each step of the [[signal chain]].

With computer-controlled digital systems, new functions to be added through software revision and no hardware changes.  Often this can be done outside of the factory by updating the product's software.  So, the product's design errors can be corrected after the product is in a customer's hands.

Information storage can be easier in digital systems than in analog ones.  The noise immunity of digital systems permits data to be stored and retrieved without degradation.  In an analog system, noise from aging and wear degrade the information stored.  In a digital system, as long as the total noise is below a certain level, the information can be recovered perfectly. Even when more significant noise is present, the use of [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] permits the recovery of the original data provided too many errors do not occur.

In some cases, digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to accomplish the same tasks, thus producing more heat which increases the complexity of the circuits such as the inclusion of heat sinks.  In portable or battery-powered systems this can limit use of digital systems. For example, battery-powered cellular telephones often use a low-power analog front-end to [[amplifier|amplify]] and [[tuner (electronics)|tune]] in the [[radio]] signals from the base station.  However, a base station has grid power and can use power-hungry, but very flexible [[software radio]]s.  Such base stations can be easily reprogrammed to process the signals used in new cellular standards.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

Digital circuits are sometimes more expensive, especially in small quantities.

Most useful digital systems must translate from continuous analog signals to discrete digital signals.  This causes [[quantization error]]s. Quantization error can be reduced if the system stores enough digital data to represent the signal to the desired degree of [[fidelity]].  The [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]] provides an important guideline as to how much digital data is needed to accurately portray a given analog signal.

In some systems, if a single piece of digital data is lost or misinterpreted, the meaning of large blocks of related data can completely change.  Because of the [[cliff effect]], it can be difficult for users to tell if a particular system is right on the edge of failure, or if it can tolerate much more noise before failing.

Digital fragility can be reduced by designing a digital system for robustness.  For example, a [[parity bit]] or other [[Error correction and detection|error management method]] can be inserted into the signal path.  These schemes help the system detect errors, and then either [[error detection and correction|correct the errors]], or at least ask for a new copy of the data.  In a state-machine, the state transition logic can be designed to catch unused states and trigger a reset sequence or other error recovery routine.

Digital memory and transmission systems can use techniques such as error detection and correction to  use additional data to correct any errors in transmission and storage.

On the other hand, some techniques used in digital systems make those systems more vulnerable to single-bit errors. These techniques are acceptable when the underlying bits are reliable enough that such errors are highly unlikely.

A single-bit error in audio data stored directly as [[linear pulse code modulation]] (such as on a [[CD-ROM]]) causes, at worst, a single click. Instead, many people use [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] to save storage space and download time, even though a single-bit error may corrupt the entire song.

==Construction==
[[File:relogio binario.JPG|thumb|A [[binary clock]], hand-wired on [[breadboard]]s]]
A digital circuit is typically constructed from small electronic circuits called [[logic gate]]s that can be used to create [[combinational logic]].  Each logic gate is designed to perform a function of [[boolean logic]] when acting on logic signals.  A logic gate is generally created from one or more electrically controlled switches, usually [[transistors]] but [[thermionic valves]] have seen historic use. The output of a logic gate can, in turn, control or feed into more logic gates.

[[Integrated circuit]]s consist of multiple transistors on one silicon chip, and are the least expensive way to make large number of interconnected logic gates. Integrated circuits are usually designed by engineers using [[electronic design automation]] software (see below for more information) to perform some type of function.

Integrated circuits are usually interconnected on a [[printed circuit board]] which is a board which holds electrical components, and connects them together with copper traces.

==Design==

Each logic symbol is represented by a different shape. The actual set of shapes was introduced in 1984 under IEEE/ANSI standard 91-1984. "The logic symbol given under this standard are being increasingly used now and have even started appearing in the literature published by manufacturers of digital integrated circuits."&lt;ref&gt;Maini. A.K. (2007). Digital Electronics Principles, Devices and Applications. Chichester, England.: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of digital circuit is constructed from lookup tables, (many sold as "[[programmable logic device]]s", though other kinds of PLDs exist).  Lookup tables can perform the same functions as machines based on logic gates, but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the wiring.  This means that a designer can often repair design errors without changing the arrangement of wires.  Therefore, in small volume products, programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution.  They are usually designed by engineers using electronic design automation software.

When the volumes are medium to large, and the logic can be slow, or involves complex algorithms or sequences, often a small [[microcontroller]] is [[computer program|programmed]] to make an [[embedded system]].  These are usually programmed by [[software engineering|software engineers]].

When only one digital circuit is needed, and its design is totally customized, as for a factory production line controller, the conventional solution is a [[programmable logic controller]], or PLC.  These are usually programmed by electricians, using [[ladder logic]].

===Structure of digital systems===

Engineers use many methods to minimize logic functions, in order to reduce the circuit's complexity.  When the complexity is less, the circuit also has fewer errors and less electronics, and is therefore less expensive.

The most widely used simplification is a minimization algorithm like the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]]{{update inline|date=May 2017|reason=This correctly describes the situation around 1995. Does it still hold true more than twenty years later? If not, this needs updating/expansion.}} within a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] system, although historically, [[binary decision diagrams]], an automated [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]], [[truth table]]s, [[Karnaugh map]]s, and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] have been used.

====Representation====
Representations are crucial to an engineer's design of digital circuits.  Some analysis methods only work with particular representations.

The classical way to represent a digital circuit is with an equivalent set of [[logic gates]].  Another way, often with the least electronics, is to construct an equivalent system of electronic switches (usually [[transistor]]s).  One of the easiest ways is to simply have a memory containing a truth table.  The inputs are fed into the address of the memory, and the data outputs of the memory become the outputs.

For automated analysis, these representations have digital file formats that can be processed by computer programs.  Most digital engineers are very careful to select computer programs ("tools") with compatible file formats.

====Combinational vs. Sequential====
To choose representations, engineers consider types of digital systems.  Most digital systems divide into "[[Combinational logic|combinational systems]]" and "[[Sequential logic|sequential systems]]."  A combinational system always presents the same output when given the same inputs.  It is basically a representation of a set of logic functions, as already discussed.

A sequential system is a combinational system with some of the outputs fed back as inputs.  This makes the digital machine perform a "sequence" of operations.  The simplest sequential system is probably a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]], a mechanism that represents a [[binary number system|binary]] [[Numerical digit|digit]] or "[[bit]]".

Sequential systems are often designed as [[state machine]]s.  In this way, engineers can design a system's gross behavior, and even test it in a simulation, without considering all the details of the logic functions.

Sequential systems divide into two further subcategories. [[synchronous system|"Synchronous" sequential systems]] change state all at once, when a "clock" signal changes state.  [[asynchronous system|"Asynchronous" sequential systems]] propagate changes whenever inputs change.  Synchronous sequential systems are made of well-characterized asynchronous circuits such as flip-flops, that change only when the clock changes, and which have carefully designed timing margins.

====Synchronous systems====
[[File:JohnsonCounter2.png|thumb|A 4-bit ring counter using D-type flip flops is an example of synchronous logic. Each device is connected to the clock signal, and update together.]]
{{main|synchronous logic}}
The usual way to implement a synchronous sequential state machine is to divide it into a piece of combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register."  Each time a clock signal ticks, the state register captures the feedback generated from the previous state of the combinational logic, and feeds it back as an unchanging input to the combinational part of the state machine.  The fastest rate of the clock is set by the most time-consuming logic calculation in the combinational logic.

The state register is just a representation of a binary number.  If the states in the state machine are numbered (easy to arrange), the logic function is some combinational logic that produces the number of the next state.

====Asynchronous systems====
As of 2014, most digital logic is synchronous because it is easier to create and verify a synchronous design&lt;!-- reference: Dieter Knollman http :// dknollman.122mb.com/simulator_test/Conclusion.htm --&gt;. However, asynchronous logic is thought can be superior because its speed is not constrained by an arbitrary clock; instead, it runs at the maximum speed of its logic gates. Building an asynchronous system using faster parts makes the circuit faster.

Nevertherless, most systems need circuits that allow external unsynchronized signals to enter synchronous logic circuits.  These are inherently asynchronous in their design and must be analyzed as such. Examples of widely used asynchronous circuits include synchronizer flip-flops, switch [[debounce]]rs and [[arbiter (electronics)|arbiters]].

Asynchronous logic components can be hard to design because all possible states, in all possible timings must be considered.  The usual method is to construct a table of the minimum and maximum time that each such state can exist, and then adjust the circuit to minimize the number of such states.  Then the designer must force the circuit to periodically wait for all of its parts to enter a compatible state (this is called "self-resynchronization"). Without such careful design, it is easy to accidentally produce asynchronous logic that is "unstable," that is, real electronics will have unpredictable results because of the cumulative delays caused by small variations in the values of the electronic components.

====Register transfer systems====
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|Example of a simple circuit with a toggling output. The inverter forms the combinational logic in this circuit, and the register holds the state.]]
Many digital systems are data flow machines.  These are usually designed using synchronous [[Register transfer level|register transfer logic]], using [[hardware description language]]s such as [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]].

In register transfer logic, binary [[number]]s are stored in groups of flip flops called [[processor register|registers]].  The outputs of each register are a bundle of wires called a "[[computer bus|bus]]" that carries that number to other calculations.  A calculation is simply a piece of combinational logic.  Each calculation also has an output bus, and these may be connected to the inputs of several registers.  Sometimes a register will have a [[multiplexer]] on its input, so that it can store a number from any one of several buses.  Alternatively, the outputs of several items may be connected to a bus through [[3-state|buffers]] that can turn off the output of all of the devices except one.  A sequential state machine controls when each register accepts new data from its input.

Asynchronous register-transfer systems (such as computers) have a general solution. In the 1980s, some researchers discovered that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs by using first-in-first-out synchronization logic.  In this scheme, the digital machine is characterized as a set of data flows.  In each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the outputs of that step are valid, and presents a signal that says, "grab the data" to the  stages that use that stage's inputs.  It turns out that just a few relatively simple synchronization circuits are needed.

====Computer design====
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|Intel 80486DX2 [[microprocessor]]]]
The most general-purpose register-transfer logic machine is a [[computer]].  This is basically an [[automaton|automatic]] binary [[abacus]]. The [[control unit]] of a computer is usually designed as a [[microprogram]] run by a [[microsequencer]].  A microprogram is much like a  player-piano roll.  Each table entry or "word" of the microprogram commands the state of every bit that controls the computer.  The sequencer then counts, and the count addresses the memory or combinational logic machine that contains the microprogram.  The bits from the microprogram control the [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[memory]] and other parts of the computer, including the microsequencer itself. A "specialized computer" is usually a conventional computer with special-purpose control logic or microprogram.

In this way, the complex task of designing the controls of a computer is reduced to a simpler task of programming a collection of much simpler logic machines.

Almost all computers are synchronous.  However, true asynchronous computers have also been designed. One example is the Aspida [[DLX]] core.&lt;ref name=aspida&gt;{{cite web|title=ASODA sync/async DLX Core|url=http://opencores.org/project,aspida|website=OpenCores.org|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was offered by [[ARM Holdings]]. Speed advantages have not materialized, because modern computer designs already run at the speed of their slowest component, usually memory.  These do use somewhat less power because a clock distribution network is not needed.  An unexpected advantage is that asynchronous computers do not produce spectrally-pure radio noise, so they are used in some mobile-phone base-station controllers. They may be more secure in cryptographic applications because their electrical and radio emissions can be more difficult to decode.&lt;ref name=arm-asynch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter|title=ARM Offers First Clockless Processor Core|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1299083|website=eetimes.com|publisher=UBM Tech (Universal Business Media)|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer architecture====
[[Computer architecture]] is a specialized engineering activity that tries to arrange the registers, calculation logic, buses and other parts of the computer in the best way for some purpose.  Computer architects have applied large amounts of ingenuity to computer design to reduce the cost and increase the speed and immunity to programming errors of computers.  An increasingly common goal is to reduce the power used in a battery-powered computer system, such as a cell-phone.  Many computer architects serve an extended apprenticeship as microprogrammers.

====Design issues in digital circuits====

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

Digital circuits are made from analog components.  The design must assure that the analog nature of the components doesn't dominate the desired digital behavior.  Digital systems must manage noise and timing margins, parasitic inductances and capacitances, and [[electronic filter|filter]] power connections.

Bad designs have intermittent problems such as "glitches", vanishingly fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "[[runt pulse]]s" that do not reach valid "threshold" voltages, or unexpected  ("undecoded") combinations of logic states.

Additionally, where clocked digital systems interface to analog systems or systems that are driven from a different clock, the digital system can be subject to [[metastability in electronics|metastability]] where a change to the input violates the set-up time for a digital input latch. This situation will self-resolve, but will take a random time, and while it persists can result in invalid signals being propagated within the digital system for a short time.

Since digital circuits are made from analog components, digital circuits calculate more slowly than low-precision analog circuits that use a similar amount of space and power.  However, the digital circuit will calculate more repeatably, because of its high noise immunity.  On the other hand, in the high-precision domain (for example, where 14 or more bits of precision are needed), analog circuits require much more power and area than digital equivalents.

===Automated design tools===

To save costly engineering effort, much of the effort of designing large logic machines has been automated.  The computer programs are called "[[electronic design automation]] tools" or just "EDA."

Simple truth table-style descriptions of logic are often optimized with EDA that automatically produces reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still produce the desired outputs. The most common example of this kind of software is the [[Minilog|Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]].

Most practical algorithms for optimizing large logic systems use [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm|algebraic manipulations]] or [[binary decision diagram]]s, and there are promising experiments with [[genetic algorithm]]s and [[Simulated annealing|annealing optimizations]].

To automate costly engineering processes, some EDA can take [[state table]]s that describe [[state machine]]s and automatically produce a truth table or a [[function table]] for the [[combinational logic]] of a state machine.  The state table is a piece of text that lists each state, together with the conditions controlling the transitions between them and the belonging output signals.

It is common for the function tables of such computer-generated state-machines to be optimized with logic-minimization software such as [[Minilog]].

Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using a "tool flow."  The tool flow is usually a "script," a simplified computer language that can invoke the software design tools in the right order.

Tool flows for large logic systems such as [[microprocessor]]s can be thousands of commands long, and combine the work of hundreds of engineers.

Writing and debugging tool flows is an established engineering specialty in companies that produce digital designs.  The tool flow usually terminates in a detailed computer file or set of files that describe how to physically construct the logic.  Often it consists of instructions to draw the [[transistors]] and wires on an integrated circuit or a [[printed circuit board]].

Parts of tool flows are "debugged" by verifying the outputs of simulated logic against expected inputs.  The test tools take computer files with sets of inputs and outputs, and highlight discrepancies between the simulated behavior and the expected behavior.

Once the input data is believed correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness.  Some tool flows verify designs by first producing a design, and then scanning the design to produce compatible input data for the tool flow.  If the scanned data matches the input data, then the tool flow has probably not introduced errors.

The functional verification data are usually called "test vectors". The functional test vectors may be preserved and used in the factory to test that newly constructed logic works correctly.  However, functional test patterns don't discover common fabrication faults.  Production tests are often designed by software tools called "[[Automatic test pattern generation|test pattern generators]]". These generate test vectors by examining the structure of the logic and systematically generating tests for particular faults. This way the [[fault coverage]] can closely approach 100%, provided the design is properly made testable (see next section).

Once a design exists, and is verified and testable, it often needs to be processed to be manufacturable as well.  Modern integrated circuits have features smaller than the wavelength of the light used to expose the photoresist.  Manufacturability software adds interference patterns to the exposure masks to eliminate open-circuits, and enhance the masks' contrast.

===Design for testability===

There are several reasons for testing a logic circuit. When the circuit is first developed, it is necessary to verify that the design circuit meets the required functional and timing specifications. When multiple copies of a correctly designed circuit are being manufactured, it is essential to test each copy to ensure that the manufacturing process has not introduced any flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Brown S &amp; Vranesic Z. (2009). Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design. 3rd ed. New York, N.Y.: Mc Graw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large logic machine (say, with more than a hundred logical variables) can have an astronomical number of possible states.  Obviously, in the factory, testing every state is impractical if testing each state takes a microsecond, and there are more states than the number of microseconds since the universe began.  This ridiculous-sounding case is typical.

Large logic machines are almost always designed as assemblies of smaller logic machines.  To save time, the smaller sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for test" circuitry, and are tested independently.

One common test scheme known as "scan design" moves test bits serially (one after another) from external test equipment through one or more serial [[shift register]]s known as "scan chains".  Serial scans have only one or two wires to carry the data, and minimize the physical size and expense of the infrequently used test logic.

After all the test data bits are in place, the design is reconfigured to be in "normal mode" and one or more clock pulses are applied, to test for faults (e.g. stuck-at low or stuck-at high) and capture the test result into flip-flops and/or latches in the scan shift register(s).  Finally, the result of the test is shifted out to the block boundary and compared against the predicted "good machine" result.

In a board-test environment, serial to parallel testing has been formalized with a standard called "[[JTAG]]" (named after the "Joint Test Action Group" that made it).

Another common testing scheme provides a test mode that forces some part of the logic machine to enter a "test cycle."  The test cycle usually exercises large independent parts of the machine.

===Trade-offs===

Several numbers determine the practicality of a system of digital logic: cost, reliability, [[fanout]] and speed.  Engineers explored numerous electronic devices to get a favourable combination of these personalities.

====Cost====

The cost of a logic gate is crucial, primarily because very many gates are needed to build a computer or other advanced digital system and because the more gates can be used, the more able and/or respondent the machine can become. Since the bulk of a digital computer is simply an interconnected network of logic gates, the overall cost of building a computer correlates strongly with the price per logic gate. In the 1930s, the earliest digital logic systems were constructed from telephone relays because these were inexpensive and relatively reliable. After that, electrical engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switches that could still fulfill the requirements.

The earliest integrated circuits were a happy accident. They were constructed not to save money, but to save weight, and permit the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] to control an [[inertial guidance system]] for a spacecraft. The first integrated circuit logic gates cost nearly $50 (in 1960 dollars, when an engineer earned $10,000/year). To everyone's surprise, by the time the circuits were mass-produced, they had become the least-expensive method of constructing digital logic. Improvements in this technology have driven all subsequent improvements in cost.

With the rise of [[integrated circuits]], reducing the absolute number of chips used represented another way to save costs. The goal of a designer is not just to make the simplest circuit, but to keep the component count down. Sometimes this results in more complicated designs with respect to the underlying digital logic but nevertheless reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption.  A major motive for reducing component count on printed circuit boards is to reduce the manufacturing defect rate and increase reliability, as every soldered connection is a potentially bad one, so the defect and failure rates tend to increase along with the total number of component pins.

For example, in some logic families, [[Negated AND gate|NAND gates]] are the simplest digital gate to build.  All other logical operations can be implemented by NAND gates. If a circuit already required a single NAND gate, and a single chip normally carried four NAND gates, then the remaining gates could be used to implement other logical operations like [[logical and]].  This could eliminate the need for a separate chip containing those different types of gates.

====Reliability====

The "reliability" of a logic gate describes its mean time between failure (MTBF).  Digital machines often have millions of logic gates.  Also, most digital machines are "optimized" to reduce their cost.  The result is that often, the failure of a single logic gate will cause a digital machine to stop working.  It is possible to design machines to be more reliable by using redundant logic which will not malfunction as a result of the failure of any single gate (or even any two, three, or four gates), but this necessarily entails using more components, which raises the financial cost and also usually increases the weight of the machine and may increase the power it consumes.

Digital machines first became useful when the MTBF for a switch got above a few hundred hours.  Even so, many of these machines had complex, well-rehearsed repair procedures, and would be nonfunctional for hours because a tube burned-out, or a moth got stuck in a relay.  Modern transistorized integrated circuit logic gates have MTBFs greater than 82 billion hours (8.2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;hours),&lt;ref&gt;MIL-HDBK-217F notice 2, section 5.3, for 100,000 gate 0.8 micrometre CMOS commercial ICs at 40C; failure rates in 2010 are better, because line sizes have decreased to 0.045 micrometres, and fewer off-chip connections are needed per gate.&lt;/ref&gt; and need them because they have so many logic gates.

====Fanout====

Fanout describes how many logic inputs can be controlled by a single logic output without exceeding the electrical current ratings of the gate outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Kleitz , William. (2002). Digital and Microprocessor Fundamentals: Theory and Application. 4th ed. Upper Saddler Reviver, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  The minimum practical fanout is about five.  Modern electronic logic gates using [[CMOS]] transistors for switches have fanouts near fifty, and can sometimes go much higher.

====Speed====

The "switching speed" describes how many times per second an inverter (an electronic representation of  a "logical not" function) can change from true to false and back.  Faster logic can accomplish more operations in less time.  Digital logic first became useful when switching speeds got above 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], because that was faster than a team of humans operating mechanical calculators.  Modern electronic digital logic routinely switches at 5&amp;nbsp;[[gigahertz|GHz]] (5&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz), and some laboratory systems switch at more than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Terahertz (unit)|THz]] (1&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz).

===Logic families===
{{main | logic family}}

Design started with [[relay]]s. Relay logic was relatively inexpensive and reliable, but slow. Occasionally a mechanical failure would occur. Fanouts were typically about 10, limited by the resistance of the coils and arcing on the contacts from high voltages.

Later, [[vacuum tube]]s were used. These were very fast, but generated heat, and were unreliable because the filaments would burn out. Fanouts were typically 5...7, limited by the heating from the tubes' current. In the 1950s, special "computer tubes" were developed with filaments that omitted volatile elements like silicon. These ran for hundreds of thousands of hours.

The first [[semiconductor]] logic family was [[resistor–transistor logic]]. This was a thousand times more reliable than tubes, ran cooler, and used less power, but had a very low [[fan-in]] of 3. [[Diode–transistor logic]] improved the fanout up to about 7, and reduced the power. Some DTL designs used two power-supplies with alternating layers of NPN and PNP transistors to increase the fanout.

[[Transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) was a great improvement over these. In early devices, fanout improved to 10, and later variations reliably achieved 20. TTL was also fast, with some variations achieving switching times as low as 20&amp;nbsp;ns. TTL is still used in some designs.

[[Emitter coupled logic]] is very fast but uses a lot of power. It was extensively used for high-performance computers made up of many medium-scale components (such as the [[Illiac IV]]).

By far, the most common digital integrated circuits built today use [[CMOS|CMOS logic]], which is fast, offers high circuit density and low-power per gate. This is used even in large, fast computers, such as the [[IBM System z]].

In 2009, researchers discovered that [[memristor]]s can implement a boolean state storage (similar to a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]], [[Logical consequence|implication]] and logical [[Inverse (logic)|inversion]]), providing a complete logic family with very small amounts of space and power, using familiar CMOS semiconductor processes.&lt;ref&gt;Eero Lehtonen, Mika Laihom, "Stateful implication logic with memristors", Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures
IEEE Computer Society Washington, DC, USA ©2009 [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1936814&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=72875680&amp;CFTOKEN=56667661 Accessed 2011-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[superconductivity]] has enabled the development of [[rapid single flux quantum]] (RSFQ) circuit technology, which uses [[Josephson junction]]s instead of transistors. Most recently, attempts are being made to construct purely [[optical computing]] systems capable of processing digital information using [[nonlinear]] optical elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3264">'''Discrete manufacturing''' is the production of distinct items. [[Automobile]]s, [[furniture]], [[toys]], [[smartphones]], and [[airplanes]] are the examples of discrete manufacturing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26228_01/doc.93/e21777.pdf | title = JD Edwards World Product Data Management - Discrete Guide | accessdate = 2013-07-15 | date = April 2013 | format = PDF | publisher = Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting products are easily identifiable and differ greatly from [[process manufacturing]] where the products are undifferentiated, for example [[oil]], [[natural gas]] and [[salt]].
[[Image:Hyundai car assembly line.jpg|thumb|300px|A discrete manufacturing assembly line at the [[Hyundai Motor Company]]'s automobile factory in [[Ulsan]], [[South Korea]].]]
Discrete manufacturing is often characterized by individual or separate [[unit production]].  Units can be produced in low volume with very high complexity or high volumes of low complexity.  Low volume/high complexity production results in the need for an flexible manufacturing system that can improve quality and [[time-to-market]] speed while [[cost cutting|cutting costs]]. High volume/low complexity production puts high premiums on [[inventory control]]s, [[lead time]]s and reducing or limiting [[material costs|materials costs]] and [[waste reduction|waste]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Industry Profile - Discrete Manufacturing includes makers of consumer electronics, computer and accessories, appliances, and other household items, as well as "big ticket” consumer and commercial goods like cars and airplanes. Discrete Manufacturing companies make physical products that go directly to businesses and consumers, and assemblies that are used by other manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elementk.com/orgMain.asp?storyid=412&amp;orgid=334/{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The processes deployed in discrete manufacturing are not continuous in nature. Each process can be individually started or stopped and can be run at varying production rates. The final product may be produced out of single or multiple inputs. Producing a [[steel]] structure will need only one type of raw material - steel. Producing a mobile phone requires many different inputs, The plastic case, LCD display, the mainboard, PVC keypad, sockets, cables are made from different materials, at different places. This is different from [[Process manufacturing]] like production of paper or petroleum refining, where the end product is obtained by a continuous process or a set of continuous processes.

Production capacity of the factory as a whole in discrete manufacturing is impossible to calculate. It is the question of common sense that how can one calculate the production capacity of its multiple characterize different products because the production time and machine setups of the parts produced are different from each other.

The '''Eight-Foot High Speed Tunnel''', also known as '''Eight-Foot Transonic Tunnel''', was a [[wind tunnel]] located in Building 641 of [[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. It was a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name=NHL_Withdrawal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/withdrawn/8foottunnel.htm|title=Withdrawal Nomination for Eight-Foot High Speed Tunnel|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel was completed in 1936 at a cost of $36,266,000. Because of its high speed and [[Bernoulli's principle]], the pressure in the test section is much lower than that in the rest of the tunnel. This required a structure that could withstand an inward force due to the pressure difference. Instead of steel construction, it was built from [[reinforced concrete]] with walls up to 1&amp;nbsp;ft (0.3 m) thick. This resulted in an "[[igloo]]-like" structure at the test section. The wind tunnel was designed as a single-return tunnel capable of moving air at speeds up to a [[Mach number]] up to 0.75. It was powered by an {{convert|8000|hp|abbr=on}} electric motor. It was repowered to {{convert|16000|hp|abbr=on}} to give Mach number 1 capability in 1945. In 1947, the speed was increased to a Mach number of 1.2 with the installation of a contoured nozzle. In 1950, a slotted-throat test section was installed, and it was repowered to {{convert|25000|hp|abbr=on}}. 

Because it was the first continuous-flow high-speed tunnel, this tunnel was a landmark in wind tunnel design. This meant it could operate almost indefinitely to produce a high-speed airstream approaching the [[speed of sound]]. And it was large enough to accommodate large-scale models and even full-scale aircraft sections. 

[[Image:EightFootHighSpeedTunnelDestruction.png|thumb|left|Destruction of Building 641, 2011 photo courtesy of NASA Langley]]
In 1950, the tunnel was the first in the world to be modified to incorporate a slotted throat design. This revolutionary design gave researchers their first accurate data on airframe performance in the [[transonic]] range. The tunnel was deactivated in 1956, when a new {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}} tunnel was built near it.

The wind tunnel was used for critical tests that validated the [[area rule]] for the design of [[supersonic aircraft]]. This said that the fuselage of the aircraft should narrow at the wings and expand at their trailing edges. This resulted in "wasp-waisted" aircraft. 

The tunnel was taken out of service in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html#8FT NASA Langley's National Historic Landmarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185106/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite document|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eight-Foot High Speed Tunnel / Eight-Foot Transonic Tunnel|url={{NHLS url|id=85002798}} |format=pdf|date=May 15, 1984|author=Harry A.

The landmark designation was withdrawn in 2014, and it was removed from the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name=NHL_Withdrawal/&gt;

There are additional photographs of the wind tunnel in the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=hhphoto&amp;fileName=va/va1700/va1795/photos/browse.db&amp;action=browse&amp;recNum=0&amp;title2=NASA%20Langley%20Research%20Center,%208-Foot%20High%20Speed%20Wind%20Tunnel,%20641%20Thornell%20Avenue,%20Hampton,%20VA&amp;displayType=1&amp;itemLink=D?hh:18:./temp/~ammem_RfcM:: HAER photographs of the wind tunnel].&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is a [[fermion]], no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state]], in accordance with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].&lt;ref name="curtis74"/&gt; Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]]: they can collide with other particles and can be [[electron diffraction|diffracted]] like light. The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.

Electrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitation]]al, [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].&lt;ref name="anastopoulos1" /&gt; Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, it will generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.

Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.&lt;ref name=Pauling/&gt; In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.&lt;ref name="arabatzis"/&gt; Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt;  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron–positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.

===Discovery of effect of electric force===
The [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur. Along with [[lightning]], this phenomenon is one of humanity's earliest recorded experiences with [[Electricity#History|electricity]].&lt;ref name="DictOrigins" /&gt; In his 1600 treatise {{lang|la|[[De Magnete]]}}, the English scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] coined the [[New Latin]] term {{lang|la|electricus}}, to refer to this property of attracting small objects after being rubbed.&lt;ref name="Baigrie1" /&gt; Both ''electric'' and ''electricity'' are derived from the Latin ''{{lang|la|ēlectrum}}'' (also the root of the [[electrum|alloy of the same name]]), which came from the Greek word for amber, {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ēlektron}}'').

===Discovery of two kinds of charges===
In the early 1700s, [[Francis Hauksbee]] and French chemist [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay|Charles François du Fay]] independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two [[Aether theories|electrical fluids]], ''vitreous'' and ''resinous'', that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined.&lt;ref&gt;

Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit [[electric charge]]s.&lt;ref name="farrar"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1846, German physicist [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|William Weber]] theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was governed by the [[Inverse-square law|inverse square law]]. After studying the phenomenon of [[electrolysis]] in 1874, Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] suggested that there existed a "single definite quantity of electricity", the charge of a [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[ion]]. He was able to estimate the value of this elementary charge ''e'' by means of [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;

Stoney initially coined the term ''electrolion'' in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to ''electron'' to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: "... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest the name ''electron''". A 1906 proposal to change to ''electrion'' failed because [[Hendrik Lorentz]] preferred to keep ''electron''.&lt;ref&gt;

The German physicist [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] studied electrical conductivity in [[wikt:rarefied|rarefied]] gases: in 1869, he discovered a glow emitted from the [[cathode]] that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure. In 1876, the German physicist [[Eugen Goldstein]] showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays [[cathode ray]]s. During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir [[William Crookes]] developed the first cathode ray tube to have a [[vacuum|high vacuum]] inside.&lt;ref name="dekosky"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the [[anode]]. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged.&lt;ref name="leicester"&gt;

The German-born British physicist [[Arthur Schuster]] expanded upon Crookes' experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an [[electric potential]] between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of [[Electric current|current]], in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the [[Mass-to-charge ratio|charge-to-mass ratio]]&lt;!-- Note: the older sources list charge-to-mass rather than the modern mass-to-charge ratio --&gt; of the ray components. However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.&lt;ref name="leicester"/&gt;

In 1892 [[Hendrik Lorentz]] suggested that the mass of these particles (electrons) could be a consequence of their electric charge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Wilczek: "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=happy-birthday-electron Happy Birthday, Electron]" ''Scientific American'', June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying naturally [[Fluorescence|fluorescing]] minerals in 1896, the French physicist [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials became the subject of much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] who discovered they emitted particles.

The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Harvey Fletcher]] in their [[Oil drop experiment|oil-drop experiment]] of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team,&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt; using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by [[Abram Ioffe]], who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;

By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the [[spectral line]]s of the hydrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;

De Broglie's prediction of a wave nature for electrons led [[Erwin Schrödinger]] to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the [[Schrödinger equation]], successfully described how electron waves propagated.&lt;ref&gt;

This approach led to a second formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1928, building on Wolfgang Pauli's work, [[Paul Dirac]] produced a model of the electron&amp;nbsp;– the [[Dirac equation]], consistent with [[Principle of relativity|relativity]] theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;

This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the electron.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particle was discovered in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]], who proposed calling standard electrons ''negatons'' and using ''electron'' as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.

In 1947 [[Willis Lamb]], working in collaboration with graduate student [[Robert Retherford]], found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other; the difference came to be called the [[Lamb shift]]. About the same time, [[Polykarp Kusch]], working with [[Henry M. Foley]], discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac's theory. This small difference was later called [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of the electron. This difference was later explained by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], developed by [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and
[[Richard Feynman]] in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;

The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the [[self-energy]] of the electron tending to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Shpolsky]], Atomic physics (Atomnaia fizika), second edition, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Observation of a single electron in a [[Penning trap]] suggests the upper limit of the particle's radius to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The classical electron radius is derived as follows. Assume that the electron's charge is spread uniformly throughout a spherical volume. Since one part of the sphere would repel the other parts, the sphere contains electrostatic potential energy. This energy is assumed to equal the electron's [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], defined by [[special relativity]] (''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
From [[electrostatics]] theory, the [[potential energy]] of a sphere with radius ''r'' and charge ''e'' is given by:

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]. For an electron with rest mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the rest energy is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle E_{\mathrm p} = m_0 c^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light in a vacuum. Setting them equal and solving for ''r'' gives the classical electron radius.&lt;br /&gt;

===Quantum properties===
As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the [[wave–particle duality]] and can be demonstrated using the [[double-slit experiment]].

The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function, the [[wave function]], commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (''ψ''). When the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] of this function is [[square (algebra)|squared]], it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a [[probability density function|probability density]].&lt;ref name="munowitz"&gt;{{cite book

Electrons are [[identical particles]] because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''ψ''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} −''ψ''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where the variables ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.

[[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.&lt;ref name="munowitz"/&gt;{{rp|162–218}}

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.&lt;ref name="munowitz"/&gt;{{rp|162–218}}

While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the [[Coulomb's law|coulomb force]] from the ambient [[electric field]] surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called [[vacuum polarization]]. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a [[Relative permittivity|dielectric permittivity]] more than [[1|unity]]. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron.&lt;ref name="genz"&gt;

An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called [[Compton scattering]].

The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles, such as an electron and a proton, is given by the [[fine-structure constant]]. This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or repulsion) at a separation of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy of the charge.

In the theory of [[electroweak interaction]], the [[Chirality (physics)|left-handed]] component of electron's wavefunction forms a [[weak isospin]] doublet with the [[Neutrino|electron neutrino]]. This means that during [[weak interaction]]s, electron neutrinos behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a [[charged current]] interaction by emitting or absorbing a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson|link=yes}} and be converted into the other member. Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions are responsible for the phenomenon of [[beta decay]] in a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] atom. Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a [[neutral current]] interaction via a {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0|link=yes}} exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron [[elastic scattering]].&lt;ref name="quigg"&gt;

An electron can be ''bound'' to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an [[ion]]. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an [[atomic orbital]]. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their [[spin quantum number]].

Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential.&lt;ref&gt;

The orbital angular momentum of electrons is [[Angular momentum operator#Quantization|quantized]]. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;

If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the [[triboelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;

Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed ''free'' electrons. Electrons in metals also behave as if they were free.

At a given temperature, each material has an [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] that determines the value of electric current when an [[electric potential]] is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] are poor conductors. In any [[dielectric]] material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. Most [[semiconductor]]s have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation.&lt;ref&gt;

Because of collisions between electrons and atoms, the [[drift velocity]] of electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second.

Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]],&lt;ref name="ziman" /&gt; which states that the ratio of [[thermal conductivity]] to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.&lt;ref name="durrant"&gt;

When cooled below a point called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical temperature]], materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current, in a process known as [[superconductivity]]. In [[BCS theory]], this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. These [[Cooper pair]]s have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called [[phonon]]s, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance.&lt;ref&gt;

===Motion and energy===
According to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]], as an electron's speed approaches the [[speed of light]], from an observer's point of view its [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, ''c''. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to ''c''—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than ''c'', the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called [[Cherenkov radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;

The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the [[Lorentz factor]], defined as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\gamma=1/ \sqrt{ 1-{v^2}/{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt; where ''v'' is the speed of the particle. The kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of an electron moving with velocity ''v'' is:

These photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons. Likewise, positron-electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:
: {{SubatomicParticle|photon|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|photon}} ↔ {{SubatomicParticle|positron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}
An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

For reasons that remain uncertain, during the annihilation process there was an excess in the number of particles over antiparticles.

Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of [[star]]s began to form.&lt;ref name="science5789"/&gt; Within a star, [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays.

Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the [[hydrogen spectral series]]. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;

In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of [[particle detector]]s, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge.&lt;ref name="grupen"/&gt; The development of the [[quadrupole ion trap|Paul trap]] and [[Penning trap]] allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations.

The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by [[angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]]—a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Particle accelerator]]s use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies.  These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam—a process known as the [[Sokolov–Ternov effect]].{{refn|The polarization of an electron beam means that the spins of all electrons point into one direction. In other words, the projections of the spins of all electrons onto their momentum vector have the same sign.|group=note}} Polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments. [[Synchrotron]] radiation can also [[Radiation damping|cool]] the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles.  Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies; [[particle detector]]s observe the resulting energy emissions, which [[particle physics]] studies .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[electron microscope]] directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen.

Two main types of electron microscopes exist: [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission]] and [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]]. Transmission electron microscopes function like [[overhead projector]]s, with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] or a [[charge-coupled device]].  Scanning electron microscopes [[Raster scan|rasteri]] a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.&lt;ref name="bozzola_1999"&gt;

===Other applications===
In the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL), a [[relativistic electron beam]] passes through a pair of [[undulator]]s that contain arrays of [[dipole magnet]]s whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that [[Coherence (physics)|coherently]] interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the [[resonance]] frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-[[Radiance|brilliance]] electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies, from [[microwave]]s to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Gothic architecture''' is a [[architectural style|style]] that flourished in [[Europe]] during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]]. It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th-century [[France]], it was widely used, especially for cathedrals and churches, until the 16th century.

Its most prominent features included the use of the [[rib vault]] and the [[flying buttress]], which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building, giving greater height and more space for windows.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}} Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass, and the [[rose window]], to bring light and color to the interior. Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior, particularly over the portals, to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners. These technologies had all existed in [[Romanesque architecture]], but they were used in more innovative ways and more extensively in Gothic architecture to make buildings taller, lighter and stronger.

The first notable example is generally considered to be the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, whose choir and facade were reconstructed with Gothic features. The choir was completed in 1144. The style also appeared in some civic architecture in northern Europe, notably in town halls and university buildings. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] began in mid-18th-century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.

==Name==
Gothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} ("French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVNGNIojGgMC&amp;pg=PA90|date=28 May 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66992-4|page=90|quote=The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - "[[Franks]]' work".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Gothic architecture" originated in the 16th century, and was originally very negative, suggesting barbaric. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}}

==History==
===Origins – Early Gothic (1130–1200)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic style originated in the [[Ile-de-France]] region of northern France in the first half of the 12th century. A new dynasty of French Kings, the [[Capetians]], had subdued the feudal lords, and had become the most powerful rulers in France, with their capital in Paris. They allied themselves with the bishops of the major cities of northern France, and reduced the power of the feudal abbots and monasteries. Their rise coincided with an enormous growth of the population and prosperity of the cities of northern France. The Capetian Kings and their bishops wished to build new cathedrals as monuments of their power, wealth, and religious faith.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}}

The church which served as the primary model for the style was the [[Abbey of St-Denis]], which underwent reconstruction by the Abbot [[Suger]], first in the choir and then the facade (1140–44), Suger was a close ally and biographer of the French King, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], who was a fervent Catholic and builder, and the founder of the [[University of Paris]]. Suger remodeled the ambulatory of the Abbey, removed the enclosures that separated the chapels, and replaced the existing structure with imposing pillars and [[rib vault]]s. This created created higher and wider bays, into which he installed larger windows, which filled the end of the church with light. Soon afterwards he rebuilt the facade, adding three deep portals, each with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], an arch filled with sculpture illustrating biblical stories. The new facade was flanked by two towers. He also installed a small circular [[rose window]] over the central portal. This design became the prototype for a series of new French cathedrals.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=17–18}}

[[Sens Cathedral]] (begun between 1135 and 1140) was the first Cathedral to be built in the new style (St. Denis was an abbey, not a Cathedral). Other versions of the new style soon appeared in [[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun 1150); [[Laon Cathedral]] (begun 1165); and the most famous of all, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], where construction had begun in 1160.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=20–22}}

The Gothic style was also adapted by some French monastic orders, notably the [[Cistercian]] order under [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]] It was used in an austere form without ornament at the new Cistercian [[Abbey of Fontenay]] (1139–1147) and the church of [[Clairvaux Abbey]], whose site is now occupied by a French prison.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=24–26}}

The new style was also copied outside the Kingdom of France in the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. Early examples of Norman Gothic included [[Coutances Cathedral]] (1210–1274); [[Bayeux Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque style in 12th century), [[Le Mans Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque 12th century) and [[Rouen Cathedral]]. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to [[England]] and spread from there to [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=36}} The Gothic style did not immediately replace the Romanesque everywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}} The Late Romanesque continued to flourish in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufens]] and [[Rhineland]].

===High Gothic (1200–1270)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the gothic style spread from the Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France. New structures in the style included [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}} At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The early type of [[rib vault]] used of Saint Denis and Notre Dame, with six parts, was modified to four parts, making it simpler and stronger. Amiens and Chartres were among the first to use the [[flying buttress]]; the buttresses were strengthened by an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinnacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and of the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels. The transept of Notre-Dame was rebuilt with the new technology, and two spectacular rose windows added.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}}

===Rayonnant Gothic (1250–1370s)===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

File:Rose du transept Sud Notre-Dame de Paris 170208 04.jpg|Exterior of south rose window of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (about 1250)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period was termed ''[[Rayonnant]]'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass. The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], the chapel attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]]. An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. Whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lace-like framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

===Flamboyant Gothic (1350–1550)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Flamboyant]] Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect. Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (1448 c.).{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=37}} Subsequently, the style spread to Northern Europe. Notable example of Flamboyant Gothic in the Baltic region includes the [[Brick Gothic]] [[Church of St. Anne, Vilnius|Church of St. Anne]] in [[Vilnius]] (1490s).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based on the model of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was a combined public market and courthouse; which was also the basis of the plan of the Romanesque cathedral. The cathedral is in the form of a Latin cross. The entrance is traditionally on the west end, has three portals decorated with sculpture, usually a rose window, and is flanked by two towers. The long nave, where the congregation worshiped, occupies the west end. This is usually divided from the nave by rows of pillars, which support the roof, flanked by one or two aisles, called ''collaérals''. There are usually small chapels on the two sides, placed between the buttresses, which provide additional support to the walls.

The cathedral usually has a [[transept]], a crossing, roughly in the middle, which sometimes projects outwards some distance, and in other cases, such as Notre-Dame, is minimal. The ''croisée'' or crossing of the transept, is the center of the church, and is surrounded by particularly massive pillars, which sometimes support a lantern tower, which brings light into the center of the cathedral. The north and south facades of the transept often feature rose windows, as at [[Notre Dame de Paris]].

To the east of the transept is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], where the altar is located, where ceremonies take place, and where only the clergy was allowed. This space grew greatly in the 12th century, as ceremonies became more elaborate. Behind the choir is single or double a walkway called the [[ambulatory]]. At the eastern end of the church is the [[apse]] usually in the form of a half-circle, and the chevet. There is usually a chapel here dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which can be very large. Around chevet there are usually several other smaller chapels.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=18–19}}

The earlier Gothic cathedrals had four levels, from the floor to the roof. On the ground floor there were two rows grand arcades with large pillars, which received the weight of the vaults of the ceiling. Above these were the tribunes, a section of arched openings, giving more support. Above these was the ''triforium'', a section of small arches. On the top level, just below the vaults, were the upper windows, the main source of light for the Cathedral.The lower walls were supported by massive ''contreforts'' or buttresses placed directly up against them, with pinnacles on top which provided additional weight.

Later, with the development of the flying buttress, the supports moved further away from the walls, and the walls were built much higher. Gradually the tribunes and the triforium disappeared, and the walls above the arcades were occupied almost entirely with stained glass.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=33}}

The eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections, both choir and presbytery. It is often square ended or has a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In France the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an [[ambulatory]] and sometimes a ring of chapels called a "[[chevet]]". While German churches are often similar to those of France, in Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow apsidal chapel containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swaan&gt;Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic feature of the Gothic style, domestic and ecclesiastical alike, is the division of interior space into individual cells according to the building's ribbing and vaults, regardless of whether or not the structure actually has a vaulted ceiling. This system of cells of varying size and shape juxtaposed in various patterns was again totally unique to antiquity and the [[Early Middle Ages]] and scholars, Frankl included, have emphasised the mathematical and geometric nature of this design. Frankl in particular thought of this layout as "creation by division" rather than the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]'s "creation by addition." Others, namely [[Viollet-le-Duc]], [[Wilhelm Pinder]], and [[August Schmarsow]], instead proposed the term "articulated architecture."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}} The opposite theory as suggested by [[Henri Focillon]] and [[Jean Bony]] is of "spacial unification", or of the creation of an interior that is made for sensory overload via the interaction of many elements and perspectives.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}} Interior and exterior partitions, often extensively studied, have been found to at times contain features, such as thoroughfares at window height, that make the illusion of thickness. Additionally, the [[pier (architecture)|pier]]s separating the isles eventually stopped being part of the walls but rather independent objects that jut out from the actual aisle wall itself.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=17}}

===The pointed arch and the rib vault===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Both the pointed arch and the rib vault had been used in [[romanesque architecture]], but Gothic builders refined them and used them to much greater effect. They made the structures lighter and stronger, and thus allowed the great heights and expanses of stained glass found in Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the barrel vaults that supported the roof pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. The pointed or broken arch, introduced during the Romanesque period, was stronger, lighter, and carried the thrust outwards, rather than directly downwards.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

The rib vault took advantage of the strength of the pointed arch. The vault was supported by thin ribs or arches of stone, which reached downwards and outwards to cluster around supporting pillars along the inside of the walls. The earlier rib vaults, used at Notre Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was improved, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vault was used at Amiens, Reims, and the other later cathedrals, and eventually at cathedrals across Europe.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In the later period of the Gothic style, the rib vaults lost their elegant simplicity, and were loaded with additional ribs, sculptural designs, and sometimes pendants and other purely decorative elements.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

===Flying buttress===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Another important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone abutments placed directly against the walls, The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.

In the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rain water off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50–51}}

In the late Gothic periods the buttresses became extremely ornate, with a large amount of non-functional decoration in the form of pinnacles, curving arches, counter-curves, statuary and ornamental pendants.

===Height===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

Beauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

One of the most prominent features of Gothic architecture was the use of stained glass window, which steadily grew in height and size and filled cathedrals with light and color. Historians including Viollet-le-Duc, Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvořák]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}

Religious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of Religious [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[The Celestial Hierarchy]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.

Many earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed Cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Swaan/&gt;

The main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of colored glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.

The stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the Bible, but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

Much of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

===Portals and the tympanum===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Early Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: "The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers."{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}

The portals and interiors were much more colorful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colors codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinopole'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''guelues'' meant charity or victory; blue, or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the color of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west facade, and this general plan was copied at Notre-Dame and most of the early cathedrals. The towers of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], 69 meters (226&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, were intended to be seen throughout the city; they were the tallest towers in Paris until the completion of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1889. An informal but vigorous competition began in northern France for the tallest Cathedral towers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95–98}}

To make the churches taller and more prominent, and visible from a distance, heir builders often added a ''flèche'', a spire usually made of wood and covered with lead, to the top of each tower, or, as in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], in the center of the transept. Later in the Gothic period, more massive towers were constructed over the transept, rivaling or exceeding in height the towers of the facade.

The towers were usually the last part of the Cathedral to be constructed. They were often built many years or decades after the rest of the building. Sometimes, by the time the towers were built, the plans had changed, or the money had run out. As a result, some Gothic cathedrals had just one tower, or two towers of different heights or styles. On the other hand, [[Laon Cathedral]], begun just before Notre-Dame, boasted five towers; two on the facade, two on the transept, and a central lantern. An additional two were planned but not built. The [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen]] originally built in the Romanesque style, was rebuilt with nine Gothic towers in the 13th century.

The informal competition for the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church in Europe]] went on throughout the Gothic period, sometimes with disastrous results. [[Beauvais Cathedral]] had the tallest tower (153 meters or 502 feet), completed in 1569, for a brief time, until its tower collapsed in the wind in 1573. [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (159.7 meters or 524 feet) also had the record from 1311 until 1549 until its tower also collapsed. Today the tallest cathedral tower in France is [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Cologne Cathedral]] (151.0 meters or 495 feet) is the tallest cathedral in Europe.

The Gothic [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] (1087–1314) had been the tallest cathedral in England until it was destroyed by the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Today the tallest combined Gothic tower and spire in the UK belongs to [[Salisbury Cathedral]], (123 meters or 404 feet), built 1220–1258.

In [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In [[France]] and [[Spain]], two towers on the front is the norm. In [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]] in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]], completed in 1890 and possessing the tallest spire in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtS2iD79NgEC|title=Cathedrals|author=Oggins, R.O.|year=2000|work=Metrobooks|publisher=Friedman/Fairfax Publishers|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest spire that was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1950812_2018362,00.html|title=A Brief History of the World's Tallest Buildings|publisher=Time Magazine|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as "Books for the poor." To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Viollet-le-Duc, Eugéne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonné de l'architecture Française du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[last judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as "the pillars of the church." {{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

Each Saint had his own symbol; a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]]; an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpete, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate theirfunction at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the Garden of Eden; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] vividly illustrates the [[Last Judgement]], with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|Strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The ''strix'' appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.&lt;ref name=fasti&gt;Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131–, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97–99}}

The [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Many of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], during the 19th century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic Cathedrals of France.

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99–100}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

From the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.

In [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms.Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and spires; spires and spires sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].

In the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress were rarely used, replaced by heavy abutments with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In the South of France, the Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south. They generally had a single nave or two or three of equal height. Some Gothic cathedrals in the Midi took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282–1480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colorful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

The facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including colored marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=34–35}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220–1320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the "Geometric" style (1250–90) and the "Curvilinear" style (1290–1350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs which were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380–1520) was final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by moldings, which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry IV chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503–07).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

A distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and ''Lady Chapels'' tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included ''[[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]]'' ( ca. 1233–1283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).

[[Prague]], in the region [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing center for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Empire, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of [[Prague]]'s [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly-decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357–1367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=221–230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting [[transept]]s. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swaan /&gt; [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in 1248 and took, with interruptions, until 1880 to complete&amp;nbsp;– a period of over 600 years.

[[Brick Gothic]] ({{Lang-de|Backsteingotik}}, {{Lang-pl|Gotyk ceglany}}) is a specific style common in [[Northern Europe]], especially in Northern Germany, Poland and in the regions around the [[Baltic Sea]] without natural rock resources. Prime examples of brick gothic include [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk]] (1379–1502),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|title=Historia Bazyliki Mariackiej w Gdańsku|work=www.bazylikamariacka.pl|accessdate=2009-11-23|language=pl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031174354/http://www.bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|archive-date=31 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] (1290–1365) and [[Malbork Castle]] (13th century).

[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] (1339–1365) has the distinctive feature of a polychrome roof. Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-colored [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic Cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Strikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].
The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at [[Leon Cathedral]], typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE---&gt;

In the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the [[transept]] and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.

The most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Basílica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].

The most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa María de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castelló Cathedral]] and [[El Fadrí]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.

[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=147}}

The [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203–1217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[Cîteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

The Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of "''armonìa''", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.

Italian Cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; [[Florence Cathedral]] (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were general not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a claire-voie with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivaled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

A distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick façade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The façades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The facade of [[Orvieto Cathedral]], begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the Baptistry of Florence, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330–1336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=161–175}}

Italian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the Baptistery of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1259–60), and in [[Siena Cathedral]]; and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of Pisa Cathedral (1284–85).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=152–176}}

While cathedrals were the most prominent structures in the Gothic style, Gothic features were also built for many monasteries across Europe. Prominent examples were built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictines]] in England, France, and Normandy. They were the builders of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]], and [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]] in [[France]]. Later Benedictine projects (constructions and renovations) include [[Rouen]]'s [[Church of St. Ouen, Rouen|Abbey of Saint-Ouen]],the Abbey [[La Chaise-Dieu]], and the choir of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in France.

English examples are [[Westminster Abbey]], originally built as a [[Benedictine]] order monastic church; and the reconstruction of [[Canterbury Cathedral|the Benedictine church at]] [[Canterbury]]. The [[Cistercian Order|Cistercians]] spread the style as far east and south as [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=28}} Smaller orders such as the [[Carthusian order|Carthusians]] and [[Premonstratensians]] also built some 200 churches, usually near cities.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=29–30}} The [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] also carried out a transition to Gothic in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Teutonic Order]], a military order, spread Gothic art into [[Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], and the Baltic region.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=30}}

The earliest example of Gothic architecture in Germany is [[Maulbronn Monastery]], a Romanesque [[Cistercian]] abbey in southwest Germany whose [[narthex]] was built in the early 12th century by an anonymous architect.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}}

[[Batalha Monastery]] (1386–1517) is a Dominican monastery in [[Batalha, Portugal]]. The monastery was built in the [[Flamboyant Gothic]] style to thank the [[Virgin Mary]] for the Portuguese victory over the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385.

The Gothic style appeared in palaces in France, including the Papal Palace in Avignon and the [[Palais de la Cité]] in Paris, close to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1119, which was the principal residence of the French Kings until 1417. Most of the Palais de la Cité is gone, but two of the original towers along the Seine, of the towers, the vaulted ceilings of the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (1302), (now in the [[Conciergerie]]; and the original chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], can still be seen.{{sfn|Texier|2012|p=12}}

The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and in modern Belgium, in [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=64}}

Notable Gothic civil architecture in Spain includes the [[Llotja de la Seda|Silk Exchange]] in [[Valencia]], Spain (1482–1548), a major marketplace, which features a main hall with twisting columns beneath its vaulted ceiling. Another Spanish Gothic landmark is the [[Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite|Palace of the Kings of Navarre]] in [[Olite]] (1269–1512), which combining the features of a palace and a fortress.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first universities in Europe were closely associated with the Catholic church, and in the late 15th century they adapted variations of the Gothic style for their architecture. The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.

By the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], Poland.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66–67}}

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337–1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=38}}

==Decline==
Beginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520–1552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532–1560), rivaled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24–26}}

The Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term "Gothic" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Molière]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism..."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].

Nonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of [[St Columb's Cathedral|Derry Cathedral]] (completed 1633), [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|Sligo Cathedral]] (c. 1730), and [[Down Cathedral]] (1790–1818) are other notable examples.&lt;ref&gt;-Bob Hunter [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/transcripts/pa01_t06.shtml "Londonderry Cathedtral"]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], including [[Tom Tower]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], by [[Christopher Wren]] (1681–82) It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in [[Horace Walpole]]'s [[Twickenham]] [[villa]], [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749–1776) The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass "low church" as well as "high church" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855–1885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].

The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.

The middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].

While some credit for this new ideation can reasonably be assigned to German and English writers, namely [[Johannes Vetter]], Franz Mertens, and Robert Willis respectively, this emerging style's champion was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], whose lead was taken by archaeologists, historians, and architects like [[Jules Quicherat]], [[Auguste Choisy]], and [[Marcel Aubert]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=11}} In the last years of the 19th century, a trend among study in art history emerged in Germany that a building, as defined by [[Henri Focillon]] was an interpretation of space.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=13}} When applied to Gothic cathedrals, historians and architects used to the dimensions of 17th and 18th [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] or [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structures, were astounded by the height and extreme length of the cathedrals compared to its proportionally modest width. [[Goethe]], in the preceding century, was mesmerised by the space within a Gothic church and succeeding historians like [[Georg Dehio]], Walter Ueberwasser, [[Paul Frankl]], and Maria Velte sought to rediscover the methodology used in their construction by making measurements and drawings of the buildings, and reading and making conjectures from documents and treaties pertaining to their construction.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}}

France had an abundance of original Gothic architecture, and therefore Gothic restoration largely replaced revival; few new buildings appeared in the Gothic style.

The [[French Revolution]] caused enormous damage to the Gothic architecture of France. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and other cathedrals and churches were closed and stripped of much of their decoration. In the 1830s, under the new King, [[Louis-Philippe]], the historic and artistic value of Cathedrals and other Gothic monuments was recognized. Interest in the Gothic style was also stimulated by the huge success of the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'' (known in English as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'') by [[Victor Hugo]], published in 1831. The writings of the romantic author [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] also played an important part; he praised the religious sentiments inspired by of the Gothic style, and declaring that the Gothic style was "the true architecture of our country," as important in the history of France as the forests of ancient Gaul.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}} A Commission of Historic Monuments was created in 1837, and major program of cataloging, protection and restoration of Gothic monuments was organized by the writer [[Prosper Merimée]] and conducted largely by the architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}}

[[Viollet-le-Duc]] conducted the restoration of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and many other churches, as well as the Gothic fortifications of [[Carcasonne]] and imaginatively finishing the castle of [[Château de Pierrefonds]], which had been only a ruin.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014}} He did not always limit himself to strict restoration of what had existed; in 1838 he designed he built a new Gothic west facade for the Parish church of Saint-Ouen in [[Rouen]]. The architects [[Franz Christian Gau]] and then [[Théodore Ballu]] built [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|The Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde]] (1846–57), the first entirely neo-Gothic church in Paris.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=101}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Gothic revival was born in 1785–86 in the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]], an early landscape garden built by near [[Potsdam]], in the garden of the country house of [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau]], designed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff]]. The ''Gothic House'' displayed his collection of medieval stained glass. It inspired other Gothic-style country houses near Berlin and Kassel. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

In Germany, the early 19th century Gothic revival had close ties to the movement of [[Romanticism]]. Beginning in 1814, the writer and historian [[Joseph Gorres]] launched a movement for the completion [[Cologne cathedral]], which had been halted in 1473. The work was begun in 1842, and the two towers were completed in 1880, six hundred years after the cathedral was begun. Similar projects were undertaken for [[Ulm Minster]], [[Heilsbronn Abbey]] and the [[Isartor]] gate in Munich. The Baroque decoration of these monuments was removed, and they were returned to at least an approximation, sometimes romanticized, of their original Gothic appearance. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

The most picturesque example of Gothic revival is [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] (1869–1876) in Bavaria built by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. For inspiration, Ludwig visited other Gothic reconstruction projects, [[Warburg]] and [[Château de Pierrefonds]], a castle which had been reconstructed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]. The highly romantic Neuschwanstein Castle inspired, among other later buildings, the Sleeping Beauty Castle in [[Disneyland]] (1955).

Though Russia had no tradition of Gothic architecture, The Empress [[Catherine the Great]] chose the style in [[Tsaritsyno Palace]], a large palace complex she constructed south of Moscow from 1776 until her death in 1796. Later, Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] commissioned the German romantic writer and painter [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] to design a Gothic chapel for his park at [[Peterhof Palace]] near St. Petersburg. It was completed in 1834.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic revival in Italy focused on the completion of earlier Cathedrals, which had been largely left to crumble. The most striking example was [[Milan Cathedral]], which received a new facade in 1806–1813 which almost completely covered the original; it was designed by Giuseppe Zanoia and [[Carlo Amati]]. In 1888 it received a Gothic crown on the front facade by [[Giuseppe Brentano]]. The famous spires and pinnacles of the building date to the 19th century.{{sfn|Toman|2007|page=123}}

A small but notable example of Gothic revival in Italy is the [[Pedrocchi Café]] in Padua, Italy (1837), by [[Giuseppe Jappelli]]. It borrowed the [[Venetian Gothic]] style plus the pinnacles of Milan Cathedral. It became famous as the meeting place of Italian patriots rebelling against Austrian rule in 1848.

The English Gothic revival style was imported from England beginning in the 1830s, and was used primarily for Anglican and Catholic churches, and for university buildings. The best-known Gothic revival buildings in Canada are those [[Centre Bloc]] and the [[Victoria Tower (Canada)|Victoria Tower]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa, by [[Thomas Fuller (architect)|Thomas Fuller]] (1859–1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624082557/http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |archivedate=2015-06-24 |df= }} List of Dominion Architects of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[William Thomas (architect)|William Thomas]] constructed [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in Toronto (1845–48), and several other Gothic revival churches in the Province of [[Ontario]].

The Gothic style was entirely contrary to the early [[Puritan]] architecture in the United States, which valued simplicity and a lack of ornament. It was also contrary to the Neoclassical style used for early U.S. government buildings. However, in the mid to late 19th century, large cathedrals and churches began to be built in the Gothic Revival style, modeled after European cathedrals. University buildings also adopted the style, using English colleges as a model. In the early 20th century, Gothic decorative elements appeared on the towers of the new skyscrapers, notably the [[Woolworth Building]] by [[Cass Gilbert]] in New York and the [[Chicago Tribune Building]] in [[Chicago]], by [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]], symbolizing the role of these buildings as "cathedrals of commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Christen, Barbara S. and Flanders, Steven (editors).

''Raymond Hood, Architect – Form Through Function in the American Skyscraper''. Architectural Book Publishing Co Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic architecture also inspired a popular style of residential architecture in the United States in the mid-19th century. It was known as [[Carpenter Gothic]], and featured pointed [[lancet windows]], a steep gable roof, and other simple Gothic elements, embellished with wooden ornament cut with a [[Jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]] or a [[scroll saw]] in Gothic designs. Sometimes the wooden trim was attached to a brick house. It became a popular style for wooden churches in rural communities. An example of Carpenter Gothic house, the [[American Gothic House]], in [[Eldon, Iowa]] appears in the background of the celebrated painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' by [[Grant Wood]], and gave the painting its name.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Fineman, Mia (June 8, 2005).

In the 19th century the Gothic style of church architecture was transported to Latin America by the Spanish and Portuguese, where it became a symbol of Christian values and traditions. It was also exported to Asia, largely for the churches of the European settlements there. The English Gothic style was a major influence in Australia, both for churches and civic buildings. [[Perth Town Hall]] (1867–70) was the only town hall in Australia (or perhaps anywhere) constructed by convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Delys (1969) ''100 years : a history of the Perth Town Hall'' originally printed in the [[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]]'s Journal. – reprinted by the Perth city council in 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basilica of the Twenty-Six Holy Martyrs of Japan (Nagasaki)|Basilica of the Twenty=Six Holy Martyrs]] (1879) was an enlargement of the first Christian church in Japan, which had been built in 1864. It survived the dropping of an atomic bomb on [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945. The plan was taken from a Belgian model, and the stained glass was imported from France.

The [[Templo Expiatorio del Santísimo Sacramento|Church of the Holy Sacrament]] in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico was begun in 1897, but construction was halted by the [[Mexican Revolution]], and it was not completed until 1972.

[[St. Ignatius Cathedral|Shanghai Cathedral]] in [[China]] (1906–1910) was originally built by the [[Jesuits]] as their primary church in the trading port of Shanghai. In 1966, at the opening of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] from Beijing vandalized the [[cathedral]], tearing down its [[spire]]s and ceiling, and smashing its roughly 300 square meters of stained glass. For the next ten years the Cathedral served as a state-owned grain warehouse. It was reopened in 1978 and the spires were restored in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-tm-china29jul16,1,1569645.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true_no=1 Jesus in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the city of [[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay) has a rich collection of neo-Gothic architecture. The style is found in the University buildings, the courthouse, and in the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station]] (former Victoria Terminus), the main railway station.

==Influences==
===Political===
The roots of the Gothic style lie in those towns that, since the 11th century, had been enjoying increased prosperity and growth, began to experience more and more freedom from traditional [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority.{{sfn|Mitchell|1968|p=9}} At the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms. The area encompassing modern [[Germany]], southern [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]] and much of northern [[Italy]] (excluding [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Papal State]]) was nominally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but local rulers exercised considerable autonomy under the system of [[Feudalism]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] were independent kingdoms, as was the [[Angevin Empire]], whose [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet kings]] ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and large domains in what was to become modern [[France]].{{efn|Section from "''L'art Gothique''," translated into English: "England was one of the first regions to adopt, during the first half of the 12th century, the new Gothic architecture born in France. Historic relationships between the two countries played a determining role: in 1154, Henry II (1154–1189) became the first of the Anjou Plantagenet kings to ascend to the throne of England."}} [[Norway]] came under the influence of [[England]], while the other Scandinavian countries and [[Poland]] were influenced by trading contacts with the [[Hanseatic League]]. [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings brought the Gothic tradition from France to [[Southern Italy]], while [[Lusignan]] kings introduced [[French Gothic]] architecture to [[Cyprus]]. Gothic art is sometimes viewed as the art of the era of feudalism but also as being connected to change in medieval social structure, as the Gothic style of architecture seemed to parallel the beginning of the decline of feudalism.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=20, 24}} Nevertheless, the influence of the established feudal elite can be seen in the [[Chateaux]] of French lords and in those churches sponsored by feudal lords.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns,&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JH1&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''&lt;/ref&gt; and they would come to be predominate in Europe by the end of the 13th century.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}} Germany and the [[Low Countries]] had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other or united for mutual weal, as in the Hanseatic League. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and [[bishops]], rather than grand [[town hall]]s for their [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burghers]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Viollet-le-Duc contended that the blossoming of the Gothic style came about as a result of growing freedoms in construction professions.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

The primary use of the Gothic style is in religious structures, naturally leading it to an association with the Church and it is considered to be one of the most formal and coordinated forms of the physical church, thought of as being the physical residence of God on Earth. According to [[Hans Sedlmayr]], it was "even the considered the temporal image of [[Paradise]], of the [[New Jerusalem]]." The horizontal and vertical scope of the Gothic church, filled with the light thought of as a symbol of the grace of God admitted into the structure via the style's iconic windows are among the very best examples of Christian architecture. [[Louis Grodecki|Grodecki]]'s ''[[#{{sfnref|Grodecki|1977}}|Gothic Architecture]]'' also notes that the glass pieces of various colors that make up those windows have been compared to "precious stones encrusting the walls of the New Jerusalem," and that "the numerous towers and pinnacles evoke similar structures that appear in the visions of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]]." Another idea, held by [[Georg Dehio]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], is that the designs of Gothic followed the current theological scholastic thought.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}} The [[PBS]] show [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] explored the influence of the [[Bible]] in the dimensions and design of some cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Building the Great Cathedrals|series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]|last1=Tiffany|first1=Scott|last2=Tinworth|first2=Rob|last3=Barako|first3=Tristian|network=[[PBS]]|date=19 October 2010|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/building-gothic-cathedrals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic===
[[File:Durham Cathedral. Interior.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The transition from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to Gothic styles is visible at the [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[England]], where both pointed and round arches are used in the cathedral's design.]]
 
From the 10th to the 13th century, [[Romanesque architecture]] had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as [[England]] and [[Spain]] produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto López, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}}

The local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In [[France]], [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration. England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features. In [[northern Germany]], [[Netherlands]], northern [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]] – called {{lang|pl|Gotyk ceglany}} in [[Poland]] and {{lang|de|Backsteingotik}} in [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] – is also associated with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In [[Italy]], stone was used for [[fortifications]], so brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated façade so that this might be achieved at a later date. The availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in [[Scandinavia]]. Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammerbeam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was earlier incorporated into [[Islamic architecture]] following the [[Islamic conquest of Syria|Islamic conquests of]] [[Roman Syria]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in [[Roman Architecture|Late Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture; within the Roman context, evidenced in early church building in [[Syria]] and occasional secular structures, like the Roman [[Karamagara Bridge]]; in [[Sassanid]] architecture, in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction.&lt;ref name=Warren1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=John|year=1991|title=Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture|periodical=Muqarnas|volume=8|pages=59–65 (61–63)|doi=10.2307/1523154|jstor=1523154|publisher=BRILL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11). Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, pp. 295-296. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-203-20387-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the pointed arch seems to have taken off dramatically after its incorporation into Islamic architecture. It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress|Al-Ukhaidir Palace]] (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]] in 780 AD, the [[White Mosque, Ramla|Ramlah Cisterns]] (789 AD), the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (851 AD), and the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba in 987 AD. [[David Talbot Rice]] points out that, "The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing military and cultural contacts with the [[Muslim world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Certainly, in those parts of the [[Western Mediterranean]] subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and later Gothic traditions with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] decorative forms, for example in [[Monreale Cathedral|Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s, the [[Alcázar of Seville]], and [[Teruel Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, L.

A number of scholars have cited the [[Armenia]]n [[Cathedral of Ani]], completed 1001 or 1010, as a possible influence on the Gothic, especially due to its use of pointed arches and cluster [[pier (architecture)|piers]].{{sfn|Lang|1980|p=223|ps=: "With this experience behind him, it is not surprising that [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]]'s creation of the Cathedral at [[Ani]] turned out to be a masterpiece.

Already, pointed arches and clustered piers, whose appearance together is considered one of the hallmarks of mature Gothic architecture, are found in this remote corner of the Christian East."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kite|first=Stephen|title='South Opposed to East and North': Adrian Stokes and Josef Strzygowski. A study in the aesthetics and historiography of Orientalism|journal=[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]|date=September 2003|volume=26|issue=4|p=519|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0141-6790.2003.02604002.x/full|quote=To Near Eastern scholars the [[Armenia]]n [[Ani Cathedral|cathedral at]] [[Ani]] (989–1001), designed by [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]] (972–1036), seemed to anticipate Gothic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stewart|1959|p=80|ps=: "The most important examples of [[Armenian architecture]] are to be found at [[Ani]], the capital, and the most important of these is [[Ani Cathedral|the cathedral]]. [...] The most interesting features of this building are its pointed arches and vaults and the clustering or coupling of the columns in the Gothic manner."}}{{sfn|Rice|1972|p=179|ps=: "The interior of [[Ani Cathedral|Ani cathedral]], a longitudinal stone building with pointed vaults and a central dome, built about 1001, is astonishingly Gothic in every detail, and numerous other equally close parallels could be cited."}} However, other scholars such as [[Sirarpie Der Nersessian]], who rejected this notion as she argued that the pointed arches did not serve the same function of supporting the vault.{{sfn|Garsoïan|2015|p=300}} [[Lucy Der Manuelian]] contends that some [[Armenians]] (historically documented as being in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]){{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=37}} could have brought the knowledge and technique employed at Ani to the west.{{sfn|Der Manuelian|2001|p=7}}

The view held by the majority of scholars however is that the pointed arch evolved naturally in Western Europe as a structural solution to a technical problem, with evidence for this being its use as a stylistic feature in Romanesque French and English churches.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}

The company’s products are built on top of its Mobility Intelligence Platform, which analyzes the locations, [[Quality of Experience]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=20462720] Bloomberg Businessweek, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; context, and lifestyles of subscribers in mobile operator’s network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universityspinoff.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/groundhog-technologies-mit/ Groundhog Technologies (MIT) selected by China Unicom]&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligence about [[geolocation]] is then applied to improve subscribers’ experience &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/4g-lte/groundhog-boasts-3g-4g-oss-deal/d/d-id/707137 Groundhog Boasts 3G/4G OSS Deal] LightReading&lt;/ref&gt; and enable applications such as [[geomarketing]] and [[geotargeting]]. The Company has leveraged its platform to enable operators to address the advertising and [[data monetization]] opportunity both internally and in partnership with third party retailers, advertisers, and ad networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalshingle.mit.edu/node/401] MIT Digital Shingle Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Technologies==
Groundhog Technologies launched its Mobility Intelligence platform based on [[Chaos Theory]] and multi-dimensional modeling.  The application of Chaos Theory gave rise to the company’s mathematical models of subscribers' mobility and usage behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management system and method for wireless communication network and associated user interface|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/7747254|website=Justia Patents|publisher=Justia Patents|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for different applications such as by mobile operators to optimize networks according to the user demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System with user interface for network planning and mobility management optimization in a mobile communication network and method thereof|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/7561876|website=Justia Patents|publisher=Justia Patents|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Groundhog Technologies Chaos Theory.png|thumb|right|Human moving pattern in phase space]]
According to Chaos Theory, some seemly random or chaotic signals may be converted to analyze in [[phase space]] which can reveal the patterns behind it. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior shows patterns around an [[attractor]] in the phase space. Based on the attractor in the phase space, data can be utilized from different space, time, and individuals for modeling and indoor geolocation.

It is also found that the dimensional structure and characteristics of phase space can naturally neutralize the bias of positioning (based on techniques such as [[triangulation]] or trilateration) caused by reasons such as multipath. That is, although each input is biased in some way, the observation from different dimensions and angles are biased in different ways. Combining multi-dimensional input in the phase space, based on the [[Law of Large Numbers]] it can average out the bias with different samples through dimensions, time, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System for constructing a mobility model for use in mobility management in a wireless communication system and method thereof|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/8031676|website=Justia Patents|publisher=Justia Patents|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">In motion picture technology—either [[film]] or [[video]]—'''high frame rate''' ('''HFR''') refers to higher [[frame rate]]s than typical prior practice.

The frame rate for motion picture film cameras was typically 24 frames per second (fps) with multiple flashes on each frame during projection to prevent flicker. Analog television and video employed [[interlaced video|interlacing]] where only half of the image (known as a [[video field]]) was recorded and played back/refreshed at once but at twice the rate of what would be allowed for progressive video of the same bandwidth, resulting in smoother playback, as opposed to [[progressive scan|progressive video]] which is more similar to how celluloid works. The field rate of analog television and video systems was typically 50 or 60 fields per second. Usage of frame rates higher than 24&amp;nbsp;FPS for feature motion pictures and  higher than 30&amp;nbsp;FPS for other applications are emerging trends in the 21st century.

==History of frame rates in cinema==

In early cinema history, there was no standard [[frame rate]] established. [[Thomas Edison]]'s early films were shot at 40&amp;nbsp;fps, while the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]] used 16&amp;nbsp;fps. This had to do with a combination of the use of a hand crank rather than a motor, which created variable frame rates because of the inconsistency of the cranking of the film through the camera. After the introduction of [[sound film|synch sound]] recording, 24&amp;nbsp;fps became the industry standard frame rate for capture and projection of motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm |title=Silent Films: What Was the Right Speed? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708155615/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 24&amp;nbsp;fps was chosen because it was the minimum frame rate that would produce adequate sound quality.  This was done because film was expensive, and using the lowest possible frame rate would use the least amount of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vanillavideo.com/blog/2012/history-frame-rates-why-speeds-vary|title=The history of frame rates; why speeds vary {{!}} Vanilla Video|website=vanillavideo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few film formats have experimented with frame rates higher than the 24&amp;nbsp;fps standard. The original 3-strip [[Cinerama]] features of the 1950s ran at 26&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr1.htm |title=The Cinerama Wing |publisher=Widescreen Museum |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two [[Todd-AO]] 70mm features, ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955) and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956) were shot and projected at 30&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingto1.htm |title=The Todd-AO / 70mm Wing 1 |publisher=Widescreen Museum |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Trumbull|Douglas Trumbull's]] 70mm [[Showscan]] film format operated at 60&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2011/showscan/index.htm |title=Showscan: The Best 70mm I have ever seen |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IMAX HD]] (high definition in this case meaning high definition [[film stock]], as [[70mm]] IMAX is the highest resolution motion picture image in the world) film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]'', presented at [[Seville Expo '92]], was shot and projected at 48&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref name="NFB Seville"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/07/23/the-nfb-and-world-fairs-pt-4-seville-and-expo-92/ | title=The NFB and World Fairs, pt. 4: Seville and Expo 92 | publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] | work=NFB.ca Blog | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=June 12, 2012 | author=St-Pierre, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMAX HD has also been used in film-based theme park attractions, including Disney's [[Soarin' Over California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Imax-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=IMAX Corporation – Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Maxivision 48]] format ran 35mm film at 48&amp;nbsp;fps, but was never commercially deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2011/01/more_than_ever_the_future_of_f.html |title=After 3D, here is the future of film &amp;#124; Roger Ebert's Journal &amp;#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Blogs.suntimes.com |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406042108/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2011/01/more_than_ever_the_future_of_f.html |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] has published a document outlining recommended practice for high frame rate digital cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcimovies.com/Recommended_Practice/ |title=High Frame Rates Digital Cinema Recommended Practice |publisher=Dcimovies.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document outlines the frame rates and resolutions that can be used in high frame rate digital theatrical presentations with currently available equipment.

==Usage in the film industry==
[[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], beginning with ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' in December 2012, used a shooting and projection frame rate of 48 frames per second, becoming the first feature film with a [[wide release]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyn Giardina | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/showeast-2012-major-exhibitors-sign-387289|title=Showeast 2012: Major Exhibitors Sign for High Frame-Rate 'Hobbit' Despite Format Challenges| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 7, 2012|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 2013 sequel, ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'' and 2014 sequel, ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', followed suit. All films also have versions which are converted and projected at 24&amp;nbsp;fps.

In 2016, [[Ang Lee]] released ''[[Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (film)|Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk]]''. Unlike ''The Hobbit'' trilogy, which used 48 frames per second, the picture shot and projected selected scenes in 120 frames per second, which is five times faster than the 24 frames per second standard used in Hollywood.

RocketJump's ''[[Video Game High School]]'' was the first web series to use HFR, and the first content shot and edited in a mixed frame rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Liberman | url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/video-game-high-school-2-first-online-production-high-frame-rate/|title=‘Video Game High School 2′ Will Be First Online Production Using High Frame Rate| website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=May 30, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series, which follows the lives of high school students in a world where gamers are revered as pro-athletes, adopted HFR in its second season, using the standard 24 frames per second for real world interactions, and 48 frames per second for "in-game" action sequences. Although the content is available on [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], it can only be viewed in mixed frame rate using a special player on RocketJump's website.

Other filmmakers who intend to use the high frame rate format include [[James Cameron]] in his [[Avatar (2009 film)#Sequels|''Avatar'' sequels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyn Giardina | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-cameron-fully-intends-make-172916|title=James Cameron 'Fully Intends' to Make 'Avatar 2 and 3' at Higher Frame Rates| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andy Serkis]] in his adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyn Giardina | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andy-serkis-animal-farm-381314|title=Andy Serkis to Direct Adaptation of 'Animal Farm'| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Out of the cinema==
Frame rates higher than 24 FPS are quite common in [[Drama (film and television)|TV drama]] and [[cutscene|in-game cinematics]].

Some media players are capable of showing HFR content and almost all computers and smart devices can handle this format as well. In recent years some televisions have the ability to take normal 24&amp;nbsp;fps videos and "convert" them to HFR content by [[Motion interpolation|interpolating the motion]] of the picture, effectively creating new computer generated frames between each two key frames and running them at higher refresh rate. Some computer programs allow for that as well but with higher precision and better quality as the computing power of the PC has grown.

Motion interpolation may cause some artifacts, as a result of the computer "guessing" the frames wrong.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Hyperthermia''' is elevated body temperature due to failed [[thermoregulation]] that occurs when a  body produces or absorbs more [[heat]] than it dissipates.  Extreme temperature elevation then becomes a [[medical emergency]] requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
The most common causes include [[heat stroke]] and adverse reactions to drugs.  The former is an [[body temperature|acute temperature elevation]] caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms.  The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the [[central nervous system]]. [[Malignant hyperthermia]] is a rare complication of some types of [[general anesthesia]].

Hyperthermia differs from [[fever]] in that the body's [[Human thermoregulation#Thermoregulation in humans|temperature set point]] remains unchanged. The opposite is [[hypothermia]], which occurs when the  temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism. The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]]  ὑπέρ, ''hyper'', meaning "above" or "over", and  θέρμος, ''thermos'', meaning "hot".

==Classification== 
{{HumanTemperature}}
In humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than {{convert|37.5|–|38.3|C|F}}, depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body's  [[Thermoregulation#In humans|temperature set point]].&lt;ref name=NC08/&gt;&lt;ref name=CC09/&gt;

The [[normal human body temperature]] can be as high as {{convert|37.7|C|F}} in the late afternoon.&lt;ref name=Harrisons/&gt;  Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected.  Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above {{convert|40|C|F}} can be life-threatening.

==Signs and symptoms==
An early stage of hyperthermia can be "heat exhaustion" (or "heat prostration" or "heat stress"), whose symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse.  If the condition progresses to heat stroke, then hot, dry skin is typical&lt;ref name=Harrisons/&gt; as [[blood vessel]]s dilate in an attempt to increase heat loss.  An inability to cool the body through [[perspiration]] may cause the skin to feel dry.

Other signs and symptoms vary.  Accompanying dehydration can produce [[nausea]], vomiting, [[headaches]], and [[low blood pressure]] and the latter can lead to [[fainting]] or [[dizziness]], especially if the standing position is assumed quickly.

In severe heat stroke, there may be confused, hostile, or seemingly intoxicated behavior.  Heart rate and respiration rate will increase ([[tachycardia]] and [[tachypnea]]) as blood pressure drops and the heart attempts to maintain adequate [[Circulatory system|circulation]].  The decrease in blood pressure can then cause blood vessels to contract reflexively, resulting in a pale or bluish skin color in advanced cases.  Young children, in particular, may have [[seizures]]. Eventually, [[organ failure]], [[unconsciousness]] and [[death]] will result.

==Causes==

[[Heat stroke]] occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  In severe cases, temperatures can exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=EMS&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith  |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1187 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat stroke may be ''non-exertional'' (classic) or ''exertional''.

===Exertional===
Significant physical exertion in hot conditions can generate heat beyond the ability to cool, because, in addition to the heat,  humidity of the environment may reduce the efficiency of the body's normal cooling mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Harrisons&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Anthony Fauci| author     = Fauci, Anthony| title      = [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]| edition    = 17th| publisher  = McGraw-Hill Professional| year       = 2008| isbn       = 978-0-07-146633-2| pages      = 117–121|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human heat-loss mechanisms are limited primarily to sweating (which dissipates heat by [[evaporation]], assuming sufficiently low [[humidity]]) and [[vasodilation]] of skin vessels (which dissipates heat by [[convection]] proportional to the [[temperature]] difference between the body and its surroundings, according to [[Newton's law of cooling]]).  Other factors, such as insufficient water intake, consuming alcohol, or lack of [[air conditioning]], can worsen the problem.

The increase in body temperature that results from a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. [[Enzyme]]s involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]], reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain.

===Situational===
[[File:heat-related deaths.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|right]]
Situational heat stroke occurs in the absence of exertion. It mostly affects the young and elderly.  In the elderly in particular, it can be precipitated by medications that reduce vasodilation and sweating, such as [[anticholinergic]] drugs, antihistamines, and diuretics.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  In this situation, the body's tolerance for high environmental temperature may be insufficient, even at rest.

Heat waves are often followed by a rise in the death rate, and these 'classical hyperthermia' deaths typically involve the elderly and infirm.  This is partly because thermoregulation involves cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems which may be inadequate for the additional stress because of the existing burden of aging and disease, further compromised by medications.  During the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago, there were at least 700 heat-related deaths.  The strongest risk factors were being confined to bed, and living alone, while the risk was reduced for those with working air conditioners and those with access to transportation.  Even then, reported deaths may be underestimates as diagnosis can be misclassified as stroke or heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heat-related deaths during the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago |vauthors=Semenza JC, Rubin CH, Falter KH, Selanikio JD, Flanders WD, Howe HL, Wilhelm JL | date=July 1996 | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=335 | issue = 2  | pages=84–90 | pmid=8649494 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199607113350203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
Some drugs cause excessive internal heat production.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  The rate of drug-induced hyperthermia is higher where use of these drugs is higher.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

* Many psychotropic medications, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), and [[tricyclic antidepressants]], can cause hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  [[Serotonin syndrome]] is a rare adverse reaction to overdose of these medications or the use of several simultaneously.  Similarly, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is an uncommon reaction to [[neuroleptic]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith  |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1818 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These syndromes are differentiated by other associated symptoms, such as tremor in serotonin syndrome and "lead-pipe" muscle rigidity in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* Various stimulant drugs, including [[amphetamines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location= |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2894 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cocaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location= |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2388 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hallucinogenic drugs, including [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[LSD]], and [[MDMA]] can produce hyperthermia as an [[adverse effect]].&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* [[Malignant hyperthermia]] is a rare reaction to common anesthetic agents (such as [[halothane]]) or the paralytic agent [[succinylcholine]].  Those who have this reaction, which is potentially fatal, have a genetic predisposition.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* The use of [[anticholinergic]]s, more specifically [[muscarinic antagonist]]s are thought to cause mild hyperthermic episodes due to its parasympatholytic effects. The sympathetic nervous system a.k.a. the "Fight or Flight Response" dominates by raising catecholamine levels by the blocked action of the Rest and Digest System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patel|first=R.J.|pmid=14751484|title=Prevalence of autonomic signs and symptoms in antimuscarinic drug poisonings|journal=J. Emerg. Med.|date=January 2004|volume=26|number=1|pages=89–94|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drugs that decouple [[oxidative phosphorylation]] may also cause hyperthermia. From this group of drugs the most well known is [[2,4-Dinitrophenol]] which was used as a weight loss drug until dangers from its use became apparent.

===Personal protective equipment===
Those working in industry, in the military, or as [[Certified first responder|first responder]]s may be required to wear [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) against hazards such as chemical agents, gases, fire, small arms and even [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)]].  PPE includes a range of hazmat suits, firefighting turnout gear, body armor and [[bomb suit]]s, among others.  Depending on design, the wearer may be encapsulated in a microclimate,&lt;ref name=MicroclimateCooling&gt;{{cite web |title=Microclimate Conditioning Systems |publisher=US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center |url=http://nsrdec.natick.army.mil/media/print/MCC_Systems_Trifold.pdf |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an increase in thermal resistance and decrease in vapor permeability.  As physical work is performed, the body’s natural  thermoregulation (i.e., sweating) becomes ineffective.  This is compounded by increased work rates, high ambient temperature and humidity levels, and direct exposure to the sun.  The net effect is that desired protection from some environmental threats inadvertently increases the threat of heat stress.

The effect of PPE on hyperthermia has been noted in fighting the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|2014 Ebola virus epidemic]] in Western Africa. Doctors and healthcare workers were only able to work 40 minutes at a stretch in their protective suits, fearing heat strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/07/354230895/ebola-protective-suits-are-in-short-supply |title=Ebola Protective Suits Are In Short Supply |first=Jackie |last=Northam |publisher=National Public Radio |date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Other rare causes of hyperthermia include [[thyrotoxicosis]] and an [[adrenal gland]] tumor, called [[pheochromocytoma]], both of which can cause increased heat production.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Damage to the central nervous system, from brain hemorrhage, [[status epilepticus]], and other kinds of injury to the hypothalamus can also cause hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:fever-conceptual.svg|thumb|A summary of the differences between hyperthermia, [[hypothermia]], and fever.&lt;br /&gt;'''Hyperthermia''': Characterized on the left. Normal body temperature (thermoregulatory set-point) is shown in green, while the hyperthermic temperature is shown in red. As can be seen, hyperthermia can be considered an increase above the thermoregulatory set-point.&lt;br /&gt;'''Hypothermia''': Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while hypothermic temperature is shown in blue. As can be seen, hypothermia can be conceptualized as a decrease below the thermoregulatory set-point.&lt;br /&gt;'''Fever''': Characterized on the right: Normal body temperature is shown in green. It reads "New Normal" because the thermoregulatory set-point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic.]]

A [[fever]] occurs when the [[body temperature|core temperature]] is set higher, through the action of the pre-optic region of the [[anterior hypothalamus]]. For example, in response to a  [[bacteria]]l or [[virus|viral]] infection, certain white blood cells within the blood will release [[pyrogens]] which have a direct effect on the anterior hypothalamus, causing body temperature to rise, much like raising the temperature setting on a [[thermostat]].

In contrast, hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature rises without a change in the heat control centers.

Some of the gastrointestinal symptoms of acute exertional heat stroke, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, may be caused by barrier dysfunction and subsequent [[endotoxemia]]. Ultraendurance athletes have been found to have significantly increased plasma endotoxin levels. Endotoxin stimulates many inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Experimentally, monkeys treated with oral antibiotics prior to induction of heat stroke do not become endotoxemic.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Patrick.  Role of gastrointestinal permeability in exertional heatstroke. ''Exercise and Sport Science Reviews.'' 32(4): 185-190. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There is scientific support for the concept of a temperature set point; that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. Nervous activity in the [[Preoptic area|preoptic-anterior hypothalamus]] of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint. As the temperature that these neurons are exposed to rises above 37&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively. Cold-sensitive neurons increase their rate of electrical discharge progressively below 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=J.H.|title=Neuroscience Online: An Electronic Textbook for the Neurosciences|url=http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/|publisher=Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, The University of Texas Medical School at Houston (UTHealth)|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Hyperthermia is generally diagnosed by the combination of unexpectedly high body temperature and a history that supports hyperthermia instead of a fever.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Most commonly this means that the elevated temperature has occurred in a hot, humid environment (heat stroke) or in someone taking a drug for which hyperthermia is a known side effect (drug-induced hyperthermia).  The presence of signs and symptoms related to hyperthermia syndromes, such as extrapyramidal symptoms characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the absence of signs and symptoms more commonly related to infection-related fevers, are also considered in making the diagnosis.

If [[antipyretic|fever-reducing drugs]] lower the body temperature, even if the temperature does not return entirely to normal, then hyperthermia is excluded.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Prevention==
When ambient temperature is excessive, humans and many animals cool themselves below ambient by [[evaporative cooling]] of [[sweat]] (or other aqueous liquid; [[saliva]] in dogs, for example); this helps prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon [[humidity]]. [[Wet-bulb temperature#Wet-bulb temperature and health|Wet-bulb temperature]], which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as [[wet-bulb globe temperature]] (WBGT), which also takes [[solar radiation]] into account, give useful indications of the degree of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines. (Wet-bulb temperature is essentially the lowest skin temperature attainable by evaporative cooling at a given ambient temperature and humidity.)

A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding {{convert|35|C|F}} is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. {{As of|2012}}, wet-bulb temperatures only very rarely exceeded {{convert|30|C|F}} anywhere, although significant [[global warming]] may change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thermogeddon: Too hot for humans |first=Hazel |last=Muir |journal=New Scientist |volume=208 |issue=2783 |pages=36–39 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(10)62649-8 |date=23 October 2010 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of heat stress caused by physical exertion, hot environments, or protective equipment, prevention or mitigation by frequent rest breaks, careful hydration, and monitoring body temperature should be attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics: Heat Stress|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, in situations demanding one is exposed to a hot environment for a prolonged period or must wear protective equipment, a personal cooling system is required as a matter of health and safety.  There is a variety of active or passive personal cooling systems;&lt;ref name=MicroclimateCooling/&gt; these can be categorized by their power sources and whether they are person- or vehicle-mounted.

Because of the broad variety of operating conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user's need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of 65&amp;nbsp;°C and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities. Requirements for hazmat teams, the medical community, and workers in heavy industry vary further.

==Treatment==
The underlying cause must be removed.  Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased [[water consumption]] and resting in a cool place.  Hyperthermia that results from [[drug]] exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures.

[[Antipyretics]] (e.g., [[acetaminophen]], [[aspirin]], other [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]) have no role in the treatment of [[heatstroke]] because antipyretics interrupt the change in the [[hypothalamic]] [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]] caused by [[pyrogens]]; they are not expected to work on a healthy [[hypothalamus]] that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop [[hepatic]], [[hematologic]], and [[renal]] [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] because they may aggravate [[bleeding]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|166320|Heatstroke|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately.  Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures.  Drinking water and turning a fan or dehumidifying [[air conditioning]] unit on the affected person may improve the effectiveness of the body's evaporative cooling mechanisms ([[sweating]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Sitting in a bathtub of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a significant amount of heat in a relatively short period of time.  It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes [[vasoconstriction]] in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core.  However, a British analysis of various studies stated: "this has never been proven experimentally.  Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=J E |title=Cooling methods used in the treatment of exertional heat illness |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=503–7; discussion 507 |year=2005 |pmid=16046331 |pmc=1725271 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.013466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis concluded that iced water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  No superior cooling method has been found for ''non-exertional heat stroke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchama |first1=Abderrezak |last2=Dehbi |first2=Mohammed |last3=Chaves-Carballo |first3=Enrique |title=Cooling and hemodynamic management in heatstroke: practical recommendations |journal=Critical Care |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=R54 |year=2007 |pmid=17498312 |pmc=2206402 |doi=10.1186/cc5910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aggressive ''ice-water'' immersion remains the gold standard for ''life-threatening heat stroke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Exerc Sport Sci Rev |date=July 2007 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=141–149 |title=Cold water immersion: the gold standard for exertional heatstroke treatment |authors=Casa DJ, McDermott BP, Lee EC, Yeargin SW, Armstrong LE, Maresh CM |pmid=17620933 |doi=10.1097/jes.0b013e3180a02bec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4085/1062-6050-44.1.84 |title=Acute Whole-Body Cooling for Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia: A Systematic Review |year=2009 |last1=McDermott |first1=Brendon P. |last2=Casa |first2=Douglas J. |last3=Ganio |first3=Matthew S. |last4=Lopez |first4=Rebecca M. |last5=Yeargin |first5=Susan W. |last6=Armstrong |first6=Lawrence E. |last7=Maresh |first7=Carl M. |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=44 |pages=84–93 |pmid=19180223 |issue=1 |pmc=2629045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the body temperature reaches about {{convert|40|C|F}}, or if the affected person is unconscious or showing signs of confusion, hyperthermia is considered a [[medical emergency]] that requires treatment in a proper medical facility.  In a hospital, more aggressive cooling measures are available, including [[intravenous]] [[Fluid replacement|hydration]], [[gastric lavage]] with iced [[Saline water|saline]], and even [[hemodialysis]] to cool the blood.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Epidemiology== &lt;!-- see similar section in Heat stroke --&gt;
The frequency of environmental hyperthermia can vary significantly from year to year depending on factors such as [[heat wave]]s. Statistically, outdoor workers, including [[Farmworker|agricultural workers]], are at increased risk of experiencing heat stress and the resulting negative health effects. Between 1992 and 2006 in the United States, 68 crop workers died from heat stroke, representing a rate 20 times that of US civilian workers overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Heat-Related Deaths Among Crop Workers – United States, 1992–2006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5724a1.htm |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |volume=57 |issue=24 |pages=649–653 |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John Fritz Medal''' has been awarded annually since 1902 by the [[American Association of Engineering Societies]] for "outstanding scientific or industrial achievements". The medal was created for the 80th birthday of [[John Fritz]], who lived between 1822 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaes.org/awards|title=Awards |publisher=[[American Association of Engineering Societies]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|4|1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720165,00.html#ixzz1SYnX1LIv |title=Fritz Medal |date={{Format date|1925|4|6}} |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|7|20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Trainer | first1 = M. | title = In Memoriam: Lord Kelvin, Recipient of The John Fritz Medal in 1905 | doi = 10.1007/s00016-007-0344-4 | journal = Physics in Perspective | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–223 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
The John Fritz Medal is described by some as the Nobel Prize for engineering."[https://www1.lehigh.edu/news/lynn-beedle-world-engineer-dies-85 Lynn Beedle, `a world engineer, dies at 85.]," News Article at ''lehigh.edu,'' October 30, 2003. Accessed 2017-09-13.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Chemical Engineers, ''Chemical Engineering Progress'', Vol. 104, Nr. 7-12, 2008. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This prestigious award is given annually for notable scientific or industrial achievements. It is granted to living people, but also posthumous. Since its initiation in 1902 it has been not awarded four years. 

The John Fritz Medal board once consisted of sixteen representatives is four national societies in the fields of civil engineering, mining, metallurgical engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/90/2342/460 Award of the John Fritz Gold Medal]."

The '''Karatmeter''' is a scientific device bought and named by India-based [[Titan Company Limited]] ([[TATA Group]]) which uses [[X-rays]] to give an exact reading of the [[Colored gold|purity of]] [[gold]]. Due to its very high precision and fast result, X-ray analysis has been adopted by international agencies in [[India]] as part of the certification process used to [[hallmark]] gold. It is an accurate, non-destructive means of [[assay|testing the purity]] of gold and other related elements. X-Ray method of Gold analysis gives the purity of gold upto 10-12 microns and hence it gives the analysis of coating only.

Using this technique, the precise percentage or karat (of [[Carat (purity)|karat]]) in a solid piece of jewellery can be determined in 30 seconds. It also accurately determines the element composition of all types of gold, [[white gold]], [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[palladium]], [[rhodium]] and related [[alloy]]s.

Energy dispersive X-Ray fluorescence technology (ED-XRF) is a simple, most accurate and most economic analytical methods for the determination of the chemical composition of many types of materials. It is non-destructive and reliable, requires very little sample preparation and is suitable for solid, liquid and powdered samples. It can be used for a wide range of elements, from Chlorine (17) to Uranium (92), and provides detection limits at the sub-ppm level.

There are many models of Gold Purity Testing machines available - from portable (light weight) to industrial grade machines.

Apart from X-ray spectrometer technique, other older traditional methods are using the TouchStone and Acid to test the gold purity. But TouchStone and Acid are destructive testing - a tiny sample of gold is cut and then tested. The sample is rubbed on TouchStone and a drop of acid is put on it and the goldsmith observes the residue using a magnifying lens. Based on experience, gold smith can determine purity of sample.

* [[Greenhouse|Heated greenhouse]]
: The first description of a heated greenhouse is from the ''[[Sanga Yorok]]'', a treatise on husbandry compiled by a royal physician of the [[Joseon]] dynasty of Korea during the 1450s, in its chapter on cultivating vegetables during winter. The treatise contains detailed instructions on constructing a greenhouse that is capable of cultivating vegetables, forcing flowers, and ripening fruit within an artificially heated environment, by utilizing ''[[ondol]]'', the traditional Korean underfloor heating system, to maintain heat and humidity; cob walls to insulate heat; and semi-transparent oiled ''[[Korean paper|hanji]]'' windows to permit light penetration for plant growth and provide protection from the outside environment. The [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]] confirm that greenhouse-like structures incorporating ''ondol'' were constructed to provide heat for [[mandarin orange]] trees during the winter of 1438.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoon|first1=Sang Jun|last2=Woudstra|first2=Jan|title=Advanced Horticultural Techniques in Korea: The Earliest Documented Greenhouses|journal=Garden History|date=1 January 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=68–84|doi=10.2307/25472355|jstor=25472355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Underfloor heating]]
: One of the earliest systems of underfloor heating, dating back 2,500 years, was invented and widely used by Koreans. The Korean ''[[ondol]]'' heating system was thought to be the oldest of its kind until the recent archaeological discovery of a similar heating system in the Alaskan [[Aleutian Islands]]. However, the archaeologist who discovered it agrees with Korean researchers that the two systems developed independently, based on the distance of 5,000 kilometers and the absence of ''ondol'' in the areas between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient 'Ondol' Heating Systems Discovered in Alaska|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/06/26/2007062661010.html|website=The Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=24 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=Jae-Han|last2=Jo|first2=Jae-Hun|last3=Kim|first3=Yong-Yee|last4=Yeo|first4=Myoung-Souk|last5=Kim|first5=Kwang-Woo|title=Application of the control methods for radiant floor cooling system in residential buildings|journal=Building and Environment|date=1 January 2006|volume=41|issue=1|pages=60–73|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.01.019|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132305000107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=温突—朝鲜族民居的独特采暖方式|journal=Journal of Shenyang Architecture and Civil Engineering University|date=2000|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/94749X/20001603/4402358.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Korean researchers have explained this phenomenon by hypothesizing that a whale-hunting people from the Korean Peninsula migrated by sea to Alaska during prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=코리안이 美 신대륙 최초 발견|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=009&amp;aid=0002186764|website=네이버 뉴스|publisher=NAVER Corporation|accessdate=2 April 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=한반도에서 알래스카까지 고래의길을 가다|url=http://www.kbs.co.kr/1tv/sisa/gonggam/view/vod/2297123_105210.html|website=다큐 공감|publisher=KBS|accessdate=2 April 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;인터뷰&gt; `코리안신대륙발견모임' 김성규 회장|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005768290|website=네이버 뉴스|publisher=NAVER Corporation|accessdate=2 April 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the Korean ''ondol'' hydronic radiant floor heating system, the American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] developed and introduced the first "radiant heating system" using hot water pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoppen|first1=Donald W.|title=The Seven Ages of Frank Lloyd Wright: The Creative Process|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-29420-9|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANZP4QSMNWkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=Bruce Brooks|last2=Wright|first2=Frank Lloyd|title=Treasures of Taliesin: Seventy-seven Unbuilt Designs|publisher=Pomegranate|isbn=978-0-7649-1041-8|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BMt1fCo5kC|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damo were trained in martial arts, carried an iron flail to break down doors and rope to apprehend perpetrators. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreanhistory.org/%EC%A3%84%EC%99%80-%EB%B2%8C%EC%9D%98-%EC%82%AC%ED%9A%8C%EC%82%AC-%EB%AA%A9%EA%B5%AC%EB%A9%8D%EC%9D%B4-%ED%8F%AC%EB%8F%84%EC%B2%AD-%EC%A1%B0%EC%84%A0-%EA%B2%BD%EC%B0%B0-%EC%9D%B4/?ckattempt=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyman Wiswell Gilmore, Jr.''' (June 11, 1874 &amp;ndash; February 18, 1951) was an [[aviation]] pioneer. In [[Grass Valley, California]], he built a steam-powered airplane and claimed that he flew it on May 15, 1902. Due to the requirement of a heavy boiler and the dependency on coal as a power source, the flights would have been unsustainable. Records and evidence relating to his claim were lost in a 1935 hangar fire.

== First flight ==
Gilmore, in a 1936 interview, reported a successful tethered glider flight in 1893&lt;ref name="Lyman Gilmore"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elam|first1=F. Leland|date=|year=1936|title=Lyman Gilmore, Jr. – Pioneer|journal=Popular Aviation|volume=18|issue=April|pages=247–248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-ZSNuX1jzQC&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=Lyman%20Gilmore%20aviation&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q=Lyman%20Gilmore%20aviation&amp;f=false|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a free glider flight in 1894.&lt;ref name="Lyman Gilmore"/&gt; Gilmore further added that (although he had not reported it until 1927) he made a controlled steam-powered flight on May 15, 1902;&lt;ref name="Lyman Gilmore"/&gt; however, all records and papers related to his aircraft were destroyed in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=|first1=|date=|year=1934|title=The Gilmore Brothers Were Real Pioneers|journal=Popular Aviation|volume=15|issue=5|pages=312 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V56iKQkRhOQC&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Lyman%20Gilmore%20aviation&amp;pg=PA312#v=onepage&amp;q=Lyman%20Gilmore%20aviation&amp;f=false|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are photographs from 1898 showing Gilmore's machine, but none showing it in the air. The claims of the aircraft achieving flight are unconfirmed, and given the weight evident by the grounded aircraft photos, the possibility of flight is highly unlikely.

== Work ==
Lyman Gilmore was in contact with other flight pioneers like [[Samuel Langley]] and, eventually, the [[Wright brothers]].

In 1902, Gilmore was granted two patents on [[steam engine]]s. He invented in other areas too: for example, a rotary [[snowplow]]. On March 15, 1907, Gilmore opened the first commercial [[airfield]], Gilmore Airfield, in Grass Valley.  There is now a middle school named in his honor on the site of the airfield.

[[Image:Gilmore monoplane.jpg|300px|thumb|Gilmore's second, larger airplane]]
[[File:Gilmore plane drawing.png|300px|thumb|Drawing of the smaller first plane]]
In 1935, Lyman's airplane hangar and the two aging monoplanes were destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;"Lyman Gilmore Jr. - Aeronautical Pioneer" by Stephen Barber. ''Nevada County Historical Society'', Volume 30, No. 2. (April, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The fire cancelled plans to exhibit the larger monoplane at the World Fair in Chicago. Gilmore began mining for gold and died a poor man in [[Nevada City, California]]. His grave can be found in Pine Grove Cemetery, about a half mile outside of town.

The Lyman Gilmore Elementary School in Grass Valley has the motto, "Flying into the Future" and photos of a mural depicting flight.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman Gilmore Elementary School. {{cite web |url=http://gilmore.ca.gvm.schoolinsites.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130721174500/http://gilmore.ca.gvm.schoolinsites.com/ |archivedate=2013-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; School children made a YouTube presentation about Gilmore including old video footage of Gilmore and an interview with people who knew him.&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Lyman Gilmore"--a student production as an entry in the California Preservation Foundation film contest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdUOe0vdJhA&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CHICKEN MDM IN POLYBLOCK.jpg|thumb|Mechanically deboned meat: frozen chicken]]
'''Mechanically separated meat''' ('''MSM'''), '''mechanically recovered/reclaimed meat''' ('''MRM'''), or '''mechanically deboned meat''' ('''MDM''') is a paste-like meat product produced by forcing pureed or ground [[beef]], [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[Domestic turkey|turkey]] or [[chicken]], under high pressure through a [[sieve]] or similar device to separate the bone from the edible meat tissue. It is sometimes called ''white slime'' as an analog to meat-additive [[pink slime]] and to meat extracted by [[advanced meat recovery]] systems, both of which are different processes. The process entails pureeing or grinding the carcass left after the manual removal of meat from the bones and then forcing the slurry through a sieve under pressure.  This puree includes bone, bone marrow, skin, nerves, blood vessels, and the scraps of meat remaining on the bones.  The resulting product is a blend primarily consisting of tissues not generally considered meat along with a much smaller amount of actual meat (muscle tissue). In some countries such as the United States, these non-meat materials are processed separately for human and non-human uses and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=And You Thought It Was Just ‘Pink’ Slime | author= Lena Groeger|work= ProPublica|date= April 12, 2012|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/and-you-thought-it-was-just-pink-slime}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is controversial; ''[[Forbes]]'', for example, called it a "not-so-appetizing meat production process".&lt;ref name="pinkwhite"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mickeymeece/2012/04/12/take-a-look-at-white-slime-a-pink-slime-cousin/ |title=Take a Look at 'White Slime, ' a 'Pink Slime' Cousin|author= Micky Meece, |work=Forbes|date=April 12, 2012| accessdate= 2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically separated meat has been used in certain meat and meat products, such as [[hot dog]]s and [[bologna sausage]],&lt;ref name="pinkwhite" /&gt; since the late 1960s. However, not all such meat products are manufactured using an MSM process.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The practice of mechanically harvesting leftover meat scraps dates to the 1950s, when mechanical hand tools were developed to help remove the remaining pieces of meat and connective tissue from animal carcasses to minimize waste, although said tissues were not automatically or necessarily "wasted" when used for other purposes. Primarily MSM was developed in and produced in countries with agriculture industries insufficiently productive to provide mass quantities of regularly processed meat for widespread and affordable consumption. By the 1960s, machines that did this more efficiently, and automatically, were developed. This allowed companies to use previously wasted materials and, in turn, sell the derived meat products to the public for a lower price. During the 1970s, these techniques became more common in other parts of the world,{{where|date=June 2014}} as well. In addition to poultry slaughterhouses, newcomers entered the market as they recognized the financial gains that mechanically separated meat processing allowed.  Eastern European countries, especially, are known for their import of frozen chicken MSM.

During the 1950s, mechanically separated meat was mostly used as a raw material for the production of hot dogs. Currently, luncheon meats, burgers, and [[mortadella]] are regularly made from MSM.

== Safety and regulation ==

Questions arose in the 1980s as to the safety of mechanically separated meat. In 1982, a report published by U.S. [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) on mechanically separated meat said it was safe and established a [[standard of identity]] for the food product.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Some restrictions were made on how much can be used and the type of products in which it can be used. These restrictions were based on concerns for limiting intake of certain components in mechanically separated meat, such as [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/oldcomm4/out16_en.html|accessdate=2015-06-27|title=Health and Food Safety {{!}} European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically separated meat may not be described simply as "meat" on food labels, but must be labeled as "mechanically separated" pork, chicken, or turkey in the ingredients statement. [[Hot dog]]s can contain no more than 20% mechanically separated pork.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Concerns were raised again when the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) epidemic, commonly known as "mad cow disease", occurred in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1986. Since bits of the [[spinal cord]] (the part most likely to be carrying the BSE [[prion]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FactSheets/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy_Mad_Cow_Disease/index.asp|publisher=USDA|title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|date=March 2005|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FactSheets/FSIS_Further_Strengthens_Protections_Against_BSE/index.asp|publisher=USDA|date=March 2005|title=FSIS Further Strengthens Protections Against Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; often got mixed in with the rest of the meat, products using mechanically separated meat taken from the carcasses of bovines were at higher risk for transmitting BSE to humans. As a result, in 1989, the United Kingdom tightened restrictions to help ensure pieces of the spinal cord would not be present in mechanically separated meat taken from bovines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1482140.stm|title=What is mechanically recovered meat|date=August 9, 2001|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, the UK government banned MRM from cattle backbone, in 1998 MRM from any ruminant backbone and in August 2001 from any ruminant bone.  In 2001, the government prohibited the sale of MRM beef for human consumption to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) rules became effective November 4, 1996, and were later updated, stressing:
{{quote|Due to FSIS regulations enacted in 2004 to protect consumers against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, mechanically separated beef is considered inedible and is prohibited for use as human food. It is not permitted in hot dogs or any other processed product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2018, a [[South Africa]]n factory that produced [[polony]], (an artificial pink-like [[bologna]] sausage imitation), and various other processed meats all from Mechanical Deboned Poultry, was associated with the deadliest [[2017–18_South_African_listeriosis_outbreak|listeriosis]] outbreak in history, that sickened 1000 people, and killed at least 180.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The '''Motorola A780''' is a cellular [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] running the [[Linux]] operating system.

It was introduced in 2003 and sold in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.softpedia.com/phones/Motorola/Motorola-A780.shtml Motorola A780 on Softpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Some models  include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and navigation software.

==Design==
The Motorola A780 is a Linux-based smartphone. When the lid is closed, the phone appears like a traditional phone, with a keypad matrix and small display, actually a window to the larger display below the lid. When the lid is flipped open, a [[QVGA]] touch screen is revealed that can be used with fingers or a supplied stylus.

|valign="top"|[[Image:MotoA780side2.jpg|frame|none|Side view]]
|}

==Features==

The phone is supplied with a number of applications including a [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] and [[IMAP]] email client, Opera web browser,  calendar and a viewer for PDF and Microsoft Office files. Calendar and address book can be synchronized with a [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[SyncML]] server. The phone has a 1.3 [[megapixel]] camera recording still and video images. [[RealPlayer]] is included to play sound audio files and streamed audio and video. The phone has 48 [[megabyte]]s of internal flash memory for storing user data and a slot for a [[microSD]] card. Both [[Bluetooth]] and USB are provided for communication with another computer. Character entry is via an on-screen [[QWERTY]] keyboard and hand writing recognition. Models including a [[GPS]] receiver are supplied with ALK Technologies' CoPilot Live  navigation software with street level maps of Europe.

==Technical details==
The phone has three processors: 
* Baseband Processor (BP) is an [[ARM7TDMI]] that is used for the basic [[GSM]]  phone functions. The necessary digital signal processing is performed  by an Onyx (566xx) [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] core. The BP runs the Nucleus operating system (produced by Mentor Graphics) from its own 32 [[megabit|MBit]] Flash memory.
* Application Processor (AP) is an  [[Intel PXA270]] with an ARMv5TE ARM core. This runs Linux, the user interface [[Qtopia]] and the application programs.
* Models with GPS use a Motorola MG4100 single chip GPS receiver integrated circuit.

The Linux operating system used,  ''EZX Linux'', is a modified version of [[MontaVista]] Consumer Electronics Linux 3.0

==Linux enthusiasts==

This phone is popular with Linux enthusiasts. It is able to establish a TCP/IP connection between the phone and another computer over USB or Bluetooth. One can then [[telnet]] to the phone and be presented with a [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] prompt. From the prompt one can, for example, mount an NFS drive(s) on the phone. The underlying operating system, Motorola EZX is Linux based, its kernel is open source. With the source code hosted on ''opensource.motorola.com'', it is possible to recompile and replace the kernel for this operating system. However Motorola did not publish a software development kit for native applications. Instead, they are expecting third party programs to be written in [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java ME]]. The [[OpenEZX]] website is dedicated to providing free opensource software for this phone and others using the same OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1729">'''Multifilament line''', also referred to as ''The Super Lines'', is a type of fishing line.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fishing Basics - 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[braided fishing line|braided line]] which is made up of a type of [[polyethylene]], an extremely thin line for its strength. By weight, polyethylene strands are five to ten times sturdier than [[steel]]. Multifilament line is similar to braided [[dacron]] in terms of sensitivity but a [[diameter]] about one-third that of monofilament.

Multifilament works best on conventional and [[baitcasting reel]]s. On [[Spinning reel|spinning]] and spincasting reels, the line's limpness can make sure for awkward manipulation, as it doesn't "spring" off the reel like [[monofilament line|monofilament]]. Consequently, knot-tying is more difficult with multifilaments. Certain knots work better with superline, like the [[palomar knot]]. Applying a type of super glue will help to prevent other types of knots from slipping.

This type of [[fishing line]] is expensive, sometimes four times the cost of equivalent monofilament. This can become a considerable expense, especially considering that the line is so thin that you need more of it to fill a reel spool. Sometimes, a backing of monofilament or other line is used under the braided line on the spool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-lines/types.asp Types of Fishing Lines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403193646/http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-lines/types.asp |date=2007-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pocket-sized, tablet-shaped handheld device, which debuted in 2006, had a screen which slid up to reveal a QWERTY keyboard. The brand name 'mylo' stands for My Life Online. Using [[Wi-Fi]] instead of cellular networks, the mylo was targeted to the 18–24 age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/phones--pdas/sony-unveils-webinyourpocket-gadget/2006/08/08/1154802879270.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Sony unveils web-in-your-pocket gadget | date=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using WiFi networks for Internet connectivity, mylo provided users with the possibility of reducing connectivity costs by avoiding the necessity of using [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[3G]] cellular networks which would usually be used for devices of this size and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geek.com/news/geeknews/2006Aug/gee20060808037883.htm Sony launches mylo | Geek.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809211709/http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2006Aug/gee20060808037883.htm |date=2006-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and design ==
;Mylo COM–1
The first version of the Sony mylo was launched on September 15, 2006 and includes 1 [[gigabyte|GB]] of onboard flash memory and a [[Memory Stick|Memory Stick PRO Duo]] expansion slot.

The mylo is 23.9&amp;nbsp;mm (31/32 in) thick, 123&amp;nbsp;mm (4⅞ in) wide, 63&amp;nbsp;mm (2½ in) tall, and sports a 6.1&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;in) QVGA (320 × 240) LCD screen.  Its form factor is similar to the T-Mobile Sidekick in that it is held in landscape mode and has a slide out QWERTY keyboard.  Its initial model colors were a glossy black and white.

;Mylo COM–2
On January 6, 2008, the second edition of the Sony mylo was announced at [[Consumer Electronics Show#2008|CES 2008]] in Las Vegas. This version was based on PSP technology and included [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]], a touchscreen, and a camera. The Internet Browser was changed from [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] to [[NetFront]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} It supported Adobe Flash for viewing Flash content such as [[YouTube]] videos and for playing Flash-based games. The mylo COM–2 had 1 GB flash memory that could be used for music and video playback.&lt;ref name="sonystyle.com"&gt;[http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=8198552921665301416 SonyStyle.com | Sony | mylo Internet Device COM-2WHITE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two colors were available: black and white. The mylo COM–2 featured [[wireless G]] connectivity. The keyboard was backlit as well.&lt;ref name="sonystyle.com"/&gt; System software version 1.201 added support for video recording. The mylo COM–2 was released on SonyStyle.com on January 25, 2008 for $299. It was reduced to $199 before the holiday season and was quickly drawn from production due to its poor sales.

== Software ==
[[File:SonyMyloCOM2.png|thumb|The mylo COM-2.  The length of the steel rule is 15 cm.]]
The mylo's menu of software applications is grouped by function.
;Communication
The following applications in the main menu group use the Wi-Fi connection:

*Ad Hoc Application. This [[Peer-to-peer]] lets the mylo share playlists and stream songs directly to another mylo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/consumer/computer_peripheral/release/24061.html Sony Electronics News and Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cannot be used natively for sending or receiving text (SMS) messages to or from cell phones; it is strictly for messenger and web only.

;Web
'''COM–1'''. The [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] web browser allows a number of configurations to help minimize the limitations of the small screen (320x240) including Zoom (%), Text Size (Small, Normal, Large) and View Mode (Normal or Fit to Screen).

'''COM–2'''. [[NetFront]] with support for Flash Lite is the web browser that is supplied with the mylo COM–2.

;Media
'''COM–1'''. The player supports the MP3, WMA (secured and unsecured) and ATRAC 3 audio formats. The image viewer supports JPG, PNG, and Bitmap formats. The video player supports the MPEG-4/AAC video format. The text application is a simple text editor.

'''COM–2'''. The player supports the MP3, WMA (secured and unsecured), AAC (no DRM) and ATRAC3 formats. The image viewers supports JPEG, PNG and BMP formats. The video player supports the MPEG-4/AAC Simple Profile and MPEG-4/AAC AVC H.264 baseline profile. It also supports WMV starting with firmware version 1.101, which was released in April 2008.

On both models DRM content in Windows Media Audio and Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding 3 is limited to the internal 1GB memory. DRM playback is not possible via Memory Stick as Magic Gate is not available and Windows Media DRM is not currently possible on Memory Sticks.

;Tools
* The utilities in this menu group include the Connection Manager for managing the Wi-Fi configuration, a File Manager, a firmware System Update tool.

== Connectivity ==
With the USB mode configuration set to the default (MSC) the mylo acts as a [[Usb mass storage|USB mass-storage device]]. Music and other files can then be transferred from a PC with the included SonicStage software or by dragging and dropping using a file manager.  With the USB mode set to MTP you can synchronize audio files via [[Windows Media Player|WMP]] 10.  While connected via USB, the mylo screen displays the USB mode currently in use and suspends whatever program had been running.

The 802.11b Wi-Fi connection is started either with the Wireless LAN slider button or automatically when one of mylo's Internet applications (i.e., Skype, Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, Opera) attempt to access the network and an infrastructure mode Wi-Fi connection has not yet been established. The Wi-Fi mode can be switched to Ad Hoc mode to enable use of the Ad Hoc Application.  Although the device is marketed for persons on the go, the Mylo does not have any commonly used [[Bluetooth]] capabilities, to provide easy connection with other wireless carrier enabled mobile devices.

Owners of the COM-1 model receive access to any T-Mobile Hotspot for the first year. Owners of the COM–2 model receive access to over 10,000 Wayport Hotspot locations nationwide, through December 31, 2010. Over 9,000 of these locations are McDonald's restaurants.

An '''oil mill''' is a [[mill (grinding)|grinding mill]] designed to crush or bruise oil-bearing seeds, such as [[linseed]] or [[peanut]]s, or other oil-rich vegetable material, such as [[olive]]s or the fruit of the [[oil palm]], which can then be pressed to extract [[vegetable oil]]s, which may used as foods or for cooking, as [[oleochemical]] [[feedstock]]s, as [[lubricant]]s, or as [[biofuel]]s.  The [[pomace]] or [[press cake]] - the remaining solid material from which the oil has been extracted - may also be used as a food or fertilizer.

==History==

Oil-rich vegetable materials have been processed mechanically to extract the valuable oils for thousands of years, typically using vertical [[millstone]]s moving around a central post (edge runner stones or kollergangs in an [[edge mill]]) to crush or bruise the seeds or fruit which can then be stamped or pressed to extract the oil.  A [[treadmill]], [[windmill]] or [[watermill]] was later used to drive the milling and pressing machinery, replaced in modern times with steam and later other power sources. In some areas, watermills may be "double" water mills, with machinery for grinding wheat on one side of the watercourse and machinery for extracting oils on the other side.

Historical windmills could process between 100 and 200 tons of raw materials per year.

==Modern oil mills==

Modern mechanical oil mills can process up to 4,000 tons per day in hot pressing processes, and up to 25 tons per day cold pressed.  Industrial [[oil pressing]] methods usually use a screw to crush the raw materials in a continuous process, before extraction of the oil from the press cake using a [[centrifuge]] or a solvent such as [[hexane]].

Edible oils may be extracted for culinary purposes.  Non-edible oils can be used in the manufacture of soaps, paints and varnishes, or as fuel for oil lamps.  Important feed stocks include [[soybean]]s, [[rapeseed]] ([[canola]]), [[sunflower seed]]s, [[cottonseed]], and [[maize]] (corn), as well as [[peanut]]s, [[olive]]s, various nuts, [[sesame seed]]s, [[safflower]], [[grape seed]]s and [[flaxseed]] ([[linseed]]).  [[Palm oil]] is extracted from the pulp of the [[oil palm]] fruit, [[palm kernel oil]] from the kernel of the [[oil palm]], and [[coconut oil]] from the kernel of the [[coconut]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13076">An '''oil water separator''' ('''OWS''') is a piece of equipment used to separate oil and water mixtures into their separate components. There are many different types of oil-water separator. Each has different oil separation capability and are used in different industries. Oil water separators are designed and selected after consideration of oil separation performance parameters and life cycle cost considerations. "Oil" can be taken to mean mineral, vegetable and animal oils, and the many different hydrocarbons.

Oil water separators can be designed to treat a variety of contaminants in water including free floating oil, emulsified oil, dissolved oil and suspended solids. Not all oil separator types are capable of separating all contaminants. The most common performance parameters considered are:
* Oil droplet size (in the feed to the separator)
* Oil density
* Water viscosity (temperature)
* Discharge water quality desired
* Feed oil concentration and the range of oil concentrations likely
* Feed oil water flow (daily and peak hourly)
   
== API oil–water separator ==
An [[API oil–water separator]] is a device designed to separate gross amounts of oil and suspended solids from the wastewater effluents of oil refineries, petrochemical plants, chemical plants, natural gas processing plants and other industrial sources. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to API Publication 421, February 1990, published by the [[American Petroleum Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;API 421, February 1990, American Petroleum Institute&lt;/ref&gt; These separators can be used to separate large oil droplets, typically greater than 150 micron.

== Oily water separator (marine) ==
[[File:No. 492 Oily water separator.jpg|thumb|210x210px|Marine oily water separator]]
The purpose of shipboard [[oily water separator (marine)|oily water separator]] (OWS) is to separate oil and other contaminants that could be harmful for the oceans.  They are most commonly found on board ships where they are used to separate oil from oily waste water such as bilge water before the waste water is discharged into the environment. These discharges of waste water must comply with the requirements laid out in [[MARPOL 73/78|Marpol 73/78]].

[[Bilge]] water is a near-unavoidable product of shipboard operations. Oil leaks from running machinery, such as diesel generators, air compressors, and the main propulsion engine. Modern OWSs have alarms and automatic closure devices which are activated when the oil storage capacity of the oil water separator has been reached.

== Gravity plate separator ==
A gravity plate separator contains a series of plates through which the contaminated water flows. The objective of the design is to allow oil droplets in the water to coalesce on the underside of the plate eventually forming larger oil droplets which floats off the plates and accumulates at the top of the chamber. The oil accumulating at the top is then transferred with some en-trained water to a waste oil tank. This type of oily water separator is very common for many industrial applications as well as in ships but it has some flaws that decrease efficiency. Oil particles that are sixty micrometers in size or smaller do not get separated. Also the presence of chemicals and surfactants in the water greatly reduce oil droplet coalescence, impeding the separation effect The variety of oily wastes in [[bilge]] water can limit removal efficiency especially when very dense and highly viscous oils such as bunker oil are present. Plates must be replaced when fouled, which increases the costs of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Useful sites in addition to NSCEP|url = http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100DCO8.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=2011+Thru+2015&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%25253A%25255Czyfiles%25255CIndex%252520Data%25255C11thru15%25255CTxt%25255C00000003%25255CP100DCO8.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%25257C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%25257Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%252520page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208062142/http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100DCO8.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=2011+Thru+2015&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%25253A%25255Czyfiles%25255CIndex%252520Data%25255C11thru15%25255CTxt%25255C00000003%25255CP100DCO8.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%25257C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8%2Fr75g8%2Fx150y150g16%2Fi425&amp;Display=p%25257Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%252520page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-12-08|accessdate = 2015-06-03|first = OARM|last = Cincinnati|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centrifugal oily water separator ==
[[File:Sigma Oily Water Separator.jpg|thumb|Centrifuge oily water separator]] A [[centrifugal water–oil separator]], ''centrifugal oil–water separator'' or ''centrifugal liquid–liquid separator'' is a device designed to separate oil and water by centrifugation. It generally contains a cylindrical container that rotates inside a larger stationary container. The denser liquid, usually water, accumulates at the periphery of the rotating container and is collected from the side of the device, whereas the less dense liquid, usually oil, accumulates at the rotation axis and is collected from the center. Centrifugal oil–water separators are used for waste water processing and for cleanup of oil spills on sea or on lake. Centrifugal oil–water separators are also used for filtering diesel and lubricating oils by removing the waste particles and impurity from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oil Water Separator Flow Process Description|url = http://www.oilwaterseparatordesign.com/flow-process.php|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrocyclone oily water separator ==
An oil water separation [[hydrocyclone]] is a device designed to separate oil from water by the use of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long tapered pipes. They typically contain an inlet section, long tapered section and a long outlet section. In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better de-oiling hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity. This is why smaller emulsified oil droplets as low as 15 microns can be removed.

Oil removal hydrocyclones, or de-oiling hydrocyclones, are very different in geometry, design and operation compared to the more common solid removal hydrocyclones. When correctly designed and operated oil removal hydrocyclones [[Hydrocyclone]]s are very useful for removing both large oil droplets and smaller emulsified oil droplets in a broad range of applications across many industries. The technology has been successfully applied to treat oily water produced in the mining industry, meat processing, dairy manufacturing, petrochemical, oil refining, oil marketing and oil production operations.

== Flotation ==
Flotation introduces gas bubbles to enhance oil removal.  The gas bubbles attach to the oil droplets to increase the rise rate of the oil.  Various flotation methods such as [[dissolved gas flotation]] (DGF), [[dissolved air flotation]] (DAF), and [[induced gas flotation]] (IGF) may be used.  Typically this separation step is used following a primary oil–water separation step which is able to remove a large portion of the free oil.

== Nut shell filtration ==
[[Nut shell filter|Nut shell filtration]] uses nut shell media in a vessel to remove oil.  Nut shell filters were designed to separate crude oil from oilfield produced water in the 1970s.  Typically, nut shell filters are used as a polishing step to achieve low oil concentrations (&lt;10 mg/L).  Oil is collected in the interstitial spaces between the media and periodically removed during a backwash procedure.

== Electrochemical ==
[[Wastewater]] purification of oils and contaminates by [[electrochemical]] emulsification is actively in research and development. Electrochemical [[emulsification]] involves the generation of [[electrolytic]] bubbles that attract pollutants such as sludge and carry them to the top of the treatment chamber. Once at the top of the treatment chamber the oil and other pollutants are transferred to a waste oil tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Separation and Purification Technology|format=PDF|url=http://www.atmc.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/advancedtechnologymanufacturingcenter/researchandpartneringlabs/environmentalchemistrylab/publications/Electrochemical_Coagulation_for_Oily_Water_Demulsification.pdf|website = www.atmc.umassd.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031315/http://www.atmc.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/advancedtechnologymanufacturingcenter/researchandpartneringlabs/environmentalchemistrylab/publications/Electrochemical_Coagulation_for_Oily_Water_Demulsification.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Downhole oil–water separation ==
[[Downhole oil–water separation technology|Downhole oil–water separation (DOWS) technology]] is an emerging technology that separates oil and gas from produced water at the bottom of the well, and re-injects most of the produced water into another formation which is usually deeper than the producing formation, while the oil and gas rich stream is pumped to the surface. [[Downhole oil–water separation technology|DOWS]] effectively removes solids from the disposal fluid and thus avoids injectivity impairment caused by solids plugging. Simultaneous injection using DOWS minimizes the opportunity for the contamination of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs) through leaks in tubing and casing during the injection process.

== Bioremediation ==
[[Bioremediation]] is the use of [[microorganism]]s to treat contaminated water. A carefully managed environment is needed for the microorganisms which includes nutrients and hydrocarbons such as oil or other contaminates, and oxygen.

In pilot scale studies, bio-remediation was used as one stage in a multi-stage purification process involving a plate separator to remove the majority of the contaminants and was able to treat pollutants at very low concentrations including organic contaminates such as [[glycerol]], solvents, [[jet fuel]], detergents, and [[phosphates]]. After treatment of contaminated water, [[carbon dioxide]], water and an organic sludge were the only residual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Useful sites in addition to NSCEP|url = http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100DCO8.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=2011+Thru+2015&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%25253A%25255Czyfiles%25255CIndex%252520Data%25255C11thru15%25255CTxt%25255C00000003%25255CP100DCO8.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%25257C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%25257Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%252520page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208062142/http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100DCO8.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=2011+Thru+2015&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%25253A%25255Czyfiles%25255CIndex%252520Data%25255C11thru15%25255CTxt%25255C00000003%25255CP100DCO8.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%25257C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8%2Fr75g8%2Fx150y150g16%2Fi425&amp;Display=p%25257Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%252520page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-12-08|accessdate = 2015-06-03|first = OARM|last = Cincinnati|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pancake machine''' is an electrically-powered machine that automatically produces cooked [[pancake]]s.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; It is believed that the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt; Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies [[Mass production|mass-produce]] pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
In 1928, a man in [[Portland, Oregon]], invented an electric pancake machine that operated by the process of batter being dropped onto a revolving heated [[flattop grill]] from a storage cylinder atop the grill.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt; The grill was heated using electricity.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt; The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt;

In 1955 in the United States, an automatic pancake machine was developed by [[Vendo]], which used a specially formulated pancake batter mix that was manufactured by the [[Quaker Oats Company]]'s [[Aunt Jemima]] branch.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; The Vendo machine could produce pancakes "in less than three minutes."&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; It was a semi-automatic machine that performed all of the cooking functions except for the pouring of the pancake batter.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt;

In 1956, four [[Racine, Wisconsin]], engineers developed and fabricated two, 5' diameter gas burning pancake machines for the annual
Pancake Day sponsored by the Kiwanis Club there in Racine.

== Types and uses ==
Various types of pancake machines exist, such as those that run pancake [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Association 1986" /&gt; Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carey 2009" /&gt; Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate.&lt;ref name="Howie 2014 p. 452" /&gt; They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges&lt;ref name="Lipsey 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plautz 2014" /&gt; and hotels.&lt;ref name="Travel &amp; Leisure" /&gt;

== Homemade pancake machines ==
Homemade versions of pancake machines have been constructed. An example of a homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which was used for the organization's annual pancake day.&lt;ref name="OSB 1977" /&gt; The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle.&lt;ref name="OSB 1977" /&gt; The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed.&lt;ref name="OSB 1977" /&gt; It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.&lt;ref name="OSB 1977" /&gt;

== Companies and brands ==
Commercial and home-consumer pancake machines are [[Mass production|mass-produced]] by some companies in contemporary times.

=== Commercial products ===
Commercial pancake machines are typically used in the commercial [[foodservice]] and [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]] industries.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Association 1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carey 2009" /&gt;

Popcake is a pancake machine brand that can produce 200 pancakes per hour.&lt;ref name="Carey 2009" /&gt; Individual Pancakes are produced in seconds by this machine.&lt;ref name="Carey 2009" /&gt; The machine was designed for use in commercial establishments such as cafeterias and convenience stores.&lt;ref name="Carey 2009" /&gt;

Popcake is a U.S. company that produces Popcake-brand pancake machines.&lt;ref name="Hotelier Middle East" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popcake" /&gt; The Popcake machine was invented by Marek Szymanski, and as of July 2014 approximately 7,000 of them are used worldwide.&lt;ref name="Popcake" /&gt; This brand has features that allow users to adjust the size, quantity and doneness level of the pancakes produced.&lt;ref name="Lipsey 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popcake2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2013" /&gt; Plates of pancakes are produced in around two minutes time by the Popcake machine.&lt;ref name="Lipsey 2015" /&gt;

=== Consumer products ===
[[File:Electric griddle.jpg|thumb|A basic electric [[griddle]] with temperature control|alt=A basic electric griddle with temperature control]]
Consumer versions of pancake machines for home use are simpler in operation compared to commercial machines, typically involving a basic [[griddle]] and a feature to adjust cooking temperature.&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt; Consumer machines are typically countertop-sized [[small appliance]]s.&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt; Brands include the [[Severin Elektro|Severin]] Crepe Maker, the [[Cuisinart]] Griddle and Grill, Swan's Come Dine With Me Party Wok and Pancake Maker, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine and the Andrew James Crepe Maker, among others.&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt; A review of various consumer machines published in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' recommended various machines per situational uses.&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt; For example, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine was recommended for use with large groups of people and the Severin Crepe Maker was recommended for "technophobes" who prefer a simple design&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt; The review recommended the Andrew James Crepe Maker as the overall best value.&lt;ref name="Cable 2014" /&gt;

In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine received over $141,000 on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name="Kindelan 2015" /&gt; Its target donation request on the website was $50,000.&lt;ref name="Kindelan 2015" /&gt; PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed by the use of pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a programmable machine arm atop the griddle.&lt;ref name="Technology.org" /&gt; The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.&lt;ref name="Kindelan 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Technology.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.technology.org/2015/03/13/pancakebot-pancake-printing-machine-that-inspires-playing-with-your-food/ | title=PancakeBot – pancake printing machine that inspires playing with your food | publisher=Technology.org | date=March 13, 2015 | accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novelty machines ==
In commemoration of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine was built by [[The Happy Egg Company]] in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch.&lt;ref name="Molloy 2013" /&gt; The machine involves the use of a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients.&lt;ref name="Molloy 2013" /&gt; After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.&lt;ref name="Molloy 2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28881">'''Quantum cascade lasers''' (QCLs) are [[semiconductor laser]]s that emit in the mid- to far-[[infrared]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and were first demonstrated by Jerome Faist, [[Federico Capasso]], Deborah Sivco, Carlo Sirtori, Albert Hutchinson, and [[Alfred Cho]] at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="QCL1"&gt;{{cite journal |quote= |last= Faist|first= Jerome|authorlink= |author2=Federico Capasso |author3=Deborah L. Sivco |author4=Carlo Sirtori |author5=Albert L. Hutchinson |author6=Alfred Y. Cho |date=April 1994|title= Quantum Cascade Laser|journal=Science|volume=264|issue=5158|pages=553–556|doi=10.1126/science.264.5158.553|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/264/5158/553|accessdate=2007-02-18|format= abstract|pmid= 17732739|bibcode = 1994Sci...264..553F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike typical interband [[semiconductor laser]]s that emit [[electromagnetic radiation]] through the recombination of [[electron–hole pair]]s across the material [[band gap]], QCLs are unipolar and laser emission is achieved through the use of [[intersubband transitions]] in a repeated stack of semiconductor multiple [[quantum well]] [[heterostructure]]s, an idea first proposed in the paper "Possibility of amplification of electromagnetic waves in a semiconductor with a [[superlattice]]" by R.F. Kazarinov and R.A. Suris in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote= |last= Kazarinov|first= R.F|authorlink= |author2=Suris, R.A. |date=April 1971|title= Possibility of amplification of electromagnetic waves in a semiconductor with a superlattice|journal= Fizika I Tekhnika Poluprovodnikov|volume=5|issue=4|pages=797–800|id= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersubband vs. interband transitions==
[[File:Interband optical transition.svg|thumb|upright|Interband transitions in conventional semiconductor lasers emit a single photon.]]
Within a bulk semiconductor [[crystal]], electrons may occupy states in one of two continuous energy bands - the [[valence band]], which is heavily populated with low energy electrons and the [[conduction band]], which is sparsely populated with high energy electrons.  The two energy bands are separated by an energy band gap in which there are no permitted states available for electrons to occupy.  Conventional semiconductor laser diodes generate light by a single [[photon]] being emitted when a high energy electron in the conduction band recombines with a [[electron hole|hole]] in the valence band.  The energy of the photon and hence the emission wavelength of laser diodes is therefore determined by the band gap of the material system used.

A QCL however does not use bulk semiconductor materials in its optically active region.  Instead it consists of a [[periodic function|periodic]] series of thin layers of varying material composition forming a [[superlattice]].  The superlattice introduces a varying [[electric potential]] across the length of the device, meaning that there is a varying [[probability]] of electrons occupying different positions over the length of the device.  This is referred to as [[one-dimensional]] [[multiple quantum well]] [[quantum confinement|confinement]] and leads to the splitting of the band of permitted energies into a number of discrete electronic subbands.  By suitable design of the layer thicknesses it is possible to engineer a [[population inversion]] between two subbands in the system which is required in order to achieve laser emission.  Because the position of the energy levels in the system is primarily determined by the layer thicknesses and not the material, it is possible to tune the emission wavelength of QCLs over a wide range in the same material system.

[[File:Cascade transitions.svg|thumb|left|In quantum cascade structures, electrons undergo intersubband transitions and photons are emitted. The electrons tunnel to the next period of the structure and the process repeats.]]
Additionally, in semiconductor laser diodes, electrons and holes are annihilated after recombining across the band gap and can play no further part in photon generation.  However, in a unipolar QCL, once an [[electron]] has undergone an intersubband transition and emitted a [[photon]] in one period of the superlattice, it can [[quantum tunneling|tunnel]] into the next period of the structure where another photon can be emitted.  This process of a single electron causing the emission of multiple photons as it traverses through the QCL structure gives rise to the name ''cascade'' and makes a [[quantum efficiency]] of greater than unity possible which leads to higher output powers than semiconductor laser diodes.

==Operating principles==

===Rate equations===
[[File:3level-qcl.svg|thumb|right|upright|Subband populations are determined by the intersubband scattering rates and the injection/extraction current.]]
QCLs are typically based upon a [[Three-level lasers|three-level system]]. Assuming the formation of the wavefunctions is a fast process compared to the scattering between states, the time independent solutions to the [[Schrödinger equation]] may be applied and the system can be modelled using rate equations.  Each subband contains a number of electrons &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the subband index) which [[Scattering|scatter]] between levels with a lifetime &lt;math&gt;\tau_{if}&lt;/math&gt; (reciprocal of the average intersubband scattering rate &lt;math&gt;W_{if}&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are the initial and final subband indices.  Assuming that no other subbands are populated, the rate equations for the three level lasers are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}n_3}{\mathrm{d}t} = I_{\mathrm{in}} + \frac{n_1}{\tau_{13}} + \frac{n_2}{\tau_{23}} -
\frac{n_3}{\tau_{31}} - \frac{n_3}{\tau_{32}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}n_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{n_3}{\tau_{32}} + \frac{n_1}{\tau_{12}} -
\frac{n_2}{\tau_{21}} - \frac{n_2}{\tau_{23}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}n_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{n_2}{\tau_{21}} + \frac{n_3}{\tau_{31}} -
\frac{n_1}{\tau_{13}} - \frac{n_1}{\tau_{12}} - I_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[steady state]], the time derivatives are equal to zero and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{in}}=I_{\mathrm{out}}=I&lt;/math&gt;.  The general rate equation for electrons in subband ''i'' of an ''N'' level system is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}n_i}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{n_j}{\tau_{ji}}-n_i\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{1}{\tau_{ij}}+I(\delta_{iN}-\delta_{i1})&lt;/math&gt;,

Under the assumption that absorption processes can be ignored, (i.e. &lt;math&gt; \frac{n_1}{\tau_{12}} = \frac{n_2}{\tau_{23}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, valid at low temperatures) the middle rate equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_3}{\tau_{32}} = \frac{n_2}{\tau_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if &lt;math&gt;\tau_{32} &gt; \tau_{21}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;W_{21} &gt; W_{32}&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;n_3 &gt; n_2&lt;/math&gt; and a population inversion will exist. The population ratio is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_3}{n_2} = \frac{\tau_{32}}{\tau_{21}} = \frac{W_{21}}{W_{32}}&lt;/math&gt;

If all ''N'' steady-state rate equations are summed, the right hand side becomes zero, meaning that the system is [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]], and it is possible only to find the relative population of each subband.  If the total sheet density of carriers &lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{2D}}&lt;/math&gt; in the system is also known, then the ''absolute'' population of carriers in each subband may be determined using:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}n_i=N_{\mathrm{2D}}&lt;/math&gt;.

As an approximation, it can be assumed that all the carriers in the system are supplied by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]].  If the dopant species has a negligible [[ionisation energy]] then &lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{2D}}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to the doping density.

[[File:QCL wavefunctions in 3QW active region.svg|thumb|left|Electron wave functions are repeated in each period of a three quantum well QCL active region. The upper laser level is shown in bold.]]

===Active region designs===
The scattering rates are tailored by suitable design of the layer thicknesses in the superlattice which determine the electron [[wave function]]s of the subbands.  The scattering rate between two subbands is heavily dependent upon the overlap of the wave functions and energy spacing between the subbands.  The figure shows the wave functions in a three quantum well (3QW) QCL active region and injector.

In order to decrease &lt;math&gt;W_{32}&lt;/math&gt;, the overlap of the upper and lower laser levels is reduced.  This is often achieved through designing the layer thicknesses such that the upper laser level is mostly localised in the left-hand well of the 3QW active region, while the lower laser level wave function is made to mostly reside in the central and right-hand wells. This is known as a ''diagonal'' transition.  A ''vertical'' transition is one in which the upper laser level is localised in mainly the central and right-hand wells.  This increases the overlap and hence &lt;math&gt;W_{32}&lt;/math&gt; which reduces the population inversion, but it increases the strength of the radiative transition and therefore the [[Gain (laser)|gain]].

In order to increase &lt;math&gt;W_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, the lower laser level and the ground level wave functions are designed such that they have a good overlap and to increase &lt;math&gt;W_{21}&lt;/math&gt; further, the energy spacing between the subbands is designed such that it is equal to the [[Optical phonon|longitudinal optical (LO) phonon]] energy (~36 meV in GaAs) so that resonant LO phonon-electron scattering can quickly depopulate the lower laser level.

==Material systems==
The first QCL was fabricated in the [[Indium gallium arsenide|GaInAs]]/[[Aluminium indium arsenide|AlInAs]] material system lattice-matched to an [[indium phosphide|InP]] substrate.&lt;ref name="QCL1" /&gt;  This particular material system has a conduction band offset (quantum well depth) of 520 [[Electronvolt|meV]].  These InP-based devices have reached very high levels of performance across the mid-[[infrared]] spectral range, achieving high power, above room-temperature, [[continuous wave]] emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote= |last=Razeghi|first=Manijeh|authorlink= |year= 2009|title= High-Performance InP-Based Mid-IR Quantum Cascade Lasers

In 1998 [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]]/[[aluminium gallium arsenide|AlGaAs]] QCLs were demonstrated by Sirtori ''et al.'' proving that the QC concept is not restricted to one material system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sirorti et al. |journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=73|issue=24|page=3486|year=1998|doi=10.1063/1.122812|title=GaAs/Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As quantum cascade lasers |bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.3486S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This material system has a varying quantum well depth depending on the aluminium fraction in the barriers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Although GaAs-based QCLs have not matched the performance levels of InP-based QCLs in the mid-infrared, they have proven to be very successful in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] region of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Benjamin S.|date=2007|title=Terahertz quantum-cascade lasers|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2007.166|journal=Nature Photonics|language=En|volume=1|issue=9|pages=517–525|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2007.166|issn=1749-4885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short wavelength limit of QCLs is determined by the depth of the quantum well and recently QCLs have been developed in material systems with very deep quantum wells in order to achieve short wavelength emission.  The InGaAs/AlAsSb material system has quantum wells 1.6 eV deep and has been used to fabricate QCLs emitting at 3.05 μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Revin|first=D. G.|last2=Cockburn|first2=J.

QCLs may also allow laser operation in materials traditionally considered to have poor optical properties.  Indirect bandgap materials such as silicon have minimum electron and hole energies at different momentum values.  For interband optical transitions, carriers change momentum through a slow, intermediate scattering process, dramatically reducing the optical emission intensity.  Intersubband optical transitions however, are independent of the relative momentum of conduction band and valence band minima and theoretical proposals for [[Silicon|Si]]/[[SiGe]] quantum cascade emitters have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote= |last=Paul|first=Douglas J|authorlink= |year= 2004|title= Si/SiGe heterostructures: from material and physics to devices and circuits

==Optical waveguides==
[[File:QC ridge waveguide.jpg|thumb|right|250px|End view of QC facet with ridge waveguide. Darker gray: InP, lighter gray: QC layers, black: dielectric, gold: Au coating. Ridge ~ 10 um wide.]]
[[File:QC buried heterostructure.jpg|thumb|right|250px|End view of QC facet with buried heterostructure waveguide. Darker gray: InP, lighter gray: QC layers, black: dielectric. Heterostructure ~ 10 um wide]]
The first step in processing quantum cascade gain material to make a useful light-emitting device is to confine the [[gain medium]] in an optical [[waveguide (optics)|waveguide]].  This makes it possible to direct the emitted light into a [[collimated]] beam, and allows a [[laser resonator]] to be built such that light can be coupled back into the gain medium.

Two types of optical waveguides are in common use.  A ridge waveguide is created by etching parallel trenches in the quantum cascade gain material to create an isolated stripe of QC material, typically ~10&amp;nbsp;um wide, and several mm long.  A [[dielectric]] material is typically deposited in the trenches to guide injected current into the ridge, then the entire ridge is typically coated with gold to provide electrical contact and to help remove heat from the ridge when it is producing light.  Light is emitted from the cleaved ends of the waveguide, with an active area that is typically only a few micrometers in dimension.

The second waveguide type is a buried [[heterostructure]].  Here, the QC material is also etched to produce an isolated ridge.  Now, however, new semiconductor material is grown over the ridge.  The change in index of refraction between the QC material and the overgrown material is sufficient to create a waveguide.  Dielectric material is also deposited on the overgrown material around QC ridge to guide the injected current into the QC gain medium.  Buried heterostructure waveguides are efficient at removing heat from the QC active area when light is being produced.

==Laser types==
Although the quantum cascade gain medium can be used to produce [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] light in a superluminescent configuration,&lt;ref&gt;

===Fabry–Perot lasers===
This is the simplest of the quantum cascade lasers.  An optical waveguide is first fabricated out of the quantum cascade material to form the gain medium.  The ends of the crystalline semiconductor device are then cleaved to form two parallel mirrors on either end of the waveguide, thus forming a [[Fabry–Pérot]] resonator.   The residual reflectivity on the cleaved facets from the semiconductor-to-air interface is sufficient to create a resonator.  Fabry–Pérot quantum cascade lasers are capable of producing high powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slivken |first=S. |author2=A. Evans |author3=J. David |author4=M. Razeghi  |date=December 2002 |title= High-average-power, high-duty-cycle (λ ~ 6 µm) quantum cascade lasers |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=81 |issue=23 |pages=4321–4323 |doi=10.1063/1.1526462 |bibcode = 2002ApPhL..81.4321S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are typically multi-[[Longitudinal mode|mode]] at higher operating currents.  The wavelength can be changed chiefly by changing the temperature of the QC device.

=== Distributed feedback lasers===
A [[Distributed feedback laser|distributed feedback]] (DFB) quantum cascade laser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faist |first=Jérome |author2=Claire Gmachl |author3=Frederico Capasso |author4=Carlo Sirtori |author5=Deborah L.

This forces single mode operation of the laser, even at higher operating currents.  DFB lasers can be tuned chiefly by changing the temperature, although an interesting variant on tuning can be obtained by pulsing a DFB laser.  In this mode, the wavelength of the laser is rapidly “[[chirp]]ed” during the course of the pulse, allowing rapid scanning of a spectral region.&lt;ref&gt;

===External cavity lasers===
[[File:QC Littrow external cavity.svg|thumb|right|250px|Schematic of QC device in external cavity with frequency selective optical feedback provided by diffraction grating in Littrow configuration.]]
In an external cavity (EC) quantum cascade laser, the quantum cascade device serves as the laser gain medium.  One, or both, of the waveguide facets has an anti-reflection coating that defeats the optical cavity action of the cleaved facets.  Mirrors are then arranged in a configuration external to the QC device to create the optical cavity.

If a frequency-selective element is included in the external cavity, it is possible to reduce the laser emission to a single wavelength, and even tune the radiation.  For example, diffraction gratings have been used to create&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maulini |first=Richard |author2=Mattias Beck |author3=Jérome Faist |author4=Emilio Gini  |date=March 2004 |title= Broadband tuning of external cavity bound-to-continuum quantum-cascade lasers |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=84 |issue=10 |page=1659 |doi=10.1063/1.1667609 |bibcode = 2004ApPhL..84.1659M }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[tunable laser]] that can tune over 15% of its center wavelength.

=== Extended tuning devices ===
There exists several methods to extend the tuning range of quantum cascade lasers using only monolithically integrated elements. Integrated heaters can extend the tuning range at fixed operation temperature to 0.7% of the central wavelength&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bismuto |first1=Alfredo |last2=Bidaux |first2=Yves |last3=Tardy |first3=Camille |last4=Terazzi |first4=Romain |last5=Gresch |first5=Tobias |last6=Wolf |first6=Johanna |last7=Blaser |first7=Stéphane |last8=Muller |first8=Antoine |last9=Faist |first9=Jerome |date=2015 |title=Extended tuning of mid-ir quantum cascade lasers using integrated resistive heaters |journal=Optics Express |volume=23 |issue=23 |pages=29715–29722 |doi=10.1364/OE.23.029715 |pmid=26698453 |url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-23-29715 |access-date=4 May 2016|bibcode = 2015OExpr..2329715B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and superstructure gratings operating through the [[Vernier scale|Vernier effect]] can extend it to 4% of the central wavelength,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bidaux |first1=Yves |last2=Bismuto |first2=Alfredo |last3=Tardy |first3=Camille |last4=Terazzi |first4=Romain |last5=Gresch |first5=Tobias |last6=Blaser |first6=Stéphane |last7=Muller |first7=Antoine |last8=Faist |first8=Jerome |date=4 November 2015 |title=Extended and quasi-continuous tuning of quantum cascade lasers using superstructure gratings and integrated heaters |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=107 |issue=22 |page=221108 |doi=10.1063/1.4936931 |bibcode = 2015ApPhL.107v1108B }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to &lt;0.1% for a standard DFB device.

==Growth==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

The alternating layers of the two different [[semiconductors]] which form the [[quantum heterostructure]] may be grown on to a substrate using a variety of methods such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) or [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOVPE), also known as [[metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]] (MOCVD).

'''Quantum heterostructure''' is a [[heterostructure]] in a substrate (usually a [[semiconductor material]]), where size restricts the movements of the [[charge carrier]]s forcing them into a quantum confinement. This leads to the formation of a set of discrete energy levels at which the carriers can exist. Quantum heterostructures have sharper [[density of states]] than structures of more conventional sizes.

Quantum heterostructures are important for fabrication of short-wavelength [[light-emitting diode]]s and [[diode laser]]s, and for other [[optoelectronic]] applications, e.g. high-efficiency [[photovoltaic cell]]s.

Examples of quantum heterostructures confining the carriers in quasi-two, -one and -zero dimensions are:
* [[Quantum well]]s
* [[Quantum wire]]s
* [[Quantum dot]]s

'''Real-time text''' ('''RTT''') is text transmitted instantly as it is typed or created. Recipients can immediately read the message while it is being written, without waiting.

Real-time text is used for conversational text, in collaboration, and in live captioning. Technologies include [[TDD/TTY]] devices for the deaf, live [[captioning]] for TV, [[Text over IP]] (ToIP), some types of [[instant messaging]], software that automatically captions conversations &lt;ref name="Interact-AS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.auditorysciences.com/ | title=Auditory Sciences | publisher=Auditory Sciences | accessdate= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513105437/http://auditorysciences.com/ | archivedate=2013-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; , captioning for [[telephony]]/[[video teleconferencing]], [[telecommunications relay services]] including [[ip-relay]], transcription services including [[Remote CART]], TypeWell, [[Collaborative real-time editing|collaborative text editing]], [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] text applications, [[Next Generation 9-1-1|next-generation 9-1-1]]/1-1-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reach112.eu|title=REACH112 - About REACH112|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; emergency service. Obsolete TDD/TTY devices are being replaced by more modern real-time text technologies, including [[Text over IP]], ip-relay, and instant messaging.

During 2012, the Real-Time Text Taskforce (R3TF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtimetext.org|title=Home of RealTimeText.org|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed a standard international symbol to represent real-time text, as well as the alternate name '''''Fast Text''''' to improve public education of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasttext.org|title=The International Symbol Of Real-Time Text|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use over instant messaging ==

While standard [[instant messaging]] is not real-time text (the message is only sent at the end of a thought, not while it is being composed), a real-time text option is found in some instant messaging software, including [[AOL Instant Messenger]]'s "Real-Time IM"&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 AOL Instant Messenger "Real-Time IM"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312102140/http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; feature. Real-time text is also possible over any [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] compatible chat networks, including those used by [[Apple iChat]], [[Cisco WebEx]], and [[Google Talk]], by using appropriate software that has a real-time text feature. When present in IM programs, the real-time text feature can be turned on/off, just like other chat features such as audio. Real-time text programs date at least to the 1970s, with the [[talk (software)|talk]] program on the DEC [[PDP-11]], which remains in use on Unix systems.

Certain real-time text applications have a feature that allows the real-time text to be "turned off", for temporary purposes. This allows the sender to pre-compose the message as a standard IM or text message before transmitting.

== Use by the deaf ==
Real-time text is frequently used by the [[deaf]], including [[IP-Relay]] services, [[TDD/TTY]] devices, and [[Text over IP]]. Real-time text allows the other person to read immediately, without waiting for the sender to finish composing his or her sentence/message. This allows conversational use of text, much like a hearing person can listen to someone speaking in real-time.

== Captioned telephony ==
Captioned telephony is the streaming of real-time text captions in parallel with speech on a phone call.  This is used by people who are hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best they can, hearing all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough.  In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.

== Use in collaboration ==
[[Collaborative real-time editing]] is the utilization of real-time text for shared editing, rather than for conversation. Split screen chat, where conversational text appears continuously, is also considered real-time text. Some examples that provide this as a service are [[Apache Wave]] and its fork [[SwellRT]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://SwellRT.org SwellRT "SwellRT"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etherpad]], the editor Gobby,&lt;ref&gt;[https://gobby.github.io/ Gobby "Gobby"]&lt;/ref&gt; and most notably [[Google Docs]].

== Captioning, transcriptions and other uses ==
Real-time text is used in [[closed captioning]] and when captions are being streamed live continuously during live events. [[Transcription services]] including [[Communication Access Real-Time Translation]] and TypeWell frequently use real-time text, where text is streamed live to a remote display. This is used in [[court reporting]], and is also used by deaf attendees at a conference. Also, real-time text provides an enhancement to [[SMS|text messaging]] on mobile phones, via [[real-time texting]] apps.

== Real-time text protocols ==
Real-time text protocols include [[Text over IP]] (ToIP) designed around [[ITU-T]] [[T.140]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.140/en|title=T.140 : Protocol for multimedia application text conversation|author=tsbmail|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] RFC4103,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4103.txt IETF RFC4103 - RTP Payload for Text Conversation]&lt;/ref&gt; RFC5194,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5194.txt IETF RFC5194 - Framework for Real-Time Text over IP Using SIP]&lt;/ref&gt; and XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0301.html|title=XEP-0301: In-Band Real Time Text|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Total conversation ==
According to [[ITU-T]] Multimedia Recommendation F.703,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-F.703|title=F.703 : Multimedia conversational services|author=tsbmail|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[total conversation]] defines the simultaneous use of audio, video and real-time text. An instant messaging program that can enable all three features simultaneously, would be compliant. Real time text is an important part of it.

== History ==
Real-time text is also historically found in the old UNIX [[talk (software)|talk]], BBS software such as [[Celerity BBS]], and older versions of [[ICQ]] messaging software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">The '''SCR-658 radar''' was developed in conjunction with the [[SCR-268 radar]]. It was preceded by the SCR-258. Its primary purpose was to track weather balloons. Prior to this it was only possible to track weather balloons with a [[theodolite]], causing difficulty with visual tracking in poor [[weather]] conditions. The set is small enough to be portable and carried in a [[Ben Hur trailer]].

'''SITS:Vision''', also known just as SITS, is a database application used for course and student management in further and higher education institutions, developed and maintained by the Tribal Group. It is currently used by roughly 70%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribalgroup.com/aboutus/news/Pages/PRESSRELEASEOxfordUniversity.aspx] PRESS RELEASE: Tribal provides University of Oxford with market-leading Student Management System&lt;/ref&gt; of the UK higher education sector as well as international institutions such as the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[University of Otago]].

==History==
SITS has been in existence since 1991 and was first developed by a former Registrar and IT Director of a UK university. The company, Strategic Information Technology Services, started in a residential property in Beverley, East Yorkshire before moving to commercial property in Middleton-on-the-Wolds. The business moved to Hessle, East Yorkshire, in 1997 and into the current premises in Hesslewood in 2000.
SITS was acquired by Tribal Group PLC [TRB.L] in 2004.

==E:Vision==
E:Vision (sometimes styled as eVision or e:Vision), is a web-based interface designed to interact with the SITS client.

It was created with the intention of allowing users to design web-based interfaces for student and/or staff interaction. This has the advantage of allowing the user to circumvent the SITS client which some customers find cumbersome.

E:Vision interfaces are created using the traditional SITS client, but does not come as a standard component when purchasing SITS. The two basic type of interfaces that can be created are 'tasks' and 'vistas' - the former allowing workflows to be created wherein a user might complete a process or operation, the latter offers an area in which data can be viewed and edited.&lt;ref name="evision"&gt;[http://www.tribalgroup.com/technology/sitsvision/evision/Pages/default.aspx e:Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maxim Integrated]], headquartered in San Jose, California, is in Fortune 1000, and is included in the [[NASDAQ-100]], the [[Russell 1000]], and [[MSCI]] USA indices. Maxim was paying $164 million to acquire SensorDynamics.

==Product Portfolio==
SensorDynamics focused on three product groups, for each of which the company had created a development platform to guarantee a maximum re-use of silicon proven analogue and digital IPs. This was the basis for both application-specific developments and adaptations of existing products.

===Inertial microsensor systems===
SensorDynamics had developed and produced world's first [[MEMS]] combo sensors in combining [[MEMS]] motion sensors ([[angular acceleration|angular]] rate and/or acceleration) with sophisticated analogue-digital electronics (ASIC) in micro packages to form a large-scale of integrated micro sensor system.
Applications included electronic stabilization systems, rollover detection and navigation sets for ’blind reckoning’ without [[GPS]] support.

===Intelligent sensor interface circuits===
SensorDynamics had a wealth of expertise in the development and manufacturing of intelligent electronic signal conditioning circuitry of macro sensors such as core and planar [[inductor|coil]]s, [[resistor]]s, capacitive and magneto resistive sensors. Cooperation with the customer produces application-specific sensor systems that combined macro sensors and electronic signal conditioning at module level.

===Wireless sensors===
Examples of wireless sensors were to be found in ‘[[Keyless Go|Keyless go]]’ or tyre pressure systems. However, [[wireless]] and battery-less sensor systems are increasingly adopted in industrial applications; especially automation such as smart [[Low frequency|LF]]/[[Radio frequency|RF]] applications.
[[Energy harvesting]], in other words powering devices from the energy produced by movement, heat or light, was enabled by SensorDynamics' system on chip [[System on chip|SOC]] products. Sensor systems that incorporated energy use optimization management&amp;nbsp;– integrated processing of sensor signals through to the transmission of control signals at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]]&amp;nbsp;– was a special discipline of SensorDynamics.

* Hubertus Christ (Founder, [[CEO]] 09/2003 - 03/2012)
*[[Volker Kempe]] (Founder)
* Jürgen Tittel (Founder)

==Management and Team==
The company had about 130 employees world-wide when it was acquired by [[Maxim Integrated]] in July 2011. Their key qualifications included: extensive experience in sensor system development, [[MEMS]] and [[semiconductor]] technology, testing and [[quality assurance]] as well as deep knowledge of the [[automotive electronics]] market and strong applications expertise. SensorDynamics as a company had been operational as such since 2003, although the nucleus of the team worked together in prior companies since the 1990s.

==Quality and environmental management==
As SensorDynamics was also providing sensitive integrated products and systems to the automotive market, the quality and environmental management system was based on the [[ISO/TS16949]] and [[ISO 14001]] standard.
SensorDynamics satisfied all automotive quality requirements (i.e. [[ISO/TS16949]], [[ISO 14001]], [[IEC61508]], [[ISO 26262]], [[Automotive Electronics Council|AEC]] Q100).

A '''thermostat''' is a component which senses the [[temperature]] of a [[physical system]] and performs actions so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired  [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]].

Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature, examples include building [[heating]], [[central heating]], [[air conditioning|air conditioners]], [[HVAC]] systems, [[water heating| water heaters]], as well as kitchen equipment including [[oven]]s and [[refrigerator]]s and medical and scientific [[incubator (culture)|incubator]]s. In scientific literature, these devices are often broadly classified as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). Thermostatically controlled loads comprise roughly 50% of the overall electricity demand in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;  Energy Information Administration, ‘‘Residential energy consumption survey,’’ U.S. Dept. Energy, Washington, DC, Tech. Rep., 2001. &lt;/ref&gt; 

A thermostat operates as a "closed loop" control device, as it seeks to reduce the error between the desired and measured temperatures. Sometimes a thermostat combines both the sensing and control action elements of a controlled system, such as in an automotive thermostat.

The word thermostat is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words θεiμός ''thermos'', "hot" and στατός ''statos'', "standing, stationary".

==Overview==
A thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. A thermostat can often be the main control unit for a heating or cooling system, in applications ranging from ambient air control, to such as automotive coolant control. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature, examples include building [[heating]], [[central heating]], [[air conditioning|air conditioners]], as well as kitchen equipment including [[oven]]s and [[refrigerator]]s and medical and scientific [[incubator (culture)|incubator]]s.

==Construction==
Thermostats use different types of [[sensor]]s to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a [[bimetallic strip]] in the form of a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a [[thermistor]] or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or cooling equipment. A thermostat is an example of a "[[Bang–bang control|bang-bang controller]]" as the heating or cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full [[heat capacity|capacity]] until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or cooling equipment to respectively add or remove [[heat]] to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.

To prevent excessively rapid cycling of the equipment when the temperature is near the setpoint, a thermostat can include some [[hysteresis]]. Instead of changing from "on" to "off" and vice versa instantly at the set temperature, a thermostat with hysteresis will not switch until the temperature has changed a little past the set temperature point. For example, a refrigerator set to 2°C might not start the cooling compressor until its food compartment's temperature reaches 3°C, and will keep it running until the temperature has been lowered to 1 °C. This reduces the risk of equipment wear from too frequent switching, although it introduces a target system temperature oscillation of a certain magnitude.

To improve the comfort of the occupants of heated or air-conditioned spaces, bimetal sensor thermostats can include an "anticipator" system to slightly warm the temperature sensor while the heating equipment is operating, or to slightly warm the sensor when the cooling system is not operating. When correctly adjusted this reduces any excessive hysteresis in the system and reduces the magnitude of temperature variations. Electronic thermostats have an electronic equivalent. &lt;ref&gt; James E. Brumbaugh, ''AudelHVAC Fundamentals: Volume 2: Heating System Components, Gas and Oil Burners, and Automatic Controls'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004 {{ISBN|0764542079}}  pp. 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensor types==
Early technologies included mercury thermometers with electrodes inserted directly through the glass, so that when a certain (fixed) temperature was reached the contacts would be closed by the mercury. These were accurate to within a degree of temperature.

Common sensor technologies in use today include:

* [[Bimetal]]lic mechanical or electrical sensors.
* [[Wax thermostatic element|Expanding wax pellets]]
* Electronic [[thermistor]]s and [[semiconductor devices]]
* Electrical [[thermocouple]]s
These may then control the heating or cooling apparatus using:
* Direct mechanical control
* Electrical signals
* Pneumatic signals

==History==
Possibly the earliest recorded examples of thermostat control were built by the Dutch innovator [[Cornelis Drebbel]] (1572–1633) around 1620 in England. He invented a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken [[wikt:incubator|incubator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first recorded [[feedback|feedback-controlled]] devices.

Modern thermostat control was developed in the 1830s by [[Andrew Ure]] (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist, who invented the bi-metallic thermostat. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so to achieve this Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achrnews.com/articles/87035-an-early-history-of-comfort-heating |title=An Early History Of Comfort Heating |author= |date=November 6, 2001 |work=The NEWS Magazine |publisher=BNP Media |location=Troy, Michigan |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warren S. Johnson]] (1847–1911) of [[Wisconsin]] patented a bi-metal room thermostat in 1883, and two years later filed a patent for the first multi-zone thermostatic control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080710104405saikceinawz0.5803339.html |title=Thermostat Maker Deploys Climate Control Against Climate Change |publisher=America.gov |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/about-us/history |title=Johnson Controls Inc. &amp;#124; History |publisher=Johnsoncontrols.com |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Albert Butz]] (1849–1905) invented the electric thermostat and patented it in 1886.

One of the first industrial uses of the thermostat was in the regulation of the temperature in poultry incubators. [[Charles Hearson]], a British engineer, designed the first modern [[incubator (egg)|incubator]] for eggs that was taken up for use on poultry farms in 1879. The incubators incorporated an accurate thermostat to regulate the temperature so as to precisely simulate the experience of an egg being hatched naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Falk |first1=Cynthia G. |title=Barns of New York: Rural Architecture of the Empire State |year=2012 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location= Ithaca, New York |publication-date=May 1, 2012 |format=paperback |edition=First |isbn= 978-0-8014-7780-5 |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100673280 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical thermostats==
This covers only devices which both sense and control using purely mechanical means.

===Bimetal===
Domestic water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally been controlled by bi-metallic strip thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article. Purely mechanical control has been localised [[steam]] or hot-water [[radiator]] bi-metallic thermostats which [[wikt:regulate|regulated]] the individual flow. However, [[thermostatic radiator valve]]s (TRV) are now being widely used.

Purely mechanical thermostats are used to regulate dampers in some rooftop turbine vents, reducing building heat loss in cool or cold periods.

Some automobile passenger heating systems have a thermostatically controlled valve to regulate the water flow and temperature to an adjustable level. In older vehicles the thermostat controls the application of engine vacuum to actuators that control water valves and flappers to direct the flow of air. In modern vehicles, the vacuum actuators may be operated by small [[solenoids]] under the control of a central computer.

===Wax pellet===

====Automotive====
{{main article|Wax thermostatic element}}
[[File:carthermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Car engine thermostat]]
Perhaps the most common example of purely mechanical thermostat technology in use today is the [[internal combustion engine]] cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum [[operating temperature]] by regulating the flow of [[coolant]] to an air-cooled [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a [[valve]] when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax.  Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.
 
On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.

====Shower and other hot water controls====
A [[thermostatic mixing valve]] uses a wax pellet to control the mixing of hot and cold water.  A common application is to permit operation of an electric water heater at a temperature hot enough to kill ''[[Legionella]]'' bacteria (above {{convert|60|C}}), while the output of the valve produces water that is cool enough to not immediately scald ({{convert|49|C}}).

===Analysis===
A wax pellet driven valve can be analyzed through graphing the wax pellet's [[hysteresis]] which consists of two thermal expansion curves; extension (motion) vs. temperature increase, and contraction (motion) vs. temperature decrease. The spread between the up and down curves visually illustrate the valve's hysteresis; there is always hysteresis within wax driven valves due to the [[phase transition|phase change]] between solids and liquids. Hysteresis can be controlled with specialized blended mixes of hydrocarbons; tight hysteresis is what most desire, however some applications require broader ranges. Wax pellet driven valves are used in anti scald, freeze protection, over-temp purge, solar thermal, automotive, and aerospace applications among many others.  

===Gas expansion===
Thermostats are sometimes used to regulate gas ovens. It consists of a gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located at the top of the oven. The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.

===Pneumatic thermostats===
A [[pneumatic]] thermostat is a thermostat that controls a heating or cooling system via a series of air-filled control tubes. This "control air" system responds to the pressure changes (due to temperature) in the control tube to activate heating or cooling when required.  The control air typically is maintained on "mains" at 15-18&amp;nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (although usually operable up to 20&amp;nbsp;psi). Pneumatic thermostats typically provide output/ branch/ post-restrictor (for single-pipe operation) pressures of 3-15&amp;nbsp;psi which is piped to the end device (valve/ damper actuator/ pneumatic-electric switch, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dr-fix-it.com/pneum1.html |title= Dr-Fix-It Explains a Common Pneumatic Comfort Control Circuit |date= 2005 |website= dr-fix-it.com |publisher= RTWEB |accessdate= November 2, 2014}}[https://web.archive.org/web/20171206202646/http://www.dr-fix-it.com/pneum1.html Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pneumatic thermostat was invented by Warren Johnson in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Fehring, T.H., ed., ''Mechanical Engineering: A Century of Progress,'' NorCENergy Consultants, LLC, October 10, 1980 - Technology &amp; Engineering, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; soon after he invented the electric thermostat. In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090192653.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that allows pneumatically controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as [[direct digital control]] (DDC).

A wax pellet driven valve can be analyzed by graphing the wax pellet's hysteresis which consists of two thermal expansion curves; extension (motion) vs. temperature increase, and contraction (motion) vs. temperature decrease. The spread between the up and down curves visually illustrate the valve's [[hysteresis]]; there is always hysteresis within wax driven technology due to the phase change between solids and liquids. Hysteresis can be controlled with specialized blended mixes of hydrocarbons; tight hysteresis is what most desire, however specialized engineering applications require broader ranges. Wax pellet driven valves are used in anti scald, freeze protection, over-temp purge, solar thermal, automotive, and aerospace applications among many others.

==Electrical and analog electronic thermostats==

===Bimetallic switching thermostats===
[[File:OfficeThermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Bimetallic thermostat for buildings.]]
Water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central system would be switched on when the temperature drops below the setpoint on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of [[hysteresis]] to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic [[sensor]]s. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the setpoint desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.

===Simple two wire thermostats===
[[File:WPThermostat new.jpg|thumb|right|Millivolt thermostat mechanism]]
&lt;!-- Edited to clarify. Millivolt systems, 24 V systems and direct-control are subsets of the two wire thermostat. --&gt;
The illustration is the interior of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a [[natural gas|gas]]-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler [[zone valve]]s, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from [[volt|millivolts]] to 240 [[volt]]s in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). ''Due to the variety of possible [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|current]]s available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.''

# Setpoint control [[lever]]. This is moved to the right for a higher temperature. The round indicator pin in the center of the second slot shows through a numbered slot in the outer case.
# [[Bimetallic strip]] wound into a coil. The center of the coil is attached to a rotating post attached to lever (1). As the coil gets colder the moving end&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; carrying (4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; moves [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]].
# Flexible wire. The left side is connected via one wire of a pair to the heater control valve.
# Moving contact attached to the bimetal coil. Thence, to the heater's controller.
# [[Magnet]]. This ensures a good contact when the contact closes.  It also provides [[hysteresis]] to prevent short heating cycles, as the temperature must be raised several [[degree (temperature)|degree]]s before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a [[mercury switch]] on the end of the bimetal coil.  The weight of the mercury on the end of the coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles.  However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently [[toxic]] nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as [[chemical waste]].
# Fixed contact screw. This is adjusted by the [[manufacturer]]. It is connected electrically by a second wire of the pair to the thermocouple and the heater's electrically operated gas valve.

Not shown in the illustration is a separate bimetal thermometer on the outer case to show the actual temperature at the thermostat.

====Millivolt thermostats====
As illustrated in the use of the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a [[thermopile]] which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light. The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.

This type of device is generally considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in the same way a dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces. Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy "wasted" on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank. The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external electrical power supply.  For tankless "on demand" water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.

Some [[programmable thermostat]]s - those that offer simple "millivolt" or "two-wire" modes - will control these systems.

====24 volt thermostats====
The majority of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts [[Alternating current|AC]]) control circuits. The source of the 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed as part of the heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as [[relay]]s, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels.&lt;ref&gt;Electrical potentials at and below 24 volts are classed as "Safety Extra-Low Voltage" under most [[electrical code]]s when supplied through an isolation transformer.&lt;/ref&gt; Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation.  A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating.  This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting.  A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.

Electromechanical thermostats use resistance elements as anticipators. Most electronic thermostats use either thermistor devices or integrated logic elements for the anticipation function.  In some electronic thermostats, the thermistor anticipator may be located outdoors, providing a variable anticipation depending on the outdoor temperature. Thermostat enhancements include outdoor temperature display, programmability, and system fault indication. While such 24 volt thermostats are incapable of operating a furnace when the mains power fails, most such furnaces require mains power for heated air fans (and often also hot-surface or electronic spark ignition) rendering moot the functionality of the thermostat. In other circumstances such as piloted wall and "gravity" (fanless) floor and central heaters the low voltage system described previously may be capable of remaining functional when electrical power is unavailable.

There are no standards for wiring color codes, but convention has settled on the following terminal codes and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawyer|first1="Doc"|title=Thermostat Wire  Color Codes|url=http://www.dr-fix-it.com/ttt/10005.html|website=dr-fix-it.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}[http://thermostatonline.com/blog/beating-the-puzzle-of-thermostat-wiring/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Transtronics, Inc.|title=Thermostat signals and wiring|url=http://wiki.xtronics.com/index.php/Thermostat_signals_and_wiring|website=wiki.xtronics.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all cases, the manufacturer's instructions should be considered definitive.

====Line voltage thermostats====
Line voltage thermostats are most commonly used for electric space heaters such as a [[baseboard]] heater or a direct-wired electric furnace.  If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching [[Electric current|current]] often exceeding 40 [[ampere]]s, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result at least in the failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire.  Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of [[fan-coil]] (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) &lt;!-- Nonsense sentence.  How can line voltage "blow through a coil of tubing"? --&gt; units in large systems using centralized [[boiler]]s and [[chiller]]s, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.

Some programmable thermostats are available to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some [[Honeywell]] models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control rather than relying on the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.

==Digital electronic thermostats==

[[File:Lux Products WIN100 Thermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Lux Products WIN100 Heating &amp; Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat shown with control door closed and open.]]

Newer [[Digital data|digital]] thermostats have no [[mechanism (technology)|moving parts]] to [[measurement|measure]] temperature and instead rely on [[thermistor]]s or other [[semiconductor devices]] such as a [[resistance thermometer]] (resistance temperature detector). Typically one or more regular [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] must be installed to operate it, although some so-called "power stealing" digital thermostats use the common 24 volt AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on [[thermopile]] powered "millivolt" circuits used in some furnaces.  Each has an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting.  Most also have a [[clock]], and time-of-day and even day-of-week settings for the temperature, used for [[comfort]] and [[energy conservation]].  Some advanced models have [[touch screen]]s, or the ability to work with [[home automation]] or [[building automation]] systems.

Digital thermostats use either a relay or a [[semiconductor device]] such as [[TRIAC|triac]] to act as a switch to control the [[HVAC]] unit.  Units with relays will operate millivolt systems, but often make an audible "click" noise when switching on or off.

HVAC systems with the ability to modulate their output can be combined with thermostats that have a built-in [[PID controller]] to achieve smoother operation.
There are also modern thermostats featuring adaptive algorithms to further improve the inertia prone system behaviour. For instance, setting those up so that the temperature in the morning at 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. should be 21&amp;nbsp;°C (69.8&amp;nbsp;°F), makes sure that at that time the temperature will be 21&amp;nbsp;°C (69.8&amp;nbsp;°F), where a conventional thermostat would just start working at that time.  The algorithms decide at what time the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell smat response technology|url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/69825/Honeywell-Ct3611.html?page=20|website=manualslib.com|accessdate=10 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other thermostat used for process/industrial control where ON/OFF control is not suitable the PID control can also makes sure that the temperature is very stable (for instance, by reducing overshoots by fine tuning PID constants for set value(SV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart PID temperature control|url=http://smartpid.com/smart-thermostat/|website=smartpid.com|accessdate=10 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or maintaining temperature in a band by deploying hysteresis control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperature Controllers Using Hysteresis|url=https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/blog/temperature-controllers-using-hysteresis|website=panasonic.com|accessdate=10 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Most digital thermostats in common residential use in North America and Europe are [[programmable thermostat]]s, which will typically provide a 30% energy savings if left with their default programs; adjustments to these defaults may increase or reduce energy savings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The [[programmable thermostat]] article provides basic information on the operation, selection and installation of such a thermostat.

With non-zoned (typical residential, one thermostat for the whole house) systems, when the thermostat's R (or Rh) and W terminals are connected, the furnace will go through its start-up procedure and produce heat.

With zoned systems (some residential, many commercial systems&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; several thermostats controlling different "zones" in the building), the thermostat will cause small electric motors to open valves or dampers and start the furnace or boiler if it's not already running.

Most programmable thermostats will control these systems.

===Combination heating/cooling regulation===
Depending on what is being controlled, a [[forced-air]] [[air conditioning]] thermostat generally has an external [[switch]] for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the [[fan (mechanical)|blower fan]] on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running.  Four [[wire]]s come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a [[closet]], [[basement]], or occasionally in the [[attic]]): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green to turn on the blower fan.  The power is supplied by a [[transformer]], and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and one or two of the other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).

A thermostat, when set to "cool", will only turn on when the ambient temperature of the surrounding room is above the set temperature.  Thus, if the controlled space has a temperature normally above the desired setting when the heating/cooling system is off, it would be wise to keep the thermostat set to "cool", despite what the temperature is outside.  On the other hand, if the temperature of the controlled area falls below the desired degree, then it is advisable to turn the thermostat to "heat".

===Heat pump regulation===
[[File:Thermostat-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|Thermostat design]]
The [[heat pump]] is a refrigeration based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the indoor and outdoor coils.  This is done by energizing a [[reversing valve]] (also known as a "4-way" or "change-over" valve).  During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air.  During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat is removed from the outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil.  The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool.  Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an "O" terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a "B" terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating.  The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building.  A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point.  Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat.  During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place.  This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity.  Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil.  This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements.  The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building.  The elements are then used in the "reheat" function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail.  This function is normally activated by an "E" terminal on the thermostat.  When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.

===Thermostat location===
The thermostat should not be located on an outside wall or where it could be exposed to direct sunlight at any time during the day. It should be located away from the room's cooling or heating vents or device, yet exposed to general airflow from the room(s) to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Thinking about Thermostats|url=https://www.kmccontrols.com/images/com_kmcproducts/products_documents/sensor_thermostat_fundamentals_white_paper_reva.pdf|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An open hallway may be most appropriate for a single zone system, where living rooms and bedrooms are operated as a single zone. If the hallway may be closed by doors from the regulated spaces then these should be left open when the system is in use. If the thermostat is too close to the source controlled then the system will tend to "short a cycle", and numerous starts and stops can be annoying and in some cases shorten equipment life. A multiple zoned system can save considerable energy by regulating individual spaces, allowing unused rooms to vary in temperature by turning off the heating and cooling.

=== Dummy thermostats ===
It has been reported that many thermostats in office buildings are non-functional dummy devices, installed to give tenants' employees an [[illusion of control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1042577628591401304|title=Employees Only Think They Control Thermostat |last=Sandberg|first=Jared|date=January 15, 2003|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/04/dummy_thermosta.html|title="Dummy" Thermostats Cool Down Tempers, Not Temperatures|author=Katrina C. Arabe|date=April 11, 2003|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dummy thermostats are in effect a type of [[placebo button]]. However, these thermostats are often used to detect the temperature in the zone, even though their controls are disabled. This function is often referred to as "lockout".&lt;ref&gt;Example datasheet of current art thermostat, exhibiting lockout functionality : http://cgproducts.johnsoncontrols.com/MET_PDF/12011079.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ToggleKeys''' is a feature of [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is an [[accessibility]] function which is designed for people who have [[vision impairment]] or [[cognitive disabilities]]. When '''ToggleKeys''' is turned on, computer will provide sound cues when the locking keys ({{keypress|[[Caps Lock]]}}, {{keypress|[[Num Lock]]}}, or {{keypress|[[Scroll Lock]]}}) are pressed. A high-pitched sound plays when the keys are switched on and a low-pitched sound plays when they are switched off.

== History ==
Microsoft first introduced ToggleKeys with [[Windows 95]]. The feature is also used in later versions of Windows.

==Enabling==
Press the {{keypress|[[Num Lock]]}} key for 5 seconds while holding. This feature can also be turned on and off via the [[Accessibility]] icon in the Windows [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]].

[[Image:videoplus.jpg|200px|right]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:gcode.jpg|200px|right]] --&gt;
'''VCR Plus+''', '''G-Code''', '''VideoPlus+''' and '''ShowView''' are different names for the same scheduling system for programming [[Digital video recorder|video recorder]]s. These names are all registered trademarks of [[Macrovision]], whose corporate predecessor, [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|Gemstar]], developed these algorithms for use in integrated [[endec]]s.

==History==
[[File:Vacuum fluorescent 1.jpg|thumb|right|A full view of a typical [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) used in a [[videocassette recorder]]]]
Before the advent of [[on-screen display]]s, the only interface available for programming a home video recorder was a small [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]], [[LED]] or [[LCD]] panel and a small number of buttons. Correctly setting up a recording for a specific program was therefore a somewhat complex operation for many people. G-Code, VideoPlus+ and ShowView were introduced in the late 1980s to remove this difficulty.

==Concept==
The central concept of the system is a unique number, a PlusCode, assigned to each program, and published in television listings in newspapers and magazines (such as ''[[TV Guide]]''). To record a program, the code number is taken from the newspaper and input into the video recorder, which would then record on the correct channel at the correct time. The number is generated by an [[algorithm]] from the date, time and channel of the program; as a result, it does not rely on an over-the-air channel to serve as a conduit to ensure the recording is properly timed. This means it will not compensate for a disrupted schedule due to live sporting events or bulletins for [[breaking news]] events, however many video recorders with these systems also incorporate [[Programme Delivery Control]] (PDC) and use that to alter times if possible.

==Branding==
The system has been licensed to television and [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] manufacturers in about 40 countries, but is branded under different names depending on the country. It is known as '''VCR Plus+''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; '''G-Code''' in [[Japan]], [[China]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]; '''VideoPlus+''' in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; and '''ShowView''' in the rest of [[Europe]] as well as in [[South Africa]]. The system is branded as VideoPlus+/ShowView in Europe due to an existing trademark registration for "VCR" by [[Philips]] in that continent, and as G-Code (the "G" standing for the system's developer Gemstar) in Japan because VCR is not a common abbreviation there ("VTR," for videotape recorder, is used instead). Because television programming schedules are different, the coding has to be adjusted in each of the regions and recording equipment is not interchangeable.

==Algorithms==
The actual algorithms used to encode and decode the television guide values from and to their time representations were published in 1992, but only for six-digit codes or less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.righto.com/papers/vcr.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Shirriff, C. Welch, A. Kinsman, Decoding a VCR Controller Code, Cryptologia, 16(3), July 1992, pp 227-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source code for seven and eight digit codes was written in [[C programming language|C]] and [[Perl]] and posted anonymously in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/VCRPlus+/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panama-Pacific International Exposition - Project Gutenberg eText 17625.png|thumb|Lighting at the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]], 1915, designed by Ryan, including the Scintillator searchlight display]]
'''Walter D'Arcy Ryan''' ([[Kentville, Nova Scotia]], Canada, April 17, 1870 &amp;ndash; [[Schenectady, New York]], USA, March 14, 1934) was an influential early [[lighting engineer]] who worked for [[General Electric]] as director of its Illuminating Engineering Laboratory. He pioneered skyscraper illumination, designed the Scintillator colored searchlights display, and was responsible for the lighting of the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] and the [[Century of Progress Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], in addition to the first complete illumination of [[Niagara Falls]]. He combined illumination into both an art and a science.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ryan was born in Kentville, Nova Scotia, and educated in Canada for a military career, but instead emigrated to the United States around 1890.&lt;ref name=World&gt;"Personal," ''Electrical World'' 65.22 (1915) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1440&amp;dq=Walter+D%27Arcy+Ryan+Kentville&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RlE1T9bxKcPTiALA4bDVCg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Walter%20D%27Arcy%20Ryan%20Kentville&amp;f=false p. 1440].&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for General Electric in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], and was rapidly promoted and put in charge of the Commercial Department, which developed into the Illuminating Engineering Laboratory, the world's first institution for research into lighting;&lt;ref name=Neumann231&gt;Karen Bouchard and Dietrich Neumann, "Walter D'Arcy Ryan (1870&amp;ndash;1934)," "Lighting Designers&amp;mdash;Selected Biographies," in ''Architecture of the Night: The Illuminated Building'', ed.

In particular, under Ryan the Illuminating Engineering Laboratory developed the ornamental streetlighting scheme called the [[White Way]] after [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and General Electric promoted it to towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;David E.

Jakle, ''City Lights: Illuminating the American Night'', Landscapes of the Night, Baltimore/London: Johns Hopkins University, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-6593-0}}, pp. 226&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan described it as a way to provide "cosmopolitan atmosphere and dignified aesthetic effects".&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Ryan, "Intense Street Lighting," ''General Electric Review'' 23 (May 1920) 362, quoted in Jakle, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of lighting as spectacle==
In 1908, with Charles G. Armstrong, Ryan was responsible for the first illumination of an entire skyscraper: the new tower of the [[Singer Building]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|lower Broadway]] in [[New York City]] was lighted from the base to the 35th floor with arc searchlights, while the top of the tower was outlined with 1,600 incandescent bulbs, the technique that had been used to illuminate buildings up to that time.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;"Singer Building&amp;mdash;New York, New York&amp;mdash;1908," "Selected Projects," in ''Architecture of the Night'', pp. 96–97. The biography of Ryan on p. 231 incorrectly dates this to 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; The illumination, which was planned when the building was designed, was bright enough for colors to be visible, but was patchy; [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] used retouched photographs for advertising.&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt; He later illuminated other skyscrapers, in particular in 1912 the [[Electric Tower|General Electric Company Building]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], which he lighted with arc searchlights and a revolving searchlight in changing colors on the top of the tower; this scheme prefigured the colored floodlighting of skyscrapers and Ryan's own work for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition three years later.&lt;ref&gt;"General Electric Company Building&amp;mdash;Buffalo, New York&amp;mdash;1912," "Selected Projects," in ''Architecture of the Night'', pp. 100&amp;ndash;01, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was also responsible for lighting the interior of that building.&lt;ref name=World/&gt;

Ryan was in charge of lighting for the New York [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] of 1909, and for this lighted up all the major buildings, East River bridges, public places, and some stretches of the coastline of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Tell, ''Times Square Spectacular: Lighting up Broadway'', New York: Smithsonian Books/Collins, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-06-088433-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwaLWFSG3rcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Walter+D%27Arcy+Ryan+Scintillator&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3cc5T7mHKOXg2QXVuJy5Cg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Walter%20D%27Arcy%20Ryan%20Scintillator&amp;f=false p. 34].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nye62&gt;Nye, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAElGDvk2yUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=David+E.+Nye,+Electrifying+America&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xmA9T8aLC-vYiALW66zLAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Every%20public%20building%20from%20City%20Hall%20to%20Grant%27s%20Tomb&amp;f=false p. 62].&lt;/ref&gt; He installed colored searchlights on the Singer Building. The tower was reportedly visible from 40 miles away, and made a great impression:&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat every one of the visitors paused to gaze at was the Singer Building tower&amp;nbsp;... The main building was dark and gloomy, but from its center sprang a terra-cotta shaft set off with pale green pilasters rising to a golden cornice. The lights which illuminated it could not be seen, but it glowed against the sky.&lt;ref&gt;"City Illumined as Never Before," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 26, 1909, quoted in ''Architecture of the Night'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryan also made use of searchlights for non-architectural display, in the Scintillator, sometimes called the Ryan Scintillator. This consisted of searchlights equipped with color filters and refracted through steam;&lt;ref&gt;Jakle, p. 129 and Fig. 6.3, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; the beams of light were also made to form different shapes, including a peacock's tail and a sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;Rucha Desai, [http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/special_programs/honors_program/hudsonfulton_celebra/homepage/iluminations_and_ele_32194.asp "Illuminations and the Electric City,"] Hudson-Fulton Celebration Project, [[Fordham University]], with picture.&lt;/ref&gt; It was on display at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, with shows twice nightly at [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and 155th Street.&lt;blockquote&gt;Forty huge searchlights of varying color shot enormous beams high in the air, now radiating in fan-like effect and changing from intensest white to the softer greens and yellows; now again shifting bodily from east to west and back again with frightful speed.&lt;ref&gt;"Hudson-Fulton Celebration," ''Electrical Age'' 40 (October 1909) p. 276, quoted in Jakle, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The steam was supplied by a 200-horsepower boiler, and black powder and smoke bombs were also used.&lt;ref name=Nye62/&gt;

Mysterious vapors rise from steam-electric cauldrons and also from the beautiful central fountain group symbolizing the Earth in formation.&lt;ref&gt;W. D.

The art of floodlighting developed directly from this scheme of lighting."&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost twenty years later, in 1933, Ryan was also the lighting designer for Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition, which again was notable for its lighting innovation.&lt;ref name=Jakle161/&gt; To match the ''[[art moderne]]'' architecture, Ryan used the new electric gaseous discharge lamps, especially neon (over 75,000 feet of neon tubing in addition to more than 15,000 incandescent lamps).&lt;ref name=Jakle162&gt;Jakle, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jakle163&gt;Jakle, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The fair was conceived of in large part as a lighting display; building surfaces were brightly colored, smooth, and shiny with few openings, for optimum reflectivity, and the fair opened at night (with a fireworks display ignited by light from the star [[Arcturus]] that had originated at the time of the previous Chicago World's Fair, converted into an electrical pulse by a photo-electric cell).&lt;ref name=Jakle162/&gt; The exterior lighting required 3,000&amp;nbsp;kilowatts of power; the General Electric building had a simulated waterfall on its side that alone required 5,000&amp;nbsp;feet of blue tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Neumann164&gt;"A Century of Progress International Exhibition&amp;mdash;Chicago, Illinois&amp;mdash;1933," "Selected Projects," in ''Architecture of the Night'', pp. 164&amp;ndash;67, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; But the use of new technology enabled Ryan to obtain the maximum amount of light for the fair's limited funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bouman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ujGSkDJRx_cC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Walter+D%27Arcy+Ryan+Century+of+Progress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7lU9T72JHKTZiQL67K2PAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Walter%20D%27Arcy%20Ryan%20Century%20of%20Progress&amp;f=false p. 182].&lt;/ref&gt; Scintillators were used again, with smoke effects from the fireworks,&lt;ref name=Neumann164/&gt; but this time the modern lighting fixtures were placed in full view.&lt;ref name=Jakle163/&gt; The largest electric incandescent filament lamp in the world, 50&amp;nbsp;kilowatts, was on display.&lt;ref name=Jakle164&gt;Jakle, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; For its second year, in 1934, the illumination was increased by about half, and the Ford Building had a Pillar of Light created by 24 searchlights projecting a mile into the sky. The closing program for the exposition on October 31, 1934, was titled "The Festival of Illumination: The Apotheosis of Man-Made Light."&lt;ref&gt;"A Century of Progress International Exposition," p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the fair was influential: the expositions at Dallas and Cleveland the following year both emulated both the architecture and the lighting of the Chicago fair.&lt;ref name=Jakle164/&gt;

The '''Waste Isolation Pilot Plant''', or '''WIPP''', is the world's third [[deep geological repository]] (after closure of Germany's [[Repository for radioactive waste Morsleben]] and the [[Schacht Asse II]] Salt Mine) licensed to permanently dispose of [[Transuranium element|transuranic]] [[radioactive waste]] for 10,000 years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/radiation/wipp/2010recertification.html 2010 WIPP Recertification Decision]&lt;/ref&gt; that is left from the research and production of [[nuclear weapons]].  The plant is estimated to incur a total cost of $19B.&lt;ref name=Feder /&gt;

It is located approximately {{convert|26|mi|km}} east of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]], in eastern [[Eddy County, New Mexico|Eddy County]], in an area known as the southeastern New Mexico nuclear corridor which also includes the [[National Enrichment Facility]] near [[Eunice, New Mexico]], the [[Waste Control Specialists]] low-level waste disposal facility just over the border near Andrews, Texas, and the International Isotopes, Inc. facility to be built near Eunice, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;International Isotopes Inc.: [http://www.intisoid.com/index.php/fep/more-information/project-overview/ Project Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[USDOE]] withdrew previous plans to develop [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in Nevada. WIPP was identified as a candidate for a facility to store waste for nuclear weapons defense related waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIPP Update, January 9, 2016|url=http://www.wipp.energy.gov/wipprecovery/recovery.html|website=WIPP Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Recovery|publisher=United States Department of Energy|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various mishaps at the plant in 2014 brought focus to the problem of what to do with this growing backlog of waste and whether or not WIPP would be a safe repository.&lt;ref name="Jeff Tollefson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/us-seeks-waste-research-revival-1.14804 |title=US seeks waste-research revival: Radioactive leak brings nuclear repositories into the spotlight |author=Jeff Tollefson |date=4 March 2014 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 incidents involved  a waste explosion and airborne release of radiological material that exposed 21 plant workers to internal doses of plutonium, which can lead to cancer of the lungs, liver, and bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vartabedian|first1=Ralph|title=2014 accident at WIPP ranks among costliest in U.S. history|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/830731/2014-nuclear-accident-at-wipp-ranks-among-costliest-in-u-s-history.html|accessdate=20 January 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Albuquerque Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxic Substances Portal: Toxic Health Statement for Plutonium|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=646&amp;tid=119|website=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|publisher=U.S. Center for Disease Control|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Geology and site selection===
In 1970 the United States Atomic Energy Commission (later merged into the Department of Energy) proposed a site in [[Lyons, Kansas]] for the isolation and storage of radioactive waste. Ultimately the Lyons site was deemed unusable due to local and regional opposition, and in particular the discovery of unmapped oil and gas wells located in the area. These wells were believed to potentially compromise the ability of the planned facility to contain nuclear waste. In 1973, as a result of these concerns, and because of positive interest from the southern New Mexico community, the DOE relocated the site of the proposed nuclear waste repository, now called the  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), to the Delaware Basin salt beds located near  [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

The [[Delaware Basin]] is a sedimentary basin formed largely during the [[Permian Period]] approximately 250 million years ago. It is one of three sub-basins of the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. It contains a 1,500-2,800 meter thick column of sedimentary rock that includes some of the most oil- and gas-rich rocks in the United States.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;Weeks, Jennifer. "Nuclear Waste Buried for the Ages in New Mexico Desert". ''CQ Researcher'' 21.4 (2011): 84–85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient shallow sea repeatedly filled the basin and evaporated while the basin slowly subsided, leaving behind a nearly impermeable 1,000 meters thick layer of evaporites, primarily salt, in the Salado and Castile Formations, geologically similar to other basins created by evaporitic [[inland seas]]. Over time the salt beds were covered by an additional 300 meters of soil and rock.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, Richard A. "For Radioactive Waste from Weapons, a Home at Last". ''Science'' 283.5408 (1999): 1626. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As drilling in the [[Salado Formation]] salt beds began in 1975, scientists discovered that at the edge of the basin there had been geological disturbances that had moved interbed layers into a nearly vertical position.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt; In response, the site was moved toward the more stable center of the basin where the Salado Formation salt beds are the thickest and perfectly horizontal.

Some observers suggested, early in the investigations, that the geological complexity of the basin was problematic, causing the hollowed-out caverns to be unstable.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charles, Dan. "Will America's Nuclear Waste Be Laid To Rest?" ''New Scientist'' 132.1799 (1991): 16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, what is considered by some to be instability is considered by others to be a positive aspect of salt as a host rock. As early as 1957 the National Academy of Sciences recommended salt for radioactive waste disposal because at depth it would plastically deform, a motion called "salt creep" in the salt-mining industry. This would gradually fill in and seal any openings created by the mining, and in and around the waste.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council|date=1957|title="The Disposal of Radioactive Waste on Land", Report of the Committee on Waste Disposal of the Division of Earth Sciences|author1=Harry H.

Exact placement of the construction site in the Delaware Basin changed multiple times due to safety concerns. [[Brine]] deposits located below the salt deposits in the Delaware Basin posed a potential safety problem. The brine was first discovered when a 1975 drilling released a pressurized deposit of the liquid from below the repository level.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt; Constructing the plant near one of these deposits could, under specific circumstances, compromise the facility’s safety. The brine could leak into the repository and either dissolve radioactivity or entrain particulate matter with [[radioactive waste]] to the surface. The contaminated brine would then need to be cleaned and properly disposed of. There is no drinking water near the site, so possible water pollution is not a concern. After multiple deep drilling, a final site was selected. The site is located approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km east of Carlsbad.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

Waste is placed in rooms {{convert|2150|ft|m}} underground that have been excavated within a {{convert|3000|ft|m}} thick salt formation ([[Delaware Basin|Salado and Castile Formations]]) where [[salt tectonics]] have been stable for more than 250 million years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Because of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity effects]], salt and water will flow to any cracks that develop, a major reason why the area was chosen as a host medium for the WIPP project.&lt;ref name="wipp.energy.gov"&gt;[http://www.wipp.energy.gov/picsprog/test1/Permanent_Markers_Implementation_Plan_rev1.pdf WIPP Permanent Markers Implementation Plan, rev1 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoserve.sandia.gov/sand_doc/1992/921382.pdf "Expert Judgment on Markers to Deter Inadvertent Human Intrusion into the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant"], [[Sandia National Laboratories]] report SAND92-1382 / UC-721 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wayback.archive-it.org"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130704215345/http://downlode.org/Etext/WIPP/ Excerpts of SAND92-1382 in HTML format]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addressing public concerns via the EEG===
In order to address growing public unrest concerning construction of the WIPP, the New Mexico Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) was created in 1978.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt; This group, charged with overseeing the WIPP, verified statements, facts, and studies conducted and released by the DOE regarding the facility. The stewardship this group provided effectively lowered public fear{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and let the facility progress with little public opposition in comparison to similar facilities around the nation such as [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] in Nevada.

The EEG, in addition to acting as a check for the government agencies overseeing the project, acted as a valuable advisor. In a 1981 drilling, pressurized brine was again discovered. The site was set to be abandoned when the EEG stepped in and suggested a series of tests on the brine and the surrounding area. These tests were conducted and the results showed that the brine deposit was relatively small and was isolated from other deposits. Drilling in the area was deemed safe due to these results. This saved the project valuable money and time by preventing a drastic relocation.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

===Early construction and testing complications===
In 1979 Congress authorized construction of the facility.&lt;ref name="Lorenzi"&gt;Lorenzi, Neal. "DOE May Open Nuclear Waste Isolation Plant". ''Professional Safety'' 41.4 (1996): 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to formal authorization, Congress redefined the level of waste to be stored in the WIPP from [[High level waste|high temperature]] to [[Transuranic waste|transuranic]], or low level, waste. Transuranic waste often consists of materials which have come in contact with radioactive substances such as [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]]. This often includes gloves, tools, rags, and assorted machinery often used in the production of [[nuclear fuel]] and [[Nuclear weapon|weapons]].&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; Although much less potent than nuclear reactor byproducts, this waste still remains radioactive for approximately 24,000 years.&lt;ref name=Charles /&gt; This change in classification led to a decrease in safety parameters for the proposed facility, allowing construction to continue at a faster pace.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

The first extensive testing of the facility was due to begin in 1988. The proposed testing procedures involved interring samples of low level waste in the newly constructed caverns. Various structural and environmental tests would then be performed on the facility to verify its integrity and to prove its ability to safely contain nuclear waste.&lt;ref name="Mon"&gt;Monastersky, Richard. "First nuclear waste dump finally ready". ''Science News'' 140.15 (1991): 228. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition from various external organizations delayed actual testing into the early 1990s. Attempts at testing were resumed in October 1991 with US Secretary of Energy [[James D. Watkins|James Watkins]] announcing that he would begin transportation of waste to the WIPP.&lt;ref name=Charles /&gt;

Despite apparent progress on the facility, construction still remained costly and complicated. Originally conceptualized in the 1970s as a warehouse for waste, the repository now had regulations similar to those of [[nuclear reactors]]. As of December 1991, the plant had been under construction for 20 years and was estimated to have cost over one billion dollars.&lt;ref name=Charles /&gt; At the time, WIPP officials reported over 28 different organizations claimed authority over operations of the facility.&lt;ref name=Charles /&gt;

===Congressional approval===
In November 1991, a federal judge ruled that Congress must approve WIPP before any waste, even for testing purposes, was sent to the facility. This indefinitely delayed testing until Congress gave its approval.&lt;ref name=Charles /&gt; The [[102nd United States Congress]] passed legislation allowing use of the WIPP. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved the facility on October 6, 1992 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed a bill allowing the opening of the facility on October 8 of the same year.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Elizabeth A. "Senate Clears Bill To Start Tests At New Mexico Nuclear Dump". ''Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report'' 50.40 (1992): 3156. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was met with much opposition in the Senate. Senator [[Richard H. Bryan]] fought the bill based on safety issues that concerned a [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|similar facility]] located in [[Nevada]], the state for which he was serving as senator.  His efforts almost prevented the bill from passing. New Mexico senators [[Pete V. Domenici]] and [[Jeff Bingaman]] effectively reassured Senator Bryan that these issues would be addressed in the [[103rd Congress]]. The final legislation provided safety standards requested by the House and an expedited timeline requested by the Senate.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

The final legislation mandated that the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issue revised safety standards for the facility. It also required the EPA to approve testing plans for the facility within ten months. The legislation stated that the security standards mandated in the bill were only applicable to the WIPP in New Mexico and not to other facilities in the United States. This clause caused Senator Bryan to oppose the bill, as he wanted safety standards mandated by the bill to apply to the facility in Nevada as well.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

===Testing and final certification===
In 1994, Congress ordered [[Sandia National Laboratories]] to begin an extensive evaluation of the facility against the standards set forth by the EPA. Evaluation of the facility continued for four years, resulting in a cumulative total of 25 years of evaluation. In May 1998, the EPA concluded that there was "reasonable expectation" that the facility would contain the vast majority of the waste interred there.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

The first nuclear waste arrived to the plant on March 26, 1999. This waste shipment was from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], a major nuclear weapons research and development facility located north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Another shipment followed on April 6 of the same year. These shipments marked the beginning of plant operations.&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;Feder, Toni. "DOE Opens WIPP for Nuclear Waste Burial". ''Physics Today'' 52.5 (1999):  59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the plant had received and stored 9,207 shipments ({{convert|72422|m3|abbr=on}}) of waste. The majority of this waste was transported to the facility via railroad or truck.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The final facility contains a total of 56 storage rooms located approximately 650 meters underground. Each room is 100 yards in length.&lt;ref name=Mon /&gt; The plant is estimated to continue accepting waste for 25 to 35 years and is estimated to cost a grand total of 19 billion dollars.&lt;ref name=Feder /&gt;

On February 26, 2014, the DOE announced 13 WIPP above ground workers had tested positive for exposure to radioactive material. Other employees were in the process of being tested.

Alvarez ponders the notion of "contract handling" of radioactive waste because it deploys conventional processing practices that do not take into consideration the tens of thousands of containers buried before 1970 at several Department of Energy sites. Alvarez states that the quantity of this pre-1970 plutonium waste is 1,300 times more than the amount permitted to "leak" into the environment at WIPP; however, much of this waste is simply buried a few feet underground at DOE sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S&gt; Environmental Protection Agency|title=The Waste Isolation Plant (40 CFR Parts 191 and 194)|url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/radinfo/cfr_191_194.html|publisher=EPA|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future ==
Following the interment of waste in the facility, estimated to be sometime between 2025 and 2035,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} the storage caverns will be collapsed and sealed with 13 layers of concrete and soil. Salt will then seep into and fill the various fissures and cracks surrounding the casks of waste. After approximately 75 years, the waste will be completely isolated from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, Chris. "Cool Wipp". ''Environment'' 41.1 (1999): 22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository is an unfinished, currently defunct deep geological repository in Nye County, Nevada. In 1987, Congress selected Yucca Mountain to be researched as the potential first permanent repository of nuclear waste, and directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to disregard other proposed sites and study the Yucca Mountain exclusively. Though under the Trump Administration, all long term storage researched has ceased, leading to the responsibility of nuclear waste management to the energy provider.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} These High-Level radioactive Waste (HLW) materials are now kept on-site within cemented dry casks, leaving the U.S. with no designated long-term storage site for HLW.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Criteria==
Waste that is to be disposed of at WIPP must meet certain "waste acceptance criteria".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipp.energy.gov/library/wac/WAC.pdf TRANSURANIC WASTE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
FOR THE WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT Revision 8.0&lt;/ref&gt; It accepts [[transuranic]] waste generated from DOE activities. The waste must have radioactivity exceeding {{convert|100|nCi|kBq|lk=on}} per gram from TRUs that produce [[alpha radiation]] with a [[half life]] greater than 20 years. This criterion includes [[plutonium]], [[uranium]], [[americium]], and [[neptunium]] among others. Mixed waste contains both radioactive and hazardous constituents, and WIPP first received mixed waste on September 9, 2000. Mixed waste is joint-regulated by the EPA and the [[New Mexico Environment Department]].

The containers may also contain a limited amount of liquids. The energy released from radioactive materials will dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen ([[radiolysis]]). This could then create a potentially explosive environment inside the container. The containers must be vented, as well, to prevent this from happening.

==Principle==
Waste is placed in rooms {{convert|2150|ft|m}} underground that have been excavated within a {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} thick salt formation ([[Delaware Basin|Salado and Castile Formations]]) where [[salt tectonics]] have been stable for more than 250 million years{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. Because of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity effects]], salt and water will flow to any cracks that develop, a major reason why the area was chosen as a host medium for the WIPP project. Because drilling or excavation in the area will be hazardous long after the area is actively used, there are plans to construct markers to deter inadvertent human intrusion for the next ten thousand years.&lt;ref name="wipp.energy.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoserve.sandia.gov/sand_doc/1992/921382.pdf Expert Judgment on Markers to Deter Inadvertent Human Intrusion into the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] report SAND92-1382 / UC-721 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wayback.archive-it.org"/&gt;

The Salado Formation is a massive bedded salt deposit (&gt;99% NaCl) that has a simple [[hydrogeology]]. Because massive NaCl is somewhat plastic and holes close under pressure, the rock becomes non-porous by effectively closing pores and fractures. This has a significant effect on the overall hydraulic conductivities (water permeabilities) and molecular diffusion coefficients. These are on the order of ≤10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; m/s and ≤10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1= Richard L.|last1= Beauheim|first2= Randall M. |last2= Roberts |title= Hydrology and hydraulic properties of a bedded evaporite formation |journal= Journal of Hydrology |volume=259 |issue=1–4 |year=2002 |pages=66–88 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(01)00586-8|postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;|bibcode = 2002JHyd..259...66B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

These pillars will surround an earthen wall, {{convert|33|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide. Enclosed within this wall will be another 16 granite pillars. At the center, directly above the waste site, will sit a roofless, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} granite room providing more information. The team intends to etch warnings and informational messages into the granite slabs and pillars.

This information will be recorded in the six [[official languages of the United Nations]] (English, Spanish, Russian, French, [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) as well as the Native American [[Navajo language]] native to the region, with additional space for translation into future languages. [[Pictogram]]s are also being considered, such as [[stick figure]] images and the iconic "[[The Scream]]" from [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting. Complete details about the plant will not be stored on site; instead, they would be distributed to archives and libraries around the world. The team plans to submit their final plan to the U.S. Government by around 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''waste water treatment''' is a process used to convert [[wastewater]] into an [[effluent]] that can be returned to the [[water cycle]] with minimum impact on the environment, or directly reused. The latter is called [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]] because treated wastewater can then be used for other purposes. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), often referred to as a Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) or a [[sewage treatment plant]].  Pollutants in municipal wastewater (households and small industries) are removed or broken down.

The treatment of wastewater is part of the overarching field of [[sanitation]]. Sanitation also includes the management of [[human waste]] and [[solid waste]] as well as [[stormwater]] (drainage) management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/sanitation/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Health topics |title=Sanitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; By-products from wastewater treatment plants, such as screenings, grit and [[sewage sludge]] may also be treated in a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |title = Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition = 4th |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.14}}

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Disposal or reuse==
Although disposal or [[reuse]] occurs after treatment, it must be considered first. Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment, disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary with the type of use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal, but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. Ocean disposal is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders. Water bodies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation may be subject to regulations of multiple local governments. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary widely among different jurisdictions for disposal of wastewater to [[evaporation pond]]s, [[infiltration basin]]s, or [[injection well]]s.

== Processes used ==



===Phase separation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1002-002, Güstrow, Zuckerwerk, Klärwerk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Clarifier]]s are widely used for wastewater treatment.]]
Phase separation transfers impurities into a [[non-aqueous phase liquid|non-aqueous phase]]. Phase separation may occur at intermediate points in a treatment sequence to remove solids generated during [[oxidation]] or polishing. Grease and oil may be recovered for fuel or [[saponification]]. Solids often require [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]] in a [[wastewater treatment plant]]. Disposal options for dried solids vary with the type and concentration of impurities removed from water.

Production of [[brine|waste brine]], however, may discourage wastewater treatment removing dissolved inorganic solids from water by methods like [[ion exchange]], [[reverse osmosis]], and [[distillation]]. 
[[File:Vorklärung - primary settling tank (12359073495).jpg|thumb|Primary settling tank of wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Sedimentation====
{{further|Sedimentation (water treatment)}}
[[Solid]]s and [[non-polar]] [[liquid]]s may be removed from wastewater by [[gravity]] when [[density]] differences are sufficient to overcome dispersion by [[turbulence]]. [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|Gravity separation]] of solids is the primary treatment of [[sewage]], where the unit process is called "primary settling tanks" or "primary sedimentation tanks". It is also widely used for the treatment of other wastewaters. Solids that are heavier than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent [[settling basin]]s. More complex [[clarifier]]s also have skimmers to simultaneously remove floating grease like soap scum and solids like feathers or wood chips. Containers like the [[API oil-water separator]] are specifically designed to separate non-polar liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.111-138&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filtration====

[[Colloid]]al suspensions of fine solids may be removed by [[filtration]] through fine physical barriers distinguished from coarser screens or [[sieve]]s by the ability to remove particles smaller than the openings through which the water passes. Other types of [[water filter]]s remove impurities by chemical or biological processes described below.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.139-196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation===
Oxidation reduces the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater, and may reduce the toxicity of some impurities. [[Secondary treatment]] converts organic compounds into [[carbon dioxide]], water, and [[biosolids]]. Chemical oxidation is widely used for disinfection.
[[File:Belebungsbecken - aeration tank (12359229313).jpg|thumb|Aeration tank of an [[activated sludge]] process at the wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Biochemical oxidation====
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
Secondary treatment by [[biochemical]] oxidation of dissolved and colloidal [[organic compound]]s is widely used in [[sewage treatment]] and is applicable to some agricultural and industrial wastewaters. Biological oxidation will preferentially remove organic compounds useful as a food supply for the treatment [[ecosystem]].  Concentration of some less digestible compounds may be reduced by [[co-metabolism]]. Removal efficiency is limited by the minimum food concentration required to sustain the treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp. 477–521&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical oxidation====
{{main|Redox}}
Chemical oxidation may remove some [[persistent organic pollutant]]s and concentrations remaining after biochemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.363-408&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection by chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial [[pathogen]]s by adding [[ozone]], [[Water chlorination|chlorine or hypochlorite]] to wastewater.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1220}}

===Polishing===
Polishing refers to treatments made following the above methods. These treatments may also be used independently for some industrial wastewater. [[Chemical reduction]] or [[pH]] adjustment minimizes chemical reactivity of wastewater following chemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon filtering]] removes remaining contaminants and impurities by chemical absorption onto activated carbon.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1138}} Filtration through sand (calcium carbonate) or fabric filters is the most common method used in municipal wastewater treatment.

== Wastewater treatment plants ==
&lt;!--[[Wastewater treatment plant]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
{{For|[[plant]] species utilized in water treatment|Organisms involved in water purification}}
Wastewater treatment plants may be distinguished by the type of wastewater to be treated, i.e. whether it is sewage, industrial wastewater, agricultural wastewater or leachate.
[[File:WWTP Antwerpen-Zuid.jpg|thumb|Overview of the wastewater treatment plant of Antwerpen-Zuid, located in the south of the agglomeration of Antwerp (Belgium)]]

===Sewage treatment plants===
{{main|Sewage treatment plant}}
A typical municipal sewage treatment plant in an industrialized country may include primary treatment to remove solid material, [[secondary treatment]] to digest dissolved and suspended organic material as well as the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and – sometimes but not always – disinfection to kill [[pathogenic bacteria]]. The [[sewage sludge]] that is produced in sewage treatment plants undergoes [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]]. Larger municipalities often include factories discharging industrial wastewater into the municipal sewer system. The term "sewage treatment plant" is now often replaced with the term "wastewater treatment plant".&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt; Sewage can also be treated by processes using "[[Nature-based solutions]]". 

==== Tertiary treatment ====
{{Main|Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment}}
Tertiary treatment is a term applied to polishing methods used following a traditional sewage treatment sequence. Tertiary treatment is being increasingly applied in industrialized countries and most common technologies are [[micro filtration]] or [[synthetic membranes]]. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is nearly indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its minerals). [[Nitrate]]s can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but also via microbial [[denitrification]]. Ozone wastewater treatment is also growing in popularity, and requires the use of an [[ozone generator]], which decontaminates the water as [[ozone]] bubbles percolate through the tank, but this treatment is energy intensive. The latest, and very promising treatment technology is the use [[aerobic granulation]].

===Industrial wastewater treatment plants===

{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
Disposal of wastewaters from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly problem. Most [[petroleum refineries]], chemical and [[petrochemical]] plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=1st |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1967 |id=[[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1412}} have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the local and/or national regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into community treatment plants or into rivers, lakes or oceans. [[Constructed wetland]]s are being used in an increasing number of cases as they provided high quality and productive on-site treatment. Other industrial processes that produce a lot of waste-waters such as [[paper and pulp production]] has created environmental concern, leading to development of processes to recycle water use within plants before they have to be cleaned and disposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byrd |first1=J.F. |last2=Ehrke |first2=M.D. |last3=Whitfield |first3=J.I. |date=April 1984 |title=New Bleached Kraft Pulp Plant in Georgia: State of the Art Environmental Control |url= |journal=Journal ''(Water Pollution Control Federation)'' |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=378–385 |doi= |jstor=25042250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial wastewater treatment plants are required where municipal sewage treatment plants are unavailable or cannot adequately treat specific industrial wastewaters. Industrial wastewater plants may reduce raw water costs by converting selected wastewaters to reclaimed water used for different purposes. Industrial wastewater treatment plants may reduce wastewater treatment charges collected by municipal sewage treatment plants by pre-treating wastewaters to reduce concentrations of pollutants measured to determine user fees.&lt;ref name="mjh"&gt;Hammer, pp.300-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[economies of scale]] may favor use of a large municipal sewage treatment plant for disposal of small volumes of industrial wastewater, industrial wastewater treatment and disposal may be less expensive than correctly apportioned costs for larger volumes of industrial wastewater not requiring the conventional sewage treatment sequence of a small municipal sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, pp.40-4-40-11&lt;/ref&gt;

An industrial wastewater treatment plant may include one or more of the following rather than the conventional primary, secondary, and disinfection sequence of sewage treatment:
* An [[API oil-water separator]], for removing separate phase oil from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[clarifier]], for removing solids from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.41-15&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[trickling filter|roughing filter]], to reduce the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.23-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[carbon filtration]] plant, to remove toxic dissolved organic compounds from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advanced [[electrodialysis reversal |electrodialysis reversal (EDR)]] system with [[ion exchange membranes]].

===Agricultural wastewater treatment plants===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
[[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for continuous confined animal operations like milk and egg production may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units similar to those described under industrial wastewater; but where land is available for ponds, [[settling basin]]s and [[facultative lagoon]]s may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding or harvest cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leachate treatment plants ===
[[Leachate]] treatment plants are used to treat leachate from [[landfill]]s. Treatment options include: biological treatment, mechanical treatment by [[ultrafiltration]], treatment with [[Active Carbon|active carbon]] filters and reverse osmosis using disc tube module technology.

A '''wearable generator''' is an article of clothing that contains some form of electrical generation system built in. The concept encompasses a variety of generation systems intended to supply small amounts of power to keep portable electronics in a good state of charge through natural motions of the body.

==Summary==
There are many great projects related to wearable technology or wearable power generation. One concept, for example, is an article of clothing that has the ability to convert the movements of the wearer into [[electricity]] using [[nanotechnology|nano]]-[[ion]] pumps.&lt;ref name="sparksuit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-Nike-ONE-Gran-Turismo.htm| title = Spark Suit information | publisher = Serious Wheels | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[nanotechnology]] and has the ability to [[electrical generator|generate electricity]] for the purposes of building [[Muscle|muscle mass]] and improving [[motor coordination|coordination]].&lt;ref name="disenoart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.diseno-art.com/encyclopedia/archive/nike_one.html| title = Spark Suit information (second reference) | publisher = Diseno-Art | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency workers like firemen and paramedics could use chest-implanted sensors to create a floor plan of unfamiliar buildings; making a rookie perform his job as efficiently as a veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/mit-hacks-kinect-laser-for-a-wearable-map-generator-for-firefighters/| title = ''MIT Hacks Kinect Laser For A Wearable Map Generator For Firefighters'' | publisher = Tech Crunch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cameras becoming cheaper and smaller, wearable generators may also serve as a quick method to recharge the batteries on those devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smart-actuation-and-sensing-systems-recent-advances-and-future-challenges/a-technology-for-soft-and-wearable-generators| title = ''A Technology for Soft and Wearable Generators'' | publisher = Intech | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental burden of disposing used batteries has contributed to [[Electronic waste|e-waste]]; something that wearable generators may drastically reduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/wearable-generators-to-power-battery-life-in-your-equipment/| title = ''Wearable generators to power battery life in your equipment'' | publisher = Gizmo Watch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough energy can theoretically be harnessed from a person's body heat to power a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=239901 | title = ''Wearable Fabric Could Power Your iPhone'' | publisher = Design News | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
