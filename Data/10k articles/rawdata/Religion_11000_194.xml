'''''40 Days and 40 Nights: Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities on Trial in Pennsylvania''''' is a 2007 non fiction book about the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial of 2005.  Author [[Matthew Chapman (author)|Matthew Chapman]], a journalist, screenwriter and director (and the great-great-grandson of [[Charles Darwin]]) reported on the trial for Harper's magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpers.org/archive/2006/02/0080934 "l God or Gorilla: a Darwin descendant at the Dover monkey trial"]. ''Harpers.org''. Retrieved July 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Austin Cline of ''[[About.com]]'' gave the book four-and-a-half-stars-out-of-five rating, stating: "There are bound to be many books written about this trial and I don't know if Chapman's will be the best source of information — either about the trial itself or the larger issues involved. It will, however, almost certainly stand out as one of the most enjoyable and entertaining to read."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Austin. [http://atheism.about.com/od/bookreviews/fr/40DaysNights.htm "Book Review: 40 Days and 40 Nights: Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, on Trial in Pennsylvania"]. ''[[About.com]]''. [[The New York Times Company]]. Retrieved July 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dupuis of ''[[ScienceBlogs]]'' gave the book a positive review, saying that "Chapman uses some of the same strategies in the Dover as he did in the first book on the [[Scopes Trial]]. He tells the story of the trial as a story about people: the lawyers, the defendants, the townspeople, the media. And a colourful lot they were, making those aspects of the book very entertaining and compelling. The weakness of the book is related to those colourful characters — the chronicle of the trial itself never really seemed to come alive for me in the same way that his telling of the Scopes trial did."&lt;ref&gt;Dupuis, John (November 14, 2010).

It was formerly known as Tjikini Mosque (Indonesian: 'Masjid Tjikini').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heuken, S.J.|first1=Adolf|title=Mesjid-mesjid tua di Jakarta|date=2003|publisher=Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka|location=Jakarta|isbn=9799722926|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan Republik Indonesia|title=Masjil Al-Makmur (Masjid Cikini) – Jakarta Pusat|url=http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/kebudayaan/1390/masjil-al-makmur-masjid-cikini-jakarta-pusat|website=Kebudayaan Indonesia|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dinas Komunikasi, Informatika dan Kehumasan Pemprov DKI Jakarta|title=Al Makmur Raden Saleh, Masjid|url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/767/Al-Makmur-Raden-Saleh-Masjid|website=Portal Resmi Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta|publisher=Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The mosque stands on what was the estate of [[Raden Saleh]], the famous late nineteenth-century [[Romantic movement|Romantic]] painter. Oral tradition has it that Raden Saleh himself allowed local Muslims to build a prayer house on his estate, sometime in 1850. In 1897, the late artist's wife sold the estate to the Alatas family, a prominent [[Arab Indonesians|Peranakan Arab]] clan of colonial landlords and [[Captain of The Arabs|officials]].

==Legal Limbo==
Some thirty years later, [[Sayyid]] Ismail bin Sayyid Abdoellah bin Alwi Alatas sold part of the estate to [[Queen Emma of the Netherlands|Koningin Emma Stichting]], a foundation that would later build and manage Cikini Hospital (Indonesian: 'Rumah Sakit Cikini'). The old mosque was excluded from the transaction due to an ongoing ownership dispute between the Sayyid and the mosque. Around this time, the simple old structure was moved to the banks of the [[Ciliwung]] to enable worshippers to undertake [[wudu]] in the river.

After Sayyid Ismail's victory in the courts, the land on which the mosque stood was sold to Koningin Emma Stichting in 1923. A year later, the hospital board officially requested the mosque board to move the house of worship further away from its present site.

==Staying power==
The mosque authorities, however, refused since they consider the land a legacy, or [[waqf]], left to the community by Raden Saleh.

To ensure the mosque's survival ''in situ'', a committee was formed to transform the old simple prayer house into a permanent, concrete structure. Among the committee members were [[Agus Salim]], [[Mas Mansur]] and [[Cokroaminoto]]. Between 1932 and 1934, the mosque underwent further renovation and expansion work, financed by [[Sarekat Islam]]. These efforts helped stave off efforts to have the mosque moved away, though the building remained in a legal limbo for many decades to come. It was only in 1991 that Cikini Hospital bequeathed - for good - to the mosque the land which it has occupied since 1850.

Although ‘Abdu'l-Bahá had instructed the Bahá'ís in Iran not to take part in open defiance of the government (and they did not participate in the street demonstrations and the taking of sanctuary in the British Legation in Tehran in the summer of 1906) during the period of the Persian Constitutional Revolution they did broadly support the Constitutionalist cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Momen | first = Moojan|authorlink= Moojan Momen| title =The Baha'is and the Constitutional Revolution: The Case of Sari, Mazandaran, 1906–1913 | journal =Iranian Studies | volume =41 |issue =3 | pages =343–363 | publisher =Taylor &amp; Francis group | date = 20 May 2008 | url =http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00210860801981310 | doi =10.1080/00210860801981310 | accessdate = 2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarbiyat-i Banat (Girls’ Education), established in 1911 in Tehran, was the most respected Baha’i girls’ school. Founded on the efforts of private school for girls by Bahá'ís,&lt;ref name="RK"/&gt; it was re-opened under the direction of an Iranian Bahá'í boys’ school committee and several American Bahá'í women [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] who moved in order to support the goals of the religion. Even though it catered to the Iranian Bahá'í community, Tarbiyat attracted children from non-Bahá'í families, as the curriculum was largely secular.

The situation of the Bahá'ís improved under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] when the government actively sought to secularize public life however there were still organizations actively persecuting the Bahá'ís in addition to there being curses children would learn decrying the Báb, a central figure of the religion, and Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fischer | first = Michael|authorlink = Michael M.

World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However the modern history of [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran is extensive and prevented these kinds of developments in Iran:

===Early reports===
The first known survey of the religion comes from an unpublished work in 1919–1920 gathered by [[John Esslemont]] and had been intended to be part of his well-known [[Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]].{{sfn|Momen|2004|pp=63-106}} In it, consulting various individuals, he summarizes the religion's presence in Egypt, Germany, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkestan, and the United States. It did not arrive at a total but did have some regional statistics based on some individual reports. In Iran "The Cause has not only spread in important centres, but even in remote villages and corners…. In Teheran alone there are probably 10,000 Bahais.… [The] population of Teheran [is] 750,000.… Khorassan: villages where the whole population is Bahai. Esphahan, places where 2/3 of the people are Bahais. In Azerbayjan, villages where 1/2 are Bahais."

'''Criticism of Conservative Judaism''' is widespread in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish community]], although the movement also has its critics in [[Reform Judaism]] and in other streams of Judaism.  While the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]] professes fidelity to Jewish tradition, it considers ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish [[religious law]]) to be a dynamic process that needs reinterpreting in modern times. The criticism by Orthodox Jews and traditionalists within the movement itself revolves around the following: 

* Conservative Judaism, or some of its [[Conservative responsa|decisions]] and [[Conservative Halakha|positions]] does not follow halakha, according to many Orthodox Jews, because:
** The legal analyses of its [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|rabbinate]] [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] or manipulate [[Mitzvah|religious obligations]], rather than being faithful to and fostering respect for them;
** It hoists certain historical or cultural assumptions onto a law, then disavows the assumption, granting itself license to disavow the law itself; {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
** It issues "emergency decrees" in the absence of legitimate emergencies, rather than following a legitimate, faithful, or reverential approach to halakha; 
** Its decisions consistently lead to more lax, rather than stringent or balanced observance; 
** It generally makes communal decrees through a council of (often lay) leaders, rather than relying exclusively on Talmudic scholars, resulting in decisions reflecting popular opinion rather than scholarship; and
** Accommodating the values and likeness of the broader society has taken precedence over a dedication to the internal integrity of halakhic sources. 

Critics also claim that the legal analysis of the Conservative movement tends to be ideologically-driven, resulting in intended outcomes to such an extent that it is outside the bounds of traditional halakhic analysis.

==Criticism from Orthodoxy==
From [[Haredi Judaism]] perspective, criticism is exemplified by Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]] of [[Agudath Israel of America]]. Shafran wrote in 2001 that the Conservative movement's leaders "trample" halakha while proclaiming fealty to it. He argued that the movement was a failure because nearly three-quarters of Conservative Jews said that they [[Who is a Jew?|consider a Jew]] to be anyone raised Jewish, even if his or her mother was a gentile—the official Reform position, rejected by Conservative leaders as nonhalachic.&lt;ref&gt;Safran cited a study of Conservative congregants conducted by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary’s]] Jack Wertheimer in 1996. Shafran also noted that only about half of Conservative [[B'nai Mitzvah|bar and bat mitzvah]] receptions were [[kosher]], by any standard.&lt;/ref&gt; Shafran further argued that Conservative Judaism "movement is not honest" because, though stating its commitment to halakhah (Jewish law), it approved the [[Ordination of women#Judaism|ordination of women]] based on a commission containing mostly laypeople and only one Talmud scholar. Shafran stated that the movement should have relied on the [[Talmud]] faculty of JTS.&lt;ref&gt;Shafran also stated that the decision was made against faculty wishes. He cited Rabbi [[Daniel Gordis]], former dean of the [[University of Judaism|University of Judaism’s]] [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] for stating that “the Conservative Movement allows its laity to set its religious agenda.”{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishamerica.com/ja/features/ConLie.cfm |title=The Conservative Lie |accessdate=13 January 2009 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Moment Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129182155/http://jewishamerica.com/ja/features/ConLie.cfm |archivedate=29 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shafran]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106063953/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/feb01/feat2.html "The Conservative Lie"], ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2006, Rabbi Shafran criticized the decision by the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] to adopt a [[responsum]] liberalizing its position on homosexual conduct. Shafran repeated his assertion that the Conservative movement, despite its "claim of halachic integrity", did not follow the "true halachic process".&lt;ref&gt;Avi Shafran, [http://jta-vip.mediapolis.com/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070101Conservativedecisio.html "Conservative vote chance for halachic Jews to go Orthodox"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321131742/http://jta-vip.mediapolis.com/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070101Conservativedecisio.html |date=2007-03-21 }}, [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Rabbi [[Avi Weiss]], an [[Open Orthodoxy|Open Orthodox]] rabbi on the left wing of Orthodox Judaism, also characterized the differences between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in a manner critical of the Conservative approach:

:Despite variations in style and approach, the system that we hold as holy sets us fundamentally apart from our Conservative co-religionists whose vision of the Jewish legal process is so very different in each of these three fundamental areas of Halakha: ''[[Torah|Torah mi-Sinai]]'' ["Torah from Sinai", the belief that the Torah was given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai], rabbinic interpretation, and rabbinic legislation.

:The belief in ''Torah mi-Sinai'' is, for all Orthodox Jews, the foundation of faith and at the core of the halakhic process. Conservative Judaism does not subscribe to this teaching. Moreover, in the area of rabbinic law, we Orthodox—Modern and Right alike—contend that legal authority is cumulative, and that a contemporary ''[[posek]]'' (legal decisor) can only issue judgments based on a full history of Jewish [[legal precedent]]. In contrast, the implicit argument of the Conservative movement is that precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior legal history appeals to it. Likewise, we adhere and turn to the wisdom of the most distinguished religio-legal authorities in making Halakhic determinations. Not so the Conservatives. Truth be told, when the Conservative movement faced some of its most controversial "new ''halakhot''", such as the ordination of women, it turned away from its own Talmudic scholars and experts in Halakha, who had almost universally rejected the reasoning on which this new practice was to be based, and who have since virtually all left the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary.

:Finally, in understanding the value of rabbinic law legislated by today's rabbis, it must be appreciated that at this juncture in our people's history in [[United States|America]], the Orthodox community is blessed with large numbers of ritually observant Jews. Across the spectrum of Orthodoxy, myriads of people meticulously keep [[Shabbat]] (the Sabbath), [[Kashrut]] (the Dietary Laws), ''[[Niddah|Taharat ha-mishapahah]]'' (the Laws of Family Purity) and pray three times a day. Thus, if a "permissive custom" is accepted, it can become binding. This is not true of Conservatism's constituency, which is generally not composed of ritually-observant Jews. Thus, only in our community if a "permissive custom" is accepted, can it be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Weiss]], {{cite web |url= http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,143 |title= "Open Orthodoxy!

==Criticism from Conservative traditionalists==
At the 2006 convention of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the Conservative movement's official rabbinical organization, Rabbi [[Ismar Schorsch]] said that the Conservative movement had "lost faith in itself" and "become Reform."&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Jennifer Siegel, [http://www.forward.com/articles/6796/ "Conservative Rabbi, in Swan Song, Warns Against Liberal Shift"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Rabbi Schorsch, who was about to retire as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the Jewish Theological Seminary, criticized rabbis and activists who were lobbying to change the Conservative movement's opposition to [[same-sex union]]s and the [[Semicha|ordination]] of gay clergy. He described their methods as using scholarship to overturn halakha rather than to foster appreciation of it.

:If the Conservative movement chooses to do something at the expense of the halachic system, then it's going to pay the price down the road... The erosion of our fidelity to Halacha is what brings us close to Reform Judaism.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;

Rabbi Schorsch made similar criticism two months later in his final [[commencement address]] at Jewish Theological Seminary, in which he spoke of the "malaise of Conservative Judaism", its "impoverishment", and its "grievous failure of nerve". He also criticized the Seminary, one of the chief academic and intellectual institutions of Conservative Judaism:

:In the wake of [[Mordecai Kaplan]]'s wholesale reduction of halakhah to [[Folkways (sociology)|folkways]], the function of history shifted to vindicating change. Ever more identified by the inane mantra of "tradition and change," Conservative Judaism lost access to critical scholarship as a source for religious meaning, with nothing substantially spiritual to replace it. ...

:Our impoverishment is sadly exemplified by the ambivalence toward critical scholarship in ''Etz Hayim'', the movement's new ''[[humash]]''. As commentary, the abridgement of the [[Jewish Publication Society]] Torah Commentary is so eviscerated as to betray not the slightest trace of the plenitude of the original to generate spiritual meaning through empathetic scholarship. As exposition, the end notes, with a few striking exceptions, are spiritually inert. Their rabbinic authors go through the paces without passion, making no effort to extract religious significance from the scholarship being mediated. While Conservative rabbis often chide the research oriented faculty of JTS for allegedly doing just that in their classes, as transmitters of scholarship, the rabbis replicated what they condemn. Ironically, the rare spiritual voice to be heard in the end notes usually emanates from one or another of the academics in the roster. ...

:With history no more than an argument for supersession, the halakhic yoke has lost its lightness. Great scholarship has ceased to energize it as it had in the past. Once, the polarity of truth and faith at the Seminary had made it home for the acme of twentieth-century Jewish scholarship, a venue of ferment and fertility. Faith once moved us to study our heritage deeply, while truth asked of us that we do it critically, in light of all that we know. Willful ignorance was never an acceptable recourse. The interaction set us apart as the vital center of modern Judaism.

:With frequency, fundamental changes come more easily. Our forebearers embraced history to enlarge and enrich Jewish observance; we wield it, if at all, to shrink it. How quickly have we forgotten the bracing spiritual power of [[Gershom Scholem|Gershon Scholem's]] ''Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism'', [[Yehezkel Kaufmann|Yehezkel Kaufmann's]] ''Religion of Israel'', [[Saul Lieberman|Saul Lieberman's]] ''Hellenism in Jewish Palestine'', [[Nahum M. Sarna|Nahum Sarna's]] ''Understanding Genesis'', or [[Jacob Milgrom|Jacob Milgrom's]] commentaries to [[Leviticus]] and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]. Our addiction to instant gratification has stripped us of the patience to appreciate any discourse whose rhetoric is dense and demanding. Mindlessly, we grasp for the quick spiritual fix.

:A grievous failure of nerve affects Conservative Judaism. We have lost confidence in the viability of the distinctive polarity that once resonated within. It is not a slick new motto that we need, but a vigorous reaffirmation of the old which gloriously captures our essence. When [[Solomon Schechter|Schechter]] left England in 1902 to head the Seminary, he inveighed against [[History of the Jews in England|Anglo–Jewry]] for its shallow quest for a decorous spiritual Judaism. What the confounding epoch of [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation]] actually called for, he claimed, was more spiritual Jews. To educate and inspire Jews of such sturdy timbre remains the unaltered mission of a vastly expanded Seminary in an age of pampered and promiscuous individualists contemptuous of all norms. A Seminary true to itself still holds out the brightest beacon for the future of Conservative Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Schorsch, [http://www.jtsa.edu/about/communications/speeches/sca.shtml Commencement Address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419092452/http://www.jtsa.edu/about/communications/speeches/sca.shtml |date=2007-04-19 }}, 112th Commencement Exercises of The Jewish Theological Seminary, May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[David Golinkin]], the chair of the Masorti movement's ''[[Va'ad Halakha]]'' (Israel's counterpart to the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards), criticized the Conservative movement's proposal to liberalize its position on homosexual conduct. He wrote that such a change would "split the Conservative movement in two ... drive away the most halakhically observant laypeople in our synagogues, and ... have a devastating effect on the Conservative movement throughout the world.” According to Rabbi Golinkin, if the Conservative movement adopted such a change, most Israelis would see little difference between the Masorti movement (Israeli Conservative Judaism in Israel) and Reform Judaism.&lt;ref name="Prouser"&gt;[[Joseph Prouser|Joseph H. Prouser]], [http://www.uscj.org/The_Conservative_Mov7074.html "The Conservative Movement and Homosexuality: Settled Law in Unsettling Times"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429173219/http://www.uscj.org/The_Conservative_Mov7074.html |date=2007-04-29 }}, ''United Synagogue Review'', Fall 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Joseph Prousser]], a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, also lobbied against the proposal, arguing that its adoption would result in "a fractured Conservative movement" that is "rendered less viable". He wrote that adopting such a change would represent a "failure of moral and religious leadership" and that such a significant change would diminish the Conservative rabbinate's ability to provide meaningful religious guidance to its congregants:

:Such sweeping change in Jewish law will make the Law Committee and the Conservative rabbinate poor role models for our religious charges. If we essentially declare so fundamental a halachic obligation inoperative, based on a minority’s subjective reading of contemporary reality, how can we deny individual Jews unbridled autonomy in determining which demands of Jewish law remain binding and personally meaningful? Jewish law would be rendered unrecognizable—as law—to our laity, and to all but the most erudite and progressive legal theorists. ...

:Lending credence to the notion that a person’s core identity is defined by physical drives and sexual desire represents a failure of moral and religious leadership. Rabbinic discourse that even unintentionally vests [[moral authority]] in the inclination of the individual, rather than in the will of a commanding God, seems a far graver transgression than prohibited, albeit loving, expressions of intimacy between homosexuals.&lt;ref name="Prouser"/&gt;

After the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted the responsum liberalizing its position on homosexual conduct, Rabbi Prouser and three other members of the Committee—Rabbis [[Joel Roth]], [[Mayer Rabinowitz]], and [[Leonard Levy (rabbi)|Leonard Levy]]—resigned in protest.

==Criticism from Reform Jews==
Rabbi Paul Menitoff, Executive Vice President of the Reform movement’s [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], wrote in a 2004 essay that Conservative Judaism would either merge with Reform Judaism or "disappear".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Debra Nussbaum Cohen, [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9154 "Reform Leader Predicts Demise Of Conservatives"], ''[[The Jewish Week]]'', March 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said that the Conservative movement's policies were at odds with the principles of its young adult members on issues such as [[Interreligious marriage#Judaism|intermarriage]], [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]], and the ordination of lesbians and gay men—all issues that Conservative Judaism then-opposed yet Reform Judaism supported.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"&gt;Joe Berkofsky, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21714/edition_id/441/format/html/displaystory.html "Death of Conservative Judaism? Reform leader’s swipe sparks angry rebuttals"], ''[[j.]]'', March 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Conservative movement has since liberalized its policy concerning the ordination of gay clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurie Goodstein]], 
[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/us/07jews.html?ex=1323147600&amp;en=d9af0c2c2de39221&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner ''Conservative Jews Allow Gay Rabbis and Unions''], [[The New York Times]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) To support his prediction, Rabbi Menitoff described Conservative Judaism's dilemma:

:If the Conservative movement capitulates regarding these core differences between Reform and Conservative Judaism, it will be essentially obliterating the need for its existence. If, alternatively, it stands firm, its congregants will vote with their feet.&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"/&gt;

Rabbi Menitoff's essay drew criticism from Conservative rabbis, two of whom described his prediction as "off base"&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and "wishful thinking."&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"/&gt; Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, then Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, pointed out that “at the beginning of the 20th century, all the Jewish pundits predicted the demise of Orthodoxy, and they all proved dead wrong. So Rabbi Menitoff has good company in bad predictions.”&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

==Criticism from third-wave feminists==
Some [[third-wave feminist]]s have criticized Conservative Judaism's [[Role of women in Judaism#Conservative Judaism|efforts at integrating women]] as half-hearted attempts at [[egalitarianism]]. Instead of maintaining a traditional approach to worship and treating women as if they were men, what Dr. [[Rachel Adler]] calls "honorary men", some have suggested that the Conservative movement cannot become truly egalitarian until it reinterprets Judaism to reflect the perspectives and experiences of women.

In her 1998 book ''Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics'', Dr. Adler wrote:

:For many Conservative congregations, counting women in the [[minyan]] and [[Torah reading|calling them up to the Torah]] are recent innovations. But ... egalitarian Judaisms may tolerate women as participants by ignoring their distinctive experiences and concerns as women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rachel Adler]], 
''Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics'', [[Jewish Publication Society]], 1998. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dianazene''' was the name given by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] to a vitamin supplement containing [[iron]], [[vitamin C]], and various [[B vitamins]], including especially large doses of [[niacin]]. Hubbard promoted it as a form of protection against radiation poisoning during the 1950s, saying that "Dianazene runs out radiation — or what appears to be radiation. It also proofs a person against radiation in some degree. It also turns on and runs out incipient cancer." &lt;ref name="all-about-radiation"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hubbard | first = L. Ron | isbn = 978-0-88404-062-0 | title = [[All About Radiation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] seized and destroyed 21,000 Dianazene tablets from the Distribution Center Inc, a company with ties to the Church of Scientology, because they were falsely labeled as a preventative and treatment for radiation sickness.&lt;ref name="Blue Sky"&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy.

Ron Hubbard|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co|location=New York|edition=First American|year=1987|isbn=0-8050-0654-0|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamins continue to play a large role in the Scientology [[Purification Rundown]] and the secular version in the [[Narconon]] program, where it is similarly claimed that large quantities of niacin and other vitamins, combined with the heat in a sauna, can "purify" the body by allowing it to release [[toxin]]s stored in cellular [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and to "run out" or ameliorate prior radiation exposure including [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clear Body, Clear Mind]] L. Ron Hubbard 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
A standard dose of Dianazene, according to Hubbard's 1957 book ''[[All About Radiation]]'', contained the following ingredients:
*[[Vitamin B3|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[Niacin]]): 200&amp;nbsp;mg
*[[Iron]] ([[Ferrous gluconate]]): 10 grains (600&amp;nbsp;mg)
*Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Thiamine]]): 25&amp;nbsp;mg
*Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Riboflavin]]): 50&amp;nbsp;mg
*[[Vitamin C]] (Ascorbic acid): 200–500&amp;nbsp;mg
*[[Calcium]] ([[Dicalcium phosphate]]): 15-20 grains (1000–1300&amp;nbsp;mg)  &lt;ref name="all-about-radiation" /&gt;

He died shortly after being appointed [[Bishop]] of [[Santiago, Chile]]. He was an investigator into survivals of the primitive rites and customs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Peru|Peruvian Indians]] and left valuable notes on the subject, fragments of them being preserved in the work of [[Pablo José Arriaga]]. Of great importance to linguistics are his ''Sermones de los misterios de nuestra santa Fe católica'', published in 1649 by the order of the Archbishop of Lima, Petro Villagomez. These sermons were delivered in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], and are published with their translation into Spanish.

In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]], '''filial piety''' ({{zh|c=孝}}, ''xiào'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors. The Confucian ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book, a purported dialogue between [[Confucius]] and his student [[Zengzi]], is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. The term can also be applied to general [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Filial piety is central to Confucian [[role ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, filial [[piety]] means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'' (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:二十四孝|二十四孝]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Filial piety is illustrated by the [[Chinese character]] ''xiao'' (孝).&lt;ref name=ikels2&gt;{{cite book|last=Ikels|first=Charlotte|title=Filial piety: Practice and discourse in contemporary East Asia|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4791-2|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is a combination of the character ''lao'' (old) above the character ''zi'' (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son.&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; In [[Korean Confucianism]], the character {{linktext|孝}} is pronounced ''hyo'' (효). In Vietnamese, the character {{linktext|孝}} is written in [[Vietnamese alphabet|Quoc Ngu]] as ''hiếu''.  In Japanese, the term is generally used in spoken and written language as 親孝行, "''oyakōkō''," adding characters for ''parent'' and ''conduct'' to make the word more specific.

According to the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', Confucius once said: "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity."&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; For Confucius, filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents. More important than the norms of ''xiào'' were the norms of ''rén'' (仁; [[Ren (Confucianism)|benevolence]]) and ''yì'' (義; [[Yi (Confucianism)|righteousness]]). For Confucius and [[Mencius]], ''xiào'' was a display of ''rén'' which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders, thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations. However, in practice, ''xiào'' was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents, and from time to time, was elevated above the notions of ''rén'' and ''yì''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Filial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Analects 1:2, Xiao Jing chap.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism stressed ''individual'' salvation, and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China, which stressed the good of the ''community'' more than the good of the ''individual''. In India, Buddhism also advocated [[celibacy]] among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view, given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line.&lt;ref&gt;Traylor, Kenneth L. ''Chinese Filial Piety.'' Bloomington: Eastern Press, 1988. pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduction of Buddhism in China====
When Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' (牟子理惑論), a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese, presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents, by closely reading the works of Confucius himself. The ''[[Guiyangtu]]'' (跪羊图)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=跪羊图高清大字版|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xo5KwtW1M|website=Youtube|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vimalakirti]] Nirdesa Sutra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert|first1=Thurman|title=Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Vimalakirti.htm|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation.

=====Mouzi Lihuolun=====
The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's life would have been lost in the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, John P. (1994). ''How master Mou removes our doubts: a reader-response study and translation of the'' Mou-tzu Li-huo lun'', SUNY Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar.  While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation. The ''Mouzi Lihuolun'' also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of [[asceticism|ascetic]] sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius.  The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent’s soul is the most important one. The same essential argument was made later by [[Sun Chuo]], who argued that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, E.  ''The Buddhist Conquest of China.'' Leiden: E. J. Brill., 1959a, pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] continued in this reasoning, arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk, then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives.

=====Adaptation =====
These philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct, and so less subtle methods were employed.  To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. ''The story of Shanzi'' 睒子 ("Syama" in [[Sanskrit]], Sama in [[Pali|Pāli]], from the "[[Jataka tales|Sama Jātaka]]"), is an example of this.

=====''Story of Shanzi''=====
Shanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents, until he was accidentally killed.  But, because of his life of filial devotion, he was miraculously revived.  This story was often mentioned in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese canon]] of Buddhist texts, and was included in a number of different anthologies (such as the ''Liudu Jijing'' and referred to by other [[Chinese Buddhist]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'en, Kenneth. ''The Chinese Transformation of Buddhism.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973. pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; While it is clearly of [[Buddhism in India|Indian]] origin based on the story of [[Shravan]], this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales. While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings, philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=====The story of Moggallāna=====
{{Main|Mulian Rescues His Mother}}
Another story advocating filial piety is that of [[Moggallana|Moggallāna]], a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life. This story appeared in the ''[[Ullambana Sutra|Ullambana Sūtra]]'' and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tzǔ, though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism. In China, however, these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture, but also popular tales which were even told among non-Buddhists. While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berezkin|first1=Rostislav|title=Pictorial Versions of the Mulian Story in East Asia (Tenth–Seventeenth Centuries): On the Connections of Religious Painting and Storytelling|journal=Fudan Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences|date=21 February 2015|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s40647-015-0060-4 |others=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Williams|editor-first1=Paul|editor-last2=Ladwig|editor-first2=Patrice|editorlink1=Paul Williams (philosopher)|author-last1=Ladwig|author-first1=Patrice|encyclopedia=Buddhist funeral cultures of Southeast Asia and China|title=Feeding the dead: ghosts, materiality and merit|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=1-107-00388-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3zdJ1kHIkxEC |p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other texts=====
Another tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the Buddha rising to heaven for three months after his [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy.  This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents, in that he cared for their immortal souls.

A number of [[Apocryphal Buddhist sutra|apocryphal texts]] were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent-child relationship.  The most important of these, the ''[[Sutra of Filial Piety]]'', was written early in the [[Tang dynasty]]. This [[Sutra|text (''sūtra'')]] has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child.  In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect.  Despite being a forgery, the ''sūtra'' was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners, and it played an important role in the development of a [[Chinese Buddhism|fully Chinese variation of Buddhism]]. Other documents discussing the Buddha’s views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries.  The ''[[Sutra on a Filial Son]]'', for instance, also sounds far more Chinese than Indian, and shows Confucian influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Criticism ===
Lu Xun in his collection "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk" (朝花夕拾) criticized the stories "He Buried His Son for His Mother" and "Wang Xiang: He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp". The latter story is about Wang Xiang, a very young boy, who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The '''Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill''' is a bill concerning religious conversions in [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

==Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill 2006==
In order to regulate religious conversions, the Gujarat government is proposing an amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=416861|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502140758/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=416861|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-05-02|title=Wired|publisher=Outlookindia.com|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will group [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] along with [[Hinduism]], and thus the adoption of any faith within the group will not be considered a conversion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianmuslims.in/gujarat-conversion-law-amendment-to-facilitate-jains/ Gujarat Conversion Law Amended To Suit Jains! | Indian Muslims Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921031640/http://indianmuslims.in/gujarat-conversion-law-amendment-to-facilitate-jains/ |date=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed by voice vote in the Gujarat assembly on 29 September 2006.

All India [[Digambar Jain Mahasabha]] led by [[NK Jain]] opposed the move on 20 September 2006. He stated, "Any government, as per their convenience and agenda cannot afford to curb our right of a religious identity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2011955.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Minorities protest against Gujarat's conversion law | date=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhartiya Dharma Rakshak Sena]] (BDRS), a small organisation said to be run by Jains, maintains that all religions in India are a part of Hinduism, "which is not a religion but a culture." In a press release, on 22 September 2006, Jasmin Shah, Piyush Jain and Abhay Shah of BDRS stated that the controversy is being promoted by forces who want to weaken Hinduism by creating minorities. They state that "Jainism is independent of Vedic religion, known as 'Hinduism'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.news.yahoo.com/060922/48/67tny.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BDRS members claimed that there four sub-sects in Jainism, out of which one, the [[Digambara]] sect, is demanding a minority status.

On 3 October 2006 the predominant Jain sect in Gujarat, the [[Shwetambar Murtipujak Jain Sangh]], held a meeting with state’s solicitor-general to assert that Jainism is a distinct religion and not a Hindu denomination. Shrenik Shah, Gujarat’s leading industrialist and president of the All India Shwetambar Murtipujak Jain Sangh, said that they had held a meeting with Gujarat’s solicitor-general and expressed their view to recognise Jainism as distinct religion. "We are not primarily concerned with the conversion aspect of the bill. But we have asserted our view that Jainism is a distinct religion," said Shah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=203711# |title=Religion Bill stirs up an unholy mess&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=3 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502163701/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=203711# |archive-date=2 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court of India's opinion==
In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to issue a [[writ of mandamus]] to grant Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India, and left it to the individual states to decide on the minority status of the Jain religion.&lt;ref&gt;Appeal (civil)  4730 of 1999, Decided on 8 August 2005 Bal Patil &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.[http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=27098 Bal Patil &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. Indian Supreme Court Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Supreme Court had recently observed that "The Jain Religion is indisputably not a part of Hindu Religion".&lt;ref&gt;Judgment, Supreme Court of India, Per Dalveer Bhandari J., Civil Appeal No. 9595 of 2003, para 25, decided On: 21.08.2006

'''Healing a man with dropsy''' is one of the [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels]] (Luke 14:1-6).&lt;ref&gt;''Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke'' by David C. Cook and Craig A. Evans (Feb 27, 2003) {{ISBN|0781438683}} page 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biblegateway Luke 14:1-6, [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2014:1-6&amp;version=TNIV biblegateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the Gospel, one [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent [[Pharisee]], and he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from [[dropsy]], i.e. abnormal swelling of his body. 

Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law:

:"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?" 

But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.

Then he asked them:

:"If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?" 

And they had nothing to say.

'''Jesse Duplantis''' (born July 9, 1949) is a [[prosperity gospel]] preacher from the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] tradition based in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], US, and the founder of Jesse Duplantis Ministries.

==Evangelical career==
Duplantis preached his first [[sermon]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jdm.org/w-AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|work=JDM.org|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was introduced by [[John Hagee]] as "The Apostle of Joy" on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], a phrase that became his professional PR slogan. He has been a full-time evangelistic [[Christian ministry|minister]] since 1978, using his  music and comic talent in his work. In the book "Close Encounters of the God Kind", Duplantis writes about his daily relationship with God, the reality of [[eternity]], perspectives on [[Heaven]] and his belief in the depth of the [[compassion]], [[forgiveness]] and love God has for [[humankind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0243230/bio|title=Jesse Duplantis|last=Tura|first=Joseph|date=|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of Jesse Duplantis Ministries (JDM), which maintains an international headquarters in America and branches in the United Kingdom and Australia. In 1997, he and his wife, Cathy Duplantis, founded Covenant Church, a local [[outreach]] of JDM on the International Headquarters property in [[Destrehan|Destrehan, Louisiana]]. The JDM official website states: "Jesse Duplantis Ministries is an evangelistic ministry dedicated to reaching people and changing lives with the [[Gospel]] of Jesus Christ. Our vision is world evangelism and our desire is to see God bless everyone in every way."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Duplantis' books have been translated into thirteen languages, including [[Braille]], and are distributed worldwide. Duplantis appears on the internet via webcasts, a variety of [[Religious broadcasting|Christian television]] stations such as the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], [[Daystar Television Network|Daystar]], and [[Lester Sumrall|LeSEA]], in addition to secular networks inclusive of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] and [[CBS]].

===Christians United for Israel (CUFI)===
In early 2006,  Duplantis was invited to become the first Louisiana Director of [[Christians United For Israel]]. He states, "CUFI has asked me to be the Louisiana Director, and it's an offer I've accepted. I believe that Christians like us should stand for [[Israel]] and the [[Jewish people]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdm.org/jdmDefault.aspx?tabindex=-1&amp;tabID=80 Jesse Duplantis Ministries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629204604/http://www.jdm.org/jdmDefault.aspx?tabindex=-1&amp;tabID=80 |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A diverse group of Christian leaders met in [[San Antonio]] February 7–8, 2006 to form the organization, which is chaired by [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charismamag.com/site-archives/146-covers/cover-story/1912-why-israel-matters|title=Why Israel Matters|last=Stearns|first=Robert|work=Charisma Magazine|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral Roberts University Board of Regents===
Duplantis was on the Board of Regents of [[Oral Roberts University]], which awarded him an honorary doctorate, until late 2007, when he, fellow regent [[Creflo Dollar]], and the President of the University [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard Roberts]] all resigned. Duplantis said in a prepared statement released by the school, "the demands of ministry have made it increasingly difficult to continue to effectively serve." The rest of the Board which included [[Kenneth Copeland]] and [[Benny Hinn]] was swept away over the next few weeks after the University accepted a $70 million donation on the condition it inaugurate "a new era of transparent governance and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Shakeup at Oral Roberts University|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/major-shakeup-at-oral-roberts-university/|publisher=cbsnews.com|date=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another televangelist leaves ORU Board|url=https://newsok.com/article/3182447/another-televangelist-leaves-oru-board|publisher=newsok.com|date=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of private jets===

In May 2018, Duplantis asked his followers to donate money to him so that he could buy a new $54 million private jet, the [[Dassault Falcon 7X]]. Duplantis said that his organization, Jesse Duplantis Ministries, had already paid for three private jets by 2006, and that he had been using them by "just burning them up for the Lord Jesus Christ." Duplantis defended his choice by saying: "I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today he wouldn't be riding a donkey. Think about that for a minute. He'd be in an airplane preaching the gospel all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broach|first1=Drew|title=Jesse Duplantis, Destrehan televangelist, seeks donations for $54 million jet|url=http://www.nola.com/religion/index.ssf/2018/05/jesse_duplantis_private_jet.html|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a wave of criticism, Duplantis stated on his ministry website, "I'm not asking you to pay for my plane."&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_d162c968-6699-11e8-9430-cb00531d27fa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously in 2016, Duplantis and fellow televangelist [[Kenneth Copeland]] defended their use of private jets as firstly, commercial planes were full of "demons" which would bog down their schedules with requests for prayers; and secondly, on a commercial airplane, Duplantis would not be able to unbuckle his seat belt to speak to God standing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chasmar|first1=Jessica|title=Televangelists defend private jets: Commercial planes full of 'demons'|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/5/kenneth-copeland-jesse-duplantis-defend-private-je/|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In recognition of his "many years of effectively sharing God's message of salvation through Jesus Christ to the world,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Duplantis|url=http://www.cfaith.com/index.php/biography-display?autid=904|publisher=cfaith.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Duplantis was awarded an honorary [[Doctorate of Divinity]] degree from [[Oral Roberts University]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Regents|url=https://newsok.com/article/3153614/board-of-regents|publisher=newsok.com|date=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and tax issues==
Duplantis's estimated $40 million net worth and lavish lifestyle come under harsh criticism from those outside the "prosperity gospel" fold. 

The [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)]], a religious watchdog organization, has kept an eye on Duplantis for more than 10 years. The organization's president Ole Anthony said that because DuPlantis' tax exemption, technically, every person in St. Charles Parish was “helping to pay for Duplantis' extravagant lifestyle”.

The ownership of Duplantis' $3 million house, which also serves as the church rectory, was also the subject of investigation, as it had been paid for through non-taxable donations, and Duplantis avoided paying up to $33,000 a year in taxes for what a house of that value would be taxed. Retired Tax Assessor Clyde Gisclair of that parish said that whereas most homeowners qualify for a tax exemption, Duplantis has placed the house in the ministry's name, though it is for his own use, and will not be paying taxes at all. Therefore taxpayers will be footing the bill. "When somebody's exempt, somebody has to pay the bill," Gisclair said. He said that instances like this can cause the area's millage, or property tax, to go up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/art-literature/interesting-jesse-duplantis-s-house-bb74d76e8c80dabd|title=What Are Some Interesting Facts About Jesse Duplantis's House?|work=Reference|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anthony, "If the IRS finds that he in fact is abusing the tax code with regard to those two issues (conversion and inurement), then they could conceivably revoke his ability to give tax receipts for donations - he could lose his tax exempt status." Besides the house, Jesse Duplantis Ministries also owns a huge private jet, with which Duplantis had used to take thousands of trips, including to Hawaii and Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/televangelist-jesse-duplantis-asks-for-donations-for-private-jet.html|title=Louisiana Televangelist Asks For Donations to Buy $54 Million Jet|first=Molly|last=Olmstead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[Judaism]], [[marriage]] is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a man and a woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. ({{bibleref||Deut.|24:1|HE}}) Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. ({{bibleref||Gen.|1:28|HE}}) In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered "incomplete" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Yebomoth 62b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |title=Why Marry? |access-date=2007-12-19 |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153323/https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |archivedate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jewish denominations such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/01/conservative-jews-approve-gay-wedding-guidelines/ |title=Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines |publisher=Fox News |date=2012-06-01 |access-date=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2000/03/Text-Of-The-Reform-Judaism-Gay-Marriage-Resolution.aspx# |title=Text of the Reform Judaism Gay Marriage Resolution |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2011-02-17 |access-date=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is considered as a diversion from the [[halakha|Jewish Law]] by the Orthodox denominations, rather than as a legitimate, alternative interpretation.

== Engagement ==
{{Judaism}}

In [[Jewish law]], an [[engagement]] ('' kiddushin'') is a contract between a man and a woman where they mutually promise to marry each other at some future time and the terms on which it shall take place.&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Jewish Law'', Ed [[Menachem Elon]], {{ISBN|0-7065-1415-7}}, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The promise may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 9b)&lt;/ref&gt; The promise is formalized in a document known as the {{lang|he-Latn|Shtar Tena'im}}, the "Document of Conditions", which is read prior to the {{lang|he-Latn|badekin}}. After this reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all.

In [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a [[shidduch]] by engaging a professional match-maker ("''shadchan''") who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a "brokerage-fee" for his or her services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.

== Betrothal and marriage ==

In Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called ''[[erusin]]'' (or ''kiddushin'', meaning ''sanctification''&lt;!--BUT historic Jewish writers sometimes use ''kiddushin'' to refer to marriage as a whole, so for the sake of avoiding ambiguity don't use it in the article as a synonym for erusin--&gt;), which is the [[betrothal]] ceremony, and ''nissu'in'' or ''[[chupah]]'', the actual [[Jewish wedding|Jewish wedding ceremony]]. ''Erusin'' changes the couple's interpersonal status, while ''nissu'in'' brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. In [[Talmud]]ic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (''nissuin''), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.

According to the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Kiddushin 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; ''erusin'' involves the groom handing an object to the bride - either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After erusin, the laws of [[adultery]] apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a [[Get (divorce document)|religious divorce]]. After ''nisuin'', the couple may live together.

== Matrimony ==

=== Marital harmony ===
{{Main article|Shalom bayit}}
Marital harmony, known as "''shlom bayit''," is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her ''more'' than he honours himself;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]'' 76b&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth.&lt;ref name="BaMe59b"&gt;''[[Baba Metzia]]'' 59b&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life.&lt;ref name="BaMe59b"/&gt; The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 6b&lt;/ref&gt; and [[domestic abuse]] by him&lt;!--but not by her--&gt; was also condemned.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; It was said of a wife that ''God counts her tears''.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

As for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]]'' 66b&lt;/ref&gt; to this end, an early [[midrash]] states that a wife should not leave the home ''too frequently''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Genesis Rabbah]]'' 65:2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tzniut|A wife, also, was expected to be modest]], even if the only other person present with her was her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 140b&lt;/ref&gt; God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' 17a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conjugal rights and obligations ===
Marriage obligations and rights in [[Judaism]] are ultimately based on those apparent in the [[Bible]], which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many [[posek|prominent rabbinic authorities]] throughout history.

Traditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the [[ketuba]].

The Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate [[Ketubot]] in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.

According to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband,&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=marriage |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms;&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"/&gt; indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"/&gt; For example, the [[Talmud]] establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband,&lt;ref name="Ket48a"&gt;''Ketubot'' 48a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ket61a"&gt;''Ketubot'' 61a&lt;/ref&gt; and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.&lt;ref name="Ket48a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ket61a"/&gt;

==== In the Bible ====
[[Biblical Hebrew]] has two words for "husband": ''ba'al'' (also meaning "master"), and ''ish'' (also meaning "man", parallel to ''isha'' meaning "woman" or "wife"). The words are contrasted in [[Hosea]] 2:18 (2:16 in Christian Bibles), where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: "On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] 'my husband' (''ish''), and will no longer call me 'my master' (''ba'al'')."

A wife was also seen as being of high value, and was therefore, usually, carefully looked after.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica |article=marriage |section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as ''[[Beena marriage|beena]]'', in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband;&lt;ref name="WRSKinship167"&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 167&lt;/ref&gt; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession&lt;ref name="WRSKinship167"/&gt; (specifically, [[Jael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:26|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacob's wives&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|31:33-34|}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|15:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|16:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:15|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|2:16|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|8:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Proverbs]] contains an entire [[acrostic]] about the duties which would be performed by a ''virtuous'' wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Proverbs|31:10-31|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The [[Torah]] obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Husband and Wife |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&amp;artid=986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Polygyny|polygynous]]&lt;!--this is NOT a spelling mistake for 'polygamous'--&gt; society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed [[monogamy]] on men.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica |article=Jealousy, Ordeal of |section=Jannaeus-Jerah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Adultery |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&amp;letter=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery|Adulterous]] married women and adulterous betrothed women, and their male accomplices however, were subject to the [[death penalty]] by [[Adultery#In the Hebrew Bible|the biblical laws against adultery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:40|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22-25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the [[Ordeal of the bitter water|Ordeal of Bitter Water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11-31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[trial by ordeal]], but one that took a miracle to convict. The [[literary prophets]] indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hosea|4:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal strictnesses.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal"/&gt;

==== In the Talmud and Rabbinic Judaism ====
The Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;
* Enough bread for at least two meals a day
* Sufficient oil for cooking and for lighting purposes
* Sufficient wood for cooking
* Fruit and vegetables
* Wine, if it is customary in the locality for women to drink it
* Three meals on each [[shabbat]] consisting of fish and meat
* An [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] of a silver coin (Hebrew: ''ma'ah'') each week

[[Beth din|Rabbinic courts]] could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 77a&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Schreiber]], a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her;&lt;ref&gt;Moses Schreiber, ''Hatam Sofer'' on ''[[Eben ha-'Ezer]]'', 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

According to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself.&lt;ref name="MaMiTI121022"&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Ishut'' 12:10-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz70"&gt;[[Jacob ben Asher]], ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 70&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.&lt;ref name="MaMiTI121022"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz70"/&gt;

In order to offset the husband's duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of [[usufruct]] on her property;&lt;ref name="Ket46b47b"&gt;''Ketubot'' 46b-47b&lt;/ref&gt; the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself.&lt;ref name="Ket46b47b"/&gt; Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud;&lt;ref name="Ket46b47b"/&gt; this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

===== Home and household =====
In Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status;&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband's choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 61b&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient [[grounds for divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:1-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

Expanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake,&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"/&gt; rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large [[dowry]];&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to supposedly "affectionate" tasks, such as [[Making the bed|making his bed]] and serving him his food.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 59b&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Clothing =====
The Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 [[Zuz (Jewish coin)|zuzim]]'s-worth of clothing,&lt;ref name="JewEncCos"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Costume |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=822&amp;letter=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; including garments appropriate to each [[season]] of the year.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes&lt;ref&gt;[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]] 64b&lt;/ref&gt; (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: [[Passover]], [[Shabu'ot]], and [[Sukkoth]]&lt;ref name="JewEncCos"/&gt;). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewellery and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

===== Physical obligations =====
The Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this;&lt;ref name="Ket46b47b"/&gt; the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care.&lt;ref name="Ket46b47b"/&gt; Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as ''inhuman'' behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt;

If the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial;&lt;ref name="Ket46a47b"&gt;''Ketubot'' 46a-47b&lt;/ref&gt; the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom.&lt;ref name="Ket46a47b"/&gt; Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone.&lt;ref name="MaMiTorIs142324"&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz89"&gt;Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 89&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.&lt;ref name="MaMiTorIs142324"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz89"/&gt;

If the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release;&lt;ref name="Ket51a"&gt;''Ketubot'' 51a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaMiTorIs141822"&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:18-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz78"&gt;Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JKShuArYD25210"&gt;[[Joseph Karo]], ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 252:10&lt;/ref&gt; there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gittin]]'', 45a&lt;/ref&gt; or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"/&gt; If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.&lt;ref name="Ket51a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaMiTorIs141822"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JabAshEbEz78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JKShuArYD25210"/&gt;

===== Fidelity =====
In the classical era of the [[rabbi]]nic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:
* the woman had been raped, rather than consenting to the crime;&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 51b&lt;/ref&gt;
* the woman had mistaken the paramour for her husband;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt;
* the woman was unaware of the laws against adultery before she committed the crime;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt;
* the woman had not been properly warned. This requires that the two witnesses testifying against her warn her that the [[Torah]] prohibits adultery; that the penalty for adultery is death; and that she immediately responded that she is doing so with full knowledge of those facts. Even if she was warned, but did not acknowledge those facts immediately upon hearing them, and immediately before doing the act, she is not put to death. These conditions apply in all death-penalty convictions.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Ketubot 33a&lt;/ref&gt;

These rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted.&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt; However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a [[Kohen]] was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yebamot'' 56b&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild; the death penalty (for all crimes) was abolished in 40 AD,&lt;ref&gt;''Sanhedrin'' 41&lt;/ref&gt; and adulteresses were flogged instead.&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt; Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them;&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' 6:1&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Maimonides]], a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife's ''[[Ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew: ''ketubah'') gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 24:6&lt;/ref&gt; Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' 5:1&lt;/ref&gt;

As for men who committed adultery (with another man's wife&lt;!--rather than with an unmarried woman--&gt;), [[Abba ben Joseph bar Hama|Abba ben Joseph]] and [[Abba Arika]] are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to [[Gehenna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' 4b&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Family purity =====
{{Main article|Niddah}}
The laws of "family purity" (''tehorat hamishpacha'') are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual [[niddah]] laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including [[Keri|those about the ejaculation of semen]], these are collectively termed "family purity".

===== Sexual relations =====
In marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/465161/jewish/The-Purposes-of-Marriage.htm The Jewish Way in Love &amp; Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt; This obligation is known as "[[onah]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm Judaism 101: Kosher Sex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex within marriage is the woman's right, and the man's duty. If either partner refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce.

== Ages of marriage{{anchor|Child marriage}} ==

Early-teen marriage was possible in Judaism. Babylonian rabbis encouraged early marriage as a means of legally channeling the male libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Satlow|editor1=William Horbury|editor2=John Sturdy|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA1134|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77248-8|pages=622–|quote=Their answer to the problem of sexual desire centered on advocating early marriage. For Babylonian rabbis, the primary goal of marriage meant channeling and controlling male sexuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, a father is commanded not to marry his daughter to anyone until she grows up and says, "I want this one".&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer, 37:8&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage that takes place without the consent of the girl is not an effective legal marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer, 42:1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the young threshold for marriage, a large age gap between the spouses was opposed,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yebamot]]'' 44a&lt;/ref&gt; and, in particular, marrying one's young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanhedrin'' 76a&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''ketannah'' (literally meaning "little [one]") was any girl between the age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day;&lt;ref name="JewEncMaj"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Majority |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was subject to her father's authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement.&lt;ref name="JewEncMaj"/&gt; However, after reaching the age of maturity, she would have to agree to the marriage to be considered as married. If the father was dead or missing, the brothers of the ''ketannah'', collectively, had the right to arrange a marriage for her, as had her mother.&lt;ref name="JewEncMaj"/&gt; In these situations, a ''ketannah'' would always have the right to [[Annulment|annul]] her marriage, even if it was the first.&lt;ref name="JewEncMiu"/&gt;

If the marriage did end (due to divorce or the husband's death), any further marriages were optional; the ''ketannah'' retained her right to annul them.&lt;ref name="JewEncMiu"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Mi'un |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=669&amp;letter=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a ''ketannah'' to annul a marriage, known in Hebrew as ''mi'un'' (literally meaning "refusal", "denial", "protest"),&lt;ref name="JewEncMiu"/&gt; led to a true annulment, not a divorce; a divorce document (''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'') was not necessary,&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 107a&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''ketannah'' who did this was not regarded by legal regulations as a divorcee, in relation to the marriage.&lt;ref name="Yeb108a"&gt;''Yebamot'' 108a&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike divorce, ''mi'un'' was regarded with distaste by many rabbinic writers,&lt;ref name="JewEncMiu"/&gt; even in the Talmud;&lt;ref&gt;''Yebamot'' 109a&lt;/ref&gt; in earlier classical Judaism, one major faction&amp;nbsp;- the [[House of Shammai]]&amp;nbsp;- argued that such annulment rights only existed during the betrothal&lt;!--NOT engagement--&gt; period (''[[erusin]]'') and not once the actual marriage (''[[Nissuin|nissu'in]]'') had begun.&lt;ref&gt;''Yebamot'' 107a&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from Rabbinic material indicates that Jewish males normally married at the age of thirty, to adolescent women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Satlow|editor1=William Horbury|editor2=John Sturdy|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA1134|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77248-8|pages=618–|quote=Rabbinic sources suggest that the common marriageable age of Palestinian men was approximately thirty years old, probably to women in their (late?) teens.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval [[Ashkenazi Jew|Jewish Ashkenazi]] communities, girls were often married at very young ages.&lt;ref&gt;''Kiddushin'' ([[tosafot]]) 41a&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Jewish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], child marriage is extremely rare in the Jewish community.

== Intermarriage ==
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Judaism}}

Rates of marriage between Jews and non-Jews have increased in countries other than Israel (the [[Jewish diaspora]]). According to the [[National Jewish Population Survey|National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01]], 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarriage]].

; Attitudes
* All branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] do not sanction the validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.
* [[Conservative Judaism]] does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.
* [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish. In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any form of marriage to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.

There are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their [[Who is a Jew|differing criteria for being Jewish]] in the first place. Orthodox Jews do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was conducted under the authority of a more liberal stream.

{{Further information|Conservative Halakha#Restrictions on marriage}}

== Marriage in Israel ==
{{See also|Marriage in Israel}}

In [[Israel]], the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law ([[halakha]]), as viewed by [[Orthodox Judaism]]. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to [[Jewish law]] (e. g., a [[kohen]] and a [[Divorce|divorcée]], or a Jew and one who is not [[Who is a Jew?|halachically Jewish]]), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.

Some secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have [[civil marriages]], either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by ''halakha''. These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.

Marriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druse), unless both parties are ''without religion''.

== Divorce ==

Halakha (Jewish law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']]. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the ''get'' document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the ''get'', if he has violated any of his numerous obligations;{{which|date=August 2016}} this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.

Since around the 12th century, Judaism recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a divorce.

[[Conservative Judaism]] follows halacha, though differently than [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the Ketubah at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe halacha, which is seldom the case in reform weddings.
=== Agunah ===
{{Main article|Agunah}}
Traditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an ''[[agunah]]'' (literally "an anchored woman"), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']] due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a Michuseres Get, not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a ''Misarev Get'' (literally, "a refuser of a divorce document"), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term ''[[agunah]]'' is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.

Within both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the agunah problem in the case of a missing husband.

== Same-sex marriage ==
{{See also|Judaism and sexual orientation}}

=== In antiquity ===
The [[Midrash]] is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to [[same-sex marriage]]. The following teaching can be found twice in the Midrash:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Joseph, 'The generation of the Flood was not wiped out until they wrote גמומסיות (either sexual hymns or marriage documents) for the union of a man to a male or to an animal.'"&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah 26:5; Leviticus Rabbah 23:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another important reference is found in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they do not sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'" &lt;ref&gt;Chullin 92ab&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Orthodox Judaism ===
Orthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of kiddushin are reserved for a union of a man and woman. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil marriages to have theological legal standing, be they civil marriages between male and female, or between two adults of the same gender.

=== In Conservative Judaism ===
In June 2012, the American branch of [[Conservative Judaism]] formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote.&lt;ref name="SSM"&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/religion/20120601_ap_conservativejewsapprovegayweddingguidelines.html?c=r Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Reform Judaism ===
In 1996, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:

: However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle - we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a "marriage" within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mljewish.org/S.C.J/faq/18-03-08.html MLjewish.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
: The Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and
: That the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.
: That this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.

In 1998, an ad-hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage "may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community." The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy ''teshuvah'' (rabbinical opinion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&amp;year=5756 CCARnet.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217072309/http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&amp;year=5756 |date=December 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.

In March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that "We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not."

=== In Reconstructionist Judaism ===
The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.

'''Josef Stangl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaŋl̩|lang}}; 12 March 1907 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1979) was [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]] of [[Würzburg]], [[Germany]].

Born in [[Kronach]], [[Bavaria]], Stangl became a [[priest]] on 16 March 1930, and he was appointed by [[Pope Pius XII]] as [[Bishop of Würzburg]] on 27 June 1957.

He approved the [[exorcism]] on [[Anneliese Michel]] in 1975 and 1976, ordering total secrecy,&lt;ref name="TWS"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s1s_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yVIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1378,1341502&amp;hl=en|title=Priests convinced woman was possessed|publisher=[[The Windsor Star]]|accessdate=14 May 2011|date=4 April 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; "after careful consideration and good information" by Father Arnold Renz. She died of malnutrition from almost a year of semi-starvation while the rites of exorcism were performed.

Stangl [[Consecration#Ordination of bishops|consecrated]] Father Joseph Ratzinger, later [[Pope Benedict XVI]], as a bishop on 28 May 1977.

On 8 January 1979, Stangl withdrew as a bishop of Würzburg, and died in [[Schweinfurt]] in April 1979.

'''''Kokkinakis v. Greece''''' (application No. 14307/88) is a landmark case of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], decided in 1993 and concerning compatibility of certain sanctions for [[proselytism]] with Articles 7 and 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].  It ruled by a vote of six-to-three that a Jehovah's Witness man's freedom to manifest his religion, protected by Article 9, had been violated by the Greek government.  One of the judges wrote that this case was "of particular importance" because it was "the first real case concerning freedom of religion to have come before the European Court since it was set up" in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, partly concurring opinion of Judge Pettiti&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==

The crime of proselytism, according to Greek law, meant "in particular, any direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion (eterodoxos), with the aim of undermining those beliefs, either by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of his inexperience, trust, need, low intellect or naivety". Greek court has later clarified that "purely spiritual teaching does not amount to proselytism, even if it demonstrates the errors of other religions and entices possible disciples away from them, who abandon their original religions of their own free will; this is because spiritual teaching is in the nature of a rite of worship performed freely and without hindrance. Outside such spiritual teaching, which may be freely given, any determined, importunate attempt to entice disciples away from the dominant religion by means that are unlawful or morally reprehensible constitutes proselytism as prohibited".&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, paras. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. [[Minos Kokkinakis]], a [[Jehovah's Witness]], and his wife, called at the home of Mrs Kyriakaki in Sitia and engaged in a discussion with her, described by Ms. Kyriakaki as follows: "They immediately talked to me about [[Olof Palme]], whether he was a [[pacifist]] or not, and other subjects that I can’t remember. They talked to me about things I did not understand very well. It was not a discussion but a constant monologue by them. ... If they had told me they were Jehovah’s Witnesses, I would not have let them in. I don’t recall whether they spoke to me about the Kingdom of Heaven. They stayed in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. What they told me was religious in nature, but I don’t know why they told it to me. I could not know at the outset what the purpose of their visit was. They may have said something to me at the time with a view to undermining my religious beliefs... [However,] the discussion did not influence my beliefs". Mrs Kyriakaki’s husband, who was the cantor at a local Orthodox church, informed the police and Mr. Kokkinakis was convicted for proselytism.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, paras. 7-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Kokkinakis appealed to the ECtHR under Articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The court's Commission unanimously held that there had been a violation of Kokkinakis' rights under Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, para. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court's judgment==
The court held that the measure complained of was prescribed by law and was in pursuit of a legitimate aim under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, paras. 37-44&lt;/ref&gt; However, it found a violation of Article 9 (by six votes to three), reasoning that the interference with Kokkinakis' freedom of religion was not necessary in a democratic society since: a "distinction has to be made between bearing Christian witness and improper proselytism. The former corresponds to true evangelism, which a report drawn up in 1956 under the auspices of the World Council of Churches describes as an essential mission and a responsibility of every Christian and every Church. The latter represents a corruption or deformation of it. It may, according to the same report, take the form of activities offering material or social advantages with a view to gaining new members for a Church or exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need; it may even entail the use of violence or brainwashing; more generally, it is not compatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others. Scrutiny of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 shows that the relevant criteria adopted by the Greek legislature are reconcilable with the foregoing if and in so far as they are designed only to punish improper proselytism, which the Court does not have to define in the abstract in the present case. The Court notes, however, that in their reasoning the Greek courts established the applicant’s liability by merely reproducing the wording of section 4 and did not sufficiently specify in what way the accused had attempted to convince his neighbour by improper means. None of the facts they set out warrants that finding. That being so, it has not been shown that the applicant’s conviction was justified in the circumstances of the case by a pressing social need. The contested measure therefore does not appear to have been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued".&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, paras. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court rejected (by eight votes to one) applicant's claim that the provision of Greek law serving as ground for his conviction was not sufficiently precise and clear, violating Article 7.&lt;ref&gt;ECtHR judgment, paras. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court held unnecessary to examine the case under Article 10 or 14.

Judge Pettiti submitted a partly concurring opinion, considering that the criminal legislation in Greece on proselytism was in itself contrary to Article 9. Judge De Meyer submitted a short concurring opinion.

Judges Foighel and Loizou, jointly, and Judge Valticos filed two dissenting opinions, regarding Article 9 as not violated.

Judge Martens filed a partly dissenting opinion, offering his own rationale for the finding of violation of Article 9 and also considering Article 7 to be violated.

'''''Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis''''' is an oil painting by the English painter [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (c.1775–1851), first exhibited in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/|title=Tate|work=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Displayed during the latter years of J.M.W. Turners career, this painting depicts a [[deluge myth|deluge]] scene where the natural effects of light and weather (the atmosphere) play a crucial role on Turner's concept of vision. The deluge being referred to in the title is the representation of the great flood story told in the [[Book of Genesis]]. As suggested by its title, the painting also acknowledges [[Moses]], known as the author of the book of Genesis found in the Old Testament of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. canada, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting the role of man is portrayed as passive through his inability to control nature, which is beautiful to the eye yet has the power to destroy and recreate life. This piece also illustrates Turner's belief that God is the one in charge as it is He who creates the flood, allows Noah to survive, and inspired Moses to write the Book of Genesis. Genesis, in this case leads back to the creation of man, light, and the water which light is being reflected on.&lt;ref name="WebEx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/romantic-color.html|title=Turner and Delacroix|work=webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
For most of his career Turner, whose works are predominantly subjective, was recognised for his watercolor and oil paintings that reflected landscape images and scenes of natural entities such as the weather, the ocean, the effect of light, and vision. Through the blurring of images, Turner attempts to justify the belief that the eye is always trying to form an image as it tries to recreate nature. Traditionally, colour is used as a type of ''accessory'' to form, but Turner's attraction to light and colour allows colour to take the place of form.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. Canada, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The main colours used by Turner were red, yellow, and blue,&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; which is discussed more in depth in relation to other works that influenced that of Turner. His work also illustrates his relationship to the [[Romanticism|Romantic Movement]] and position as the precursor of the impressionist movement.

==Influence==
As expressed in the title of the painting, J.M.W. Turner found interest in [[Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe]]'s book, ''Theory of Colours'' also known as [[Zur Farbenlehre]], published in 1810.&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;Finley, Gerald. ''The Deluge Pictures: Reflections on Goethe, J.M.W. Turner and Early Nineteenth-Century Science.'' Deutscher Kunstrerlag GmbH Munchen Berlin. Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte, 60 Bd., H. 4 (1997), pp. 530–548&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goethe's Theory==
Turner absorbed Goethe’s theory of light and darkness and depicted their relationship in a number of his paintings, including ''Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – the Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis''. According to this theory,the creation of colour is dependent on the distribution of dark and light reflecting through a transparent object.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner uses main concepts from Goethe’s theory, which is a rejection of Newton's Seven Color Theory, and expresses the belief that every colour was an individualised combination of light and darkness. Newton's reasoning in his theory of light and colour was, in the words of Michael Duck, too ''simplistic'' for Goethe. As a result, Goethe found his own form of vision in regards to the physiological aspects of the concept of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Duck, Michael (September 1988). "Newton and Goethe on colour: Physical and physiological considerations". Annals of Science, Volume 45, Number 5, pp. 507–519.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Goethe claims that there is an infinite amount of colour variation, and through his paintings Turner attempts to reflect this theory.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner also responds to the ''plus'' and ''minus'' concepts that Goethe created to address both emotions and the eye. His main focus was the after image that is left on the retina after seeing an image. Through this after image the ''plus'' addresses the colours red and yellow which is intended to evoke a buoyant feelings, while the colour blue contrasts such as it creates the emotion of melancholy and desolation.&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; According to Goethe's concept, yellow undergoes a transition of light becoming darker when light reaches its peak, just as the sun shines in the sky, it develops to a white light that is colourless.  But the light deepens and evolves the yellow into an orange and then finally to a ruby red hue.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner illustrates the process of yellow transitioning into phases of light by showing how, as the viewer moves away from the centre, the edges get darker.

==Symbolism==
The yellowing colouring of the painting is a reference to Goethe’s ''Theory of Colour'', which explains the colour yellow as being the first colour transmitted from light.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Backhaus, Reinhold Kliegl, John S. Werner. ''Color Vision: perspectives from different disciplines''. Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, 1998. pp 13–26&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the painting is circular, symbolising the construction of the human eye, changing the focus of a typical linear splitting of space to a more subjective portrayal. The colour yellow is typically optimistic, but Turner captures the negativity of yellow by attaching the colour to a light that is subject to change.  The morning sun aspect of the colour is something transient.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

==Companion piece==
*Turner's paired piece titled ''Shade and Darkness – The Evening of the Deluge'' was also exhibited in 1843. In this piece as well as ''The Morning After the Deluge'', Turner makes no attempt to mirror the scene of the flood in its naturality.&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; 
*''Fallacies of Hope'' is a poem that Turner supposedly wrote to parallel the two paintings.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

==1994 Frankfurt theft==
''Light and Colour'' was among three paintings [[Frankfurt art theft (1994)|stolen from a Frankfurt museum in 1994]]. ''Shade and Darkness'' was also taken. In 2002, the Tate Gallery covertly purchased ''Light and Colour'' on the black market for $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Tate found its Turners|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4414120.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 July 2016|date=8 November 2005|first1=Egmont R|last1=Koch|first2=Nina|last2=Svensson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academic]]-[[History|historical]] research into [[Jewish mysticism]] is a modern multi-discipline [[university]] branch of [[Jewish studies]]. It studies the texts and historical contexts of Judaic mysticism using objective historical-critical methods of [[Religious studies]], such as [[Philology]], [[History of ideas]], [[Social history]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]. The historical development of Jewish mysticism under study covers the range of phases, forms and expressions, from early Rabbinic [[Merkabah mysticism]], through Medieval [[Hasidei Ashkenaz]] and [[Kabbalah|Classical Kabbalah]], early-modern [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Safed Kabbalah]] and [[Sabbateanism]], to modern [[Hasidism]] and 20th century expressions. It is often seen as a parallel field to academic research into rationalist [[Jewish philosophy]], though some scholars contribute in both areas. In Israel both subjects, together with [[Musar literature|Ethical literature]], share the unbrella department of [[Jewish thought]].

Historical research into Jewish mysticism was first prepared by the 19th century [[Wissenschaft des Judentums]] school, whose [[historiography]] ignored, opposed or downplayed Kabbalah. The founding of the present flourishing University discipline is attributed to [[Gershom Scholem]] and his school in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in the 20th century, whose historiography positioned Jewish mysticism as a mainstream vitalising source in the centre of Jewish development. A second generation of scholars are today found in Israel, the United States and Europe. The field is broadly divided into three camps:&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization). The introduction by [[Joseph Dan]] surveys the field of Jewish mysticism academia today, citing the first two categories as two departments in Universities: the (philological) "mystics" and the (social) "historians". In the past, each kept to separate domains, but now multi-disciplinary crossover fertilisation prevails. The third, religious historiography camp is referenced in the academic scholarship, welcoming the research, but cautioning use of its findings&lt;/ref&gt;
# Professors/researchers of Jewish mysticism/thought in academia, who study Jewish mysticism through its internal textual development
# Professors/researchers of Jewish history/society in academia, who contribute to the study of Jewish mysticism through its external social contexts
# Independent historian researchers outside of Universities, who follow a religious historiography, but use the scholarly academic apparatus of research, sourcing and presentation. This research is most common in relation to Hasidism, due to its social popularisation of Kabbalah. These works are not usually cited in the critical-methodology of academia, but work is being done to examine their findings

Spiritual figures within the Jewish mystical tradition are not listed here, but in [[Timeline List of Jewish Kabbalists]]. Contemporary teachers of Jewish mysticism across the [[Jewish denominations]], listed there, should only be listed here if they also publish scholarly-form historical research into Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars of Jewish mysticism have followed a diverse range in personal belief commitment or detachment to Jewish mysticism, independent of their research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20349">The [[Anglican Church of Canada]], a member church of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], contains twenty-nine [[diocese]]s and one non-diocesan administrative region that are organised into four [[Ecclesiastical Provinces and Dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada|ecclesiastical provinces]].

Most dioceses are contained within a single civil province or territory. The four exceptions are the Arctic, Moosonee, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and Ottawa dioceses.

Each diocese has a [[bishop]], four of whom are [[archbishop]]s as [[Metropolitan (religion)|metropolitans]] of their [[ecclesiastical province]]. Dioceses are self-governing entities, incorporated under the Corporations Act of the civil [[provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]] in which they are active. 

Diocesan [[synod]]s generally meet annually and have responsibility for those aspects of church life which do not concern doctrine, discipline, or worship.  These latter matters are the purview of the [[General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada|General Synod]] of the national church, which meets triennially and at other times delegates its powers to an elected body of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], called the Council of General Synod, and to the [[Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada]].

==Provinces==
The [[Anglican Church of Canada]] is divided into four [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each under the jurisdiction of a provincial [[synod]] and a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] archbishop. Originally the metropolitans were bishops of particular dioceses within the provinces. In 1893 the metropolitans were granted the title of "archbishop", and they are now elected from among the bishops of each province.

*The '''[[Ecclesiastical Province of Canada]]''' was founded in 1860, originally consisting of the four dioceses in the then civil [[Province of Canada]] (Upper and Lower Canada, i.e. modern Ontario and Quebec, respectively) under the metropolitan authority of the Bishop of Montreal. The province was expanded in 1870 and 1871 to include New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 1913, the Ontario dioceses were split off to form the Province of Ontario (see below). The Province was expanded to include the civil province of Newfoundland following its entrance into Confederation in 1949. The province today comprises seven [[diocese]]s.
*The '''[[Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land]]''' was formed in 1875, covering the Prairie Provinces and initially under the metropolitan authority of the Bishop of Rupert's Land. Today it comprises ten dioceses.
*The '''[[Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario]]''' was formed out of the Province of Canada and the Diocese of Moosonee (which had been in the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land) in 1912. Today, it comprises seven dioceses.
*The '''[[Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon]]''' was formed out of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land as the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia in 1914. It was expanded in 1943 (and consequently renamed) to incorporate the Diocese of Yukon, which was transferred from Rupert's Land. The province today comprises five dioceses.

==Archbishops==
The four metropolitans (who all bear the style of ''[[The Most Reverend]]'') are:
*Canada: [[Ron Cutler]], Archbishop of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 
*Rupert's Land: [[Greg Kerr-Wilson]], Archbishop of Calgary
*Ontario: [[Anne Germond]], Archbishop of Algoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne Germond |url=http://dioceseofalgoma.com/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=view&amp;ID=814 |website=The Diocese of Algoma |publisher=Anglican Church of Canada |accessdate=12 October 2018 |date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*British Columbia and Yukon: [[Melissa Skelton]], Archbishop of New Westminster

The [[Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada|Primate of Canada]] (who has no diocese and is styled ''The Most Reverend'') is [[Fred Hiltz]]. The Primate is elected from among all the bishops across the country.

'''''Manmukh''''' literally means "to follow one's mind or desires".

The word ''Manmukh'' consists of two parts: '''Man''' and '''Mukh'''. ''Man'' means "one's own mind or one's own desires" and ''Mukh'' literally means "face", so the full word conveys the message "One who follows whichever way his or her mind leads or goes"; "one who follows his or her desires"; "one who does as his or her mind dictates". The Manmukh is attached to worldly desires, material wealth, worldly allurements and sensual enjoyments. His desires and his needs are unlimited.

To be a Manmukh is to follow one's own mind or desires without regards for anyone else. A person who is self-centred is called a Manmukh. The opposite of Manmukh is [[Gurmukh]], which means a person who follows the teaching and life-code as narrated by the [[guru]]. A Manmukh is the opposite of a Gurmukh. Hence, a Manmukh is a material being (egoistic or attached to worldly things) as opposed to a spiritual being. The people with materialistic attachment believe that everlasting happiness is attainable only in acquisition (i.e. ownership) and the use of these material objects. In other words, a Manmukh is ruled by and is conditioned by pleasure of his five senses and his mind. Simply stated, a Manmukh is an ego-centric person whose actions are controlled by the following urges and desires: lust, anger, greed, material attachment, self-conceit, envy and stubborn mindedness, with their numerous variations.

As a result, he has no belief no understanding of the [[Naam]] (God's existence), [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] (word of the guru), Hukam (will of the Almighty), [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]] (Soul), or God (Spirit or Sat Guru). Consequently, he has no understanding of the ultimate purpose of life, his relationship with God, and the way of God ([[Gurmat]]). In this madness and illusion and "I-am-ness", he cultivates the life of a faithless cynic called "Saakat" — an unwise and an untrue being. Thus, according to the Gurbani, anyone who has not realized the Self within (God, Truth, Shabad or Naam, etc.) alone is a Manmukh.

Everyone in the world can be categorised as either a servant of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or a servant of the [[Akal]]. Those who serve Maya are called Manmukhs, and those who serve the Truth (God) are called Gurmukhs or Divine. Thus, a Manmukh regardless of how advanced he may be in his or her material qualifications by education or cultural status, lacks in Divine qualities; consequently, is not aware of the Cosmic Reality that is contained within him/her. Such individuals fail to attain Spiritual Perfection or Intuitive Understanding of the "ultimate reality"; for their intellect is dimmed by material contamination. They hate holiness. They chase after Maya, and wander in this dense forest of material existence like a beast in human garb.

A Manmukh lifestyle is void of humility, contentment, compassion, love and spiritual wisdom. Such lifestyle exhibits nothing but undesirable qualities in a person. To make us aware of Manmukhs and their conduct, [[Gurbani]] has provided us with numerous symptoms of such material beings caught in the vertex of unenlightened existence. Some of these symptoms include: egoism, ignorance, selfishness, duality, bondage, evil-mindedness, falsehood, violence, untruthfulness, doubts, superstitions, uncontrolled senses, identification with the feeling of "I, me, mine, your", lust, anger, greed, attachment, self pride, self-conceit; superstitious, jealousy and enviousness, stubborn mindedness, hatred, fanaticism, conflicts, lack of contentment, material hankering and lamentation, lack of mental control and inner peace, self-centredness, are full of quarrel and contentions, lack of faith, ritualistic, unhappy, always interested in taking instead of giving, affinity for bad association, lack of self-discipline, mental agitation, unceasing wandering (rat-race), begging material things from God, complaining, finding faults in others, unable to bear pains and sorrows of life, love for material world instead of the Self within, corruption, fraud, larceny and swindling, bribery, cheating, lying, plundering, stealing, fond of mental speculations and material logic, attachment to material world, deceitful nature, fearful, unceasing desire for sense objects, cynicism, hypocrisy, always wanting to control the world, always wanting to be appreciated, unceasing hunger for name and fame, love for titles and honor, divisiveness, prejudices, cruelty, bigotry, unnatural diet, indulgence in worldly pleasures, illusion, delusion, wrong identity, stupor, obstinate error, love of Maya or worldliness, crookedness, animosity, and so on. Opposite to these are the attributes of Gurmukhs (Spiritual Beings)

According to the Gurbani, a Manmukh is not a question of heredity, family of birth, ancestry, race, region, social status, caste, creed, education, titles, religion or any peculiar external appearance of a person; it is a question of lack of Naam [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]], self-evaluation, unenlightened existence, cynicism, egoism, ignorance, hypocrisy, bondage, mental delusion, body-consciousness, mistaken identity, and so on.

The [[Sikh]] scriptures have some very harsh word to say to the Manmukh. Below are several quotations from the [[Holy Text]]:
* See [http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Main&amp;S=y www.srigranth.org] for the full text of all these Shabads.

{{about|the hills|the area|Ngũ Hành Sơn District}}

'''Marble Mountains''' ({{lang-vi|Ngũ Hành Sơn}}; {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "[[ngũ hành|five elements]] mountains") is a cluster of five [[marble]] and limestone hills located in [[Ngũ Hành Sơn District]], south of [[Da Nang]] city in [[Vietnam]]. The five mountains are named after the five elements: Kim (metal), Thuy (water), Moc (wood), Hoa (fire) and Tho (earth).

All of the mountains have cave entrances and numerous tunnels, and it is possible to climb to the summit of Mount Thuy. Several Buddhist sanctuaries can also be found within the mountains, making this a tourist destination.

The area is known for stone sculpture making and stone-cutting crafts. Direct rock extraction from the mountains was banned recently. Materials are now being transported from quarries in [[Quảng Nam Province]].

{{Wide image|Marble_Mountains.jpg|1800px|View from on top of Mount Thuy|alignment=right|alt=Village as viewed from atop a mountain}}

== Vietnam War == 

The mountains were very near the American [[Marble Mountain Air Facility]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. According to [[William Broyles, Jr.]], the Marble Mountains contained a hospital for the Vietcong, probably within earshot of the American air field and [[Da Nang Beach]] (which bordered the air field on the side opposite the mountains). He describes the enemy as having been so "certain of our ignorance [...] that he had hidden his hospital in plain sight".&lt;ref&gt;William Broyles, Jr., ''Brothers In Arms'', as quoted in Morley Safer's ''Flashbacks'', St. Martin's Press / Random House, 1991, p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist and Hindu grottoes==
The Marble Mountains are home to several Buddhist and Hindu [[grotto]]es. A stairway of 156 steps leads to the summit of Thuy Son, the only Marble Mountain accessible to visitors. It allows a wide panoramic view of the surrounding area and the other marble mountains. There are a number of grottoes, including Huyen Khong and Tang Chon, and many Hindu and Buddhist sanctuaries, the temples of Tam Thai, Tu Tam and Linh Ung, and the pagoda of Pho Dong. The sanctuaries feature statues and relief depictions of religious scenes carved out of the marble.

'''Mbuti (Bambuti) mythology''' is the [[mythology]] of the African [[Mbuti]] (also known as Bambuti) [[Pygmies]] of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

The most important god of the Bambuti pantheon is [[Khonvoum]] (also Khonuum, Kmvoum, Chorum), a god of the hunt who wields a bow made from two [[snake]]s that together appear to [[human]]s as a [[rainbow]].  After [[sunset]] every day, Khonvoum gathers fragments of the [[star]]s and throws them into the sun to revitalize it for the next day.  He occasionally contacts mortals through [[Gor (mythology)|Gor]] (a thunder god who is also an elephant) or a [[chameleon]] (similar to the divine messenger used by [[Orish-nla]] of [[Yoruba mythology]]).  Khonvoum created mankind from [[clay]].  Black people were made from black clay, white people came from white clay, and the Pygmies themselves came from red clay.  He also creates the animals that are needed by hunters.

[[Arebati]] is a [[lunar deity]] and [[Sky Father]].  In some sources, he was said to have created humanity from clay, instead of Khonvoum.

[[Tore (mythology)|Tore]] is a god of the [[forest]]s who supplies animals to hunters.  He is also a thunder god who appears as a storm and hides in [[rainbow]]s.  Most importantly, Tore appears as a [[leopard]] in the initiation rites.  The first Pygmies stole fire from Tore; he chased them but could not catch them, and when he returned home, his mother had died.  As punishment, he decreed that humans would also die, and he thus became the death god.

[[Negoogunogumbar]] is a child-eating [[giant (mythology)|giant]].  [[Obrigwabibikwa]] is a [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] who can change himself into a [[reptile]].

A Mbuti [[soul]] is called a megbe. When a man dies, his son places his mouth over his to draw in part of the ''megbe''. Another part inhabits the man's totem animal. If the son does not inhale the megbe or the totem animal is later killed, it may escape into the forest, where it becomes a semi-visible being called a Lodi and lives forever with others like it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=QaEUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120 "Children of the Forest: Africa’s Mbuti Pygmies", page 120, by Kevin Duffy]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">'''Nirankar''' ({{Lang-pa|ਨਿਰੰਕਾਰ}} ) is one of the many attributes associated to God in Sikh philosophy and means ''The Formless One''. The word has its roots in {{Lang-sa|ਨਿਰਾਕਾਰਾ/निराकारा}} ''nirākārā'' and is a compound of two words "Nir" meaning Without and Akar (or Akaar), Shape or Form; hence, The Formless. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/god-in-sikhism-3|title=God in Sikhism 3|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a name for The Almighty in [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

{{Quote|text=ਸਚ ਖੰਡਿ ਵਸੈ ਨਿਰੰਕਾਰੁ ॥

सच खंडि वसै निरंकारु ॥

Sacẖ kẖand vasai nirankār.

In the realm of Truth abides the Formless Lord.|sign=SGGS. Pg 8|source=}}

"The actual meaning of "Nirankar" is Waheguru, Allah, God, and Ishbar. It describes that God is formless and omnipresent. We all are made by Nirankar. Only the name of "Religions" are different. But the supreme power is same in actual. We all are one and belongs to one Lord master(Nirankar)."

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Pirene''' or '''Peirene''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Πειρήνη means "of the osiers"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[nymph]], was either the daughter of the river god [[Asopus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4.72.1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]], Fragment 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laconia]]n king [[Oebalus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]'' fr. 258, cited in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; or the River god [[Achelous]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; depending on different sources. By [[Poseidon]] she became the mother of [[Lecheas]] and [[Cenchrias]]. When Cenchrias was unintentionally killed by [[Artemis]], Pirene's grief was so profound that she became nothing but tears and turned into the fountain outside the gates of [[Corinth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Corinthians had a small sanctuary dedicated to Pirene by the fountain where honey-cakes were offered to her to during the dry months of early summer.

The fountain was sacred to the Muses and it was there that [[Bellerophon]] found [[Pegasus]] (as [[Polyidus]] had claimed), drinking, and tamed him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], Odes Olympian 13.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qixi Festival''', also known as the '''Qiqiao Festival''', is a [[Chinese festival]] celebrating the annual meeting of [[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl|the cowherd and weaver girl]] in [[Chinese mythology|mythology]].&lt;ref name="zhao15-13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhao|2015|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brown06-72&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Brown|2006|loc=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=poon11-100/&gt;&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt; It falls on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month on the [[Chinese calendar]].&lt;ref name="zhao15-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt;&lt;ref name=poon11-100&gt;{{Harvnb|Poon|2011|loc=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|Baumann|2010|loc=912–913}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The festival originated from the romantic legend of two lovers, Zhinü and Niulang,&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt;&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt; who were the weaver girl and the cowherd, respectively. The tale of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]'' has been celebrated in the Qixi Festival since the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref name=schomp09-70&gt;{{Harvnb|Schomp|2009|loc=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest-known reference to this famous myth dates back to over 2600 years ago, which was told in a poem from the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]''.&lt;ref name=schomp09-89&gt;{{Harvnb|Schomp|2009|loc=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qixi festival inspired the [[Tanabata]] festival in [[Japan]] and [[Chilseok]] festival in [[Korea]].

The festival has variously been called the ''Double Seventh Festival'',&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt; the ''Chinese Valentine's Day'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welch|2008|loc=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Night of Sevens'',&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chester Beatty Library, [http://www.cbl.ie/china/Item.aspx?itemId=6 online].&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Magpie]] Festival''.

== Mythology ==
{{See also|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}

The general tale is a love story between Zhinü (the weaver girl, symbolizing [[Vega]]) and Niulang (the cowherd, symbolizing [[Altair]]).&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt; Their love was not allowed, thus they were banished to opposite sides of the Silver River (symbolizing the Milky Way).&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lai|1999|loc=191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a year, on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, a flock of magpies would form a bridge to reunite the lovers for one day.&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt; There are many variations of the story.&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt;

== Traditions ==
During the Han dynasty, the practices were conducted in accordance to formal ceremonial state rituals.&lt;ref name="zhao15-13"/&gt; Over time, the festival activities also included customs that the common people partook.&lt;ref name="zhao15-13"/&gt;

Girls take part in worshiping the celestials (拜仙) during rituals.&lt;ref name=poon11-100/&gt; They go to the local temple to pray to Zhinü for wisdom.&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt; Paper items are usually burned as offerings.&lt;ref name=steph91-83/&gt; Girls may recite traditional prayers for dexterity in needlework,&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kiang|1999|loc=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which symbolize the traditional talents of a good spouse.&lt;ref name=melbau10-912-3/&gt; Divination could take place to determine possible dexterity in needlework.&lt;ref name=steph91-83&gt;{{Harvnb|Stepanchuk|Wong|1991|loc=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make wishes for marrying someone who would be a good and loving husband.&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt; During the festival, girls make a display of their domestic skills.&lt;ref name=brown06-72/&gt; Traditionally, there would be contests amongst those who attempted to be the best in threading needles under low-light conditions like the glow of an ember or a half moon.&lt;ref name=steph91-83/&gt; Today, girls sometimes gather toiletries in honor of the seven maidens.&lt;ref name=steph91-83/&gt;

The festival also held an importance for newlywed couples.&lt;ref name=poon11-100/&gt; Traditionally, they would worship the celestial couple for the last time and bid farewell to them (辭仙).&lt;ref name=poon11-100/&gt; The celebration stood symbol for a happy marriage and showed that the married woman was treasured by her new family.&lt;ref name=poon11-100/&gt;

On this day, the Chinese gaze to the sky to look for [[Vega]] and [[Altair]] shining in the Milky Way, while a [[Summer Triangle|third star forms a symbolic bridge]] between the two stars.&lt;ref name=schomp09-70/&gt; It was said that if it rains on this day that it was caused by a river sweeping away the magpie bridge or that the rain is the tears of the separated couple.&lt;ref name=steph91-82&gt;{{Harvnb|Stepanchuk|Wong|1991|loc=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the legend of a flock of magpies forming a bridge to reunite the couple, a pair of magpies came to symbolize conjugal happiness and faithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welch|2008|loc=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''''sacra''''' (Latin, neuter plural, "sacred [matters]") were transactions relating to the worship of the gods, especially sacrifice and prayer. They are either ''sacra privata'' or ''publica''. The former were undertaken on behalf of the individual by himself, on behalf of the family by the [[pater familias]], or on behalf of the ''[[gens]]'' by the whole body of the people.

==Sacra privata==
The centre of the domestic service of the gods is formed by the worship of the [[Penates]] and [[Lares]]. In particular cases recourse was also had to certain specified deities. Besides this, '''private sacra''' were attached to particular families; these passed to the heir with the succession and became a burden on him. Hence an inheritance without sacra [''hereditas sine sacris''] proverbially signified an unimpaired piece of good fortune. If a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] wished to become a [[plebeian]] he had to renounce his familial sacra, his gens and his [[curia]].  As the family had sacra, so also had the gens, which had arisen out of the family by expansion. These were performed by a sacrificial priest [[flamen]] appointed from among the gentiles, the celebration taking place in his own house or in a special [[sacellum]] in the presence of the assembled gentiles.

Sacra Privata typically takes place within the family.  An individual might perform sacra at any time and whenever they thought it necessary; but if he vowed such sacra before the [[pontiffs]] and wished that they should be continued after his death, his heirs inherited with his property the obligation to perform them, and the pontiffs had to watch that they were performed duly and at their proper time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rüpke|first=Jörg|title=A Companion to Roman Religion|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/book.html?id=g9781405129435_9781405129435|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though Sacra could take place at any time, however, the devout Roman prayed and made a sacrifice typically during meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmitz|first=Leonhard|title=Sacra|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Sacra.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The usual time was between dinner and dessert. When possible, a pig was sacrificed. Proper ceremonies accompanied all family occasions from birth to death, even when the gods were no longer popular. The [[gens]] of families had special rites, sacra. It must be maintained for the welfare of the clan and State.  If not, it was believed that gods will become displeased with the [[pater familias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Religion|url=http://www.classicsunveiled.com/romel/html/religion.html|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In return, their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant [[Lemures]], might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.

For [http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/sacrifice.html home sacrifices], citizens would usually use foods instead of animals because they were less messy.&lt;ref name="Prayer and Sacifice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prayer and Sacifice|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/sacrifice.html|publisher=The Roman Empire|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was not unheard of.  Many families would use small animals for their blood sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Rüpke 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rüpke|first=Jörg|title=A Companion to Roman Religion|year=2011|publisher=Malden: Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some foods that they would use were wine, cheese, fruits, milk,&lt;ref name="Prayer and Sacifice"/&gt; honey cakes, honeycombs, and grapes.  Families would also use incense, fire, or wreaths if they wanted a sacrifice that was more permanent.&lt;ref name="Rüpke 2011"/&gt;  Romans would use sacrifices that represented life.&lt;ref name="Prayer and Sacifice"/&gt;  If their ancestors became angry, they would placate them with an offering of black beans and spring water at midnight.

[[Lares]], a household protector, was housed in a shrine along with the penates and favorite gods or goddesses.  In the homes of the lower class, the shrines were set in wall-niches with a basic painted background, whereas the upper class, built their shrines in the servants quarters.  This kept the focus on religion instead of making it a public showing.

==Sacra publica==
The sacra publica were undertaken pro populo, i.e., collectively, (1) by the curia, pagi, or vici, into which the community was divided, whence such sacrifices were called sacra popularia; or (2) by the individual gentes and societies, i.e., the sodalitas, to which the superintendence of a particular cult had been committed by the State; or (3) by the magistrates and priests of the [[Roman State]]. The sacra of the gentes were with few exceptions performed in public, though the multitude present remained silent spectators; only in a few cases they took part in the procession to the place of worship or in the sacrificial feast.

The public religious practices of Ancient Rome served multiple purposes due to the nature of its religion.  In ancient Rome, religion and the affairs of the state were closely intertwined so that the state religion was a mode of political power.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;Gordon, Richard. "The Veil of Power." Paul and Empire Religion and Power in Roman Imperial society. 	Ed. Richard A. Horsley. Harrisburg: Trinity Press International, 1997. 126. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious [[rituals]] and festivals were often held in order to calm and distract the people. This can be seen through the establishment of the Apollinares around the time of the [[Second Punic War]].&lt;ref name=Scullard&gt;Scullard, H. H. Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981. Print&lt;/ref&gt; These public affairs were meant to honor the gods by either consisting of sporting competitions, such as the Apollinares, or religious rituals.  When these rituals consisted of sacrifice, they were controlled by the Emperor and the Elites&lt;ref name=Angus&gt;Angus, S. The Religious Quests of the Graeco-Roman World. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct practice of rituals, or [[orthopraxy|orthopraxis]] was essential to currying favor of the gods.&lt;ref name=Schied&gt;Schied, J. (2008) "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in A Companion to Roman Religion (ed J. Rüpke), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. doi: 10.1002/9780470690970.ch19&lt;/ref&gt; Public ceremonies were presided over by some sort of authority from the higher [[social class in ancient Rome|social class]] over public affairs, and in some rare cases specifically women.&lt;ref name=Schied /&gt; The presider would begin the ceremony at the start of the day and bathe himself or herself thoroughly beforehand. Any civilians in attendance would wear togas with a hood over their heads while the presider was bareheaded, often with a laurel wreath on his head for distinction.&lt;ref name=Schied /&gt; In live sacrifices, only domestic [[animals|religion in ancient Rome]] were used. These animals were cleaned and often decorated with ribbons or garlands with colors dependent on the god or goddess for whom they were intended.&lt;ref name=Faraone&gt;Faraone, Christopher A., and F. S. Naiden. "Greek and Roman Animal Sacrifice: Ancient Victims, Modern Observers." University of Iowa Libraries. Cambridge University Press, 2012. Web. 19 Nov. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans would also use fruit and grains in public ceremonies as well as libations or drinks.&lt;ref name=Faraone /&gt; These inanimate sacrifices were not less significant than live animal sacrifices, but rather they all served different purposes and went to different [[religion in ancient Rome|deities]].

[[File:Novices meditating.jpg|thumb|Śrāmaṇeras in Thailand]]
[[File:Chogye Buddhist monks.jpg|thumb|Śrāmaṇeras from the tradition of [[Korean Buddhism]]]]
A '''sāmaṇera''' ([[Pali]]); [[Sanskrit]] ''śrāmaṇera'', is a novice male monastic in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumedho|first=Ajahn|authorlink=Ajahn Sumedho|title=Peace is a Simple Step|url=https://www.abhayagiri.org/media/books/Ajahn%20Sumedho%20Volume%201%20-%20Peace%20is%20a%20Simple%20Step.pdf|publisher=Amaravati Publications|year=2014|page=36|ISBN=978-1-78432-000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female novice is a ''śrāmaṇerī'' or ''śrāmaṇerikā'' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pāli]]: ''sāmaṇerī'').

== Etymology ==
The ''sāmaṇera'' is a Pali language diminutive of the Sanskrit term ''śrāmaṇa'' "strenuous", which indicates an [[asceticism|ascetic practitioner]]. Therefore, sāmaṇera might be said to mean "small or young [[asceticism|renunciate]]". In some South and Southeast Asian Buddhist traditions, the term refers to someone who has taken the initial [[pabbajja|pravrajya]] vows but not the [[upasampada]] or full ordination. The [[prātimokṣa]] rules do not apply to them and they do not take part in the recital of the rules on [[uposatha]] days.

The word ''śrāmaṇerī'' is the feminine form of ''śrāmaṇera''.

== History ==
The account provided in the literature of South Asian Buddhism (and adopted by other Buddhist sects) is that when [[Gautama Buddha]]'s son [[Rāhula]] was seven years old, he followed the Buddha, saying "Give me my inheritance." The Buddha called [[Sariputta]] and asked him to ordain Rāhula, who became the first sāmaṇera.{{quote|The King ([[Śuddhodana|Suddhodana]]), discovering that now his grandson and a number of young men in the royal family had requested ordination, asked the Buddha only to ordain a minor with the consent of his parents or guardian. The Buddha assented. This rule was expanded to include the spouses of those intending to join the Order of monks and nuns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/arty/his-life/home.htm |title=Wall paintings ·· coming home, see section Buddha's son |publisher=buddhamind.info |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Overview ==
{{Main|Vinaya}}
[[File:Novices sweeping.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Thai novices sweeping temple grounds.]]
In the Vinaya (monastic regulations) used by many South Asian Buddhist sects, a man under the age of 20 cannot ordain as a bhikṣu (monk) but can ordain as a sāmaṇera. Sāmaṇeras (and sāmaṇerīs&amp;nbsp;– the equivalent term for girls) keep the Ten Precepts as their code of behaviour and devote themselves to the religious life during breaks from secular schooling, or in conjunction with it if devoted to formal ordination. In other cultures and Buddhist traditions (particularly North East Asia, and those in the West that derive from these lineages), monks take different sets of vows, and follow different customary rules.

The Ten Precepts upheld by sāmaṇeras are:
#Refrain from killing living things.
#Refrain from stealing.
#Refrain from unchastity (sensuality, sexuality, lust).
#Refrain from lying.
#Refrain from taking intoxicants.
#Refrain from taking food at inappropriate times (after noon).
#Refrain from singing, dancing, playing music or attending entertainment programs (performances).
#Refrain from wearing perfume, cosmetics and [[garland]] (decorative accessories).
#Refrain from sitting on high chairs and sleeping on luxurious, soft beds.
#Refrain from accepting money.

Ordination differs between sāmaṇeras and srāmaṇerīs.

== Transition to full ordination ==
After a year or at the age of 20, a sāmaṇera will be considered for the [[upasampada]] or higher ordination as a bhikṣu. Some monasteries will require people who want to ordain as a monk to be a novice for a set period of time, as a period of preparation and familiarization. Adults would normally wear the white robes of a [[Brahmin]].

{{peoplepalicanon}}

== Ordination of women ==
{{main|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}
A woman is to be ordained, according to the traditional [[vinaya]]s, by both a monk and a nun, first as a śrāmaṇerī. Śrāmaṇeras and śrāmaṇerīs keep the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]] as their code of behaviour, and are devoted to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious life during a break from secular schooling, or in conjunction with it if devoted to formal ordination.

After a year or at the age of 20, she will be ordained as a full [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] (Pali: ''bhikkhunī'').

Note that Scholem says he was "probably" born in Cairo, whereas the original source article in the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' stated that he "probably" died in Constantinople. Here we have kept the two places not qualified otherwise as "probable" for the respective places of birth and death.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primo was one of the earliest followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], the self-proclaimed Jewish messiah. Primo became Zevi's private secretary on Zevi's journey from Jerusalem to [[Smyrna]] in 1665, cleverly managing to give to the advent of the pseudo-[[Messiah]] an air of dignity. From Smyrna, Primo spread the news among foreign [[Jews]] that the Messiah had actually appeared. With certain of his confidants he was the first to plan the abolition of [[rabbinic]] Judaism. In the name of Zevi, Primo sent a circular to the Jews (December 1665) advising the abolition of the fast-day of the tenth of the tenth day of the month of [[Ṭebet]] on the [[Hebrew calendar]].

In February, 1666, Primo accompanied Zevi to [[Constantinople]]. After Zevi converted to [[Islam]], Primo explained this apparent [[apostasy]] as having been foreordained in the Messianic role. Concerning the rest of his life not much is known.

The '''Harmonious Church of the Three-in-One''' (三一教协会{{efn|三一教协会 ''Sānyī jiào xiéhuì'', translated as "Harmonious Church of the Three-in-One", "Harmonious Church of the Three-One" and "Harmonious Church of the Trinity".}}), or '''Sanyiism''' (三一教{{efn|三一教 ''Sānyī jiào''}}) and '''Xiaism''' (夏教{{efn|夏教 ''Xià jiào'', literally the "Summertime Transmission"}}), is a [[Chinese folk religious sect]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] character founded in the 16th century by Lin Zhao'en, in [[Putian]].&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 343"&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was officially recognised by the government of [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"&gt;China Zentrum: ''[http://www.china-zentrum.de/fileadmin/redaktion/RCTC_2014-1_Complete_Issue.pdf Religions &amp; Christianity in Today's China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502142724/http://www.china-zentrum.de/fileadmin/redaktion/RCTC_2014-1_Complete_Issue.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}''. Vol. IV, 2014, No. 1. {{ISSN|2192-9289}}. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion is based on Confucian moral ideas and [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestral worship]], and includes meditation techniques modeled after ''[[neidan]]'' and pursuit of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 343"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"&gt;Edward L. Davis. ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture''. ¶ [http://contemporary_chinese_culture.academic.ru/670/Sanyi_jiao Sanyi jiao]&lt;/ref&gt; Differently from other Chinese folk religious sects, the Sanyi philosophy is not expounded in the sentimental vernacular language but in the elaborate language of the Confucian literary tradition.&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 343"/&gt; The "Three in One" is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept expressing the original trinity proceeding from the [[Tao]], the two principles, [[yin and yang]], of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Great Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 1998. pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Pole is the One that contains yin and yang, the Two, in the Three.

==History==
Sanyiism was founded by Lin Zhao'en (1517–98), in [[Putian]], [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt; Lin was born in an upper-class family, and among his ancestors and relatives were many officials and scholars. He started the usual career for the son of an influential family and passed the first civil examinations in 1534, but after failing the higher exams he forsook the career of an official to become a master of religion and philosophy according to the Confucian tradition.&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 343"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Given this background, Lin Zhao'en doctrines show little influence from the vernacular folk religious tradition of the ''[[baojuan]]'' literature.&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 343"/&gt;

Lin Zhao'en was instructed by other religious leaders, including a Confucian who taught him the true meaning of the Confucian classics and Taoists from whom he learnt ''[[neidan]]'' techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. pp. 346-347&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1585 the regional official Yang Sizhi wrote a proclamation of heterodoxy against Lin, upset by his claim to be the true interpreter of the Confucian tradition, rejecting [[Zhu Xi]], and to continue the teachings of the sages of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. pp. 350-351&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the accusation of heterodoxy, the strength of the sect remained unshaken.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. pp. 352-353&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sanyi holy scriptures Lin Zhao'en is portrayed as a supernatural savior of cosmic significance.&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 356"&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; After Lin died, he was deified as the "Lord of the Three-in-One", and is worshipped in over a thousand temples in Fujian, and also in [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asia]]'s Chinese communities.&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt;

The religious community split into a number of schools and spread beyond the borders of Fujian up to [[Anhui]], and then reaching [[Beijing]]. The community in [[Nanjing]] developed as an influential centre of gravitation for the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. pp. 353-354&lt;/ref&gt; In Fujian, the religion developed into two major competing branches led by two direct disciples of Master Lin, namely Lu Wenhui and Lin Zhenming (alias Lin Zhijing).&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 356"/&gt; Through the Qing dynasty the religion survived strong in Fujian but declined elsewhere, and at the end of the 19th century it started to strongly revive.&lt;ref name="Seiwert, 2003. p. 356"/&gt;

As of 1998 the Church of the Three-in-One had approximately 500,000 adherents in Putian, which is 17% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 1998. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was officially recognised as a legal religion by the government of Fujian.&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"/&gt;

==Rituals==
Three-in-One practices include the "heart method" of self-cultivation, which is still widely practised in Putian today.&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt; The religion has its independent ritual tradition, similar to those of Taoism and Buddhism. Its ritual specialists perform communal offerings (''jiao'') and funeral services (''gongde''), along with individual rites.&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt;

In some communities in the Putian region, the Sanyi temple has become the primary village temple, centre of collective life.&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt; Annual pilgrimages are made to the religion's central temple in Putian, Fujian.&lt;ref name="Davis-Sanyi"/&gt;

'''Shirley Shaker Village''' is a historic former [[Shaker]] community in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Shirley, Massachusetts]]. Defined as an [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]], it includes about half of the original buildings and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Shirley Shaker Village began in 1793. Hundreds of acres of land was donated by John Warren, Elijah and Ivory Wildes, and Nathan Willard near their properties. At its peak there were 26 buildings; Now there are 13. Within the community there were the North, South and Church families. By 1853 there were 150 believers, or members, and the community continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/shaker/shi.htm ''Shirley Shaker Village''], National Park Service. Retrieved March 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The buildings were first made of clapboard and painted yellow and white. After the 1840s and the founding of a brick factory nearby, new buildings were constructed of brick. The brick administration building was styled similarly to one at the [[Canterbury Shaker Village]] in New Hampshire. The interiors of the buildings were described by [[William Dean Howells]] in 1875 as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the unpapered walls, the scrubbed floors hidden only by rugs and strips of carpeting, and the plain flat finish of the wood-work. Each chamber accommodates two brothers or sisters, and is appointed with two beds, two rocking chairs, two wash stands, and a wood stove with abundance of rugs. There were few tokens of personal taste in the arrangements of the rooms."&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Shakers earned income by producing and selling jellies, applesauce, herbs, mops and brooms. When the community dwindled and they were no longer able to be self-supporting, in 1908 "believers" moved to the [[Hancock Shaker Village]].&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;

The state purchased the property in 1909 and adapted it for use as an "[[industrial school]]" for troubled and delinquent boys. Extensive changes were made to the property, resulting in the movement, alteration, and demolition of buildings.

In 1971 the school was closed. New construction was done on site and the total facility was converted into the [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Shirley|Massachusetts Correctional Institution]] complex. A [[historic district (United States)|historic district]], encompassing the Shaker-related resources on more than {{convert|700|acre|ha}} of land in Shirley and Lancaster, was defined and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=MACRIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=LAN.F|title=MACRIS inventory record for Shirley Shaker Village|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shirley Historical Society arranges periodic tours of the former Shirley Shaker Village.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;

Several other Shaker village sites operate today as museums. A similar community was founded in nearby [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]]. The meetinghouse of Shirley Shaker Village was moved in 1962 to [[Hancock Shaker Village]] in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]] to replace an identical one which burned and then was razed in 1938.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Today, only one "society" remains in the control of the last Shakers, located at Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in [[New Gloucester, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/september-17-2010/the-shakers/7026/ The Shakers] Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly, September 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/the-last-of-the-shakers The last of the Shakers] Busted Halo, April 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lauber"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.independentpub.com/story.asp?pubId=wi&amp;artId=1260283348 | title = Jeannine Lauber: Exploring the Modern Day Shakers | author = Ouimet, Leanne | date = 2009-12-08 | accessdate = 2009-12-16 | work = The Independent | location = UK | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120223142845/http://www.independentpub.com/story.asp?pubId=wi&amp;artId=1260283348 | archivedate = 2012-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Atlanta Jewish Times''''' is a weekly community [[newspaper]] serving the [[Jew]]ish community of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[United States]].  Its owner and publisher is Michael Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/contact/|title=Contact Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Atlanta Jewish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The newspaper began publishing as the ''Southern Israelite'' in 1925. In the 1980s, it was purchased by Charles "Chuck" Buerger, the owner of the ''[[Baltimore Jewish Times]]''. Buerger died in 1996, and the paper was taken over by his son, Andrew.

In 2000, Andrew Buerger sold the paper, along with ''[[The Detroit Jewish News]]'', to Jewish Renaissance Media (JRM), which also operated the website Jewish.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2000/02/07/daily16.html|title=Jewish Times owner sells two newspapers|last=|first=|date=2000-02-11|website=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, it claimed a readership of 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jtonline.us/main.asp?SectionID=7&amp;SubSectionID=26&amp;ArticleID=27 About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205170509/http://jtonline.us/main.asp?SectionID=7 |date=2010-12-05 }}, Atlanta JTonline (''The Atlanta Jewish Times'' website), 2005-10-18. Retrieved July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Arthur M. Horwitz of Jewish Renaissance Media was the publisher and Michael Jacobs the [[Editing#Periodicals|Managing Editor]]. When Jacobs left the paper in 2008, Ann Marie Quill was then promoted to managing editor.

On April 14, 2009, Andrew B. Adler (Metro Jewish News) acquired ''The Atlanta Jewish Times'', with a staff of five and a subscribership of only 3,500. After his takeover the website jtonline.us ceased to be updated.

In late October 2009, ''The Atlanta Jewish Times'' moved to a new office, though still in the Dunwoody area. As of the end of that month, the paper's staff had expanded to 10, with new employees taken on for sports coverage and advertising coordination.

In January 2012 Adler wrote a column stating that one option for Israel to defend itself against [[Iran]] would be to have U.S.-based [[Mossad]] agents "take out" an "unfriendly" president. Mainstream Jewish organizations denounced the column, which was read as referring to an assassination of [[Barack Obama]]. Adler subsequently apologized and resigned as editor, and announced he was looking for a buyer for the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/23/news-opinion/united-states/atlanta-jewish-times-publisher-resigns-over-obama-assassination-column|title=Atlanta Jewish Times publisher resigns over Obama assassination column|last=|first=|date=2012-01-23|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/editor-who-suggested-mossad-murder-obama-quits/article2312325/|title=Editor who suggested Mossad murder Obama quits|last=Koring|first=Paul|date=2012-01-23|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Atlanta-Jewish-newspaper-calls-for-Obama-assassination|title=Atlanta Jewish newspaper calls for Obama assassination|last=Shefler|first=Gil|date=2012-01-22|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the paper was purchased by Cliff Weiss and the office was moved to Sandy Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/03/12/news-opinion/the-telegraph/zadok-publishing-buys-atlanta-jewish-times|title=Zadok Publishing buys Atlanta Jewish Times|last=|first=|date=2012-03-12|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Morris purchased the paper from Weiss in December, 2014 and re-hired Michael Jacobs as Editor. The newspaper currently prints 15,000 copies per week and distributes them at more than 320 locations across Metro Atlanta.

The '''US Conference of Chaplains''' is made up of [[Chaplains]] and Chaplain Assistants (clergy and laity) forming Ministry Teams in their local communities. The motto "fide et operibus" – is representative of the mission and vision of the USCoC – which in English is "by faith and works". Whether the focus of the individual ministry is corporate, prison, emergency services, nursing home, veterans, campus, hospital, fraternal, disaster preparedness, active military and reservists, sports, hospice or the streets – members keep their minds alert and their hearts tender to the opportunities to be of service which present themselves every day.

The Conference is not affiliated with any branch of the [[armed services]] nor endorsed by the [[federal government]].  They are managed by a [[board of directors]] with the collective goal of being the premier organization for Chaplain training.  The USCoC is also intended to serve as a covering for individual efforts which may want to include uniformed ministry.  Formed in 2011, they are headquartered in [[Phelan, CA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20672">The history or legend of the '''witches of [[Benevento]]''' is [[folklore]] dating from at least the 13th century.  Its dissemination is one reason for the fame of this [[Samnites|Samnite]] city. The popular belief{{mdash}}that Benevento would be the Italian witches' gathering place{{mdash}}has abundant implications, blurring the border between reality and imagination. Various writers, musicians, and artists have drawn inspiration from or referred to it.

==Birth of the legend==

Many hypotheses on the birth of the witches' legend exist.  It has probably been the synergy of several elements that gave Benevento lasting fame as the "city of witches."

===The cult of Isis===
For a brief period during Roman times, the cult of [[Isis]], Egyptian goddess of the moon, proliferated in Benevento; also, the emperor [[Domitian]] had a temple erected in her honor.

Within this cult Isis was part of a sort of [[Trimurti]]: she became identified with [[Hecate]], goddess of the underworld, and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the hunt. These deities were also connected with magic.

The cult of Isis probably stands on the basis of some elements of [[paganism]] that survived in succeeding centuries: the characteristics of some witches can be connected with those of Hecate, and the same term used for witches in Benevento, ''janara'', arguably could be derived from the name of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=In the past, even before the belief in witches, it was said that on certain days of the year the peasants and shepherds would gather in sacred places handed down from their ancestors, like the [[Irpinian dialect|Avellinese]] ''preta r' 'e 'gghianare'', a designation that goes back to "''dianara''," meaning 'follower of or possessed by Diana'. And therefore it was in the places of the sacred [[baetyl]], where the fertility rituals were conducted, that the ''janara'' came to be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lombardic rituals===
The chief physician of Benevento, Pietro Piperno, in his essay ''On the Superstitious Walnut Tree of Benevento'' (1639, translated from his original Latin ''De Nuce Maga Beneventana''), traced the roots of the witch legend back to the seventh century. At that time Benevento was the capital of a [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Duchy of Benevento|duchy]]. The invaders, although formally converted to Catholicism, did not renounce their traditional pagan religion. Under [[Romuald I of Benevento|Duke Romuald I]] they worshiped a golden viper (perhaps winged, or with two heads), which probably had some connection with the cult of Isis, since the goddess was able to control serpents. They began to develop a singular rite near the [[Sabato river]], which the Lombards celebrated in honor of [[Wotan]], father of the gods: the hide of a goat was hung on a [[sacred tree]]. The warriors earned the favor of the god by rushing frantically around the tree on horseback and striking the hide with their lances, with the intent of tearing off shreds, which they then ate. In this ritual can be recognized the practice of ''[[sparagmos|diasparagmos]]'', the god sacrificed and torn to pieces, which became the ritual meal of the devotees.

The Christians of Benevento would have connected these frenzied rites with their already-existing beliefs about witches: in their eyes the women and the warriors were witches, the goat was the incarnation of the Devil, and the cries were orgiastic rites.

A priest named [[Saint Barbatus of Benevento]] outright accused the Lombard rulers of idolatry. According to the legend, when Benevento was besieged by forces of the Byzantine emperor [[Constans II]] in 663, Duke Romuald promised Barbatus to renounce paganism if the city—and the duchy—were saved. Constans withdrew (according to the legend, by divine grace), and Romuald made Barbatus the bishop of Benevento.

Saint Barbatus cut down the sacred tree and tore out its roots, and on that spot he had a church built, called Santa Maria in Voto. Romuald continued to worship the golden viper in private, until his wife Teodorada handed it over to St. Barbatus, who melted it down to make a [[chalice]] for the [[Eucharist]].

This legend is incompatible with the historical facts. In 663 the duke of Benevento was [[Grimoald II of Benevento|Grimoald]], while [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald I]] would not succeed his predecessor until 671, having become [[King of the Lombards]] in the meantime;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rovagnati|first1=Sergio|title=I Longobardi|year=2003|publisher=Xenia|location=Milan|isbn=8872734843|page=115|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, Romualdo's wife was named Theuderada—not Teodorada, who was instead the wife of [[Ansprand]] and mother of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diaconus|first1=Paulus |authorlink1=Paul the Deacon|title=[[Historia Langobardorum]]|chapter=Liber V, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, [[Paul the Deacon]] neither mentioned the legend, nor the presumed pagan faith of Romuald, who was much more likely to have been an [[Arian]] like his father Grimoald.

The meetings under the walnut tree, one of the main features of the witch legend, therefore very probably came from these Lombard customs; nevertheless, they are also found in the practices of the [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] of [[Artemis]] (the Greek goddess who can in part be assimilated to Isis), carried out in the Anatolian region of [[Caria]].

===Christianity===
The first centuries of the diffusion of Christianity were characterized by a harsh battle against the pagan, rural, and traditional culti. The basic principle is that any cultus which is not oriented toward the one God is, by elimination, subservience to the Devil. This explains the demonization of rituals like those of the Lombard women in Benevento, who became "witches" in a wider sense with regard to how they were understood by popular culture. Originally, in effect, the potential wickedness of these women was not in the context of a religious sense; Christianity depicted them as women who had made a pact with the Devil, and as a sort of opposite to [[the Madonna]], dedicated to orgiastic rites and bearers of infertility.

==The legend==
{{main|Witchcraft in Italy}}
In the following centuries the legend of the witches took form. Beginning in 1273 reports of witches' gatherings began to circulate in Benevento. Based on the statements of [[Matteuccia de Francesco|Matteuccia da Todi]], who was put on trial for witchcraft in 1428, they took place under a [[Juglans regia|walnut tree]], and it was believed that it was the tree that had been cut down by Barbatus, perhaps restored by the work of the Devil or, rather, replanted by the witches from seed.{{efn-ua|"The Witches replanted the walnut tree from seed, and legend says it still stands in Benevento."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimassi|first1=Raven|authorlink1=Raven Grimassi|title=Italian Witchcraft: The Old Religion of Southern Europe|date=2000|publisher=Llewellyn|location=St. Paul|isbn=1567182593|page=11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later, in the 16th century, bones with the flesh recently stripped off were found under a tree; an aura of mystery was created around the matter, gradually becoming more complex.

===The walnut tree===
According to the testimony of the presumed witches, the walnut must have been a tall tree, ever green, and of a "noxious nature".{{efn-ua|The description of the walnut tree as "noxious" arose from a medieval [[folk etymology]]: Italian ''noce'' 'walnut' was confused with Latin ''[[wikt:noceo|nocere]]'' 'to harm', origin of the word "noxious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=Richard M.|title=Encyclopedia of witchcraft: The Western tradition, Volume 1|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781576072431|page=109|url=http://www.paoloportone.it/flyer/benevento.htm|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There are various hypotheses about the location of the Riverbank of the ''Janara''s, the place on the bank of the Sabato where the walnut tree would be found. The legend does not rule out that there could have been more than one. Pietro Piperno, intending to prove the rumor to be false, included in his essay a map that indicated a possible positioning of several walnut tees.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;The reborn walnut tree of St. Barbatus, as well as of the Lombard golden viper, in the lands of the nobleman Francesco di Gennaro, where an inscription was posted to commemorate the work of the saint.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions have the walnut tree located in a gorge called the Strait of Barba, in [[Ceppaloni]] on the road to [[Avellino]], where there was a grove flanked by an abandoned church, or in another location called Plain of the Chapels. Even the vanished Pagan Tower is spoken of, on which was built a chapel to St. Nicholas where the saint had worked numerous miracles.

There were several nut trees forming a circular shape near what is now the [[:it:Stazione di Benevento Porta Rufina|Porta Rufina Station]], just at the outskirts of the city, where witches would dance and chant: "To the nut tree of Benevento, over the water, over the wind."

==The sabbats and evil spells==
{{more footnotes|date=October 2014}}
'''Nguento, 'nguento,''&lt;br&gt;
''mànname a lu nocio 'e Beneviento'',&lt;br&gt;
''sott'a ll'acqua e sotto ô viento,''&lt;br&gt;
''sotto â ogne maletiempo.''

Unguent, unguent,&lt;br&gt;
Carry me to the walnut tree of Benevento,&lt;br&gt;
Above the water and above the wind,&lt;br&gt;
And above all other bad weather.

(Magic spell that many women accused of [[Stregheria|witchcraft]] recounted during the trials.)

The legend has it that the witches, indistinguishable from the other women by day, at night anointed their underarms (or their breasts) with an [[flying ointment|unguent]] and took off flying, pronouncing a magic phrase (recounted above), riding on brooms of sorghum. At the same time the witches became incorporeal, spirits like the wind; indeed, their preferred nights for flying were stormy ones. In particular, it was further believed that there was a bridge from which the witches of Benevento usually launched themselves into flight, which was therefore called the "bridge of the ''jannara''s," destroyed during World War II. At night they stole horses out of their stables and after plaiting the horses' hair they would race the horse until it started to foam around the mouth; they would then rub themselves with it.

Witches of various origins participated in the [[witches' sabbat|sabbats]] under the walnut tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Jeffrey Burton|authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell|title=Witchcraft in the Middle Ages|date=1972|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0801406978|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;vq=Benevento&amp;pg=PA74#v=snippet&amp;q=Benevento&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sabbats consisted of banquets, dances, and orgies with spirits and demons in the form of cats or goats, and they also came to be called the "games of Diana."

After the gatherings the witches spread horror. It was believed that they were able to cause abortions, to generate deformities in newborns, making them suffer dreadful afflictions, which brushed against sleepers like a gust of wind and caused a sense of oppression on the chest, which at times was felt while they lay on their backs. Also feared were certain more "innocent" pranks, which, for example, would make the horses be found in their stables in the morning with their manes braided, or sweating from having been ridden all night. In some small [[Campania]]n villages, rumors circulated among the elderly that they kidnapped newborns from their cradles in order to be passed among them, throwing them on the fire, and finishing the game by bringing them back to where they had taken them from.

The ''janara''s, because of their incorporeal consistency, entered a house by passing under the door (corresponding with another possible etymology of the term: ''[[wikt:ianua|ianua]]'', 'door'. For this reason a broom or some salt was usually left on the threshold; the witch would have to count all the fibers of the broom or grains of salt before entering, but in the meantime the day would arrive and they would be compelled to go away. The two objects have a symbolic value: the broom is a phallic symbol opposed to the sterility brought by the witch; the salt was connected through a false etymology to ''[[wikt:salus#Latin|salus]]'' ('safety').

If someone was harassed by a ''janara'', they freed themselves from her by shouting behind her "Come get the salt on Sunday!" If ''janara''s were mentioned in a conversation, the ill omen was warded off with the sentence "Today is Saturday."

==The other witches of Benevento==
Besides the ''janara''s, there were other types of witches in the popular imagination of Benevento. The ''zucculara'' ('lame person') haunted Triggio, the medieval Lombard quarter, the area of the [[Roman Theatre, Benevento|Roman Theater]], and she was called that because of her noisy clogs. The figure probably derives from Hecate, who wore only one sandal and was venerated at the crossroads (the name ''Triggio'' derives from ''[[wikt:trivium#Latin|trivium]]'', 'crossroads').

There is also the ''manalonga'', 'the one with the long arm', who lives in wells and pulls down passersby in the vicinity. The fear of pits, imagined to be the passageways to hell, is a recurring element: in the cliff under the Bridge of the ''Janara''s there is a pool in which whirlpools are suddenly formed, which is called "the whirlpool of hell." Finally, there are the ''uria''s, domestic spirits who recall the [[lares]] and [[penates]] of Roman times.

In popular beliefs the legend of the witches still survives in part today, enhanced by anecdotes and manifested in superstitious attitudes and fear of supernatural events.

==Persecution==
The persecutions of the purported witches may be considered to have begun with the preaching of [[Saint Bernardino of Siena]], who preached harshly against them in the 15th century, referring in particular to those of Benevento. He denounced them to the people as responsible for disasters and bluntly asserted that they must be exterminated.

A final incentive to [[witch hunting]] came from the publication of ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' in 1486, which explained how to recognize witches and how to try them effectively and interrogate them using the cruelest tortures. From the 15th to the 17th centuries, many confessions were coerced from supposed witches in this way, who often spoke of sabbats in Benevento. Common elements turned up, such as flight or practices like that of sucking children's blood; however, discrepancies also turned up about, for example the frequency of their meetings. In the great majority of cases the "witches" were burned, sent to the gallows, or otherwise given the death penalty, with more or less atrocious methods.

Only in the 17th century was it realized that truthful confessions could not be made under torture. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] a rational interpretation of the legend came to prevail with [[Girolamo Tartarotti]], who in 1749 explained the witches' flight as a hallucination provoked by the Devil, or [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]], who in 1745 asserted that the witches were only psychologically ill women. Successive hypotheses held that the [[flying ointment|unguent]] the witches were anointed with was a [[hallucinogenic]] substance.

A local historian, Abele De Blasio, reported that in the archepiscopal archive of Benevento were kept the records of about two hundred trials for witchcraft, largely destroyed in 1860 to avoid saving documents that could further inflame the [[anti-clericalism#Italy|anticlerical]] tendencies that accompanied the era of [[Italian unification]]. Another part was lost because of the bombardments in World War II.

==Narratives==
Like all popular beliefs, the legend of the witches is fueled by a large number of popularly spread tales.

* A man, seeing his wife anoint herself with an unguent and take off flying out the window, realized that she was a ''janara''. He replaced the unguent with another substance, so the next night his wife died crashing into the ground.
* Saint Bernardino of Siena in his preaching told of the family of a cardinal who, having arrived in Benevento, joined a nighttime banquet, and brought with him a girl he knew, who had not spoken for three years; later it was discovered that she was a ''janara''.
* A tale possibly deriving from a Neapolitan poem of the 19th century titled ''Story of the Famous Walnut Tree of Benevento'' tells of a man who has his wife, a janara, take him to the sabbat. He asks for salt because the food is insipid, but as soon as he salts his food the sabbat disappears.

==Cultural influence==

Italian and foreign poets and writers, as well as musicians and others, relate tales of the witches, taking inspiration from the Benevento legend.

* The scientist and author Francesco Redi wrote a tale, titled "The Hunchback of Peretola," in which he narrates the story of a local [[hunchback]]{{mdash}}who was envious of another hunchback's good fortune in meeting the witches of Benevento to heal his deformity{{mdash}}headed there without delay, but, having treated the witches badly, was instead punished with the addition of a second hump.
* In the mock-heroic epic ''Il Malmantile Racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]], the 30th canto is about witches.
* The ballet ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Il Noce di Benevento|ru|3=Орех Беневенто|lt=Il Noce di Benevento|vertical-align=sup}}'' by [[Salvatore Viganò]] and [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr]] ([[La Scala]], April 25, 1812) is about the witches' sabbat there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Il Noce di Benevento|journal=The Parthenon|date=December 1825|issue=15|pages=363–364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osNPAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA365&amp;ots=T2uk2eq9Cx&amp;dq=parthenon%20benevento&amp;pg=PA365#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Niccolò Paganini]] composed the violin piece ''Le Streghe'' as variations on a theme from Süssmayr's ballet score (premiered at La Scala, October 29, 1813).
* In turn, Paganini's variations inspired the witchery in the second act of the ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (premiered at the [[Paris Opéra]], 1832).
* Laurence Stern's novel ''[[Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' repeatedly mentions the "demons of Benevento."
* The musical ''Il Santo e la Strega'' by Antonio Coppolaro is about the deeds of Saint Barbato, who defeated the witches of Benevento and eliminated the walnut tree.
* [[Strega (liqueur)|Strega]] liqueur is made in Benevento and takes its name from the legend of the ''streghe'' there. Its label depicts the ''streghe'' dancing under the famous walnut tree.
* [[Benevento Calcio]] is a football club in Benevento; its club logo features a witch riding a broomstick.

'''Wodziwob'''  (died c. 1872) was a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[prophet]] who performed the first [[Ghost Dance]] rituals around 1869.

In 1869 Wodziwob, a [[shaman]] or [[medicine-man]] in the [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]] Valley of [[Nevada]], had a series of visions while on a mountain. The first vision proclaimed that "within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake... [during which] the improvements of the whites-all their houses, their goods, stores, etc.-would remain, but the whites would be swallowed up, while the Indians would be saved and permitted to enjoy the earth and all the fullness thereof, including anything left by the wicked whites".&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James ''The Ghost Dance Religion and Wounded Knee''. 1896. Reprint (London; Constable and Company, Ltd, 1973) 702&lt;/ref&gt; This selective earthquake was met with skepticism, so after a second trip to the mountain, Wodziwob received a new prophecy that stated that all peoples would be swallowed by the earthquakes, and after a few days the Native Americans would return to a paradisiacal world while the whites would be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James 1896, 702&lt;/ref&gt; As the time period began to pass, many became disenchanted with Wodziwob's prophecies. This prompted him to make a third trip to the mountain, where it was revealed to him that those "who believed in the prophecy would be resurrected and be happy, but those who did not believe in it would stay in the ground and be damned forever with the whites".&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James 1896, 702&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional prophecy stating that a train carrying the dead would come from the east within four years is also attributed to Wodziwob (although this may have been a later addition by his disciple, '''Weneyuga''').&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora "The 1870 Ghost Dance"  ''Anthropological Records'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (1939) (Berkeley, California: University of California Press) 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Wodziwob's death in 1872, he had apparently removed the destruction of whites from his prophecy, replacing it with the idea that all were to be granted eternal life with no racial distinction being made.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James 1896, 703&lt;/ref&gt;

Weneyuga would proselytize the prophecy of Wodziwob for several years after Wodziwob's death, but after the failure of the train to restore the dead within four years, he essentially retired and became a respected medicine man until his death in the 1910s, with the majority of direct activities centered on Wodziwob's message not surviving the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora 1939, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his followers may have been '''Numu-tibo'o''' (also known as '''Tavibo'''), who for several decades was incorrectly identified as being the same man as Wodziwob.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora 1939, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Numu-tibo'o was the father of [[Wovoka]], who re-introduced a version of the [[Ghost Dance]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Hittman, Hittman ''Wovoka And The Ghost Dance: Expanded Edition'' (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press 1997) 33&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9941">'''Zabulistan''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Pashto language|Pashto]]: {{lang|fa|زابلستان}}; ''[[Zabul Province|Zabul]]'' + ''[[-stan]]''), originally known as "Zavolistan", is a historical [[region]] roughly corresponding to today's [[Zabul Province]] in southern [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Leyden"/&gt; Zabulistan translates to "land of Zabul" or "land of the Zabuls". The name "Zabuls" is probably a transliteration of [[Zunbils]], a Hindu dynasty that ruled the area during the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].

==History of Zabulistan==

[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the 7th century CE.]]

[[Babur]], founder of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] in the 16th century, records in [[Baburnama]] that the territory south of the [[Hindu Kush]] between [[Old Kandahar|Kandahar]] and [[Ghazni]] is generally known as Zabulistan.&lt;ref name="Leyden"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=95 |title=Events Of The Year 910 (1525) |page=8 |editor=John Leyden, Esq. |editor2=William Erskine, Esq. |work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]] |publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1921 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |authorlink=Babur |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113215245/http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=95 |archivedate=2007-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Persian mythology]], city of Zabol in eastern Iran, was the birthplace of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] hero [[Rostam]].

===Buddhist and Hindu Shahi period===
From the 7th century to 11th century, the region was ruled by Shahi kings. Later, it was conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]] of [[Ghazni]].

===Zunbils===
{{Main article|Zunbils}}
According to book writer André Wink,
{{quote|"In southern and eastern Afghanistan, the regions of Zamindawar (Zamin I Datbar or land of the justice giver, the classical Archosia) and Zabulistan or Zabul (Jabala, [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisha]], Kia pi shi) and Kabul, the Arabs were effectively opposed for more than two centuries, from 643 to 870 AD, by the indigenous rulers the Zunbils and the related [[Shahi|Kabul-Shahs]] of the dynasty which became known as the Buddhist-Shahi. With [[Makran]] and [[Baluchistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]] and much of [[Sindh]] this area can be reckoned to belong to the cultural and political frontier zone between [[India]] and [[Persia]]. It is clear however that in the seventh to the ninth centuries the Zunbils and their kinsmen the Kabulshahs ruled over a predominantly Indian rather than a Persian realm. The Arab geographers, in effect commonly speak of that king of "Al Hind" ...(who) bore the title of Zunbil."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hind: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam, 7th-11th centuries By André Wink Edition: illustrated Published by BRILL, 2002 Page 112 to 114 {{ISBN|0-391-04173-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-391-04173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to another book by William Bayne Fisher and Richard Nelson Frye:{{quote|"One of the most important aspects of early Saffarid policy of significance for the spread of Islam in Afghanistan and on the borders long after their empire had collapsed, was that of expansion into eastern Afghanistan. The early Arab governors of [[Sistan]] had at times penetrated as far as [[Ghazni Province|Ghazna]] and [[Kabul]], but these had been little more than slave and plunder raids. There was fierce resistance from the local rulers of these regions, above all from the line of Zunbils who ruled in [[Zamindavar]] and Zabulistan."&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge history of Iran By William Bayne Fisher, Richard Nelson Frye Page 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Islamization===
{{Further|Islamic conquest of Afghanistan}}
The region of southern Afghanistan was first invaded by Muslim Arabs from [[Zaranj]] in what is now [[Nimruz Province]]. From there they marched toward [[Lashkar Gah|Bost]], [[Kandahar]], Zabulistan, and reached Kabul. In 683 Kabul revolted and defeated the Muslim army, but two years later Zabul's army was routed by the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narasimhan.com/SK/Culture/culture_history/culture_hist_gupta2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121160257/http://narasimhan.com/SK/Culture/culture_history/culture_hist_gupta2.htm |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"We are told that it was only in 870 AD that Zabulistan was finally conquered by one [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari|Yakub]] who was the virtual ruler of the neighbouring Iranian province of [[Sistan|Siestan]]. The king was killed and his subjects were made Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;Medieval India Part 1 by Satish Chandra Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"One of the most important aspects of the early [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] policy of significance for the spread of Islam in Afghanistan and on the borders of [[India]] long after their empire had collapsed, was that of expansion into eastern Afghanistan. The early Arab governors of [[Sistan]] had at times penetrated as far as [[Ghazni Province|Ghazana]] and [[Kabul]], but these had been little more than slave and plunder raids. There was a fierce resistance from the local rulers of these regions, above all from the line of Zunbils who ruled in Zamindavar and Zabulistan and who were probably epigoni of the southern Hepthalite or Chionite kingdom of Zabul; on more than one occasion, these Zunbils inflicted sharp defeats on the Muslims. The Zunbils were linked with the [[Shahi|Kabul-Shahs]] of the [[Shahi]] dynasty; the whole river valley was at this time culturally and religiously an outpost of the Indian world, as of course it had been in the earlier centuries during the heyday of the [[Buddhist]] [[Gandhara]] civilization."&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Iran By Richard Nelson Frye, William Bayne Fisher, John Andrew Boyle Edition: reissue, illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 1975 Page 111 {{ISBN|0-521-20093-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-20093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sakawand a pilgrimage centre==
Various scholars have recorded the importance of Sakawand as a major centre of Hindu pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Mishra1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Yogendra|title=The Hindu Sahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab, A.D. 865-1026: a phase of Islamic advance into India|year=1972|publisher=Vaishali Bhavan|pages=42–43|quote=When Fardaghan arrived in Zabulistan, he led his army against Sakawand, a large Hindu place of worship in that country with a temple and many idols. He took the temple, broke the idols into pieces, and overthrew the idolaters. He informed Amr ibn Lais of the conquest and asked for reinforcements.

{{quote|"It is related that, Amru Lais conferred the governorship of Zabulistan on Fardghan and sent him there at the head of four thousand horses.

{{quote|"The activities of the Saffarid brothers on the Indian frontier attracted special attention in the Caliphate thanks to the care they took to send exotic presents from the plunder to the Abbasid court. Yaqub, for instance, at one time sent fifty gold and silver idols from Kabul to the caliph Al-Mutamid who dispatched them to Mecca. Another set of Idols lavishly decorated with jewels and silver, sent by himAmr in 896 from Sakawand (a place in the Logar valley between Ghazna and Kabul which the sources describe as a pilgrimage centre dedicated to God Zhun), caused a sensation in Baghdad on account of their strangeness."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World By André Wink Edition: illustrated Published by BRILL, 2002

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">'''Ōmononushi''' {{nihongo|大物主}} is a [[kami]] in the [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]] tradition. He is [[mitama|saki-mitama and kushi-mitama]] of [[Ōkuninushi]] and associated with [[Mount Miwa]] and is worshipped at the [[Ōmiwa jinja|Ōmiwa shrine]] there.

During the reign of [[Emperor Sujin]] (around 97-30 BCE), a plague affected the country. After Ōmononushi's descendant, Ōtataneko, petitioned the kami, the Emperor had a dream in which Ōmononushi appeared to him and claimed responsibility for the plague, announcing that it would not stop until an appropriate priesthood was set up on Mount Miwa. When the Emperor created such a priesthood, the plague ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Contemporary Japanese Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of4yAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85 |date=3 September 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23436-9|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ōmononushi was worshipped as a nature spirit who provided good weather and bountiful harvests, and was strongly associated with snakes.&lt;ref name="InoueJun2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nobutaka Inoue|author2=Endo Jun |author3=Mori Mizue|author4=Ito Satoshi |title=Shinto: A Short History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-38461-0|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two legends tell of Ōmononushi fathering children with human women. On one occasion he transformed himself into an arrow in order to impregnate a girl named Seyadatarahime, whilst on another occasion he used the form of a snake to have a son with the maiden Ikutamayorihime.&lt;ref name="Blacker2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carmen Blacker |title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGeOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=2 August 2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-31873-4|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Kojiki]]'' he is recognised as the ancestor of Himetataraisuzu-hime (Isukeyorihime), the spouse of [[Emperor Jimmu]].&lt;ref name="Ponsonby-Fane2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.
