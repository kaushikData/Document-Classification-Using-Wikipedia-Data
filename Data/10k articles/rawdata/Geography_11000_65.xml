The '''A525''' is major route from [[Rhyl]] in [[Wales]] to [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] in [[England]]. On the way, it passes near to [[Denbigh]], through [[Ruthin]], through [[Wrexham]] and near [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]]. 

It is dual carriageway just south of Rhyl. As of 10 March 2010, the section between Wrexham and Whitchurch is not classified as a [[primary route]] and  the section between Burleydam, (to the East of Whitchurch where it is a 'totso' with the A530 to Nantwich) and Newcastle (via Audlem) is also a non-primary A road now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/council_information/communication/press_releases/previous_press_releases/press_releases_from_2010/march_2010/re-classification_of_road.aspx Cheshire East Road is re-classified]&lt;/ref&gt;

In total the A525 is some {{convert|73|mi|km}} in length.

'''Baron Adolph Wilhelm August Friedrich von Steinwehr''' (September 25, 1822 – February 25, 1877) was a German-Brunswick army officer who emigrated to the [[United States]], became a [[geographer]], [[cartographer]], and author, and served as a [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Steinwehr was born in [[Blankenburg am Harz|Blankenburg]], in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]], [[Germany]], the son of a military family. (His grandfather fought in the Prussian Army against [[Napoleon]].) He attended the Brunswick Military Academy and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Brunswick Army in 1841. In 1847 he resigned his commission and emigrated to the United States, settling in [[Alabama]]. He served as an engineer in the [[Coast Survey|U.S. Coast Survey]], surveying the [[United States–Mexico border]] and [[Mobile Bay, Alabama]], but his desire to serve in a combat position in the [[Mexican–American War]] was denied and he returned to Brunswick in 1849, but not before marrying 19-year-old Florence Mary of Mobile, Alabama. He returned to the United States in 1854 and purchased a farm near [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]. He later moved to [[New York (state)|New York]] state.

==Civil War==
At the start of the Civil War, Steinwehr raised a regiment, consisting primarily of German immigrants, the [[29th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], which he commanded at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The regiment was in reserve during the battle, but served an important screening role during the Union retreat. He was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on October 12, 1861, and commanded the 2nd Brigade of [[Louis Blenker]]'s [[division (military)|division]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. This brigade was moved into [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John C. Frémont]]'s Mountain Department on April 1, 1862, and it fought in the [[Valley Campaign]] against Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]]. Fremont's command was expanded into an army [[corps]], which was soon commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]], another German immigrant. Steinwehr was given the 2nd Division in that corps. It was assigned to the [[Army of Virginia]], under Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], and participated in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], but had little role in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. Although the corps joined the [[Army of the Potomac]], the division did not fight at the [[Battle of Antietam]] or the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].

The command of what was now called the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] changed to Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]] in 1863, and Steinwehr continued to command the division in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] and the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  The corps was the victim of the surprise flanking attack by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and the overwhelming attack by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Richard S. Ewell]]'s Second Corps on the first day of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863.  At Chancellorsville, Steinwehr's division had one brigade, that of Col [[Adolphus Buschbeck]] involved in resisting Jackson's attack. At Gettysburg, when the corps was forced to retreat back through the town to [[Cemetery Hill]], Col [[Charles Coster]] took a brigade of Steinwehr's division out to the edge of the town, where it sacrificed itself buying time for the retreating soldiers of the other two divisions. These two defeats seriously degraded the combat effectiveness of the XI Corps and humiliated many of the German immigrant soldiers in the corps. Nevertheless, Steinwehr was well thought of by his superiors. After Chancellorsville, General Howard wrote that Steinwehr's bearing during the battle was "cool, collected and judicious." Brig. Gen. [[Alpheus Williams]], a fellow division commander, described him as a "remarkably intelligent and agreeable person."

In September 1863, two divisions of the XI Corps, those of Steinwehr and MG [[Carl Schurz]], were transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] to help relieve the besieged Union army in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], becoming part of the [[Army of the Cumberland]]. They served under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] in the [[Battle of Wauhatchie]], where the brigade of Col [[Orland Smith]] from Steinwehr's division distinguished itself. Buschbeck's brigade was engaged alongside Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]]'s command at the [[Third Battle of Chattanooga]]. After that battle the XI Corps was combined with the equally depleted [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII Corps]] to form the new [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]]. That corps fought under Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], but Steinwehr was essentially reorganized out of his job and he commanded no more combat units during the war. He resigned his commission on July 3, 1865.

==Postbellum life==
After the war, Steinwehr was employed as a geographer and cartographer. He returned to Connecticut to accept a professorship at [[Yale University]]. He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], then to [[Ohio]], and returned to New York. He died in [[Buffalo, New York]], and is buried in [[Albany Rural Cemetery]], [[Menands, New York]].  Steinwehr was a prolific author, including ''A School Geography: Embracing a Mathematical, Physical, and Political Descriptions of the Earth'' (published in 1870); co-author of ''Primary Geography'' (1870) and ''An Elementary Treatise on Physical Geography'' (1873); editor of ''The Centennial Gazetteer of the United States'' (1874). He is memorialized by the prominent Steinwehr Avenue in the city of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].

The '''African Conservation Foundation''', also known as '''ACF''', is an international [[non-governmental organisation]] established in 1999 and registered in 2001. Its focus is [[Wildlife management|wildlife]] and [[habitat conservation]] within and outside of [[protected areas]], adopting an integrated approach which includes [[community development]] and [[environmental education]]. The organisation is registered as a [[Charitable organization|charity]], supporting and conducting field conservation projects around [[Africa]]. It also maintains an Africa-wide network for information exchange and [[capacity building]] of conservation efforts in the region.

==Mission==
The organisation's mission is "to change the approach of the management and utilization of [[natural resources]] to one in which the needs of [[Human development (humanity)]] in the region are reconciled with [[biodiversity]] conservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanconservation.org/2007092023/about-acf/about-acf.html |title=About ACF |accessdate=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422113443/http://africanconservation.org/2007092023/about-acf/about-acf.html |archivedate=2011-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation Approach==
ACF works together with a large number of different partners to achieve its mission, including other NGOs, governmental organisations, companies, researchers and local communities. It conducts field projects in close collaboration with local partners, building in-country capacity by providing technical and [[fundraising]] support. The organisation is involved in wildlife conservation, [[great apes]] conservation ([[Cross River gorilla]], [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]]), habitat and  [[tropical forest]] conservation. It is also running tree planting and [[reforestation]] programmes in [[Kenya]] and [[Cameroon]], and is a [[World Elephant Day]] associate.

==Education==
Through its website, the organisation provides conservation news and action alerts, information about jobs and volunteer opportunities, and seeks to educate people on conservation issues in Africa. ACF involves volunteers in various aspects of its work, online and in the field.

==Campaigns==
* Save the Cross River Gorillas

==Wildlife Art==
The African Conservation Foundation is working closely together with Canadian Artist [[Daniel Taylor (painter)]] on a project called ArtSavingWildlife which aims to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of Africa's most [[endangered species]].

'''Aures''' ([[Berber languages|Amazigh]]: ⴰⵡⵔⴰⵙ / '''Awras''', {{lang-ar|أَوْرَاس|Awrās}}) is an [[Amazigh]] language-speaking [[natural region]] located in the mountainous area of the [[Aurès Mountains|Aurès range]] in eastern Algeria. The region includes the Algerian provinces of [[Batna Province|Batna]], [[Tebessa Province|Tebessa]], [[Khenchela Province|Khenchela]], [[Oum El Bouaghi Province|Oum El Bouaghi]], [[Souk Ahras Province|Souk Ahras]] and [[Biskra Province|Biskra]].
==History==
The [[Awras]] or Aures region is characterized both by its mountain terrain and by the [[Chaoui]] ethnic group that historically has inhabited the area.
The rugged terrain of the Aurès made that the region became one of the less developed areas in the Maghreb. Traditionally the women of the region wore [[tattoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/algeria-aures-mountains-facial-tattoos-culture-portrait-series Behind Algeria's Tattoos: A Portrait Series]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the Aures region that the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was started by [[Berber people|Berber]] independence fighters such as [[Mustapha Benboulaïd|Mostefa Ben Boulaïd]] who were operating from the area.&lt;ref&gt;''Algeria, 1830-2000: A Short History'', p. &lt;/ref&gt; A district of [[Algeria]] that existed during and after the War of Independence, from 1962 to 1974, was named after this region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Bedding''', in [[horticulture]], refers to the temporary planting of fast-growing plants into flower beds to create colourful, temporary, seasonal displays, during spring, summer or winter.&lt;ref name="PlantUser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant User Handbook |last=Hitchmough |first=James |authorlink= |author2=Fieldhouse, Ken|year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05843-3 |pages=292–309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtWpIjO7SgcC&amp;pg=PA292 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annuals"&gt;{{cite book |title=Annuals and Biennials |last=Phillips |first=Roger |authorlink= |author2=Rix, Martyn |year=1999 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-74889-1 |pages=10, 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants used for bedding are generally annuals, biennials or [[Hardiness (plants)|tender]] perennials; [[Succulent plants|succulents]] are gaining in popularity.

Some bedding plants are also referred to as "patio plants" because they are widely used in pots and other containers positioned on patios, terraces, decking and other areas around houses. Larger tender "conservatory plants" may also be moved out from [[greenhouse]]s or [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]] and planted out in borders (or stood in their pots in sheltered positions) for the warmer months, then returned to shelter for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservatory and Indoor Plants Vol I |last=Phillips |first=Roger |author2=Rix, Martyn |year=1997 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-67737-4 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern bedding plant industry breeds and produces plants with a neat, dwarf habit, which flower uniformly and reliably. They are bred primarily for use in large-scale bedding schemes where uniformity and predictability is of paramount importance, but this is often achieved by losing the plants' individual character, and has been criticised by such notable [[Plantsman|plantsmen]] as the late [[Christopher Lloyd (gardener)|Christopher Lloyd]], who championed an informal style of bedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Well-Tempered Garden |last=Lloyd |first=Christopher |year=1987 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn= 0-14-046562-6 |pages=93–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Mall, London April 2006 043.jpg|thumb|right|Spring bedding with tulips, wallflowers and forget-me-nots]]
==Bedding plants==
There exists a huge range of plants specifically grown to produce a period of flower colour throughout the spring and summer, and (usually) discarded after flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hessayon|first=Dr. D. G.|authorlink = D. G. Hessayon|title=The bedding plant expert|year=1996|publisher=Expert|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0903505452|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fish|first=Martin|title=Bedding plants (Collins practical gardener)|year=2004|publisher=Collins|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0007164068|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may conveniently be divided into four groups:-
*[[Hardiness (plants)|Hardy]] annuals sown directly into the ground early in the season (poppy, stock, sunflower, clarkia, godetia, eschscholzia, nigella, dianthus)
*Tender annual or perennial plants treated as half-hardy annuals – sown under glass in late winter in heat, or purchased as young plants, and hardened-off outdoors when all danger of frost has passed (begonia, lobelia, petunia, argyranthemum, chrysanthemum, pelargonium, nicotiana, cosmos, fuchsia)
*Hardy biennial plants, or perennials treated as biennial, sown in one year to flower the next, and discarded after flowering (antirrhinum, polyanthus, wallflower, daisy, foxglove, some dianthus, some poppies, campanula, delphinium, aubrieta, aquilegia, cornflower, pansies)
*Corms, rhizomes, bulbs and tubers, planted each year and lifted after the plant has died down and stored in winter, or discarded (tulip, narcissus, hyacinth, gladiolus, dahlia, canna)

==Types of bedding==
Formal bedding, as seen in parks and large gardens, where whole flower beds are replanted two or three times a year, is a costly and labour-intensive process. Towns and cities are encouraged to produce impressive displays by campaigns such as "Britain in bloom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain in bloom|url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardening/Community-gardening/Britain-in-Bloom/New-to-Bloom|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Spring bedding, South Shields - geograph.org.uk - 406077.jpg|thumbnail|right|Spring bedding (tulips and polyanthus), [[South Shields]], UK]]
===Spring bedding===
Plants used for spring bedding are often [[Biennial plant|biennials]] (sown one year to flower the next), or hardy, but short-lived, perennials.[http://www.hortweek.com/news/search/895053/Spring-bedding-selling-ahead-summer-season/] Spring-flowering bulbs such as [[tulip]]s are often used, typically with [[forget-me-not]]s, [[Erysimum|wallflowers]], winter [[Pansy|pansies]] and [[Primula|polyanthus]].

===Summer bedding===
[[File:Royalvictoriapark.jpg|thumb|right|Formal summer bedding scheme in Victoria Park, [[Bath, Somerset]]. Most of the colour is provided by large-flowered [[begonia]]s]]
Plants used for summer bedding are generally [[Annual plant|annuals]] or tender [[Perennial plant|perennials]]. They become available (often as what are referred to as "plug plants"[http://www.hortweek.com/news/search/793163//]) in nurseries and garden centres during spring, to be gradually "[[Cold hardening|hardened off]]" (acclimatised to outdoor conditions) by the purchaser and finally planted out around the time that the last frosts are expected. Experienced gardeners keep an eye on the weather forecasts at that time of year and are on standby to protect their bedding displays overnight with [[horticultural fleece]] (or the older alternatives of net curtains or newspaper) if frost threatens.

[http://www.hortweek.com/news/search/843510/Summer-sensations-bedding-plant-trials/]

====Carpet bedding====
[[File:Union Terrace Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|Municipal carpet bedding schemes often incorporate lettering]]
Carpet bedding employs two or more contrasting plant cultivars with a neat, dwarf habit and distinct colouring (of flower or foliage) to create geometric displays. It is often used to form such things as [[lettering]], [[logo]]s or trademarks, [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], or [[floral clock]]s. Suitable plants are rosette-forming succulents such as ''[[Echeveria]]'' or fairly slow-growing or mat-forming foliage plants, such as coloured-leaved ''[[Alternanthera]]'' cultivars, which are tolerant of clipping; such plants may also be used in three-dimensional sculptural forms or pseudo-topiary.

===Winter bedding===
Planted in autumn to give a display until early spring, the plants used for winter bedding are mainly hardy perennials. As it has to be planted at the same time of year as spring bedding does, winter bedding tends to be less commonly seen, except in containers such as [[windowbox]]es.&lt;ref name="PlantUser"/&gt; Some are short-lived and will be discarded after their first display; others may be used as a source of cuttings for the next year. Winter-hardy ornamental vegetables such as [[cultivar]]s of [[kale]] and [[cabbage]] with coloured or variegated foliage are increasingly common. ''[[Primula]]'' cultivars (polyanthus and [[Primula vulgaris|primroses]]) are commonly used, as are winter-flowering [[Erica carnea|heathers]] and ''Viola'' ×''wittrockiana'', winter [[Pansy|pansies]]. Variegated evergreens such as cultivars of ''[[Vinca minor]]'' (lesser periwinkle), ''[[Euonymus fortunei]]'' and ''[[Hedera helix]]'' (ivies) are also popular.

'''Borchert's epochs''' refer to five distinct periods in the history of [[Urbanization in the United States|American urbanization]] and are also known as Borchert's model of urban evolution. Each epoch is characterized by the impact of a particular transport technology on the creation and differential rates of growth of [[United States|American]] cities. This model was conceptualized by [[University of Minnesota]] geographer John R. Borchert [http://www.borchert.com/john/ (about)] in 1967. The five epochs identified by Borchert are:

*Sail-Wagon Epoch (1790–1830), cities grow near ports and major waterways which are used for transportation;
*Iron Horse Epoch (1830–70), characterized by impact of steam engine technology, and development of steamboats and regional railroad networks;
*Steel Rail Epoch (1870–1920), dominated by the development of long haul railroads and a national railroad network;
*Auto-Air-Amenity Epoch (1920–70), with growth in the gasoline combustion engine;
*High-Technology Epoch (1970–present), expansion in service and information sectors of the economy

Subsequent researchers (e.g., Phillips and Brunn) have proposed an extension of Borchert's model with new epochs to take into account late 20th-century developments in patterns of metropolitan growth and decline in the United States.

'''''Champlain’s Dream: The European Founding of North America''''' is a biography written by American historian, [[David Hackett Fischer]] and published in 2008. It is a biography of French "soldier, spy, master mariner, explorer, cartographer, artist and "Father of New France"", [[Samuel de Champlain]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encore.sasklibraries.ca/eds/item?dbid=cat02955a&amp;an=SILS.b1258715|title=Champlain's dream|work=sasklibraries.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this book, Fischer examines more closely Champlain's personal impact on the establishment of a French colony in the [[New World]] - securing royal support despite opposition from formidable foes like [[Marie de Medici]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]], negotiating with "Indian nations" and imbuing the new colony with the values of [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/books/review/Boot-t.html?pagewanted=all|first1=Max|last1=Boot|title=They Didn't Name That Lake for Nothing|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-10-31|access-date=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also remembered for having survived 27 crossings of the North Atlantic in 37 years - without ever losing a ship.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Despite never being the "senior official" of [[New France]], Champlain functioned as an absolute ruler and as Fischer shows, his vision for New France (a vision that was very much a product of Champlain's upbringing and experiences) helps explain both its triumphs and failures.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Fischer has substantial experience using the life and perspective of a great leader to tell a broader historical narrative; he employed a similar structure in ''[[Washington's Crossing (book)|Washington's Crossing]]'' for which he received a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

== Main thesis ==
[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909]]
Champlain's dreams as an explorer and [[cartographer]] are documented in his own writings - one of them was to find a North American passage to China.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Fischer 2008, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly, his overarching dream was to establish a successful French colony in the New World. This required Champlain to:
* secure political support in the French court&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 345&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1535 and 1601, six French settlements in the New World ended in failure.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 113&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain carefully studied the experiences of earlier explorers like [[Jacques Cartier]] and [[Pierre de Chauvin]]. But then, he needed to convince men like the [[duc de Sully]], the King's Chief Minister who thought American colonies were against French national interest as they distracted from business at home.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Fischer 2008, p 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Other noblemen of the time would have preferred domestic reforms to expansion abroad and Champlain stayed alert to their machinations. 
* and make difficult administrative decisions once in the New World
Even after royal support could be secured, "rival merchants, competing seaports and the representatives of foreign powers" conspired against the colonies of 'New France'&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and it fell to Champlain to lead his men to deal with all kinds of problems.The explorers had to claim land, protect it from the "Indian nations" and convince French subjects to emigrate to the New World - a prospect they were much less enthusiastic about than Britishers fleeing religious persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 445&lt;/ref&gt; 
Even after all of this was done and the colonies began to run smoothly, he had to regulate unlicensed trade on the rivers and build trading posts to make sure the colony stayed profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 455&lt;/ref&gt;

But as Fischer puts forward in this book, Champlain's dream went further than that. He envisioned that this colony would be "a place where people of different cultures could live together in amity and concord" and hoped that North America could be this place.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He dreamed of collective action, humanistic ideals like peace and tolerance and a Francophone legacy in the new world. Fischer makes frequent reference to Champlain's "grand design" or his sweeping vision.

What Fischer seeks to do in this book, after articulating this aspiration, is ask a series of questions about why this man believed in it and what steps he took to make it a reality.

== Fischer's treatment of Champlain ==
Fischer rejects the view that Champlain was just another European mercenary looking to seize lands and enslave native populations like many other early British and Spanish explorers in North America. He writes admiringly of Champlain's humanist values - that he treated "Indian nations" with respect and pursued peaceful coexistence through policies of "trade alliances, cultural tolerance and intermarriage".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110602715.html|title=The Ideal Colonist|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== An explanation for Champlain's humanism ===
* Growing up in port city of Brouage

Fischer describes the unique character of [[Brouage]], the town of Champlain's youth as the "salty broth in which our hero was cooked".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to its thriving economy and "cosmopolitan nature", the man historians know as Champlain's father managed to work his way up from a humble ship's pilot to a naval captain in the King's Marine. Thus, Champlain's early life was one of visible opportunity and upwards mobility, an experience that Fischer claims Champlain's later optimism and persistence is a result of.

Brouage was in a region that was deeply suspicious of Paris, the seat of power but enjoyed a "broad diversity of language, culture, religion and ecology".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 37&lt;/ref&gt; This upbringing inculcated in Champlain an exceptional curiosity about cultural differences. He learned Dutch, English and Spanish in school and from his neighbors and "the art of navigation" from his father.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 26&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not having a 'classical' education, Samuel de Champlain became skilled in the use of weapons and likely learned map-making from a Champlain family friend who was an "engineer and geographer to the King".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer emphasizes the exposure Champlain had as a youth and the different strengths he picked up through his family, his education and his town to show that each served him well in the adventures that would come later on.

* The religious turbulence of his youth

Even the small town of Brouage was not immune from the clashes between [[Calvinists]] and [[Roman Catholics]] that occurred after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Fischer writes about an incident in which a rival port city sent "barges full of sand and rock" to block the channel leading to Brouage and sabotage its trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 20&lt;/ref&gt; After 1628, Brouage was even turned into a garrison by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], its sea trade having been cut off. 
Even though historians cannot confirm whether Champlain was a Protestant or a Catholic, his writings show the influence of a deep "Christian faith".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer goes further, drawing parallels between King [[Henry IV of France]] and Champlain, arguing that both men detested intolerance and believed it to be "anti-Christian".&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Fischer 2008, p 57&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that both thought religion was a force for social and political stability, faith was an intensely personal choice and religious controversy mattered far less than "piety, humility and good works".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Fischer claims that Champlain gained an understanding of the need for cultural acceptance, but also limited violence to ensure stability from war.

===That Champlain may have been the illegitimate son of the King===
One of the new theories published in this book is that Champlain was actually the son of French King, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 45&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as [[Marcel Trudel]] and [[Hubert Deschamps]] have previously expressed belief that Champlain was actually the son of an "unknown French nobleman".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer, however, said that both Champlain’s "close relationship with the King" and "the King’s travel history in the nine months prior to Champlain’s birth" lead him to believe that Henry IV was in fact the father. At a book reception in Brandeis, Fischer stated that, “He was at the right place at the right time, so to speak. It could have happened. Granted that there is exactly zero hard evidence to support that theory, but [if Henry IV were his father] it would explain many anomalies in their relationship. It’s only a possibility, but it’s very clear that the two of them had a very special relationship.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrandeishoot.com/articles/3657#sthash.mGiNyyUV.dpuf|title=The Brandeis Hoot » Hackett Fischer discusses book Champlain’s Dream|work=thebrandeishoot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The challenges of writing biography on Samuel de Champlain ==
[[File:Samchamprifle.jpg|thumb|The defeat of the [[Iroquois]] at Champlain Lake]]
Many reviewers of Fischer's work pointed out that little is known about Samuel de Champlain- both in the United States and also in Canada.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/champlains-dream-lives-on-in-north-america/article1345919/|title=Champlain's dream lives on in North America|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the variety of his achievements, he is a somewhat obscure figure.

There is only a single “authentic likeness . . . is known to survive from his own time”.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; This likeness is a one-inch engraving wielding an advanced wheel-lock arquebus and with a ''[[panache]]'', or a feathery plume in his helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Every other portrait or image came much later.

Another is that he wrote "thousands of pages about what he did, but only a few words about who he was" - historians hardly know his birthdate, level of schooling or even whether he was baptized as a Protestant or a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer has also offered the view that Champlain may have been forgotten due to the predominance of the [[Annales School|Annales school]] of French [[historiography]].&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Under its influence, the "structure of society and the details of daily and communal life" were seen as more important subjects for history than great men or major events.

In response to the many questions left unanswered, Fischer devotes a series of Appendices that examine competing theories on subjects from his birthdate to the questions of authorship or authenticity in his surviving writings.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 569-635&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fischer's views on biography ==
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?282039-1/champlains-dream Presentation by Fischer on ''Champlain's Dream'' at the New York Historical Society, October 23, 2008], [[C-SPAN]]}}
In the Introduction to this book, Fischer mentions the need for biography to walk the line between [[hagiography]] and [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address to the [[New York Historical Society]], Fischer lays out the three rules of biography he picked up from historians [[Francis Parkman]] and [[Samuel Eliot Morison]]: 
# "Go there"
# "Do it"
# "Then write it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?282039-1/book-discussion-champlains-dream|title=Book Discussion Champlain's Dream - Video - C-SPAN.org|work=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Partly in deference to this process, the Introduction to the book is subtitled ''In Search of Champlain'' and Fischer makes frequent mention of the role of "physical evidence" in knowing history.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2008, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Tony Horwitz]], writing for the [[Washington Post]] described ''Champlain's Dream'' as "exhaustively researched" though perhaps too effusive in its praise for Champlain's character.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; He writes that Champlain seems “almost perfect, and perfectly dull” and though Fischer tries, Champlain remains an abstract figure and doesn't come alive. Moreover, Horwitz describes the near avoidance of Champlain's love life or trust placed in Champlain's own writings of how the Native Americans loved him as odd notes. He adds that the absence of a dramatic event to offer a tight focus (like in Fischer's other books, [[Washington's Crossing (book)|Washington's Crossing]] and ''Paul Revere's Ride'') throws off the book's pace.

[[Max Boot]], in the [[New York Times]] takes the view that this work must be considered within the view of how little documentation exists of Champlain's life and how he "remains a relatively obscure corner of our continent’s history".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since Fischer's "plain, unadorned" prose is seeded with "intriguing ideas", the reader's interest is caught by how this man they barely knew anything about was so versatile and accomplished and how smoothly Fischer's narrative of his life fits its big ideas together.

In general, the response was positive with ''Champlain's Dream'' being declared one of the best books of 2008 by the New York Times (100 Notable Books) and [[Publishers Weekly]] (Best Books of the Year) as well as a number of regional papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind0903&amp;L=CRVNET&amp;E=base64&amp;P=2775981&amp;B=--------------060704000800050107030504&amp;T=application%2Fmsword;%20name=%22Champlain's%20Dream-Reviews.doc%22&amp;N=Champlain's%20Dream-Reviews.doc.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a runner-up for the 2009 [[Cundill Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cundillprize.com/prize2009/short-list/|title=2009 Short List - Cundill Prize in History|work=cundillprize.com|access-date=2015-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629035627/http://www.cundillprize.com/prize2009/short-list/#|archive-date=2015-06-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buenos Aires desde el aire.jpg|thumb|View of [[Buenos Aires Central Business District|central Buenos Aires]] from the air|alt=View of [[Buenos Aires Central Business District|central Buenos Aires]] from the air.]]
[[Buenos Aires]], the capital of [[Argentina]], has a [[temperate climate]], which is classified as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]] with four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid with frequent thunderstorms while winters are cool and drier with frosts that occurs on average twice per year. Spring and fall are transition seasons characterized by changeable weather. At the central observatory,{{refn|group=note|name=Central Observatory|The central observatory refers to the weather station located in Villa Ortúzar that has been operational since 1906,&lt;ref name=observatorioname&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.smn.gob.ar/prensa/archivo/gace06/gace2606.pdf |title=Centenario de la Creación del Observatorio Central Buenos Aires, del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional |publisher=Servicio Meteorológico Nacional |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; having one of oldest and most reliable weather records in South America.&lt;ref name=Pezza2010/&gt;}} the highest recorded temperature is {{convert|43.3|C|1}} while the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-5.4|C|1}}.

Different climatic factors influence the '''climate of Buenos Aires'''. The semi–permanent [[South Atlantic High]] influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to the city in the form of [[Weather front|frontal systems]] during winter or storms produced by [[cyclogenesis]] in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high [[insolation]] in the summer months form a [[low pressure system]] called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a [[pressure gradient]] that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the [[Pampas]], Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting [[air mass]] – the cold, dry [[Pampero (wind)|Pampero]] from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.

Most of the precipitation comes from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures.{{sfn|Fittkau|1969|p=73}}{{sfn|Veblen|2007|p=234}}&lt;ref name=sudestada/&gt; Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool.{{sfn|Lydolph|1985|p=334}} Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures.&lt;ref name=Bejaran2003/&gt; These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when they come from the north or northwest as a result of a trough located in central Argentina.&lt;ref name=Bejaran2003/&gt; On the other hand, warm air masses from [[Brazil]] bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air.&lt;ref name=Bejaran2003/&gt; These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures.&lt;ref name=Bejaran2003/&gt; Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.&lt;ref name=Seluchi2000/&gt;

'''Earth3D''' was developed as part of a diploma thesis of Dominique Andre Gunia at 
[[Braunschweig University of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourcepole.ch/assets/2010/9/10/foss4g2010_virtual_globes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707003012/http://sourcepole.ch/assets/2010/9/10/foss4g2010_virtual_globes.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }} Comparison of Open Source Virtual Globes&lt;/ref&gt; to display a virtual globe of the earth. It was developed before Google bought [[Keyhole, Inc]] and changed their product into [[Google Earth]]. Earth3D downloads its data (satellite imagery and height data) from a server while the user navigates around. The data itself is saved in a [[Quadtree]]. It uses data from [[NASA]], [[USGS]], the [[CIA]] and the city of [[Osnabrück]].

One of the strengths of Earth3D is the capacity of showing metereological phenomena, like [[Low-pressure area]]s, [[anticylone]]s, etc. in near-real time.&lt;ref name=cuadernalia&gt;http://www.cuadernalia.net/spip.php?article4255 Earth3D (Visor interactivo 2D, 2.5D y 3D para Andalucía)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of Earth3D was developed using Trolltech's [[Qt (toolkit)|QT]] framework. Later a version built with Java and [[JOGL]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earth3d.org/ Welcome to Earth3D&lt;/ref&gt; But the demand for a Java-based version was very little. This may be because NASA's [[WorldWind]] also has an open source Java version. So most people wanted to use a C++ based globe in their applications. That was the reason why a minimalized version, the Earth3dlib was developed. It contains only the most necessary functions to display the earth itself and to add own visualizations to it.

All these three projects can be retrieved from Sourceforge's CVS (C++) or Subversion (Java) repository.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24003">'''Health impact assessment''' ('''HIA''') is defined as "a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by
which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the
[[Population health|health of a population]], and the [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of those effects within the population." {{Harv|ECHP|1999|p=4}}

==Overview==
HIA is intended to produce a set of [[evidence]]-based recommendations to inform [[decision-making]] {{Harv|Taylor|Quigley|2002|p=2}}. HIA seeks to maximise the positive [[health]] impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed [[policies]], programs or [[projects]].

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of [[impact assessment]], such as [[environmental impact assessment]] or [[social impact assessment]]. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently:

# ''Screening'' - determining if an HIA is warranted/required
# ''Scoping'' - determining which impacts will be considered and the plan for the HIA
# ''Identification and assessment of impacts'' - determining the magnitude, nature, extent and likelihood of potential health impacts, using a variety of different methods and types of information
# ''Decision-making and recommendations'' - making explicit the trade-offs to be made in decision-making and formulating evidence-informed recommendations
# ''Evaluation, monitoring and follow-up'' - process and impact [[evaluation]] of the HIA and the monitoring and management of health impacts

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve [[community health]] and [[wellbeing]]. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both [[design]] and [[operational]] aspects of a proposal.

HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential [[health inequalities]] can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project {{Harv|Acheson|1998}}.

A number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see [[#Further reading|further reading]]).

==Determinants of health==
The proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the [[determinants of health]] underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely [[Social environment|environmental]] and [[social]], so that there are many overlaps with [[environmental impact assessment]] and [[social impact assessment]].

==Levels of HIA==
Three forms of HIA exist:

* Desk-based HIA, which takes 2–6 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides a broad overview of potential health impacts;
* Rapid HIA, which takes approximately 12 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides more detailed information on potential health impacts; and
* Comprehensive HIA, which takes approximately 6 months for one assessor and provides a in-depth assessment of potential health impacts. {{Harv|IMPACT|2004|p=7}}

It has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) {{Harv|Taylor|Gorman|Quigley|2003|p=1}}. This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to [[evaluation]] with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se {{Harv|Kemm|2003|p=387}}. Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts.

==HIA practitioners==
HIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency.

==HIA worldwide==
HIA is currently being used or developed around the world, most notably in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Africa]] and [[Thailand]].

The new safeguard policies and standards of the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), part of the [[World Bank]], were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the [[Equator Principles]]. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.

==HIA conferences==
The [http://www.unige.ch/medecine/eis2013/accueil_en.html 13th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Geneva]] in 2013.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327020826/http://www.hia2012.ca/en/home.aspx 12th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Québec City]] in 2012.

'''Krivolak''' ({{lang-mk|Криволак}}) is an area in east-central [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], where the largest [[military base]] of the [[Military of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Army]], and the largest [[military training]] area in the [[Balkans]] is located. The area is primarily used for the training of the [[Macedonian Armed Forces]] and its allies. The base has also been used for [[NATO]] exercises, and, while Macedonia was a part of [[Yugoslavia]], for testing of [[chemical weapons]].

Krivolak occupies a large area of mostly barren landscape. Hills, valleys, and a [[desert]] are used to test the skills and endurance of [[soldier]]s that train there. The [[military drills]] that take place there often are a combination of [[heavy artillery]] firing, [[Airstrike|aerial bombardment]], and [[Infantry tactics|infantry attack]]. Many objects are used to simulate real [[warfare]] conditions, including temporary buildings and structures, vehicles, and other impediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NTI |publisher=NTI |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Yugoslavia/Chemical/4340_4380.html |title=Chemical Facilities |date=2007-04-08 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624165754/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Yugoslavia/Chemical/4340_4380.html |archivedate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The military training area within the base is sometimes used for training of [[United Nations Military Observer]]s (UNMOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MRT|publisher=MRTI|url=http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3814&amp;Itemid=27|title=Training for Military Observers underway at Krivolak|date=2007-04-08|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krivolak is also the location of an annual [[training exercise]] sponsored by the [[Consortium for Humanitarian Service and Education]] (CHSE). The Consortium is a collaborative effort of academic, government, and [[non-governmental organization]]s in the United States and Macedonia.  The training includes university students from Macedonia and the United States who are involved in organizing and conducting a [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] response to a simulated major [[earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CHSE|publisher=CHSE|url=http://humanitariantraining.org/Humanitarian_Training/SVETLINA.html|title=Svetlina|date=2009-03-08|accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kumbhavurutty Waterfall''' is a famous waterfalls in [[South India]] situated near [[Aryankavu]] [[panchayath]] in [[Kollam district]] of [[Kerala]] near [[Tamil Nadu]] border. Located on the eastern area of [[Kollam District]], Kumbhavurutty falls is one among the few crowd pulling waterfalls in [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralatourism.org/routes-locations/kumbhavurutty/id/8143 Kumbhavurutty Waterfall - Kollam]&lt;/ref&gt; During peak times, the daily collection of this tourism spot will cross Rs. 1,50,000. It is about 6.5&amp;nbsp;km away from Achenkovil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveltokerala.blogspot.in/2009/11/kumbhavurutty-waterfalls.html Kumbhavurutti Waterfall, Kollam District]&lt;/ref&gt; This waterfall is a part of river [[Achankovil]]. Manalar Waterfall is another important waterfall near to this. The travelers can see wild animals also if lucky. Because the waterfall is very close to the thick Konni Forest area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralatravelpal.com/waterfalls-in-kollam.html Waterfall in Kollam]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palaruvi Falls]] is another nearby attraction of this falls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townplanning.kerala.gov.in/pages/ldp/kollam/iddp_v1_klm_ch_27.pdf Town Planning - Kollam]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7108">'''Landscape engineering''' is the application of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] to shape land and waterscapes. It can also be described as [[Sustainable engineering|green engineering]], but the design professionals best known for landscape engineering are [[landscape architecture|landscape architects]]. Landscape engineering is the interdisciplinary application of [[engineering]] and other [[applied science]]s to the design and creation of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscapes. It differs from, but embraces traditional [[land reclamation|reclamation]]. It includes scientific disciplines: [[Agronomy]], [[Botany]], [[Ecology]], [[Forestry]], [[Geology]], [[Geochemistry]], [[Hydrogeology]], and [[Wildlife biologist|Wildlife Biology]]. It also draws upon applied sciences: Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Sciences, Engineering [[Geomorphology]], landscape architecture, and [[Mining]], [[Geotechnical]], and Civil, Agricultural &amp; [[Irrigation]] Engineering.

Landscape engineering builds on the engineering strengths of declaring goals, determining initial conditions, iteratively designing, predicting performance based on knowledge of the design, monitoring performance, and adjusting designs to meet the declared goals. It builds on the strengths and history of reclamation practice. Its distinguishing feature is the marriage of landforms, substrates, and vegetation throughout all phases of design and construction, which previously have been kept as separate disciplines.

Though landscape engineering embodies all elements of traditional engineering (planning, investigation, design, construction, operation, assessment, research, management, and training), it is focused on three main areas. The first is closure planning – which includes goal setting and design of the landscape as a whole. The second division is landscape design more focused on the design of individual landforms to reliably meet the goals as set out in the closure planning process. Landscape performance assessment is critical to both of these, and is also important for estimating liability and levels of financial assurance. The iterative process of planning, design, and performance assessment by a multidisciplinary team is the basis of landscape engineering.

Carpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. During his life he investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law. He became Colorado's State Engineer which he held for several years while still teaching.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt; Carpenter was involved in not only in irrigation engineering but consulting on hydraulic construction projects and the problems associated with such projects.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lange&gt;{{cite web| title=Guide to the Papers of Louis G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">The '''Limestone Alps''' ({{lang-de|Kalkalpen}}) are a [[mountain range]]s system of the [[Alps]] in [[Central Europe]].

They are of economic importance, including as a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] source of [[drinking water]]. They have many accessible [[dripstone cave|dripstone]] and [[ice cave]]s.

==Geography==
They are roughly {{convert|600|km|mi}} long. The two main groups, Northern and Southern, run parallel to the main [[Austrian Central Alps]] (also known as the Central Eastern Alps) mountain ranges, on their north and south. Together with the Austrian Central Alps, the Limestone Alps form the most westerly portion of the [[Eastern Alps]].

The [[Geomorphology|mountain and hill profiles]] of the Limestone Alps are very varied and range from jagged peaks and sheer rock faces to [[high plateau]]s and extensive areas of [[karst]] formations.

===Groups===
The numerous ranges of the Limestone Alps are within three mountain groupings, the Northern Limestone Alps, Southern Limestone Alps, and Western Limestone Alps:
*The [[Northern Limestone Alps]] are in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]], Germany. Its ranges include: the [[Allgäu Alps]], [[Berchtesgaden Alps]], [[Chiemgau Alps]], [[Ennstal Alps]], [[Salzburg Slate Alps]], [[Türnitz Alps]], [[Vienna Woods|Vienna Woods foothills]], [[Ybbstal Alps]]
*The [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are in Austria, northern [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Switzerland]]. Its ranges include: the [[Dolomites]], [[Carnic Alps]], [[Julian Alps]], [[Ortler Alps]], and [[Vicentine Alps]].
*The [[Western Limestone Alps]] are in Austria and [[Switzerland]]. Its ranges include: the [[Albula Alps]], [[Bergamasque Alps]], [[Livigno Alps]], [[Oberhalbstein Alps]], [[Plessur Alps]] and [[Rhaetian Alps]].

The Limestone Alps comprise 3 of the 4 primary regions in the [[Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps]]. However, they are not used in the proposed [[SOIUSA]] classification system.

==Geology==
The Limestone Alps are made of lighter and more porous rock. In addition to [[limestone]], they also contain [[Dolostone|dolomite]], [[marl]], and [[sandstone]]. They are unlike the [[Central Alps]], which are mainly composed of [[crystalline]] rock ([[granite]] and [[gneiss]]), or of [[slate]].

This page is a '''list of characters''' for the [[British television]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] '''''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''''', which was shown on [[BBC One]] from 1990 to 1995.

==Hyacinth and her family==
===Hyacinth Bucket===
The show's protagonist, played by [[Dame Patricia Routledge]], is the [[social-climbing]] [[snob]] Hyacinth Bucket (née Walton) (b. 4 December 1930),&lt;ref&gt;In ''Young Hyancinth'' set in the 1950s, Hyacinth is 19. Depending on the exact year of the show, Hyacinth is born between 1930 (to be 19 on the first day of 1950) and 1940 (to be 19 in exactly 1959.) The Walton name was also introduced in ''Young Hyacinth'', as it is never mentioned in the series.&lt;/ref&gt; who insists that her surname is pronounced "Bouquet", like a bunch of [[flowers]]. Hyacinth's primary aims in life are to impress people, particularly of the upper and upper-middle classes, and to give the impression that she is of high social standing, despite her fairly average status. 

Hyacinth and Richard live at number 22 Blossom Avenue, in a [[bungalow]] which Hyacinth refers to as "The Residence" when sending letters. She describes herself as a "local [[celebrity]]", and believes she is held in high and enviable esteem by the community for her [[candle|candlelight]] suppers, [[charity (practice)|charity]] work and her involvement in the local [[amateur dramatics]]. In an attempt to make callers think she is well-off enough to employ [[domestic staff]], she repeatedly (and famously) answers her beloved pearl-white slim line [[telephone]] with automatic redial facility with, "The Bouquet residence; the lady of the house speaking." While on the phone, she is prone to making impossible requests of people, such as a [[shipping forecast]] for a [[river]], and does not understand why they cannot be met. 

Those around her despise her snobbery, her constant meddling, her outlandish plans and her refusal to listen to others. Hyacinth seems completely oblivious to everyone's terror of her and wants to believe the best of most people, that they are either enamoured with her and too shy to say so or that they are trying to be considerate to her by not bothering her. However, she cannot abide anyone one-upping her when it comes to social events or showing the same snobbery she herself shows. She has a penchant for finding the most disagreeable people to try to impress, while at the same time shunning agreeable people who are of lower social standing, but never seems to learn from her mistakes.

Hyacinth goes to great lengths to avoid her poorer or oddly-behaving relatives (Daisy, Onslow, Rose, Bruce and, to an extent, Daddy) in public, while boasting about her richer sister (Violet, who has "a [[Mercedes Benz|Mercedes]], [[sauna]], and room for a [[pony]]") in order to maintain her vaunted social status. However, she loves her family, especially her father, and will rush to their aid in times of need. She rarely acknowledges the fact, however, that her family treat her more kindly than most characters on the series whom she is trying to impress, being equally willing to come to her aid in an emergency as she is for them. 

Another of Hyacinth's other quirks is that she frequently refers to or makes preparations for her candlelight suppers, attendance at which almost seems mandatory, but we never actually see one in progress. She also plans other extravagant functions such as fancy [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue|barbecues]], which usually end in disaster. She is an excellent housekeeper, keeping the house immaculately clean and setting absolutely beautiful tables for dinners and functions. She is very proud of her various [[china (material)|china dishes]] and [[objets d'art]], especially her [[Royal Doulton]] [[tea service]] with the hand-painted [[vinca|periwinkles]]. She can play [[piano]], and often attempts to sing for people. While she has a rich, strong voice, she tends to force it too hard and loudly, making her singing unpleasant to listen to. She often plots and schemes to make herself or Richard look higher-class than they are, and has a tendency to embellish upon stories of her and Richard's exploits to make them sound better than they really were, to impress other people. She does the same with stories of her son Sheridan, whom she adores even though he only wants her money. She also has a great aversion to dogs and indeed most animals, which is reciprocated by the animals themselves. 

As revealed in the special "Young Hyacinth", Hyacinth is the eldest of the four floral-named Walton sisters: in birth order, [[hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]], [[bellis perennis|Daisy]], [[viola (plant)|Violet]] and [[rosa (plant)|Rose]].

===Richard Bucket===
Played by [[Clive Swift]], Richard Bucket is Hyacinth's long-suffering husband who is at her beck and call. Richard is a calm, tolerant and relaxed character who cares little for enhancing or preserving social status, and he seems content with his lower-middle class standing. He is usually laid back but has two great fears; [[acrophobia|heights]], and Hyacinth spending too much money on things. He pronounces his last name, [[Bucket]], as the English word, and snaps to Hyacinth in one episode, "It's not "Bouquet", it's Bucket! It was always Bucket until I met you". 

Richard Bucket married Hyacinth Walton (as she was back then) on 9 February 1963 and moved into 22 Blossom Avenue at a later date. Although the house is in his name, he does not have a [[key (lock)|key]] for it: Hyacinth has the only key. Until series three, he works as a [[civil servant]], a deputy in the [[Town Council]]'s Department of [[Finance]] and General Purposes. He dreads the idea of [[retirement]], as it would mean being with Hyacinth all day, every day for the rest of his life, but is forced into early retirement despite begging and pleading with his boss. After his early retirement, Hyacinth attempts to get Richard back into the workforce in a "senior executive position" in several jobs, but the attempts never succeed. In "The Senior Citizens' Outing", he is seen reading a [[self-help book]] titled, ''Can You Afford to Retire?'', suggesting he too is still eager to get back into the workforce.

A few times, Richard has stood up to Hyacinth in public because of her unreasonable behaviour, driving her into shock, but he is usually meek and mild in front of other people. He is not afraid to disagree with Hyacinth in private, however, and does so frequently, though she never listens and he always winds up capitulating to her whims. These usually involve contrived plots to impress neighbours or [[aristocracy|aristocrats]], or a far-fetched plan to avoid Hyacinth's down-market family, whom he actually prefers to the upper-class people Hyacinth is determined to mingle with. Whenever anyone asks how he manages to cope with Hyacinth, he often compares his marriage to being in the [[military|army]]: every day is routinely planned out for him, and he never has to make any decisions. He also points out that Hyacinth is extremely kind and caters to his every need. However, in "Please Mind Your Head", it is revealed that they are no longer intimate, as Hyacinth disapproves of it at their age, and in other episodes Richard indicates that Hyacinth lost interest in him once their son Sheridan was born.

Richard and Hyacinth own a blue 1986 [[Rover 216]], which Richard is often forced to polish, sometimes multiple times a day. He drives the car because Hyacinth has not learned to drive, but claims he only steers while Hyacinth drives by "word of mouth". A [[running gag]] of the series is that, besides directing every turn he makes, Hyacinth incessantly tells him to watch out for various people, animals, or objects that are on the side of the road or on the [[sidewalk|pavement]], as if they might suddenly leap out and block Richard's path. An exasperated Richard usually responds with "Minding the..." whatever it is, in a silly voice, which irritates Hyacinth.

Richard is an avid reader, and is often shown with a book in hand - he mentions to the vicar in "Let There Be Light" that he uses reading as an escape from Hyacinth, oftentimes reading in the [[bathroom]] to avoid interruption. However, while Richard protests otherwise, Hyacinth insists Richard's favourite hobby is [[gardening]], and forces him to work in the [[garden]] and look happy while doing so, hoping neighbours will think they could afford a [[gardener]] but don't have one because Richard likes doing it himself. Hyacinth twice tries to get him started in [[golf]], also to impress wealthy people, but Richard is no good at it. In "Richard's New Hobby", Hyacinth also tried to get him started in amateur [[cinematography]], but an unfortunate mishap involving the [[law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police]] put that to an end quickly. As shown in several episodes, Richard sings, and is actually a bit better at it than Hyacinth is, but he usually does not make a habit of singing unless asked to by someone else. In "The [[Father Christmas]] Suit", it was revealed he also knows how to play piano (Richard plays while he and Emmet drunkenly sing "[[Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer]]"). In "How to Go on Holiday Without Really Trying", Richard is shown to be excellent at [[billiards]], when Onslow "kidnaps" him and takes him to a local [[pub]].

[[Roy Clarke]], writer of the show, described Richard as a foil to show Hyacinth's character to worst advantage. Although various characters in the series often express bemusement as to Richard's tolerance for Hyacinth, the cast and crew observe that he simply loves her and that his sense of humour helps get him through.

===Daisy===
Daisy (played by [[Judy Cornwell]]) is the second-born of the Walton sisters. A happy, lively character, Daisy lives with her slobbish husband Onslow, her man-crazy sister Rose and their [[dementia|senile]] father. Her married surname is never given. Daisy, Onslow and Rose are the lower-class relatives Hyacinth is ashamed of. It is repeatedly mentioned that Daisy and Onslow were once very wild and passionate lovers, but Onslow has considerably cooled down with age. Daisy is constantly trying to get her husband to show passion towards her; however, she often fails to rouse any signs of affection from him save the odd compliment, and, as a result, buries herself in [[Mills &amp; Boon]] [[novel|novels]].

Her other attempts to get Onslow's attention include giving herself a makeover to attract the attention of other men, and getting herself a seventeen-year-old, [[motorcycle|motorbike]]-riding toy boy; however, Onslow was sensible enough to not fall for either of these. Much to Onslow's disbelief, Daisy repeatedly insists he is a "menace to the female sex" and is terrified of the thought of him possibly having another woman, or of other women (even Hyacinth) coming after him. In "A Celebrity for the Barbecue", she even likens him to [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. It is sometimes hinted that these claims are just attempts to rouse Onslow, however.

Daisy, like her husband, enjoys life in the slow lane; she spends most of her time sitting on the [[sofa]] eating, reading romance novels borrowed from the [[public library]], or watching [[television]]. Daisy is full of life and always smiling, despite picking up her husband's bad habits of sleeping until noon, eating junk food, drinking [[beer]] and watching television all day. She and Onslow are actually fairly well-educated, and often have philosophical discussions, but these never last long because she usually tries to turn the conversation to love fairly quickly.

Daisy tries to rein in Rose's dramatics, but her own flighty nature often gets in the way of these endeavours. She also has trouble keeping an eye on Daddy, and frequently has to ask Hyacinth for help when he goes off on one of his exploits, or does something outlandish at home. She makes half-hearted efforts to look nice around Hyacinth and tries to get Onslow to do the same, but usually fails. She also tries to rescue the Vicar and Emmett from Rose when she can. 

Daisy and Onslow have a daughter called Stephanie, who appeares only in the final episode of series one, along with her own daughter Kylie and two lovers. In "Let There Be Light", Daisy reveals she was once a [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] supporter, but changed loyalties because of Onslow's intense hatred for the team. A kindly soul at heart, Daisy does try to help Hyacinth when the latter reluctantly has to ask for help on occasion, but is rarely ever acknowledged or thanked. Like Onslow, although Hyacinth is ashamed of her, she gets along well with every other character she meets during the series thanks to her cheerful nature.

===Onslow===
Onslow's surname is never given. He is played by [[Geoffrey Hughes]], is Hyacinth's brother-in-law, and is a [[tattoo|tattooed]], beer-guzzling, unemployed and [[apathy|apathetic]] slob intensely despised by Hyacinth. Onslow threatens his sister-in-law's social prestige with his scruffy clothes and common, coarse ways. Onslow is proudly "workshy, bone idle and out of condition", and rarely gets up before lunch or dinner time. In multiple episodes, it is implied he was a bit wild in his youth, and it is suggested he may even have served time in [[prison]]&lt;ref&gt;Onslow references being reminded of "hard labour" in the episode ''Problems with Relatives''&lt;/ref&gt;, but he has considerably mellowed with age and is a gentle soul under his rough exterior.

He watches television all day every day, eating and drinking constantly and rarely moving from his [[armchair (furniture)|armchair]] save to go to the [[bookie|bookie's]] on occasion. He calls himself "the breadwinner", but his only income comes from [[gambling|betting]] on [[horse]]s and [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Social Security]]. Nevertheless, Onslow's intellectual reading, and viewing of [[Open University]] programmes, have made him knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects. He is also a fan of an unnamed [[soccer|football club]], though he is known to dislike [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] – so much so that he felt ready to [[divorce]] Daisy when she revealed on their honeymoon that she supported Liverpool. Very occasionally, he goes to the local [[pub]] to play [[billiards]] or [[darts]], once challenging Richard to play billiards and discovering Richard was actually better at it than he was. He also loves to eat, his favourite snack being Smoky [[Bacon]] [[Crisps]]. He owns both a [[bicycle]] and a 1978 [[Ford Cortina]], which is falling apart and tends to [[back-fire]] and belch dark clouds of [[exhaust gas|exhaust]].

Onslow owns a mixed-breed dog, which lives outside in the rusting carcass of a [[Hillman Avenger]] in the front garden. However, he indicates that this is the dog's preference and not neglect on his part, and in several episodes it is shown he does care deeply for the dog and treat her well. He is an inattentive husband to Daisy, in that he never takes her out, nor has he ever bought her any [[jewellery]] or clothing. However, he does compliment her on occasion, and the two seem fond of each other despite their issues. His sex drive has slackened off considerably since his youth, and Daisy's frequent efforts to arouse him are often in vain.

Despite Hyacinth's utter contempt of him and her belief that he cannot succeed at anything, in the [[Christmas]] special "Sea Fever", Onslow managed to win a [[newspaper]] competition, which earned him and Daisy a first-class vacation on the [[QE2]]. Hyacinth and Richard were also on board in a cheaper cabin at the time, and, while at first intensely jealous, Hyacinth swallowed her pride and kindly wished Onslow congratulations and danced with him in the ship's [[ballroom]]. Also, despite Hyacinth's usual mistreatment of him, Onslow is willing to help Hyacinth when she needs help (though often she would rather it was someone else than him) and even rescued her [[three-piece suite]] in the episode of the same name when the van carrying it crashed. He also admitted in "Riverside Picnic" that he admired Hyacinth's stiff upper lip when things went wrong. 

Hyacinth detests Onslow; however, he has no mean spirit and gets on well with almost everyone else, including his own [[vicar]], Hyacinth's vicar, Emmett, Elizabeth, Bruce and Violet. He is exasperated by Rose and Daddy on occasion, and thinks Daisy should not take their dramatics so seriously. Onslow is also good friends with Richard, nicknaming him "Dickie" much to Hyacinth's outrage (though Richard himself does not mind), and often tries to persuade him not to let Hyacinth browbeat him all the time. 

Onslow is - when he can overcome his inherent sloth - a very loving and kindly character, despite his appearance suggesting otherwise. He is Roy Clarke's favourite character in the show, as stated in the [[Comedy Connections]] series.

===Stephanie and Kylie===
Stephanie (played by Laura Shavin) is Daisy and Onslow's daughter and Hyacinth's niece. Her daughter, Daisy's and Onslow's granddaughter, is named Kylie and is [[infant baptism|christened]] in the episode "The Christening". Great-Aunt Hyacinth does not approve of the name Kylie, saying it sounds like a foreign [[vegetable]]. She also disapproves of the fact that Stephanie had her baby out of [[marriage|wedlock]], as do others, though she is the only one to make a point of her disapproval. However, when Stephanie and Kylie don't show up to the christening, Hyacinth and Richard volunteer to search for them and find that Stephanie's [[RV|caravan]] is broken down. They also are horrified to discover that she has become a [[hippie]] and lives in the caravan with two men, and has no idea which of the two men is Kylie's father. Even the men themselves don't know, and after delivering the trio to the [[church (building)|church]] for the christening, Hyacinth insists she and Richard hide behind a [[pillar|column]] in the church because she is so ashamed. 

Stephanie and Kylie are not seen again in the show, although in "Problems with Relatives", while pushing Daddy in a [[wheelchair]], Daisy says it reminds her of when she and Onslow used to push baby Stephanie in the [[Baby transport|pram]]. It also reminds them of why they had to bring the wedding forward, implying Daisy became [[pregnant]] out of wedlock as well.

=== Rose ===
Hyacinth's youngest, lustful sister, Rose has an eye for men and a taste for [[miniskirts|short skirts]] and flashy, provocative outfits. In the episode "Early Retirement", she reveals she was once married, though it is not stated whether she is [[widow|widowed]] or divorced. Her surname is also never given, though her maiden name is Walton like all the other sisters. She was played by [[Shirley Stelfox]] in series one and [[Mary Millar]] (whose performance was more over-the-top than Stelfox's) in every episode after that. She is another family member who threatens Hyacinth's social prestige, especially as the Vicar and Emmett are two of the men she sometimes chases. She even sometimes cosies up to Richard, though Hyacinth always puts a quick stop to that.

Rose is promiscuous, unstable, and prone to fits of [[hysteria]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]], some of which are genuine but most of which are merely attention-seeking tactics. However, Richard describes her as a gentle soul who is just a bit 'mixed up'. She is constantly having affairs with men, but her choice in men is poor and she often finds herself with married or otherwise unsuitable men who abandon her after a brief fling. Onslow has said more than once that her [[estrogen|hormones]] never get a chance to settle, which explains her outrageous behaviour. She has a penchant for stealing Onslow's [[cigarettes]], and for going into long tirades about men and their unfaithfulness. She regularly becomes 'disillusioned' and decides to 'give up men', sometimes several times in a week, but always has a new [[boyfriend|beau]] in record time. She is shown to be relatively uneducated, never reads, often speaks childishly, and cannot spell simple words.

Hyacinth is particularly ashamed of Rose, and at times goes to great lengths to keep her existence and their relationship a secret. But she does care for her, all the same. In the episode "[[Charity (practice)|Charity]] Shop", she stands and listens patiently as Rose confides to her about her dysfunctional love life. Hyacinth cheers her up and then kisses her on the cheek before sending her home. In "[[Iron Age]] Remains", when Rose has locked herself in a room in one of her depressive fits, Hyacinth panics that Rose may have harmed herself, especially when there is no answer at the door (in fact, Rose just had stereo [[headphones]] on and couldn't hear the people outside). She sends Richard up a [[ladder]] to investigate, but he falls off. Hyacinth also tries to stop a fight between Rose and one of her lovers in "A [[Picnic]] for Daddy", thinking he is a reputable member of society, though she changes her mind and tells the man to stop bothering Rose when she realises she had mistaken his identity and that he was indeed another of Rose's bad choices in men.

=== Violet and Bruce ===
Violet (played by [[Anna Dawson]]) is the third-eldest of the Walton sisters, who married a successful but eccentric [[turf accountant]] named Bruce (played by John Evitts). A sign outside their house reads "The Paddocks", but it is not revealed if this refers to their surname or is the name of their property. Violet and Bruce were initially [[unseen characters]], apart from the occasional glimpse from a distance, but in the fifth series, both Bruce and Violet became regulars on the show.

Bruce and Violet are extremely wealthy. Hyacinth often brags that Violet and Bruce have a [[mansion|large house]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[sauna]], [[jacuzzi]], [[swimming pool]], musical [[bidet]], and room for a [[pony]]. They also have a [[cottage]] in the [[rural|countryside]], and a [[villa]] in [[Ibiza]]. However, Violet has a troubled marriage with her eccentric, [[cross-dressing]] husband, and repeatedly phones Hyacinth to complain about Bruce's mad behaviour. Bruce often confiscates Violet's clothes in order to wear them himself, leaving her with his clothes. He also has had an affair with his [[secretary]], and has done other unsuitable things such as refusing to come down out of a tree, [[alcoholism|drinking to excess]], [[cosplay|wearing strange costumes]], throwing childish tantrums over trivial things, and buying lots of nude artwork. In "The Toy Store", Richard remarks that Bruce is supposed to be on some sort of medication but it's implied he often does not take it. However, despite everything, Hyacinth insists that Violet put up with Bruce for the luxurious lifestyle his wealth gives her, particularly the Mercedes. 

While Violet is obviously far more affluent than Hyacinth, she is not the snob Hyacinth is. She is far more accepting of Daisy, Onslow and Rose than Hyacinth, in that she is not embarrassed by them. In "Riverside Picnic", when told by Hyacinth to find a friend "in the same income bracket" to drive her, Violet calls Onslow and invites her father and sisters to [[gatecrashing|gate-crash]] Hyacinth's "waterside supper with riparian entertainments". 

Although continually bragging about Violet to her friends, Hyacinth cannot use Violet and Bruce to her full advantage, as she often cannot introduce them to friends and neighbours due to their volatile marriage and Bruce's costumes. On the odd occasion, Hyacinth has invited Violet to her candlelight suppers (which Violet does not enjoy any more than anyone else), and it is implied the main reason Hyacinth invites Violet and Bruce around is because she likes to have their [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] in her driveway. 

In the episode "A Barbecue at Violet's", when Hyacinth and Richard arrive at Violet's home, they arrive in the middle of a vicious domestic row, in which Violet and Bruce are arguing loudly and hurling objects at each other. By "Skis", Violet eventually wants to divorce Bruce, but Hyacinth frog-marches her distraught sister to the vicar to try to change her mind, determined not to lose her one genuine connection to a higher class. Richard is shown to not be fond of Violet, remarking how she is "always moaning", nor is he fond of Bruce and his eccentricities.

=== Daddy ===
Daddy (played by [[George Webb (actor)|George Webb]]) is the apparently [[dementia|senile]], divorced father of Hyacinth, Daisy, Rose and Violet; the prequel ''Young Hyacinth'' reveals his wife ran off with an [[United States of America|American]]. He lives with Onslow, Daisy and Rose. Hyacinth repeatedly makes bizarre excuses as to why he can't live with her (one being that he brings Sheridan out in a [[rash]]), and Daisy herself remarks in "Angel Gabriel Blue" that to punish Daddy by making him live with Hyacinth would be inhumane. Hyacinth loves her father dearly; however, his antics and constant requirement for attention put her social standing at risk. She tends to make up outlandish stories to explain his behavior to other people.  It is often said by Richard that the rundown neighborhood that Daddy lives in is the one he has lived in all his life, therefore revealing that Hyacinth grew up in the grubby, decrepit area she loathes visiting. 

While mentally senile, Daddy is still quite capable physically, and seems unable to keep himself out of trouble. He is fit enough to climb onto [[roof|roofs]], ride a [[skateboard]], steal [[car|cars]], dig [[trenches]], ride [[bicycle]]s, and wander all over the countryside - all of which he has done, usually causing some embarrassment to his family in the process. Rose apparently inherited her promiscuous streak from him, as he is constantly ogling, pursuing, and accosting women, sometimes promising to marry them. He also [[flashback (psychology)|relives experiences]] from his younger days, such as his childhood and his service in [[World War I|the war]], and in those moments he will assume the character of his younger self in the clothes he wears and the actions he takes. He often goes missing, and requires the rescue efforts of his daughters and sons-in-law. He has a medication which makes him very drowsy (and therefore manageable) when given, but whenever it wears off, he starts causing trouble again. 

Daddy's screen appearances are somewhat rare, and his spoken lines even more so. Although his given name is unknown, his surname is revealed to be Walton in ''Young Hyacinth''.

=== Sheridan Bucket ===
An [[unseen character]], Sheridan is Hyacinth's and Richard's spoiled and selfish only son, about 18 years of age. He is away at college (a [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|poly]] which Hyacinth insists is of a "[[university]] standard" - the first three series were written before the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]]) and is known to audiences primarily through Hyacinth's telephone conversations with him. 

The major [[running gag]] surrounding Sheridan involves him ringing home whenever he needs money, Hyacinth without fail assuming at first that he is "just ringing his mummy" - despite his age, she still refers to herself and Richard as "mummy and daddy". Most of the time, he needs money for ludicrous things that his friend Tarquin has suggested, up to and including a walking holiday in [[Iceland]]. 

Although Sheridan usually convinces Hyacinth of his need for the money (much to Richard's exasperation), Hyacinth is very occasionally able to say no. Hyacinth claims Sheridan writes to her constantly, and often expects to receive letters from him, but Sheridan rarely gets in touch unless he wants money. Only once in the series did Sheridan do something for his parents; in the episode "What to Wear When Yachting", he arranged a weekend for Hyacinth and Richard on a small [[yacht]] owned by Tarquin's father.

Sheridan prefers not to talk to Richard on the phone, and has been known to pretend to be someone else whenever he calls and Richard answers. The other running gag is that Richard suspects Sheridan is gay, something which is implied through his love of [[needlework]], his [[lilac]]-colored car, his desire for pure [[silk]] [[pyjamas]], his male friend, Tarquin (with whom Sheridan makes his own [[curtains]]), and his stated disinterest in girls. Richard regularly tries to raise the issue with Hyacinth, only for her to remain totally oblivious. 

A glimpse of the back of Sheridan's head can be seen in the episode "Let There Be Light" while he is in a [[Taxicab|taxi]], and during the opening credits, a [[photograph]] of him as a young boy is seen on Hyacinth's [[writing desk]]; this is the closest he has ever been seen on the show.

==Neighbours==

=== Elizabeth 'Liz' Warden ===
Elizabeth Warden (née Hawksworth) is Hyacinth's friendly, tolerant next-door neighbour who lives at number 24 Blossom Avenue. She has a brother, Emmett, who moves in with her in Season 2. She is played by [[Josephine Tewson]]. Hyacinth calls her Elizabeth, but everyone else calls her Liz. Hyacinth often invites her round for [[coffee]], and despite frequent encouragement from her brother, Liz is too weak-willed to say no despite living in fear of Hyacinth's invitations. 

Aware of Hyacinth's house-proud ways, Elizabeth is terrified of spilling, dropping or breaking anything in her neighbour's home, but ironically, Hyacinth's flighty mannerisms and nagging make Liz especially clumsy in her presence, and she indeed ends up spilling, dropping or breaking something nearly every time. 

Unlike most, Liz [[sympathy|sympathises]] with Hyacinth, aware of how she is despised by everyone, including Liz's brother Emmet. She is likely Hyacinth's only real friend (although she makes a point of referring to Hyacinth as a "neighbour" rather than a friend). This friendship is tested by Hyacinth's tactless and unthinking remarks, which usually involve Elizabeth's [[dexterity]], clothes, car, appearance, and her daughter's intelligence. Liz likes Richard quite dearly, and has deep sympathy for him; the two seem discreetly fond of each other. Liz feels pity for Hyacinth's and Richard's son, Sheridan, as well, believing "he never really stood a chance" with Hyacinth for a mother. Liz is also unsure whether to be amused by or disapproving of her brother's frequent attempts to avoid and/or exact revenge on Hyacinth. 

Liz's husband Mr Warden is never seen: he is always away due to his work (he is variously mentioned as being in the [[Far East]] or in [[Saudi Arabia]]). In "Onslow's Birthday", it is implied that Liz and her husband were having marriage troubles, which is what prompted him to take the position abroad. They have a daughter, Gail, who is also never seen but mentioned in conversation in a few early episodes. Gail grew up friends with Sheridan, but unlike Sheridan she goes to a proper [[university]] and is trying to make something of herself. Hyacinth seems a bit jealous of Gail's success as compared to her son's, and sometimes finds reasons to put her down (such as having a live-in boyfriend) when she is mentioned.

While Elizabeth did eventually meet and become friends with Rose, Onslow, and Daisy in "Problems with Relatives", Hyacinth did her best to prevent this happening and afterwards would still go to great lengths to prevent her from seeing their shabby house. Both parties have offered lifts for the other when one is stranded on the side of the road, and have met on other occasions as well. Onslow even jokingly kissed Liz under the [[mistletoe]] in the episode "The Father Christmas Suit", which prompted an inebriated Richard to do the same. 

Liz owns a white 1988 [[Austin Metro]], which appeared in most episodes and was also subject to tactless comments from Hyacinth about its age and appearance, even though Hyacinth's own car is older.

===Emmet Hawksworth===
Emmet, played by [[David Griffin (actor)|David Griffin]], made his first appearance in "A Strange Man", and appeared in nearly every subsequent episode. At first, Hyacinth and Richard thought he was Liz's illicit lover, but later found out he was her brother who moved in after he reportedly &lt;ref&gt;Emmett claims to have lost his house in the divorce, but in more than one episode it is stated his wife ran away with another man and was the one at fault, so why he should lose his house is left an unresolved mystery.&lt;/ref&gt; lost his own house in a messy [[divorce]].

Emmet is a cultured person, unlike most of Hyacinth's acquaintances. He [[equestrianism|rides horses]], enjoys working in the [[garden]], and has a fondness for [[sherry]] (occasionally over-imbibing, which Liz chides him for). He is a classically trained [[pianist]], as well as both [[theatrical producer|producer]] and [[theatre director|director]] for the local amateur [[opera|operatic society]]. He is also shown to have a fair singing voice, himself. Richard suggests that Emmett probably makes a good [[salary]] for his talents. Hyacinth, who always wanted to be on the stage, frequently sings at Emmet, and drops broad hints that he should include her in his work, but to no avail.

Emmet is, like most [[artists]], very temperamental. He has a tendency to be somewhat [[melodramatic]] (though not to the same extent as Rose), and is terrified of leaving the house because of Hyacinth's terrible singing and even worse [[manners]] being enough to "ruin his day." He develops a stronger aversion to Hyacinth than just about any other main character does, to the point he burst into tears when told they were going to visit Hyacinth when the latter was out of town in the episode "Violet's Country Cottage". He also frequently falls or hurts himself trying to run to escape her.

In "Singing for Emmett", Emmet explosively loses his temper at Hyacinth, only to realize Hyacinth is completely oblivious to it. Therefore, in later episodes, he frequently says nasty things about her practically to her face, because this incident taught him she doesn't listen and won't hear him. Emmett also begins to seek out ways to get back at Hyacinth for the misery she causes himself and Elizabeth. In "Let There Be Light", he and the Vicar's wife contrive to leave Hyacinth outside the church hall during the [[Bring and Buy sale]] to meet a wealthy guest (who happens to own two disagreeable [[dogs]], but Hyacinth doesn't know this). In "Hyacinth Is Alarmed", Emmett makes a point to call Hyacinth and tell her when the house across the street is [[burglary|burgled]] twice, because he knows Hyacinth will be [[jealousy|jealous]] that the burglars thought there were better pickings at the Barker-Finches than at her own house. Arguably, his most famous revenge against Hyacinth came in "Please Mind Your Head", when he discovered Hyacinth was dressed in riding gear to impress the neighbors. He forced her to actually ride a horse to prove she could, taking great delight in her horrible attempts to mount and get the horse started, but showing some [[remorse]] when the horse threw her and nearly injured her. 

In the latter years of the programme, Hyacinth can no longer ignore the fact Emmett is desirous to avoid her, but assumes he's shy and possibly has a romantic attraction to her. Upon hearing this, Emmet says, "I think I want to die!" Emmett is often pursued by Rose as well, because she believes him handsome. Emmett is initially flattered by Rose's attentions, even showing some attraction to her, but eventually comes to fear her as well because of how eagerly she forces herself on him. 

Like Liz, Emmett deeply sympathizes with Richard. He and Emmett become friends early on, and Emmett is one of the few people who can get Richard to do something silly or unbecoming without Hyacinth being too upset, such as going to a [[pub]] in "Hyacinth is Alarmed". Emmett also is shown in several episodes to be friendly with Onslow, despite Hyacinth's initial attempts to keep them apart. 

In the special features of the complete [[DVD]] collection of the series, it is revealed that David Griffin was being treated for [[cancer]] during much of the series' run. In later seasons, Emmett is noticeably much thinner and seems to have aged, because of this, though the show explains it as his having gotten prison pallor from hiding indoors from Hyacinth all the time. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0619136/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious people==

===Michael Partridge (the vicar)===
Michael (played by [[Jeremy Gittins]]) is the young and handsome [[vicar]] of [[St. Mark]]'s [[Church of England|Church]], which Richard and Hyacinth attend. Like most, he is terrified of Hyacinth, and does his best to avoid her, often unsuccessfully. Moreover, he often forgets that Hyacinth prefers her last name to be pronounced "bouquet" and addresses her as "Mrs Bucket". When he's discussing Hyacinth with his wife, they refer to her as "the Bucket woman". 

He first arrived in the [[parish]] in "The New Vicar", after being a [[prison]] [[chaplain]] for an unspecified amount of time (as referenced in "A Picnic for Daddy"). He is called "that dishy vicar" by Rose, who often pursues him, much to the anger of his jealous wife, who dislikes the fact that the majority of Michael's [[church (congregation)|congregation]] are women who make a fuss of him. The vicar being caught in compromising positions (which in context are quite innocent) with Rose or other women is a recurring gag in the series, as is the Vicar damaging whatever he's holding/using whenever Hyacinth's name is mentioned. However, despite his dislike, he feels it his duty to be sympathetic to Hyacinth most of the time, trying to rescue her from the [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]'s amorous advances in "The Commodore" and agreeing to help her with her [[kitchen]] dilemma in "[[Angel Gabriel]] Blue". He also twice stops to offer Hyacinth and Richard lifts when he spots them stranded on the side of the road, and agrees to try to counsel her sister Violet in the episode "[[Skis]]", though Violet is unwilling to go through with it. 

The vicar likes Onslow and Daisy and is always glad to see them, and more than once has been to their house to help with various issues (such as a [[ghost]] in Daddy's [[bedroom]], or Rose being depressed). However, he has made no secret of the fact he dislikes Hyacinth's father, famously standing up to Hyacinth in the episode "The Father Christmas Suit" to demand she take her inebriated and nearly-nude father away from the church Christmas gathering 'as soon as possible'. 

Only once did the vicar try to exact revenge on Hyacinth, in the episode "Senior Citizen's Outing". He saddled her with the two most difficult seniors to deal with, telling his wife he'd 'make up for it on Sunday'.

===Mrs Partridge (the vicar's wife)===
Married to the vicar, Mrs Partridge (played by [[Marion Barron]]) is usually referred to as "dear" by her husband. She is a timid yet fiery young woman with a soft [[Scotland|Scottish]] accent. She often finds her husband in compromising positions with Rose, whom she nicknames 'the [[vamp (woman)|vampire]] sister', or other young females and incorrectly assumes the worst. These situations are usually prefaced in an earlier scene where she expresses [[jealousy]] over the attention that Michael's female parishioners give him.

The vicar's wife initially dislikes Hyacinth, but as the series goes on, she grows to see more [[humour]] in some of Hyacinth's behaviour than other characters do. She has been seen to stifle fits of [[laughter]] at Hyacinth's suggestion of leaving sick parishioners outside while the vicar attends a party of Hyacinth's, and on another occasion merrily bobbed her head in time to Hyacinth's horrendous singing. She also is the only person who seems willing (instead of forced) to go on Hyacinth's little expedition in "Riverside Picnic".

Mrs. Partridge, like Emmett, has frequently attempted various small revenges against Hyacinth. In "How to Go On Holiday Without Really Trying", she deliberately tricked Hyacinth into cleaning the [[toilets]] in the church hall all by herself, and in "Let There Be Light", she assigned Hyacinth to the booth farthest away from anyone else in the church [[Bring and Buy sale]]. Furthermore, in the same episode, she and Emmett contrived to get Hyacinth to stay outside and wait for Mrs. Drummond and her disagreeable dogs, instead of helping set up the sale.

===The other vicar===
The other vicar (played by [[Gerald Sim]]) had a single appearance in the episode "The [[infant baptism|Christening]]".  He is of an older appearance than Michael the vicar, and his [[Church (building)|church]] is located at a different location from Michael's.  He is Onslow and Daisy's friend and likes to joke around with them.

==Other townspeople==

===Michael the postman===
Michael the [[postman]] was played by Leo Dolan in the first series and by [[David Janson]] from 1992 on. He is impertinent, high-strung, and completely overwhelmed by Hyacinth Bucket, of whom he lives in fear. He would rather avoid her, but tries to stand up to her when she pounces on him, which is every time he delivers (and occasionally throws) [[mail]] to her house. She constantly makes sure she takes all [[letter (message)|letters]] in person, never allowing him to put them in the [[letter box|letterbox]] itself and sternly rebuking him when he tries to do so. She frequently makes impossible demands of him, such as letting her see Elizabeth's mail, or switching all second class stamps on her letters to first class [[postage stamp|stamps]], or having him track down [[packaging and labeling|packages]] or letters that were never actually sent. He tries many techniques to not speak to Hyacinth, but all fail. In later episodes he develops a bad [[tic|twitch]], and he openly tells Hyacinth it is her fault, but she seems not to notice. He is the father of seven children.

===The milkman===
Played by Robert Rawles, the unnamed [[Milkman]] is in the same position as Michael the Postman, in that he constantly sneaks about doing his level best to avoid speaking to Hyacinth. Like the postman, he always fails, and usually finds himself bombarded with ridiculous requests such as finding out which specific [[cows]] the [[milk]] comes from and making sure Hyacinth receives the exact same [[bottles]] every time. He and the postman consider themselves fellow brothers in affliction, and celebrate whenever Hyacinth is on holiday. However, unlike the postman, the milkman never loses his cool with Hyacinth and is not afraid of her, merely annoyed by her.

=== Major Wilton-Smythe ===
[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Wilton-Smythe (played by [[Peter Cellier]]), commonly known simply as "the major", only appears in the first two series, and hopelessly lusts after Hyacinth even though he is married to a never-seen wife, whom he refers to as "the [[ball and chain]]". 

He fought in [[World War II]] and is a veteran of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[North African Campaign]] against [[Erwin Rommel]]. The Major lives in a large house called The [[Laurels]], which is just around the corner from Hyacinth and Richard's [[bungalow]]. In "[[golf|Golfing]] with the Major", he reveals he was wounded in the leg somewhere east of [[Suez]], and he still has "some poxy foreign [[bullet|lead]] in there somewhere". He pretends to limp on this injury when he wants to get out of doing something he doesn't like, walking normally whenever people aren't watching.

He is brash and forceful, and disliked by Richard. In particular, Richard finds it odd that an elderly man like the major prefers whizzing about in a two-seat sports car convertible rather than driving in presumably a more sensible car - the major drives a [[Morgan Plus 4]]. 

Despite his irritating behaviour, his upper-class status means that Hyacinth refuses to sever contact with the man. At one point she admits "it's a good thing he's a Major... if he were a Sergeant, he wouldn't get a foot past the door!"

===Mrs Councillor Nugent===
Mrs Nugent (played by [[Charmian May]]) is high up the [[social ladder]] but low down the [[Charisma|charismatic]] scale, being a dull, bad-tempered and ill-mannered woman. She speaks in an overly loud and militaristic tone and goes on unnecessary tirades about "excessive romantic behaviour" and wasting [[money]]. Despite her dislike of romance, however, she thinks it would be fun to be a part of the [[film industry]], and dons a skimpy costume when she thinks Richard is filming an amateur [[movie]] in "Richard's New Hobby".

She also seems to be the only person who can get away with referring to Hyacinth as "Mrs Bucket" without Hyacinth correcting her. In "The Toy Store", when Mrs Nugent yells "Mrs Bucket", Hyacinth can be seen mouthing out "It's Bouquet", meaning she still wants to correct her, but stifles it. 

Hyacinth tolerates her, not only because of her status, but also because she wants a place on her [[committee]]. The committee itself is never identified, nor it is clear if Mrs Nugent or her husband is the [[Councillor]]. Hyacinth admits that she doesn't know what the committee does, she just wants a seat on it.

===Sonia Barker-Finch===
Sonia Barker-Finch lives in the same street as Hyacinth, just opposite her own home in Number 23, Villa Costa Blanca. Above all her other acquaintances, Hyacinth is convinced that Mrs Barker-Finch is her greatest social rival; however, Mrs Barker-Finch does not seek to outdo Hyacinth in any way, and generally wants nothing to do with her at all. She is referred to in many episodes, but only makes an (uncredited) appearance in the episode "Driving Mrs. Fortescue", appearing on the [[sidewalk]] with a friend just in time to see Hyacinth embarrassingly trapped on the back of a moving [[lorry]].

Although Hyacinth invites
Mrs Barker-Finch to parties and dinners, Mrs Barker-Finch usually declines. She also had the temerity to talk while Hyacinth was singing, once, firmly making her an enemy of Hyacinth's. Hyacinth hypocritically believes Mrs Barker-Finch to be a [[snob]] ("She was a Barker, he was a Finch, now suddenly they're hyphenated") and is determined to get one up on her at every opportunity. 

She also believes Mrs Barker-Finch is inferior to her. In "Hyacinth is Alarmed", when Hyacinth hears that Mrs Barker-Finch has been burgled twice, rather than sympathise with her, she accuses Mrs Barker-Finch of being "pretentious", and opines that only a "low-class burglar" would rob Number 23. Hyacinth furthermore becomes unreasonably jealous whenever Mrs Barker-Finch has some form of social success and becomes adamant that she will do better than her. This was best exampled in the episode "A [[Celebrity]] for the [[Barbecue]]", when Mrs. Barker-Finch invited a prominent businessman to her house. Hyacinth went to great lengths to throw a barbecue with a more distinguished celebrity.

In "Three Piece Suite", Hyacinth ordered a [[three-piece suite]] that was "an exact [[replica]] of the one at [[Sandringham House]]", and went to extraordinary lengths to ensure Mrs Barker-Finch saw it being delivered by "The [[van]] with the [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrant]] on it", such as repeatedly phoning her so that she would have to come to the [[window]] and see the delivery van pull up. An ill-timed phone call from Sheridan to ask for money fouled the plan up, and Richard had to pay the van to drive away and come back. Unfortunately, the van was seen to crash into a [[road verge|verge]] shortly thereafter, and Daisy and Onslow's hired lorry turned up just as this happened. This resulted in them delivering the three-piece suite to Hyacinth's house instead, which Mrs. Barker-Finch presumably saw (much to Hyacinth's dismay).

===Delia Wheelwright===
Delia Wheelright is another unseen rival of Hyacinth. Her rivalry with Hyacinth forms the central plot for the episode 'How To Go On Holiday Without Really Trying'. At the beginning of the episode, Hyacinth is talking to Delia Wheelright on the phone. We do not hear the other side of the conversation, but it is revealed that the former is going on an expensive holiday to [[the Caribbean]]. 

Although she does not express it on the telephone, Hyacinth is greatly put out by this and sets out to better her. Hyacinth drags Richard into town to visit some [[travel agency|travel agencies]] and inquire about holidays, though not the cheap sort of holiday that 'caters to the [[spaghetti]] and [[french fries|chips]] brigade". Of course the Buckets cannot afford to pay for any of the expensive holidays, but Hyacinth grabs information regarding trips for the [[Orient Express]] and the [[QE2]] (the latter trip being one they actually save up to take in the 1994 [[Christmas]] special). On the way home, Hyacinth deliberately drops the [[brochures]] out of the car window in front of some friends of Delia Wheelright, in the hope that they will see the brochures and the news gets back to her that Hyacinth is going on an expensive holiday. As usual the plan comes to nothing as the friends in question take no notice.

===Lydia Hawksworth===
Another of Hyacinth's social rivals, Lydia Hawksworth (actress uncredited) earned Hyacinth's ire during one of her [[candle|candlelight]] suppers, when she obnoxiously commented that Hyacinth's [[kiwi fruit]] were "lower middle-class", and further rubbed Hyacinth up the wrong way by boasting about her recent holiday in [[Corfu]]. By this behaviour, it can be assumed that she too is as snobbish as Hyacinth. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that she may be either Emmet's ex-wife or some other relation of Elizabeth and Emmet.

In the episode, "The [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]]", Hyacinth was outraged at losing to Lydia in a flower arranging contest, and even further dismayed that Lydia had acquired a flashy new [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. She then began a scheme to show her up, by visiting an exclusive garage and convincing the owner to let her "test drive" a Rolls Royce. 

However, Hyacinth badgered Richard into driving the Rolls out to the country club where Mrs Hawksworth often went, and the vehicle was reported as stolen. Hyacinth was apprehended by [[police officers]] as soon as Mrs Hawksworth arrived, much to the latter's glee.

=== Mrs Fortescue ===
Mrs Fortescue (played by [[Jean Anderson]]) is the irascible, bossy and inconsiderate [[widow]] of a wealthy businessman who is a parishioner at the Buckets' church. Her sister is married to a [[baronet]], which leads Hyacinth to perform favours for her even if they are inconvenient to her and Richard, with hopes of socializing with members of the nobility. She appeared in "Driving Mrs. Fortescue".

Mrs Fortescue asks for a lift into town - as she has had her own [[driving license]] revoked for [[speeding]] - and Hyacinth goes to enormous lengths to impress her, even forcing Richard to rehearse how he is going to ring her [[doorbell]]. Richard is not fond of Mrs Fortescue because she hits him with her [[walking stick]]. Much to Hyacinth's dismay, Mrs Fortescue accidentally meets Rose, Daisy and Onslow, and gets on extremely well with them.

===The two Miss Pillsworths===
Miss Pillsworth and Miss Pillsworth (played by Lois Penson and [[Clare Kelly]]) are two elderly spinster sisters that appear in the series 5 episode 'Skis'. They are from a rather posh and "very old" family, their late father having been a [[Colonel]]. Hyacinth and Richard drive through town, and on the way they pass the two Miss Pillsworths and, despite the lack of space in the car and the fact that both dislike Hyacinth and are reluctant to travel with her, manage to persuade the two women to take a lift. However, Hyacinth insists they detour through the beautiful neighborhood Violet lives in before letting them out of the car, prompting the elder Miss Pillsworth to fear they've been kidnapped. Later on in the same episode, the sisters run away when they see Hyacinth coming, afraid she'll insist on giving them another lift.

===The Thorgunbys===
Mr Reginald 'Reggie' Thorgunby (played by Mark Brackenbury) was Richard's superior in the Department of Finance and General Purposes. In "The Father Christmas Suit", it was Hyacinth's intention to have Mr Thorgunby and his wife Fiona (played by Annette Peters) around for [[mulled wine]] and hot [[mince pie]]s so that they could discuss the conditions of Richard's early retirement. Unfortunately for her, a series of mishaps involving a drunken Richard, a disguised Elizabeth, and a semi-naked Daddy caused the Thorgunbys to give up on the idea of a Christmas visit and drive back home.

Earlier on in the episode, Hyacinth phoned the Thorgunby's house. She was surprised to have a timid childish voice answer at the other end. Believing it to be a child, Hyacinth told the person to "run along, poppet, and tell your Mummy Mrs Thorgunby that there is a nice lady wanting to speak with her". However, it turned out that Hyacinth was speaking to Mrs Thorgunby.

===The Millburns===
Mr. Millburn (Played by [[Frederick Jaeger]]) is the owner of Frosticles [[Frozen Food]] [[factory]], and a neighbour of Hyacinth and Richard. His unseen wife is a member of the Ladies' Luncheon Committee along with Hyacinth, and Hyacinth dislikes her, calling her a "thrusting creature." Hyacinth and Richard tend to refer to the Millburns as Mr. and Mrs. Frosticles instead of their actual names. Their acquaintance is only slight, as Richard forgot who they were for a time, and Millburn had no recollection at all of who Hyacinth and Richard were. He was shown as a not-very-bright man, who valued stupidity as a quality and who enjoyed golfing.

In "A Job for Richard", Millburn announced an open senior executive position at his factory. Hyacinth schemed with Onslow to get Richard the job, roping a reluctant Richard into it. The scheme involved Onslow pretending to be a hoodlum and Richard pretending to subdue him, to impress Millburn. The arrival of two real hoodlums (which Hyacinth had to chase off herself) messed up the plan, and Millburn offered the job to Hyacinth instead, though she refused.

===The Cooper-Bassets===
The Cooper-Bassets (Mr. Cooper-Basset was played by [[Derek Waring]], Mrs. Cooper-Basset was uncredited) were a wealthy married couple, who liked [[amusement park]]s, having met on a [[Dark ride|ghost train]]. They appeared in "[[old age|Senior Citizen's]] Outing." Hyacinth, Richard, and Elizabeth ran into them while escorting some senior citizens on an outing to the [[beach|seaside]]. Hyacinth initially wanted to meet up with them, but they went out of their way to avoid her. However, the tables were turned when the Cooper-Bassets showed up a second time while Hyacinth was dealing with an embarrassing situation with one of the senior citizens, and she tried to avoid them, but without success.

===Signor Farrini and Mrs. Lomax===
Appearing only in "Senior Citizen's Outing", Signor Farrini (played by [[Angus Lennie]]) and Mrs. Lomax (played by Rita Davies) were the two senior citizens Hyacinth was to escort to the outing at the beach. The vicar, knowing full well they were the two most difficult to manage of the group, deliberately saddled Hyacinth with them and told his wife that he knew it was wicked and that he would 'make up for it on Sunday'.

Signor Farrini was a senile, elderly [[Italy|Italian]] gentleman, who was almost instantly enamored with Hyacinth. He did everything in his power to follow her around and express his love, even going so far as to [[handcuff]] himself and Hyacinth together when she wasn't looking. Mrs. Lomax was an even older lady, who suffered from severe [[motion sickness]], to the point she would even begin to feel sick in anticipation of getting in the car and would require stops every few miles to prevent her from [[vomit|vomiting]]. She also had a gluttonous appetite for [[candy|sweets]] and [[ice cream]].

===Mrs. Drummond===
Mrs. Drummond (played by [[Sue Lloyd]]) appeared in "Let There Be Light" and was a wealthy and very inconsiderate parishioner of Michael the vicar, and another person Hyacinth tried to impress. Her family lived on an estate called "The Grange", and Hyacinth always introduced them as "The Drummonds. From the Grange, you know." She had two ill-behaved [[Labrador retrievers]] who despised Hyacinth, but Hyacinth pretended not to notice, since Mrs. Drummond had said she had no time for anyone who disliked dogs. Mrs. Drummond would watch while other people worked, and was very much so a snob.

===Bunty and Dorian===
Bunty and Dorian (played by Marcia Warren and Royce Mills) were two extremely eccentric neighbors of Bruce and Violet, who appeared in "Violet's Country Cottage". They lived in a [[manor house]] next door to the aforementioned cottage, but whether they actually were [[aristocracy]] or not was not mentioned. They tended to dress in shabby [[yokel]]-like clothing and behaved very oddly, as befits friends of the equally eccentric Bruce, whom Bunty referred to as "The Weirdo". Bunty enjoyed [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]], [[hunting]] and [[shooting]]. She first met Hyacinth while looking for her lost dog (Hyacinth and Richard were staying in the cottage at the time). Richard met up with her husband Dorian while helping to look for the missing dog at Hyacinth's behest, and brought Dorian back to the cottage with him. Bunty quickly became drunk and Dorian started to pursue Hyacinth amorously, which amused Bunty to no end. For once, Hyacinth did not act snobbish but went with the flow, and the three of them danced a [[conga line]] at the end of the episode.

===Zoe Zbygn (Mrs. Thing)===
Zoe Zbygn made an uncredited appearance in the episode "Violet's Country Cottage". She was an elderly lady from [[Poland]] who spoke no English. While all the other characters could spell her surname, no one could figure out how to pronounce it. Daisy finally settled on "Mrs. Thing", which the other characters (even Hyacinth) also called her. She was Daddy's girlfriend for a time, and accompanied Daddy, Daisy, Onslow, and Rose to the cottage to visit Hyacinth. She seemed a mostly [[deadpan]] individual until she heard Richard calling her name, which made her excitedly leave Daddy's side and act amorously toward Richard. In actuality, Richard was calling Bunty's lost dog, who was also named Zoe.

===The Commodore===
The [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] (played by [[Nigel Davenport]]) appeared in the episode "The Commodore" and was an old [[seafaring]] man who became famous sailing round [[Cape Horn]] singlehandedly. He retired from the [[sea]] and made a living going around as a guest speaker at events. Hyacinth went to great lengths to meet and impress him, and volunteered the Vicar to give him a ride back to the [[train station]] after the Commodore had given a speech. The Commodore had a notorious reputation with the ladies, including a [[scandal]]ous divorce. Hyacinth ignored warnings about him, enamored with the prospect of meeting a Commodore, until he tried to seduce her in the back seat of the Vicar's car. The Vicar tried to rescue the terrified Hyacinth by offering to let her out of the car, but because stopping would mean the Commodore would miss his [[locomotive|train]] (and be stuck with her!) Hyacinth told him to keep driving.

===His Lordship===
Never named, and played by [[Bruce Montague]], His Lordship was a suave and wealthy [[peerage|peer]] who lived on a large estate some miles out in the country from Hyacinth's house. He was said to be the son of the deceased [[Dowager]] [[Lady]] Ursula. He was one of the kindliest, most considerate characters in the series.

In "Country House Sale", Hyacinth first met His Lordship in the large drive of his mansion, at the [[estate sale]] of his late mother. Hyacinth, unaware to whom she was speaking, asked him for directions, which he happily gave her. Later, she overheard a [[servant]] address him as 'Milord' and realized who she was talking to. After the estate sale had concluded, Hyacinth, who had bought several bottles of homemade [[fruit wine|wine]] in the sale, sought out his Lordship, and the two seemed to get along well together. They shared a [[toast (honor)|toast]] to the late Dowager Lady Ursula, but the wine was too strong for Hyacinth, who promptly became hopelessly drunk. However, His Lordship was very nice about the whole business, blaming the wine and not Hyacinth and helping Richard get his confused wife safely back to the car.

===Sir Edward===
In the episode "Looking at Properties", Hyacinth and Richard briefly [[lease]]d a second home in the form of a [[apartment|flat]] in the roof of a large manor house, and were neighbours to Sir Edward (played by [[John Arnatt]]). He lived on the ground floor, and spent most of his time snoozing in a [[wheelchair]] with his [[gout]]y foot propped up. He took an instant dislike to Hyacinth when the first thing she did was inadvertently bump into his gouty foot, and barely spoke to her after that incident.

===Mrs. Braddock===
Seen only in "Country Estate Sale", Mrs. Braddock (played by Jessica James) is a senile older woman who attends Senior Lunches with Daddy and who [[stalker|stalks]] his house and insists he [[proposal (marriage)|proposed]] to her, though Daddy remembers only offering her a "temporary arrangement". Rose and Daisy imply she's stalked their house before, but only one instance is shown, in which she shoos Onslow's dog away from the old car she naps in, and takes her place, waiting outside to nab Daddy. She causes Onslow to fall into the [[hedge]] (parodying a recurring gag of Hyacinth doing the same whenever the dog barks) by jumping out and yelling "Oi!" at him. She also scares Hyacinth into the hedge when she arrives later in the episode.

===Mr. Mawsby===
Mr. Mawsby (played by [[Preston Lockwood]]) appeared in "Angel Gabriel Blue". Daddy went off on one of his adventures and [[renting|rented]] the room to the equally elderly Mr. Mawsby, giving him a [[receipt]]. Mr. Mawsby stayed in the room for a time, and Rose and Daisy mistook Mr. Mawsby for Daddy and brought him meals. When Rose found out he wasn't Daddy, Mr. Mawsby locked himself in the room and refused to leave. Eventually, after the entire family tried various tactics to get him out, Hyacinth sent Richard up a ladder to try to contact him through the window. However, Daddy came back and Mr. Mawsby left of his own volition, referring to his rented accommodation as a '[[Insane Asylum|Madhouse]]'.

===Rose's boyfriends===
Throughout the series, Rose had a long succession of boyfriends, sometimes seeing more than one at the same time. It was a running gag that Rose had a new one almost every episode. Most were unseen, but a few made appearances, usually embarrassing Hyacinth in some way in the process. 

====Reg and Dennis====
Appeared in "The Christening", played by Bruce Bennett and Jonathan Fryer. Rose spent the first half of the episode on the phone alternately with the two men, playing them off each other and trying to make one of them jealous enough of the other to escort her to her grand-niece's christening. Unfortunately, this backfired as both men arrived at the church at the same time and began squabbling over Rose in front of all the guests. 

====Charlie====
Charlie (played by John Darrell) was a local [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|police inspector]] who appeared in the episode "Senior Citizen's Outing". It was implied he'd had a brief fling with Rose in the past; however, when he met her again, he was less than thrilled to renew the acquaintance, given she called him out in front of his peers at the [[police station]].

====Mr. Sudbury====
Mr. Sudbury (played by Tony Kemp) was a tall, elegant man that Rose fell for because of his [[dancing]] skills. He appeared briefly in "The Father Christmas Suit", literally dancing down the street with her. 

====Boris and Mr. Heliwell====
Boris and Mr. Heliwell, (played by [[Dicken Ashworth]] and Gregory Cox), were both mentioned in several episodes as on-again-off-again flames of Rose's, but only appeared in "The Candlelight Supper". They were two very large and loud men who embarrassingly fought over Rose's affections on Hyacinth's front [[porch|doorstep]], only getting louder when Rose told them to go away because she had fallen for Emmett. The disturbance prompted Hyacinth - who had Elizabeth and Emmett over for dinner - to sing as loud as she could to drown the fighting out. The horrible, off-key racket actually stopped the fight and made both men flee, which was not Hyacinth's intent but it did save the situation.

====Roger====
Roger (played by Jon Glover), a kindly younger man with a large [[Newfoundland dog]], appeared in "Early Retirement". He disrupted Hyacinth's [[tea party]] plans when he went to the wrong house to pick Rose up, having mistaken Hyacinth for Rose's mother. His dog then refused to leave Hyacinth's drive, and Roger ended up leaving her there while he went in search of something to entice her away. The big dog then terrorized the pet [[Yorkshire Terrier]] of Hyacinth's honored guest. 

====Mr. Merryweather====
Mr. Merryweather (played by [[Trevor Bannister]]), appeared in "Angel Gabriel Blue" and was a long-suffering, obsequious salesman in a store that sold [[kitchen]] fittings and [[remodeling]] services. Hyacinth, unaware he was involved with Rose, persuaded him to get her an out-of-stock [[worktop]] in the color [[Angel Gabriel]] [[Blue]], so her house would be the only one in the neighborhood with the 'exclusive' color. However, the scheme backfired when Onslow found a new worktop being given away and Mr. Merryweather identified it as Angel Gabriel Blue as well, thus meaning Daisy and Onslow's house now had the "exclusive" color.

Bannister's appearance on the show was a [[cameo appearance|cameo]], as he had previously played Mr. Lucas - almost exactly the same character, in terms of personality and occupation, as Mr. Merryweather - on the popular [[BBC]] [[comedy]] [[Are You Being Served?]].

====Mr. Marinopoulous====
In "Onslow's [[Birthday]]" Rose infamously became involved with a wealthy Greek gentleman by the name of Mr. Marinopoulous (played by Ivan Santon), who also happened to have a [[limousine]]. Rose offered Hyacinth and Richard a ride in the limousine, to Onslow's [[birthday party]]. Hyacinth, thrilled that Rose was moving up in the world, invited people over for [[cocktails]] and bought Onslow a pair of expensive [[cufflinks]], to impress the wealthy Greek when he arrived. However, Mr. Marinopoulos was, in fact, a well-to-do [[undertaker]], and when the limousine broke down, he came to pick Hyacinth and Richard up in his [[hearse]] instead, in front of a crowd of guests invited to see the limousine.

====C.P. Benedict====

In "A Celebrity for the [[Barbecue]]", C.P. Benedict (played by Paul Williamson) was an acquaintance of Richard's who passed the time of day during strolls, as well as a former fling of Rose's who had parted with her on amicable terms. Furthermore, Hyacinth knew of C.P. from watching him on [[television]], [[advertising]] his lucrative [[garden center]], and referred to him as "The Garden Center King". However, none of the three were aware that either of the others knew him, until Richard happened to casually mention him in conversation with Hyacinth. Hyacinth, thinking him a celebrity, invited him to a barbecue in hopes of impressing the neighbors. She even had Richard deck the house out in live [[plants]] until it resembled a [[jungle]], and wore one of her best dresses, only to have Rose and Daisy accidentally [[gate-crashing|crash the party]]. C.P. gleefully reunited with Rose, much to Hyacinth's dismay.

====Mr. Finchley====
Appeared in "The [[Art exhibition|Art Exhibition]]". The occupation of Mr. Finchley (played by Nicholas Bennett) is unknown, but he happened to own a [[van]] with [[loudspeakers]] in the roof and a [[microphone]] in the cab. He also happened to be one of Rose's most amorous pursuers. When Daddy went missing one day, Rose borrowed Mr. Finchley's vehicle to go look for him, though he ended up having to drive her. Unfortunately Mr. Finchley turned on the loudspeakers by accident, and as the two of them rode through town, everyone could hear his and Rose's rather scandalous conversation blaring at full blast, much to Hyacinth's horror.

====Mr. Whatsit====
Seen only as a [[silhouette]] in the back seat of a car, Mr. Whatsit  appeared/was mentioned in two episodes, "The [[Fancy Dress]] Ball" and "Hyacinth is Alarmed". His real name was unknown, but Rose stated that it was a [[Polish language|Polish]] surname with "too many [[z|zed]]s" in it, hence her calling him either "Cuddly Chops" or "Mr. Whatsit". He was the most serious of Rose's lovers, actually proposing to her, but Hyacinth was afraid she'd have to call Rose "Mrs. Whatsit" or "Mrs. Cuddly Chops" if the marriage came to pass. However, when he went back to Poland, he fell for a Polish woman and broke the engagement off. Rose was more philosophical about this breakup than most, musing "Well, I couldn't [[pronunciation|pronounce]] him anyway".

== Animal characters ==

===Onslow's dog===

Onslow's dog doesn't have a name, simply referred to as "Girl" or "Dog". In some episodes she appears as an [[Old English Sheepdog]] mix of some sort, but for the most part she appears as an [[Irish Wolfhound]] mix. She is most often found in the Hillman Avenger that has been left to rust in the front yard of Onslow's home, though she sometimes snuggles on Onslow's lap, hanging off it as she's too big to fit. Generally placid and friendly to visitors, the dog barks aggressively at only two characters: Hyacinth and Mrs Councillor Nugent, the two most disagreeable characters on the show. Onslow clearly is very fond of his dog - he feeds her scraps, takes her for car rides, and in "Country Estate Sale", when one of Daddy's fiancées shoos the dog out and stays in the old car herself, Onslow is visibly distraught and goes down the street looking for her. Richard also seems to be fond of the dog; however, he becomes unhappy with her when, in "A Picnic for Daddy", she takes a liking to Richard's suit and snuggles with him, pinning him to the couch against his wishes.

In what is arguably the series' most memorable running gag, the dog startles Hyacinth into falling into the nearby hedge by barking at her from the car whenever she walks down the path to the house. Sometimes the dog startles her in other places by barking, as well, such as from a window or from the church hall car park. This habit of the dog's was also responsible for Richard's leg injury in "Iron Age Remains"; she barked at Hyacinth, who in turn jumped backwards and hit the ladder Richard was standing on, knocking him off it. In "The Charity Shop", the dog made Mrs. Councillor Nugent fall into the hedge as well. In "Country Estate Sale", Hyacinth, emboldened by [[gooseberry]] [[wine]], sneaked up on the car and barked into it to startle the dog and teach her a lesson. This backfired, however, since Daddy's fiancee was in the car instead of the dog and barked back at Hyacinth, again startling her into the hedge.

=== Violet and Bruce's pony ===
Hardly ever seen and only referenced on the phone or on the gates of Violet's house, the [[pony]] is part of a main running gag, which features Hyacinth introducing Violet on the telephone (shouting to Liz, her next-door neighbour, from the corridor) by exclaiming: "The one with the [[swimming pool]], the new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and room for a pony... But not in the car!" Or replacing the Mercedes part with "...[[Sauna]]..." or "...Musical [[bidet]]..." and referencing the joke that there isn't room for it in the Sauna or the Musical bidet. 

In "Problems with Relatives", When Hyacinth and Richard plan on taking Daddy to Violet and Bruce's house, the pony makes a brief cameo in the background. The stables is also seen briefly in this episode.

===Olive===
Only appearing in "Early Retirement", Olive was a massive black [[Newfoundland dog|Newfoundland]] that belonged to one of Rose's beaus. She was incredibly stubborn and disobedient, and caused mayhem when she sat on Hyacinth's driveway and flatly refused to get up, just as Hyacinth was expecting a prominent guest to arrive. Neither her owner nor Hyacinth could get her to move by command, so Elizabeth and Hyacinth tried pulling and pushing her instead while her owner walked off. Unfortunately, the guest (and her [[Yorkshire Terrier]]) arrived at Hyacinth's house at that moment. Olive, who liked to play with smaller dogs according to her owner, chased after the Yorkie, dragging Hyacinth down the street behind her.

===Zoe the spaniel===
Zoe is never seen but her actions drive much of the plot of "Violet's Country Cottage". She is reportedly a liver-and-white [[English Springer Spaniel]] belonging to Bunty and Dorian. It is revealed Bunty was training her to be a [[gun dog]]. However, Zoe is very scared of loud noises and ran away when Bunty fired the gun, and hasn't been seen since. Bunty first meets Hyacinth and Richard while trying to find Zoe, and in order to ingratiate herself with the wealthy eccentric lady, Hyacinth sends Richard to look for the dog. Richard spends much of the episode looking for Zoe, and in doing so meets Dorian, Bunty's husband, who saves him from getting stuck in a patch of [[Urtica|nettles]]. Later, while still looking for Zoe and calling her name, Richard is amorously pursued by one of Daddy's girlfriends, whose first name also happens to be Zoe.

===Vicar's dog===
Only seen in "A Picnic for Daddy", the vicar and his wife own a fat, black and white [[Cocker spaniel]] mix whose name is never given. She, like most dogs, despised Hyacinth. When Vicar gave Hyacinth a lift, with the dog riding in the boot of the car, the dog barked at her furiously and proceeded to eat all the artificial fruit off of her fancy hat. 

===Mrs. Drummond's dogs===
Also unnamed, appearing in "Let There Be Light". They belonged to a wealthy parishioner of Michael the vicar and were two [[Labrador Retriever|Labradors]], atypically vicious for the breed, who lunged at and tried to attack Hyacinth. She was eventually able to calm them and try to take them for a walk, but an ill-timed electrical explosion in the church hall spooked them into running away from her.

This '''list of autonomous areas arranged by country''' gives an overview of autonomous areas of the world. An [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous area]] is defined as an area of a [[country]] that has a degree of [[autonomy]], or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a [[national minority]]. Countries that include autonomous areas are often [[Federacy|federacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lucas I. González|title=Political Power, Fiscal Crises, and Decentralization in Latin America: Federal Countries in Comparative Perspective (and some Contrasts with Unitary Cases)|journal=Publius: the Journal of Federalism|date=2008-02-11|url=http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/pjn001v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=%28federal+AND+countries+AND+are+AND+often+AND+autonomous%29&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712174936/http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/pjn001v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=(federal+AND+countries+AND+are+AND+often+AND+autonomous)&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/publius/pjn001|volume=38|issue=2|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see [[Federated state#List of federal units by federation|Federated state]]).&lt;ref&gt;Olausson, Pär M. (2007) ''Autonomy and Islands: A Global Study of the Factors that Determine Island Autonomy'', [[Turku]]: [[Åbo Akademi University]] Press, pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes areas that are [[diplomatic recognition|internationally recognized]], as well as some that are generally unrecognized.{{ref|example|A}}{{ref|see|B}} The definition of an ''autonomous area'' varies from country to country, so the native term as defined by the respective country's government is listed, and the English translation of the term is included.

Notes:
*'''{{flag|Svalbard}}, [[Norway]]''': Although it does not fit the definition of ''autonomous area'' (not possessing partial internal sovereignty), [[Svalbard]] has the sovereignty of [[Norway]] limited by the ''[[Spitsbergen Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1925/10.html|title=Treaty concerning the Archipelago of Spitsbergen, and Protocol [1925] ATS 10|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore is considered as having special status (as it is considered fully integrated with [[Norway]], and not a [[Dependent territory|dependency]], it is a ''sui generis'' case).
*'''{{Flagicon image|Flag of Helgoland.svg}} [[Heligoland]], [[Germany]]''': Although it is part of a German state, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], it has been [[Special member state territories and the European Union#Heligoland|excluded]] of some [[European Union]] normatives, such as [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] and the [[European Union value added tax|Value Added Tax Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 (as amended) on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0112:EN:NOT Eur-lex.europa.eu].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2 digit postcode poland.png|thumb|300px|2-digit postcode areas Poland(defined through the first two postcode digits)]]
The '''[[Postal code]]s in Poland''' consists of 5 numbers in the following format xy-zzz.

First digit in the postal code represents the postal district, second digit major geographical subdivision of this district, and the three digits after [[dash]]: the [[post office]], or in case of large cities: particular street, part of the street or even separate address (in the last case code is in the form of xy-9zz). Thus the postal code 70-952 means:
* 7 – postal district of [[Szczecin]],
* 0 – subdivision of that district, in this case the Western Part of Szczecin,
* 9 – denotes ''special'' code, and
* 52 – Office of the District Attorney (''Prokuratura Okręgowa'').

Similarly, the code for 70-470 denotes the odd numbers from 1 to 27 in the Wojska Polskiego Street in Szczecin, and 34-434 is a code for whole town of Dębno near [[Nowy Targ]] (3 – postal district of [[Kraków]], 4 – subdivision of that district, 434 the town of Dębno – strictly speaking the post office in Dębno).

Postal districts and their subdivisions are not related to the administrative division of Poland.

==Postal codes are not unique==
Unlike other European postal codes the place names of the postal codes in Poland are not unique.&lt;ref name="POindex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kody.poczta-polska.pl/index.php|title=Look up postal code 62-262|accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postal code 62-262 are valid with 5 different place names:
*62-262 Wierzyce
*62-262 Przyborowo
*62-262 Chwałkówko
*62-262 Fałkowo	
*62-262 Imielno

Other examples are: 09-135, 12-250, 16-424, 32-104, 55-300, 62-010, and 98-338.

[[File:M27 - geograph.org.uk - 156928.jpg|thumb|250px|right|M27 Between junctions 5 and 7 (there is no junction 6)]]

The '''M27''' is a [[motorway]] in [[Hampshire]], England.  It is {{convert|25|mi|km}} long and runs west-east from [[Cadnam]] to [[Portsmouth]]. It was opened in stages between 1975 and 1983. It is unfinished, as an extension to the east was planned.&lt;ref name="PM M27"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathetic.org.uk/unfinished/m27/|publisher=Pathetic Motorways |title=M27 Portsmouth-Chichester }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of smaller motorways were proposed, connecting the city centres of [[Southampton]] and Portsmouth to the motorway;&lt;ref name="cityplans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chris-roads.fotopic.net/p8364519.html |title=Overall plans for the city |accessdate=27 January 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of these only the [[M271 motorway|M271]] and [[M275 motorway|M275]] were built. Three sections of the M27 have since been widened to four lanes each way, the first between Junctions 7 and 8, the second between Junctions 3 and 4, and the third begins at the slip road where Junction 11 joins until mid-way to junction 12.

==Route==
Running approximately parallel both to the coast of the [[Solent]] and to the [[A27 road|A27]], the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the [[A31 road|A31]] from [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]], meets the [[A36 road|A36]] from [[Salisbury]], crosses the [[Wessex Main Line]] railway, and then meets the [[M271 motorway|M271]] to central [[Southampton]]. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes [[Rownhams services]], it then meets the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]], (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing to the other side of the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes [[Southampton Airport]], meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the [[West Coastway Line]] as it heads south-east towards [[Fareham]]. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the [[M275 motorway|M275]] to [[Portsmouth]]. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the [[A3 road#A3.28M.29|A3 (M) Motorway]]. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the [[hard shoulder]]s being too narrow. Although the [[M275 motorway|M275]] which the M27 junctions with, has no official hard shoulders throughout its entire length.

==History==

===Opening dates===

The M27 was opened in stages (in common with many UK motorways)  between 1975 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m27scmstat.htm |publisher=The Motorway Archive Trust |title=M27 – The South Coast Motorway and A3(M) Statistics and options |accessdate=27 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311002951/http://www.iht.org/motorway/m27scmstat.htm |archivedate=11 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Junction 1 to 2 opened 20 August 1975
*Junction 2 to 4 opened in December 1975
*Junction 4 to 7 opened in 1983
*Junction 7 to 8 opened in February 1978
*Junction 8 to 12 opened in March 1976

The South Stoneham Crematorium, which was located north of [[South Stoneham Cemetery]], was demolished during 1973 to make way for the construction of the M27 motorway. The South Stoneham garden of remembrance is now located at the north end of the cemetery, adjacent to the motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Stoneham Cemetery |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/living/cremburial/sotoncemetries/Southstone.aspx |publisher=Southampton City Council |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516051833/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/living/cremburial/sotoncemetries/Southstone.aspx |archivedate=16 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfulfilled plans===

It has been said that the M27 was intended as a motorway connecting south coast towns from [[Penzance]] to [[Ramsgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m27/|title=CBRD Motorway Database – M27|last=Marshall|first=Chris|first2=Nigel |last2=Le Poidevin |first3=Dave |last3=McGuire |first4=James |last4=Denson|author5=Steve |author6=Clive |accessdate=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the only proposal of a route similar to that was by the Institution of Highway Engineers in 1936.&lt;ref name="PM M27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Highway Engineers"&gt;{{cite book|title=The post war development of highways|publisher=Institution of Highway Engineers|year=1943|chapter=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charlesworth|first=George|title=A history of British Motorways|publisher=Thomas Telford Ltd|location=London EC1|year=1984|chapter=2|isbn=978-0-7277-0159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Road developments in the [[New Forest]] are also restricted due to its [[national parks of England and Wales|national park]] status.

The M27 was meant to be extended to [[Chichester]]; a sign of this is the width of the A27 road between Junction 12 and the junction with the [[A3 road|A3(M)]], which has 3-or-4 lanes, a hard shoulder and grade-separated junctions. It is not part of the M27 as its hard shoulders are not quite wide enough to comply with motorway regulations.&lt;ref name="PM M27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m27scoastm.htm |title=M27 – The South Coast Motorway, M271, M275 and A3(M) |publisher= |accessdate=25 January 2007 |quote=The land acquired for this stretch of the motorway was not quite wide enough – by less than a foot – and the Chief Highway Engineer of the day, quite rightly if a little pedantically, ruled that it didn’t conform to motorway standards and must therefore be an all-purpose trunk road. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102215025/http://www.iht.org/motorway/m27scoastm.htm |archivedate=2 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M272 was meant to go from Junction 5 through Portswood to the centre of Southampton. The M272 was instead built (in much-reduced form) as the [[A335 road|A335]] Thomas Lewis Way.

Junction 6 was never built – there were plans for a motorway spur (probably to be numbered M273) connecting the M27 to the centre of the [[Townhill Park]] area of Southampton.&lt;ref name="cityplans" /&gt;

A planned [[motorway service station|service area]] just east of Junction 9 was never constructed.  The long westbound exit slip road at Junction 9 was designed to allow an entry to and exit from the service area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/unbuilt/meon/
|title = Meon Valley
|publisher = Motorway services online
|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 suicide incident ===
In November 2015, an elderly woman, Marion Munns, died after jumping from the A3057 bridge that crosses over the M27, into westbound traffic, just before Junction 3. She had become distressed due to mental illness, and escaped from her Southampton home through an upstairs window before climbing off the garage roof and running away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/24/nhs-care-workers-did-not-aid-patient-in-crisis-as-staff-about-to/|title=NHS care workers did not aid patient in crisis 'as staff about to go home'|first=Telegraph|last=Reporters|date=24 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junctions==
Data from [[driver location signs]] are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information.&lt;ref&gt;Area 3 Driver Location Signs (map) – Highway Authority, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where a junction spans several hundred metres (yards) and start and end points are available, both are cited.

[[Nazi Germany]] maintained [[concentration camps]] ({{lang-de|Konzentrationslager}}, KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The first [[Nazism|Nazi]] camps were erected in [[Germany]] in March 1933 immediately after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] became Chancellor and his [[Nazi Party]] was given control of the police by Reich Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] and Prussian Acting Interior Minister [[Hermann Göring]].{{sfn|Evans|2003| pp=344–345}} Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=81}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]]'s ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) took full control of the police and the concentration camps throughout Germany in 1934–35.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=85}} Himmler expanded the role of the camps to hold so-called "racially undesirable elements", such as [[Jews in Nazi Germany|Jews]], [[Romani people|Romanis]], [[Serbs]], [[Poles]], [[disabled people]], and [[Crime|criminals]].&lt;ref&gt;Revisiting the National Socialist Legacy: Coming to Terms With Forced Labor, Expropriation, Compensation, and Restitution page 84 Oliver Rathkolb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gumkowski"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe |first1=Janusz |last1=Gumkowski |first2=Kazimierz |last2=Leszczynski |first3=Edward (translator) |last3=Robert |work=Poland Under Nazi Occupation |format=Paperback |pages=219 |publisher=Polonia Pub. House |edition=First |year=1961 |asin=B0006BXJZ6 |accessdate=12 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409034704/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=9 April 2011 |df= }} at [[Wayback machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=87–90}} The number of people in the camps, which had fallen to 7,500, grew again to 21,000 by the start of World War II{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=90}} and peaked at 715,000 in January 1945.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=367}}

The concentration camps were administered since 1934 by the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]] (CCI) which in 1942 was merged into ''[[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt]]'' and they were guarded by ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (SS-TV).

[[Holocaust]] scholars draw a distinction between ''concentration'' camps (described in this article) and [[extermination camp]]s, which were established by Nazi Germany for the industrial-scale mass murder of [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jews in the ghettos]] by way of [[gas chamber]]s.

==Pre-war camps==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R96361, Dachau, Konzentrationslager.jpg|thumb|The Dachau concentration camp was created for the purpose of holding political opponents. In time for Christmas of 1933, roughly 600 of the inmates were released as part of a pardoning action. The picture above depicts a speech by camp commander [[Theodor Eicke]] to prisoners who were about to be released.]]

Use of the word "concentration" came from the idea of confining people in one place because they belong to a group that is considered undesirable in some way. The term itself originated in 1897 when the "reconcentration camps" were set up in [[Cuba]] by General [[Valeriano Weyler]]. In the past, the U.S. government had used [[concentration camp]]s against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the British had also used them during the [[Second Boer War]]. Between 1904 and 1908, the ''[[Schutztruppe]]'' of the [[Imperial German Army]] operated concentration camps in [[German South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) as part of its [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide of the Herero and Namaqua peoples]]. The [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] in [[Lüderitz]] was the largest camp and the one with the harshest conditions.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they quickly moved to suppress all real and potential opposition. The general public was intimidated by the arbitrary psychological terror that was used by the special courts (''[[Sondergerichte]]'').&lt;ref name="resistance1"/&gt; Especially during the first years of their existence when these courts "had a strong deterrent effect" against any form of political protest.&lt;ref name="sondergerichte"/&gt;

The first camp in Germany, [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], was founded in March 1933.&lt;ref name="MNN"/&gt; The press announcement said that "the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for 5,000 people. All Communists and – where necessary – [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]] and [[Social Democratic]] functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated there, as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons."&lt;ref name="MNN"/&gt; Dachau was the first regular concentration camp established by the German coalition government of National Socialist Workers' Party ([[Nazi Party]]) and the Nationalist People's Party (dissolved on 6 July 1933). [[Heinrich Himmler]], then [[Chief of Police]] of Munich, officially described the camp as "the first concentration camp for political prisoners."&lt;ref name=MNN/&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-11-12, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|left|''Reichsführer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] inspecting [[Dachau concentration camp]] on 8 May 1936.]]

On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed [[Theodor Eicke]] commandant of Dachau, who in 1934 was also appointed the first [[Inspector of Concentration Camps]] (CCI). In addition, the remaining SA-run camps were taken over by the SS.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=137}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308–314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} Dachau served as both a prototype and a model for the other Nazi concentration camps. Almost every community in Germany had members who were taken there. The newspapers continuously reported on "the removal of the enemies of the Reich to concentration camps" making the general population more aware of their presence. There were jingles warning as early as 1935: "Dear God, make me [[Muteness|dumb]], that I may not come to Dachau."&lt;ref name="Janowitz 141–146"/&gt;

Between 1933 and the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, more than 3.5 million Germans were forced to spend time in concentration camps and prisons for political reasons,&lt;ref name="socialistreviewindex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contending"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictatorial"/&gt; and approximately 77,000 Germans were executed for one or another form of resistance by [[Sondergerichte|Special Courts]], [[courts-martial]], and the civil justice system. Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which enabled them to engage in [[subversion]] and conspiracy against the Nazis.&lt;ref name="resistance1"/&gt;

As a result of [[the Holocaust]], the term "concentration camp" carries many of the connotations of "[[extermination camp]]" and is sometimes used synonymously. Because of these ominous connotations, the term "concentration camp", originally itself a [[euphemism]], has been replaced by newer terms such as internment camp, resettlement camp, [[detention facility]], etc., regardless of the actual circumstances of the camp, which can vary a great deal.

==World War II==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Duerr-053-29, Lettland, KZ Salaspils, Essensausgabe.jpg|thumb|Jewish prisoners are issued food on a building site at [[Salaspils concentration camp]], Latvia, in 1941.]]
After September 1939, with the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]], concentration camps became places where millions of ordinary people were enslaved as part of the war effort, often starved, tortured and killed.&lt;ref name="cnn.com-1"/&gt; During the war, new Nazi concentration camps for "undesirables" spread throughout the continent. According to statistics by the [[German Ministry of Justice]], about 1,200 camps and [[subcamp (SS)|subcamp]]s were run in [[German-occupied Europe|countries occupied by Nazi Germany]],&lt;ref name=bundesrecht/&gt; while the [[Jewish Virtual Library]] estimates that the number of Nazi camps was closer to 15,000 in all of occupied Europe{{r|jewishvirtuallib1}}{{r|ListNaziMem}} and that many of these camps were run for a limited amount of time before they were closed.{{r|jewishvirtuallib1}} Camps were being created near the centers of dense populations, often focusing on areas with large communities of Jews, Polish [[intelligentsia]], [[Communism|Communists]] or Romani. Since [[History of the Jews in Poland|millions of Jews lived in pre-war Poland]], most camps were located in the area of the [[General Government]] in occupied Poland, for logistical reasons. The location also allowed the Nazis to quickly remove the German Jews from within Germany proper.

By 1940, the CCI came under the control of the ''Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt'' (VuWHA; Administration and Business office) which was set up under [[Oswald Pohl]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=115}} Then in 1942, the CCI became ''Amt D'' (Office D) of the consolidated main office known as the ''[[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt]]'' (SS Economic and Administrative Department; WVHA) under Pohl.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=115}} In 1942, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] built a network of [[extermination camp]]s to systematically kill millions of prisoners by gassing. The extermination camps (''Vernichtungslager'') and death camps (''Todeslager'') were camps whose primary function was [[genocide]]. The Nazis themselves distinguished the concentration camps from the extermination camps.&lt;ref name="Kremer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interrogations"/&gt; The British intelligence service had information about the concentration camps, and in 1942 [[Jan Karski]] delivered a thorough eyewitness account to the government.

===Internees===
The two largest groups of prisoners in the camps, both numbering in the millions, were the Polish Jews and the Soviet [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war (POWs)]] held without trial or judicial process. There were also large numbers of Romani people, ethnic [[Poles]], [[Serbs]], [[political prisoner]]s, [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], people with disabilities, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Holy Orders|Catholic clergy]], Eastern European intellectuals and others (including common criminals, as the Nazis declared). In addition, a small number of [[Allies of World War II|Western Allied]] aviators were sent to concentration camps as punishment for spying.&lt;ref name="vac-acc.gc"/&gt; Western Allied POWs who were Jews, or who were suspected of being Jews by the Nazis, were usually sent to ordinary POW camps; however, a small number of them were sent to concentration camps because of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt;
[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 07511.jpg|thumb|American soldiers view a pile of corpses found in the newly liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in April 1945]]

Sometimes the concentration camps were used to hold important prisoners, such as the generals involved in the [[20 July plot|attempted assassination of]] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]; [[U-boat]] [[Captain (naval)|Captain]]-turned-[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor [[Martin Niemöller]]; and [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], who was interned at Flossenbürg on February 7, 1945, until he was hanged on April 9, shortly before the war's end.

In most camps, prisoners were forced to wear identifying overalls with [[Nazi concentration camp badges|colored badges]] according to their categorization: red triangles for Communists and other political prisoners, green triangles for common criminals, pink triangles for homosexual men, purple triangles for Jehovah's Witnesses, black triangles for [[Black triangle (badge)|asocials]] and the "work shy", yellow triangle for Jews, and later the brown triangle for Romanis.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

===Treatment===
Many of the prisoners died in the concentration camps due to deliberate maltreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or they were executed as unfit for labor. Prisoners were [[Holocaust trains|transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars]], in which many died before reaching their final destination. The prisoners were confined in the [[boxcar]]s for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of [[dehydration]] in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Concentration camps also existed in Germany itself, and while they were not specifically designed for systematic extermination, many of their inmates perished because of harsh conditions or they were executed.
[[File:Eines von 3 Massengräbern in Bergen-Belsen, so wie es von den Befreiern vorgefunden wurde, 1945.jpg|thumb|left|A mass grave inside [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] ]]

In the spring of 1941, the SS—along with [[List of Nazi doctors|doctors]] and officials of the [[Action T4|T-4 Euthanasia Program]]—introduced the [[Action 14f13]] programme meant for extermination of selected concentration camp prisoners.&lt;ref name="webcitation.org"/&gt; The Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps categorized all files dealing with the death of prisoners as 14f, and those of prisoners sent to the T-4 [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]] as 14f13. Under the language regulations of the SS, selected prisoners were designated for "[[Sonderbehandlung|special treatment]] ({{lang-de|Sonderbehandlung}}) 14f13". Prisoners were officially selected based on their medical condition; namely, those permanently unfit for labor due to illness. Unofficially, racial and eugenic criteria were used: Jews, the handicapped, and those with criminal or [[Public order crime|antisocial]] records were selected.&lt;ref name="Friedlander"/&gt;{{rp|p.144}} For Jewish prisoners there was not even the pretense of a medical examination: the arrest record was listed as a physician's "diagnosis".&lt;ref name="Friedlander"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 147–148}} In early 1943, as the need for labor increased and the gas chambers at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] became operational, Heinrich Himmler ordered the end of Action 14f13.&lt;ref name="Friedlander"/&gt;{{rp|p.150}}

After 1942, many small [[subcamp (SS)|subcamp]]s were set up near factories to provide forced labor. [[IG Farben]] established a [[synthetic rubber]] plant in 1942 at [[Monowitz concentration camp|Monowitz concentration camp (Auschwitz III)]]; other camps were set up next to airplane factories, [[coal mining|coal mines]] and [[rocket propellant]] plants. Conditions were brutal and prisoners were often sent to the gas chambers or killed on site if they did not work quickly enough.

On 31 July 1941 [[Hermann Göring]] gave written authorization to SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], Chief of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a "total solution of the Jewish question" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=315}} The resulting ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}}
[[File:Gen Eisenhower at death camp report crop.jpg|thumb|Commander-in-Chief of all Allied Forces, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], witnesses the corpses found at [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]] in May 1945.]]

Towards the end of the war, the camps became sites for [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]. [[Eugenics]] experiments, freezing prisoners to determine how downed pilots were affected by exposure, and experimental and lethal medicines were all tried at various camps. A cold water immersion experiments at [[Dachau concentration camp]] were performed by [[Sigmund Rascher]].&lt;ref name="BERGER"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nazi Science — The Dachau Hypothermia Experiments |author=Robert L.

The lead editors of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945]]'' of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [[Geoffrey P.

==Liberation==
[[File:Ebensee concentration camp prisoners 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Starving prisoners in [[Ebensee concentration camp]], part of the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] liberated on May 5, 1945]]
The camps were liberated by the Allied forces between 1944 and 1945. The first major camp, [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]], was discovered by the advancing Soviets on July 23, 1944. [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was liberated, also by the Soviets, on January 27, 1945; [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] by the Americans on April 11; [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] by the British on April 15; [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] by the Americans on April 29; [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] by the Soviets on the same day; [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] by the Americans on May 5; and [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] by the Soviets on May 8.&lt;ref name="GluckWood144"/&gt; [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] were never liberated, but were destroyed by the Nazis in 1943. Colonel William W. Quinn of the U.S. 7th Army said of Dachau: "There our troops found sights, sounds, and stenches horrible beyond belief, cruelties so enormous as to be incomprehensible to the normal mind."&lt;ref name="GluckWood146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hitchcock"/&gt;

In most of the camps discovered by the Soviets, almost all the prisoners had already been removed, leaving only a few thousand alive—7,000 inmates were found in Auschwitz, including 180 children who had been experimented on by [[List of Nazi doctors|doctors]].&lt;ref name="GluckWood145"/&gt; Some 60,000 prisoners were discovered at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] by the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 11th Armoured Division]],&lt;ref name="11th"/&gt; 13,000 corpses lay unburied, and another 10,000 died from [[typhus]] or malnutrition over the following weeks.&lt;ref name="BB"/&gt; The British forced the remaining SS guards to gather up the corpses and place them in mass graves.&lt;ref name="Wiesel41"/&gt;

==Types of camps==
The Nazi concentration camps have been divided by historians into several major categories based on purpose, administrative structure, and inmate population profile.&lt;ref name="Lichtblau2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lifshitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shirer"/&gt; The system of camps preceded the onset of World War II by several years and was developed gradually. 
[[File:MajorConcentrationCamps.png|thumb|right|upright=1.95|The main German camps and extermination centers, 1943–44]]

# Early camps, usually without proper infrastructure, sprang up everywhere in Germany when the Nazi reached power in 1933: rising "like mushrooms after the rain", Himmler recollected.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=84}} These early camps, called also "Wild camps" because some were set up with little supervision from higher authorities, were overseen by Nazi paramilitaries, political police forces, and sometimes local police authority utilizing any lockable larger space, e.g. engine rooms, brewery floors, storage facilities, cellars, etc.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QzKdBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=wild%20camps&amp;f=false pp. 38–45]}}
# State camps (e.g. Dachau, Oranienburg, Esterwegen) guarded by the SA; prototypes for future SS concentration camps, with a total of 107,000 prisoners already in 1935.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QzKdBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=107%2C000&amp;f=false 88]}}
# Hostage camps (''Geisellager''), known also as police prison camps (e.g. Sint-Michielsgestel, Haaren) where hostages were held and later killed in reprisal actions.&lt;ref name="bundesarchiv1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Federal Archives |title=Police prison Camps and Police Prisons in the Occupied Territories |date=2010 |url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php.en?tab=25 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Labor camps (''[[Arbeitslager]]''): concentration camps where interned captives had to perform hard physical labor under inhumane conditions and cruel treatment. Some of these were sub-camps, called "Outer Camps" (''Aussenlager''), built around a larger central camp (''Stammlager''), or served as "operational camps" established for a temporary need.
# [[POW camp]]s (''Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschafts-Stammlager'' / ''Stalag'') a.k.a. Main Camps for Enlisted Prisoners of War: concentration camps where enlisted prisoners-of-war were held after capture. They were usually assigned soon to nearby labor camps (''[[Arbeitslager#Arbeitskommandos|Arbeitskommandos]]''), i.e. the Work Details. POW officers had their own camps (''[[Oflag|Offizierslager]]'' / ''Oflag''). Stalags were for Army prisoners, but specialized camps (''Marinelager'' / ''Marlag'' ("Navy camps") and ''Marineinterniertenlager'' / ''Milag'' ("Merchant Marine Internment Camps")) existed for the other services. ''Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschafts-Stammlager Luftwaffe'' / ''Stalag Luft'' ("Air Forces Camps") were the only camps that detained both officers and non-commissioned personnel together.
# Camps for the so-called "rehabilitation and re-education of Poles" (''Arbeitserziehungslager'' - "Work Instruction Camps"): camps where the intelligentsia of the ethnic Poles were held, and "re-educated" according to Nazi values as slaves.
# Collection and Transit camps: camps where inmates were collected (''Sammellager'') or temporarily held (''Durchgangslager'' / ''Dulag'') and then routed to main camps.
# [[Extermination camp]]s (''Vernichtungslager''): These camps differed from the rest, since not all of them were also concentration camps. Although none of the categories are independent, many camps could be classified as a mixture of several of the above. All camps had some of the elements of an extermination camp, but systematic extermination of new arrivals by gas chambers only occurred in specialized camps. These were extermination camps, where all new-arrivals were simply killed—the "[[Operation Reinhard|Aktion Reinhard]]" camps ([[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]]), together with [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chelmno]]. Two others ([[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek]]) were combined concentration and extermination camps. Others like [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Maly Trostenets]] were at times classified as "minor extermination camps".&lt;ref name="Shirer"/&gt;

==Post-war use==
[[File:Concentration camp SS.jpg|thumb|right|A concentration camp victim identifies an SS guard in June 1945]]
Though most Nazi concentration and extermination camps were destroyed after the war, some of them were turned into permanent [[memorial]]s. In [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist Poland]], some camps such as [[Majdanek]], [[Central Labour Camp Jaworzno|Jaworzno]], [[Central Labour Camp in Potulice|Potulice]] and [[Zgoda labour camp|Zgoda]] were used by the [[NKVD|Soviet NKVD]] to hold German prisoners of war, suspected or confirmed Nazis and Nazi collaborators, anti-Communists and other political prisoners, as well as [[civilian]] members of the German-speaking, [[Silesians|Silesian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ethnic minorities. Currently, there are memorials to the victims of both Nazi and communist camps at Potulice; they have helped to enable a German-Polish discussion on historical perceptions of World War II.&lt;ref name="geschichtswerkstatt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geschichtswerkstatt-europa.org/expired-project-details/items/potulice.html | title=One place, different memories | publisher=Geschichtswerkstatt Europa | date=2010 | accessdate=July 26, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212808/http://www.geschichtswerkstatt-europa.org/expired-project-details/items/potulice.html | archivedate=July 16, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[East Germany]], the concentration camps at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] were used for similar purposes. [[Dachau concentration camp]] was used as a detention centre for the arrested Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ausstellung der KZ-Gedenkstätte Dachau |website=Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site |language=de |url=http://www.gedenkstaettenpaedagogik-bayern.de/ausstellungstexte.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118203533/http://www.gedenkstaettenpaedagogik-bayern.de/ausstellungstexte.htm |archive-date=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pančevački Rit''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Панчевачки Рит}}) is a small geographical area in south-western [[Banat]], [[Serbia]]. It is situated between the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Timiş River|Tamiš]], in [[Belgrade]]'s municipality of [[Palilula Belgrade|Palilula]].

== Features ==

Its 400&amp;nbsp;km² wetland was constantly flooded, but since [[World War II]] it has been drained part by part and almost half of it has been turned into a very fertile patch of land, suitable especially for cultivating grains and vegetables. It is managed by Serbia's largest agricultural company, "[[PKB Beograd]]", which almost exclusively provides food for 2 million people in the greater [[Belgrade]] area; thus Pančevački Rit is commonly nicknamed Granary of Belgrade. Stockbreeding is also very intensive, as are fishery and hunting.

Many meandering canals and bogs have remained in the marsh: the slow streams of [[Vizelj]], Dunavac, Sibnica, Butuš, Rogoznica, Buk, Belanoš and [[Sebeš]], and large bogs of [[Reva, Belgrade|Reva]], [[Veliko Blato]] (2&amp;nbsp;km²), Sebeš and [[Široka Bbara]]. In the south, the area ends with a river island (ada) [[Kožara]] (0.44&amp;nbsp;km²) and the southwest is occupied by the wetland of [[Beljarica]].

== Wildlife ==

The marshland is the natural habitat for the [[wild boars]] and Pančevački Rit is the location of the largest population of the wild boars on the territory of Belgrade, and probably in the entire Serbia. They are especially numerous in the area bounded by the [[Pupin Bridge]], Crvenka, Borča and Padinska Skela. In the previous decades, as the settlements expanded, boars' natural roaming paths have been intersected by the houses or roads. As the area is agricultural, they feed on the crops (wheat, corn) and roots, but also on the fish and shells so many are found on the banks of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Divlje svinje dolaze iz Pančevačkog rita | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 8 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.co.rs/sr/clanak/388420/Divlje-svinje-dolaze-iz-Pancevackog-rita }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two official, unfenced hunting grounds in Pančevački Rit. One is named the same way, while the other is called simply Rit. The Rit is located near Padinska Skela, {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Belgrade along the ''Zrenjaninski put''. It covers an area of {{convert|82.63|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|0.5|km2|abbr=on}} is a [[pheasantry]]. Animals bred in the facility include [[roe deer]], [[hare]], [[quail]], [[mallard]], [[greylag goose]] and 13,000 [[pheasants]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Lovci u Beograd stižu porodično | trans-title = Hunters travel to Belgrade with their families | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 5 August 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/408612/Lovci-u-Beograd-stizu-porodicno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neighborhoods and settlements ==

After being almost uninhabited before 1945, today its population density is above average for Serbia as a whole, since some of the fastest growing suburbs of Belgrade ([[Borča]], [[Padinska Skela]] and [[Krnjača]]) have been built there.

== History ==

The area had its own municipality in 1955-1965 (until 1955 it had four municipalities: [[Borča]], [[Ovča]], [[Padinska Skela]] and [[Krnjača]] which merged into one municipality, [[Krnjača]], in 1955 which in turn was annexed to [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]] in 1965).

== Politics ==

Today, there is a proposal that area again become a separate municipality with the name [[Dunavski Venac]]. Beginning in the late 1990s, the notion of the area on the left bank of the Danube splitting from the municipality of Palilula had been gaining momentum until in 2005 the Municipal assembly of Palilula finally accepted supporting the move. The proposed new municipality, if accepted and confirmed by the Belgrade City assembly, will have an area of 407&amp;nbsp;km² and a population of 70-80,000.

The '''protected areas of [[Namibia]]''' include its [[national park]]s and reserves.

==Transboundary Protected Areas==
{{Double image|right| Ai-Ais.jpg |200| Fish River Canyon Namibia by anagoria.JPG|200|Left: Entrance to [[Ai-Ais Hot Springs]]; right: [[Fish River Canyon]] within the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.}}
The protection is not necessarily limited to inside the borders of Namibia. In 2007 the [[Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park]], an international [[peace park]], was created through the joint management of the [[Ai-Ais Hot Springs]] park, which includes parts of [[Fish River Canyon]], and the [[Richtersveld National Park]] in neighbouring South Africa.&lt;ref name=MET/&gt; Fauna includes [[rock hyrax]], [[ground squirrel]], [[jackal buzzard]] and Hartmann's [[mountain zebra]].

In 2006, the countries of Namibia, [[Angola]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Botswana]] signed an agreement creating the [[Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area]] (KaZa TFCA), a vast expanse of land designated primarily "'to establish a world-class transfrontier conservation area and tourism destination in the Okavango and Zambezi river-basin regions within the context of sustainable development", by linking different habitats and allowing animals the freedom of movement throughout this region of Africa.&lt;ref name=MET/&gt;

In addition, there is ongoing discussion between the governments of Namibia and [[Angola]] regarding the creation of a trans-border coastal park, formed from the concaternation of the Skeleton Coast National Park, and Angola's [[Iona National Park]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

[[File:Regions locator map of Côte d'Ivoire (non-regions in grey).jpg|thumb|left|The 31 current regions. Red lines indicate borders of districts. Grey areas are not governed by regions.]]
The '''regions of Ivory Coast''' ({{lang-fr|régions de Côte d'Ivoire}}) are the second-level [[subdivisions of Ivory Coast|subdivisions]] of [[Ivory Coast]]. There are 31 regions, and each region is subdivided into two or more [[departments of Ivory Coast|departments]], the third-level division in Ivory Coast. Two to four regions are combined to make up a [[districts of Ivory Coast|district]], the first-level subdivision. The two autonomous districts of Ivory Coast are not divided into regions.

==History==
[[File:Regions locator map Côte d'Ivoire 1997-2000.jpg|thumb|left|The 16 original regions. These boundaries existed from 1997 to 2000, when three new regions were created.]]
The first 16 regions were established in 1997;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1980s, ten regions were set up as regional groupings for census purposes, but these "regions" were not administrative subdivisions of the country and existed only for statistical purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, they supplanted the departments as the first-level administrative subdivisions of the country, with the departments being converted into second-level subdivisions. In 2000, four of the regions were divided to create three more regions, bringing the total to 19.

Prior to the 2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, the 19 regions were the first-level subdivision of the country. In the reorganisation, districts were created and replaced regions as the first-level subdivisions and the 19 regions were reorganized into 30.&lt;ref name = abidjannet&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/412022.html "Décentralisation : Le gouvernement créé 12 districts et 30 régions"], abidjan.net, 29 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = decret&gt;[http://www.pndap-ci.org/pdf/decret_districts.pdf Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, one region was divided to create a 31st region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/436675.html "Conseil des Ministres du mercredi 04 Juillet 2012 : De nouvelles entités administratives créées"], abidjan.net, 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depse.ci/telecharger-fichier-joint/15 Décret n° 2012-612 du 04 juillet 2012 portant création de la Région du Moronou].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and purpose==
The executive of each region is headed by a prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451/&gt; For departments that house regional capitals, the prefect of the department is the same individual as the prefect of the region, though the two offices of prefect remain distinct.&lt;ref name = ordonnance262&gt;[http://www.dgddl.interieur.gouv.ci/documentation/20130612092155TEXTELIGISLATIFETREGLEMENTAIRE.pdf Ordonnance n° 2011-262 du 28 septembre 2011 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'administration territoriale de l'Etat].&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative body of the region is the Regional Council, which is elected and headed by a President.

The government of each region is responsible for designing and implementing programmes to improve the economic, social, and cultural life of the region.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451&gt;[http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/ivc146379.pdf Loi n° 2014-451 du 5 août 2014 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'Administration Territoriale].&lt;/ref&gt; Regions are also responsible for coordinating and harmonising the activities of their departmental governments and for implementing public interest projects established by the district or the national government.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451/&gt;

Precise distinctions in the jurisdiction of regions as compared to districts has yet to be established. The governments of the non-autonomous districts have not yet begun to function. Apart from governors for the two autonomous districts, no district governor has yet been nominated; the inaction has largely been in response to apprehensions by the regional prefects that district governors will usurp their authority and responsibilities.&lt;ref name = chefsdesanpedro&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/528149.html "Les chefs de San Pedro demandent l’érection de leur cité en district autonome"], 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions==
There are currently 31 regions of Ivory Coast. Two areas of the country, the autonomous districts of [[Abidjan]] and [[Yamoussoukro]], are not divided into regions. The regions are as follows, with the date of creation in parentheses:

'''Stanisław Wawrzyniec Staszic''' {{IPAc-pl|s|t|a|'|ń|i|s|ł|a|f|-|'|s|t|a|sz|i|c}} (baptised 6 November 1755 – 20 January 1826) was a leading figure in the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]]: a Catholic priest, philosopher, geologist, writer, poet, [[translation|translator]] and [[Politician|statesman]]. A [[Physiocracy|physiocrat]], [[Monism|monist]], [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] (after 1815) and [[laissez-faire|laissez-fairist]], he supported many reforms in Poland. He is particularly remembered for his political writings during the "[[Great Sejm|Great (Four-Year) Sejm]]" (1788–92) and for his support of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by that Sejm.

He co-founded the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning]] (precursor to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]), of which he became president. He served as a member of the [[State Council (Duchy of Warsaw)|State Council]] of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and as minister of trade and industry in [[Congress Poland]]. Staszic is seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, [[Tatra Mountains]] studies and exploration, mining and industry.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

Stanisław Staszic was born into a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] family in the town of [[Piła]] (he was baptised on 6 November 1755), the youngest of four siblings.&lt;ref name="psb540" /&gt; His father, [[Wawrzyniec Staszic]], was mayor of Piła and a royal secretary.&lt;ref name="psb540" /&gt; His brothers were Antoni (1743–1775) and Andrzej (1745–1825), a priest.&lt;ref name="psb540" /&gt;

Staszic attended secondary school at [[Wałcz]]. He studied [[theology]] and graduated from a [[Jesuit]] school at [[Poznań]] in 1778 and was [[ordination|ordained]] a Catholic priest (he took lesser [[Holy Orders]] in 1774, and higher orders about 1778–79).&lt;ref name="psb540" /&gt; Between 1779 and 1781 he continued his  studies in France at the [[Collège de France]], where he took classes in physics and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt;

On returning to Poland in 1781, he accepted a position as tutor in the house of [[Grand Crown Chancellor]] [[Andrzej Zamoyski]].&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt; In 1782 he received a doctorate from the [[Zamojski Academy]].&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt; He translated several works from French into Polish and briefly worked at the Academy as a teacher of French language.&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt;

=== Reformer ===
[[File:Stanislaw Staszic by Barwicki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Staszic by W. Barwicki]] 
His ''Remarks upon the Life of [[Jan Zamoyski]]'' (''Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego'', 1787), published anonymously on the eve of the [[Great Sejm]], transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; It became a model for other similar works&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt; and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.&lt;ref name="psb541" /&gt;

Within his ''Remarks'', Staszic did not portray the life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; He advocated the abolition of the [[serfdom]] and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights).&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; He criticised the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) for [[Golden Liberty|inefficient governance]], and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grze?kowiak-Krwawicz2012"/&gt; He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt; Although he preferred [[republicanism]] in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name="Bauer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grze?kowiak-Krwawicz2012"/&gt; In ''Remarks'' he even supported the introduction of an [[absolute monarchy]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt;

Staszic was a keen observer of the proceedings of the Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788.&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; He continued publishing new books and pamphlets.&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; His ''Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski'' (''Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego'', 1790), together with his previous ''Remarks'', are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; In ''Warnings'', he criticised the [[magnates of Poland and Lithuania]], [[monasticism|monastic order]]s and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt; Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is recognized as one of the founding fathers of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]].&lt;ref name="TrencsényiKopeček2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Balázs Trencsényi|author2=Michal Kopeček|title=Discourses of Collective Identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): Texts and Commentaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-52-3|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suziedelis2011"/&gt;

During 1790–1791 he accompanied Zamoyski's family on a trip abroad, and continued to serve as an adviser to the family, although his relations with the sons ([[Aleksander August Zamoyski]], [[Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski]]) had become strained; he would eventually align himself with the daughter of the family, [[Anna Zamoyska]] (Anna Jadwiga Sapieżyna).&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; He supported the 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]], a failed attempt to liberate Commonwealth from foreign influence following the events of the 1793 [[Second Partition of Poland]], donating money to the insurgents' cause.&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; Upon the defeat of the Uprising, he accompanied the family on their trip to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="psb542" /&gt; He also made some successful financial investments, including in the stock market.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt; He then served as an economic adviser for the Zamoyski and the [[Sapieha family|Sapieha families]], invested in their estates, and lent them money.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt;

=== Late life ===

[[File:Pan-tnw.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Polish Academy of Sciences]] ([[Staszic Palace]]), [[Warsaw]]]]
[[File:Portret Staszica w granatowym fraku.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Staszic, 1820s]]
After the [[partitions of Poland]], in which Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized all of the Commonwealth's territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. He studied the geology of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt; In 1800 he co-founded the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning]]; from 1802 he was one of its most active members.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt; In 1804 he went to France, where he observed the changes wrought by Napoleon.&lt;ref name="psb543" /&gt; On return to Poland in 1805, he spent some time in the [[Tatra Mountains]], where he continued his geological studies and conducted [[ethnography|ethnographic]] ones. He worked with [[Jan Chrystian Hoffmann]] on a geological map of Poland.&lt;ref name="psb544" /&gt; In the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] he worked with the Ministry of Education (''Izba Edukacyjna Księstwa Warszawskiego'') and was involved in numerous educational reforms and initiatives.&lt;ref name="psb544" /&gt; He also briefly worked with the Ministry of Treasury.&lt;ref name="psb544" /&gt;

From 1808 he was president of the [[Society of Friends of Learning]] (''Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk'', or ''TPN''), forerunner to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (''Polska Akademia Nauk''); he would be elected repeatedly as the society's president until his death.&lt;ref name="psb544" /&gt; In 1808 he also became [[referendary]] to the [[State Council (Duchy of Warsaw)|State Council]] (''Rada Stanu'') of the Duchy; in 1810 he became a full member.&lt;ref name="psb544" /&gt; In the Council, he was active in regard to questions of education and the economy.&lt;ref name="psb545" /&gt; As ''TPN'' president he was active in many initiatives which supported and popularized science in Poland.&lt;ref name="psb545" /&gt; He oversaw the construction of a headquarters for the ''TPN'', which came to be known as the "[[Staszic Palace]]".&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt;

From 1814 he supported the [[Russian Empire]], seen as a [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] ally of Poland, and favored the idea of a great [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] monarchy.&lt;ref name="psb545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psb546" /&gt; After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, he became a member of the government of the newly created small state of [[Congress Poland]] (in [[personal union]] with Russia), initially in the new Ministry of Education and Religion, in 1816 serving as deputy minister.&lt;ref name="psb546" /&gt; In 1815 he was decorated with the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]].&lt;ref name="psb546" /&gt; In 1819 he endorsed a controversial censorship law, damaging his reputation.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt;

His 1815 Polish translation of Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' met with a negative reception.&lt;ref name="psb546" /&gt; In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume ''Works'' (''Dzieła'').&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt; Volumes 7–9 comprised his ''Humankind: A Didactic Poem'' (''Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne''), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as an important contribution to the [[history of Polish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt; However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt;

He also carried out studies on education and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt; Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of [[evolution]]ism in the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical of the influence of religion.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt; These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt;

From 1816 he was involved in mining research and projects.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt; He also actively supported industrial development in Poland.&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt; He was one of the first to see the importance of coal, and supported the development of [[metallurgy]]-related projects, from mines to zinc and [[steel mills]].&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt; He was also involved in the development of [[ceramic]] and textile industries, and improving the transport infrastructure (roads, canals).&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt; He discovered coal deposits in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], where he initiated the building of a coal mine. Between 1816 and 1824 he was the ''de facto'' minister of industry of the Congress Poland (styled officially the "director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry") and initiated construction of the [[Old Polish Industrial Area]] (''[[Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy]]'').&lt;ref name="psb547" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt; As his projects did not result in quick returns, he incurred increasing criticism, and eventually resigned from his position in 1824.&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt;

In 1816 he founded the ''[[Hrubieszowskie Towarzystwo Rolnicze]]'' ([[Hrubieszów]] Agricultural Society),&lt;ref name="psb546" /&gt; seen by some as the first Polish [[cooperative]].&lt;ref name="hrubieszow" /&gt;

He died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, most likely due to a stroke.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; His funeral gathered 20,000 people, including the viceroy of the Congress Poland, [[Józef Zajączek]].&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; He was buried in the cemetery of the [[Camaldolese Hermit Monastery (Kraków)|Camaldolese Hermit Monastery]] in Kraków.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; His testament left his property at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.&lt;ref name="psb548" /&gt;

== Private life ==

Staszic was remembered by his contemporaries as a loner and not a person who was quick to make friends.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; He has been described as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt; He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.&lt;ref name="psb549" /&gt;

'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of [[sustainable design]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space.&lt;ref name=nytimes_landscape&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Stephen|title=A Sustainability That Aims to Seduce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/garden/21sustainable.html?pagewanted=all&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=cserbias%3Aw%2C[%22RI%3A1%22%2C%22RI%3A3%22]&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FSustainable%2Blandscape%2Barchitecture%2F|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This can include ecological, politically correct, social and economic aspects of sustainability. For example, the design of a [[Sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage system]] can: improve habitats for [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.

The design of a [[green roof]] or a [[roof garden]] can also contribute to the sustainability of a [[landscape architecture]] project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for [[wildlife]] and provide for [[recreation]].

Sustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (''firmitas'', ''utilitas'', ''venustas''). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, [[pollution]], [[surface water runoff]] etc. 

== Professional Practice ==
The American Society of Landscape Architects' sustainable design guidelines include the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/guidesandtoolkit.aspx|title=Sustainable Design Guides {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* ''Public Health + Landscape Architecture:'' Health benefits of nature

* ''Community Design'': Climate change, green infrastructure, healthy and livable communities, resilient design, sustainable transportation, sustainable urban development.  

* ''Residential Design'': Improving water management, increasing water efficiency, applying ecological design, using low impact materials.
The American Society of Landscape Architects also provide a sustainability toolkit that includes economic, environmental, and social models, for projects of different scales, that can be used in practicing landscape architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/guidesandtoolkit.aspx|title=Sustainable Design Guides {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Telephone numbers in Mauritius follow a [[numbering plan|closed numbering plan]] and are regulated by the ''Information and Communication Technologies Authority''.

==Numbering details==
Mauritian phone numbers are seven ([[landline]]) to eight digits ([[mobile phone|mobile]]) long. Landline numbers begin with ''2'' (north), ''4'' (central), or ''6'' (south). Mobile numbers begin with the digit ''5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to call Mauritius (country code +230)|url=https://howtophoneto.com/mauritius/|website=howtophoneto.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calling formats==
To call a Mauritius cell phone, the following format is used:
* '''5 123 4567'''       Calls inside Mauritius
* '''+230 5 123 4567'''  Calls from outside Mauritius

To call a Mauritius fixed line, the following format is used:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">'''''The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st Century''''' is a book by [[Robert W. McChesney]] (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2004).&lt;ref name="McChesney2004"&gt;{{cite book |last= McChesney |first= Robert W.
|title=The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st Century
|year= 2004|publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |isbn= 1-58367-105-6
|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book brings up issues in [[journalism]] like bias of news and declining quality of content. The book also points a number of weaknesses in the media sector as well as new ways to regulate the sector.

In further analysis of identifying the problem with Media as it relates to politics is to understand that in the Political Science disciplines in universities it is very much a sideline subject matter that doesn't bare the potential weight should on American Politics and elections.   The higher education discipline that does deal more with the impact of media bias on politics is Communications.   

In a a Journal article by D. Graber, J.Smith '''Political communication faces the 21st century''' but the research in this article shows the importance and small change to begin to better understand the impact of the media and politics.   The author references multiple future directions and 10 targets to give political communication scholars better insight into the neglected aspect of the impact and issues facing politics and media in the 21st century.   These targets include, ''Communications policy formulation,  preserving the open marketplace of ideas, Global cultural differences,Media as agents of political socialization,Public information campaigns,The rhetoric of political leaders,The rhetoric of negotiations,Learning limitations and Network analyses''.

Another powerful impact to U.S. Politics has grown from the types of technology used to communicate political information to the masses.   We need look no further than our own Facebook or Twitter pages to see positions, news or fake news and quotes from our politcal leaders taken in and out of context and manipulated to position the posters agenda.   The seeds are planted and those seeds are powerful.  In an article by Clay Shirky '''The Political Power of Social Media Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change''' he first describes the 2001 impeachment trial of Philippin President Joseph Estrada.   How mass text messages created crowds of protesters coordinated by text messages that shut down the city of Manila and the response changing the course of the hearing.  Shirky goes to write "''Disciplined and coordinated groups, whether businesses or goverments, have always had an advantage over undisciplined ones: they have  an easier time engaging in collective action because they have way of directing the action of their members. Social media can compensate for the disadvantages of undisciplined groups by reducing the costs of coordination''".  This has effectivley changed the ability of smaller group impact on any politically charged environment.    Shirky goes on to analyze several attempts by U.S. offiicials to control, censor or entertain controlling these private environments.  In addition Shirky says he believes " ''Washington's ability to shape or target these changes is limited. Instead, Washington should adopt a more general approach, promoting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly every where. And it should understand that progress will be slow. Only by switching from an instrumental to an environmental view of the effects of social media on the public sphere will the United States be able to take advantage of the long-term benefits these tools promise?even though that may mean accepting short-term disappointment."''

Media bias, rating importance and monetary gain for sensationalizing political controversy  verses fact reporting on politics is rampant in our society, the tools by which now normal people can piece together a political view and share it with 1000s of people instantly is problematic where it is combined with the extreme mainstream media antics needs to be researched more thoroughly and is at a critical point that begs for reform and understanding not necessarily censorship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4295">{{short description|A major shear zone that developed in the Precambrian}}
The '''Trans Brazilian Lineament''' (TBL), or '''Transbrasiliano Lineament''', is a major [[shear zone]] that developed in the [[Precambrian]] period, and that has been reactivated several times since then, mostly recently during the [[Mesozoic]]. Movement along the shear zone helps explain how the [[South America]]n continent could have fitted tightly to the [[Africa]]n continent before the breakup of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref name=Fairhead2007/&gt;

==Formation and location==

The TBL was formed when the [[Goiás Ocean]], lying between the [[Amazonian craton]] and the [[Congo craton|Congo]] / [[Sao Francisco craton]], was closed during the formation of West Gondwana around 600 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Hatcher2007/&gt;
The [[lineament]] extends from the northeast coast of [[Brazil]] in a southwesterly direction through [[Paraguay]] and into [[Argentina]], where it is dissipated in the Salado and Colorado extension basins.&lt;ref name=Fairhead2007/&gt;

The [[Trans-Saharan Belt]] (TSB), running from [[Algeria]] to [[Benin]], was created in the same period. It marks the line where the [[Pharusian Ocean]], linked to the Goiás Ocean, was closed as the [[West African craton]] collided with the [[Saharan Metacraton]].&lt;ref name=Hatcher2007/&gt;
The TSB includes the Hoggar belt, which splays into the [[Kandi fault zone]] in Benin, corresponding to the [[Sobral fault]] at the north of the TBL.
Given the correspondence of faults, which is widely accepted, the TBL and TBS form perhaps the longest coherent shear zone on the Earth.&lt;ref name=Attoh2008/&gt;

==Gondwana breakup==

Towards the north of the lineament in Brazil, a series of splay faults show where the crust has extended, and these faults match corresponding faults in Africa. Thus the [[Pernambuco fault]] in Brazil matches the [[Foumban fault zone]] in [[Cameroon]], and other Brazilian faults match the [[Benue Trough]] in [[Nigeria]]. The extension caused by these splay faults causes a poor fit between South America and Africa around the [[Niger Delta]] region.&lt;ref name=Fairhead2007/&gt;
However, after allowing for a [[Sinistral and dextral|sinistral]] shear movement of about 100&amp;nbsp;km of the crust to the east of the TBL, there is an excellent fit between South America and Africa both to the south and the west of the Niger Delta.&lt;ref name=Foulger2005/&gt;

Joerg''' (February 6, 1885 - January 7, 1952) was an American geographer, and in particular an expert in the geography of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, who exercised broad influence on the field in various positions, ultimately as Chief Archivist of the Cartographic Records Branch of the National Archives.&lt;ref name="AINA"&gt;Herman R. Frits, Arctic Institute of North America, [http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3883 W. L. G. JOERG (1885-1952)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;John K.

Joerg 1885-1952]", ''Geographical Review'', published by the American Geographical Society, Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jul., 1952), pp. 482-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joerg was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; A prodigy, Joerg graduated from the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Preparatory School]] at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="AINA"/&gt; He was fluent in many languages, and studied  in Germany, at [[Thomas Gymnasium]] and the [[University of Leipzig]], from 1901 to 1904, then studied [[geography]] and [[surveying]] at [[Columbia University]] for a year.&lt;ref name="AINA"/&gt; After returning to Germany for a five year stint at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, Joerg entered into employment with the [[American Geographical Society]] in 1911, where he would remain until 1937 when he left the Society to accept the post of Chief of the Division of Maps and Charts in the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Joerg was the first employee of the society to have had advanced university training in modern geography.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

Joerg published many books articles on geography, including volumes on the geography of the polar regions.&lt;ref name="AINA"/&gt; Although he personally never travelled to the polar regions, he was considered to be the world's greatest expert on the geography of these regions.&lt;ref name="AINA"/&gt;

His early death was caused by a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="AINA"/&gt;

He studied [[mathematics]] and [[geography]] in [[Berlin]] and Halle, where he graduated in 1888 with a dissertation on the lakes of [[Mansfeld Land|Mansfeld]], ''Die Mansfelder Seen''. The following year he obtained his habilitation with a study on the depth ratios of [[Masurian Lake District|Masurian lakes]]. In 1889 he also became managing director of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. 

In 1907 he became an associate professor at the [[University of Rostock]], where in 1919 he was appointed full professor. He was editor of the ''Geographischen Arbeite'' and the ''Mitteilungen der geographischen Gesellschaft zu Rostock'' (Releases of the Geographical Society of [[Rostock]]). Ule is sometimes referred to as "the founder of geography in [[Mecklenburg]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igs-halle.de/igs/cms/front_content.php?idcat=73&amp;idart=2023 Integrierte Gesamtschule Halle - Projekte - Spurensuche]&lt;/ref&gt;

With Swiss scientist [[François-Alphonse Forel]] (1841-1912), he was co-creator of the "[[Forel-Ule scale]]", a method used for obtaining an approximate measurement of [[surface water]] color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n5x_d0TRGlsC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Forel-Ule+scale%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9PSBGfXe--&amp;sig=RRoKE5Q-6DemHRfEVb6O2nMV8-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rxteUKu3I4TXigKMyIH4DQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Forel-Ule%20scale%22&amp;f=false Google Books] Living Marine Resources: Their Utilization and Management by Edwin S.
