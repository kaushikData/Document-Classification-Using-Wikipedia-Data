The '''2007 [[Monte Carlo Masters]]''' was a men's [[tennis]] tournament played on [[Clay court|outdoor clay courts]]. It was the 101st edition of the [[Monte Carlo Masters]] and was part of the [[ATP Masters Series]] of the [[2007 ATP Tour]]. It took place at the [[Monte Carlo Country Club]] from 14 April through 22 April 2007. 

==Review==
[[Image:Marat Safin 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Marat Safin]], who was knocked out in the second round.]]
[[Rafael Nadal]] won his third consecutive title and Monte Carlo in 2007. The Spaniard, second seed, defeated the current world number one, [[Roger Federer]] in one hour and thirty-six minutes 6–4, 6–4. 

Before the tournament began, British number one [[Andy Murray]] pulled out due to back problems. During the first round matches, there were only a few shocks, with seeded players [[Jarkko Nieminen]] and [[Marcos Baghdatis]] failing to make it past there unseeded opponents. The second round the higher seeded players due to them all receiving a bye through the first round. [[Roger Federer]] defeated Italian [[Andreas Seppi]], and [[Rafael Nadal]] beat [[Juan Ignacio Chela]] in straight sets. The highest seeded player not to make it into the third round was third seed [[Nikolay Davydenko]]. He was defeated by Swedish player [[Robin Söderling]]. Other casualties in the second round were [[Fernando González]], [[Mikhail Youzhny]] and [[David Nalbandian]]. 

In the third round, there were no shock results, with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer both easing into the next round in straight sets. The quarter final draw was:

* [1] [[Roger Federer]] vs [[David Ferrer]] [12]
* [16] [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] vs [[Richard Gasquet]] [11]
* [10] [[Tomáš Berdych]] vs [[Robin Söderling]]
* [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]] vs [[Rafael Nadal]] [2]

[[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Roger Federer]] both eased through into the semi-finals. However, both the other matches went to three sets. [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] beat eleventh seed [[Richard Gasquet]] 5–7, 7–5, 6–2. Plus, [[Tomáš Berdych]] beat the unseeded Swedish player [[Robin Söderling]] 5–7, 6–3, 6–0.

In semi-finals, Federer and Nadal beat their opponents in straight sets to meat each other in the final. After over and hour and a half of tennis however, [[Rafael Nadal]] was victorious defeating the world number one in two sets.

Nadal won his third consecutive Monte Carlo Masters, becoming the first man to achieve this and equalling [[Thomas Muster]]'s record of 3 wins in the process.

The tournament, despite his loss in the final, represented an upturn in fortunes for Roger Federer. After winning the [[2007 Australian Open]] and prestigious [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], Federer suffered early losses in [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] and [[2007 Miami Masters|Miami]], tournaments he had won both  in the previous two years.

The '''Agumba''' (also '''Gumba''') people were an [[ethnic group]] who inhabited the plains of what is now central [[Kenya]], but are now either [[extinct]] or assimilated.

They are known only through the oral tradition of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Ogiek]] peoples, who credit them as being the original inhabitants of the territory. The Agumba are described as being [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and [[pygmy|pygmies]]According to Kikuyu descriptions, they worked with iron and made pottery, and were [[beekeeping|beekeeper]]s. They are probably reated to the [[Khoisan]] peoples of Southern Africa, especially the hunter-gatherer [[San people]]/Bushmen

The Agumba, along with several other groups, were sometimes called the [[Dorobo]] by the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and other cattle-herding groups. This derogatory term was also used in much of the early academic anthropological literature on the area.

'''Arkan''' ({{lang-uk|Aркан, Aрґан }}) is a popular dance of the Ukrainian [[Hutsuls|Hutsul]] people (from Hutsulshchyna, southwestern Ukraine).

The Arkan is traditionally performed around a burning bonfire by the men. The word Arkan also refers to the step that the men perform while dancing around the fire. The step begins with the right foot stepping to the side (or double stamping as the dance builds momentum), the left foot crosses behind, the right foot steps to the side again, and the left foot is hopped in front of the dancer with a bent knee. The dance is performed with the men's arms upon one another's shoulders. In professional Ukrainian dances, however, many variations may accompany this root step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houston|first1=Ron|title=Folk Dance Problem Solver|date=1987|publisher=The Society of Folk Dance Historians|url=http://www.sfdh.org/encyclopedia/arkan87.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901000010/http://www.sfdh.org/encyclopedia/arkan87.php|archivedate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Romanian dance called [[Arcan (dance)|Arcan]].

British folk-punk band [[The Ukrainians]] have a (very fast and furious) track called ''Arkan'' on their ''[[Respublika (Ukrainians album)|Respublika]]'' album.

The Maltese nationalist [[Mikiel Anton Vassalli]], a convert to [[Protestantism]], translated the [[Gospel]]s and [[Acts of the Apostles]] into [[Maltese language]]. This was then known as the "[[Kafir]] version". [[Michael Camilleri]] (c.1814–1903), afterwards vicar of [[Lyford, Oxfordshire|Lyford, Berkshire]], revised Vassali's version translated the New Testament and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Maltese.

'''''BirGün''''' (''One Day'') is an [[Istanbul]]-based [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[left-wing]] daily.

The paper was founded in 2004 by a group of Turkish intellectuals. The most important point of the newspaper is that it is not owned by any parent company or conglomerate.

Since its foundation, the newspaper had to face serious pressures from publishing trusts, mainly to affiliated with [[Doğan Media Group]] that owns the vast majority of the market. Whereas most of the newspapers in Turkey pay paper and publishing cost as installments, ''BirGün'' had to pay in cash. In order to afford the costs, the newspaper first launched a subscription campaign, then raised its price to 0.75&amp;nbsp;[[Turkish lira|TL]]. The price was 1 TL in 2012 and 1,5 TL in Summer 2015 while also costs 40 [[kuruş]] (0,4 TL) on [[universities in Turkey]].

{{clear left}}
Most of the ''BirGün'' columnists are members or sympathizers of the socialist [[Freedom and Solidarity Party]] (ÖDP), which is a member of [[Party of the European Left]] and one of the founders of [[European Anti-Capitalist Left]].

'''Bolungarvíkurgöng''' is a tunnel in northwestern [[Iceland]], located in [[Westfjords]] along Route 61. It has a length of {{convert|5156|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and opened on 25 September 2010.&lt;ref name="Vegagerdin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegagerdin.is/upplysingar-og-utgafa/frettir/nr/2439 |title=Bolungarvíkurgöng opnuð |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607032538/http://www.vegagerdin.is/upplysingar-og-utgafa/frettir/nr/2439 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main objectives of building the tunnel was to replace one of Iceland’s most dangerous roads which connected two of the largest towns in the area, [[Ísafjörður]] and [[Bolungarvík]], and thereby improving road safety. The old road lies along the seashore under the steep and unstable mountain hills of Óshlíd. Other objectives include improved road connections and reduced travel times so the distance between Ísafjordur and Bolungarvík will be similar as between districts in a city. The tunnel was opened for traffic on 15 July 2010.

'''Combating Corruption''' is a Federal law of the [[Russian Federation]] that took effect on January 10, 2009. It establishes basic principles of combating corruption as well as the legal and organizational frameworks for preventing and fighting corruption. The law also seeks to minimize the consequences of corrupt offenses.

Corruption is defined as the illegal use of an official's position contrary to the legitimate interests of society and the state, combined with obtaining or illegal provision of benefits to the official.

Among the anti-corruption measures are elimination of unjustified prohibitions and restrictions, especially in the area of economic activity, higher wages as well as sotsgaranty for state and municipal employees, the establishment of mechanisms of public control over the work of government, anti-corruption [[propaganda]], ensuring [[media independence]], tightening requirements for civil servants and others.

The law requires [[civil servants]] to inform their employer, the prosecutor's office or other state bodies of all bribe attempts. In addition, civil servants are obliged to declare their income and wealth (the list of declared income and assets) and the income and property of the spouse and minor children. In order to prevent [[conflicts of interest]], civil servants holding securities or shares (including participation interests) need to transfer them to trust management.

The '''''four banal''''' (English: '''common oven''') was a feudal institution in medieval [[France]]. The [[feudal lord]] (French: ''seigneur'') often had, among other [[Banalité|banal rights]], the duty to provide and the privilege to own all large ovens within his [[fief]], each operated by an ovenmaster or ''fournier''. In exchange, personal ovens were generally outlawed and commoners were thus compelled to use the seigniorial oven to bake their bread. Such use was subject to payment, in kind or money, originally intended merely to cover the costs associated to the construction, maintenance and operation of the oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=François|last1=de Boutaric|first2=Théodore|last2=Sudre|title=Traité des droits seigneuriaux et des matiéres feodales|trans-title=Treaty on seigniorial rights and feudal matters|publisher=Jean-François Forest|location=Toulouse|year=1767|origyear=First published 1745|language=French|chapter=1ère partie : Du Bail à Cens ou à rente, et des Droits dûs au Seigneur, Censuel et Directe – Chapitre 11 : De la Bannalité|page=379|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24992301M/|chapter-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seigniorial ovens were [[masonry oven]]s built on the Roman plan and were large enough to hold an entire community's ration of [[bread]].

For example, in the hamlet of Nan-sous-Thil ([[Côte-d'Or]], France), the villagers were required to bake their bread at the ''four banal'', as at home they were permitted only a small oven placed under the hood of the chimneypiece, for baking "''[[Cake|gâteau]] et [[flan]]''". Those regulations sought to reduce the risk of fire where [[thatch]]ed cottages huddled together. The danger was real, as demonstrated in 1848 when a full quarter of the neighbouring hamlet of Thil-la-Ville was consumed by a fire that ignited from sparks when a [[housewife]] heated her oven.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Logeat, ''Nan-sous-Thil'' Semur-en-Auxois, 1940, noted in a review by Albert Colombet, "Review: En feuilletant une monographie de village", ''Annales d’histoire sociale'' '''3'''.1/2 (January - June 1941):78-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oven design, but not necessarily the feudal monopoly on oven operation, was carried to French colonies. In [[New France]], it was the only banal right commonly established and the oven's fortified construction also served to protect the colonists during skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/BanalRights-Segniorialsystem-NewFrance.htm|accessdate=2013-04-18|title=Banal rights|work=Quebec history|first1=Claude|last1=Bélanger|publisher=Marianopolis College|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''four banal'' system seems to have died out in France during the 18th century, though it was a time when some dormant seigneurial rights were being insisted upon by an aristocracy hard-pressed for cash, as an official ''mémoire'' suggests: {{Quote|The lord will do well not to raise the question, taking into consideration that times have changed, seeing the scarcity of wood and the poverty of the populace, whom the exercise of this right seems to greatly trouble. If it is through the negligence of the lord that this right has fallen into desuetude, let everyone profit from it without injury".&lt;ref&gt;''Le seigneur fera bien de ne pas élever la question par considération pour la différence des temps, attendu la rareté du bois et la pauvreté des habitants, que l'exercise de ce droit paraît incommoder beaucoup. Si c'est par négligence du seigneur que ce droit est tombé dans l'oubli, que les habitants en profitent paisiblement''; quoted in Colombet 1941:79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Traditions surrounding the ''four banal'' may have lasted as late as [[World War II]]. In some rural areas of France, the old communal ovens are still extant (''illustration'') and are sometimes used for community celebrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17800">'''Confidence-building measures''' ('''CBMs''') or '''confidence- and security-building measures''' are in actions taken to reduce fear of attack by both (or more) parties in a situation of tension with or without physical conflict. The term is most often used in the context of international politics, but is similar in logic to that of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] and [[interpersonal communication]] used to reduce conflictual situations among human individuals. CBMs emerged from attempts by the [[Cold War]] superpowers and their military alliances (the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]) to avoid nuclear war by accident or miscalculation. However, CBMs also exist at other levels of conflict situations, and in different regions of the world although they might not have been called CBMs.

Mathematically, this term assumes that a [[positive feedback]] model, where fear (and/or suspicion) of military attack or [[human right]]s violations is the positive feedback factor, is a valid model of the conflict. The actions which constitute confidence-building measures provide a [[negative feedback]] to the conflict, which weakens, or possibly cancels or reverses the tension which would otherwise grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]] and eventually turn into a [[war]].

==Information exchange and verification==
In international relations, the way that confidence-building measures are intended to reduce fear and suspicion (the positive feedbacks) is to make the different states' (or opposition groups') behaviour more predictable.

This typically involves exchanging information and making it possible to verify this information, especially information regarding armed forces and military equipment.

=== Examples ===
1. CBMs dealing with troop movements and exercises:
:a. Notification of maneuvers (with different procedures and length of advance notice for different types and sizes of maneuvers).
:b. Notification of alert exercises and mobilization drills.
:c. Notification of naval activities outside of normal areas.
:d. Notification of aircraft operations and flights near sensitive and border areas.
:e. Notification of other military activities (in the "out of garrison" category) which might be misinterpreted.

2. CBMs dealing with exchanges of information.
Information may be exchanged, directly or through third parties, in the following categories:
:a. Military budgets
:b. New equipment and arms
:c. Unit locations
:d. Significant changes in a unit's size, equipment or mission
:e. The major elements of strategic and tactical doctrine

3. CBMs dealing with exchanges of personnel.
These personnel exchanges should be balanced in terms of numbers and duration, and could include:
:a. Inviting observers to maneuvers, exercises and "out of garrison" activities. (The observers could be from neighboring states, from a third party neutral nation, or from an international organization).
:b. Stationing permanent liaison observers at major headquarters. (As in a above, the observers could be from neighbors, neutrals, or international organizations).
:c. Exchanging personnel as students or instructors at military academies, military schools, and war colleges.
:d. Exchanging military attachés from all three services (land, sea, air). These attaché positions should be filled by highly qualified personnel, and not be used as "golden exiles" to get rid of officers who are politically undesirable.

4. CBMs dealing with the assembly, collation, and dissemination of data.
:a. A central registry should be set up (under international organization auspices) to assemble, collect, analyze and publish information on armaments, organization and disposition of military units.
:b. Independent technical means (under national or international organization control) should be available to verify this data. There should be agreement on the nature of these means and an understanding that there will be no interference with these means.

5. CBMs dealing with border tensions.
:a. Set up demilitarized zones in sensitive border areas. Depending on the sensitivity of the area and the tensions between the two countries, certain types of weapons and units (e.g., armor, artillery) could be excluded from these areas.
:b. Establish joint patrols in these areas (with or without the participation of other third party neutrals).
:c. Establish fixed observation posts in these areas manned by neutrals and representatives from the two border nations.
:d. Set up sensors (ground, tower, air, tethered aerostat) to supplement these patrols and observation posts.

6. CBMs dealing with actions which might be interpreted as provocative.
:a. Agreement should be reached on acceptable and unacceptable military activities, especially in sensitive and border areas.
:b. Clear limits should be placed on those military activities, such as a mobilizations and calling up selected reserves, which could lead to misunderstandings. Notification procedures should be established for practice movements.

7. CBMs dealing with communications.
:a. Direct ("hot line") communications systems should be established between heads of state, chiefs of military forces (defense ministers), general staffs, and units in contact across a border.
:b. The use of coded military message traffic (on-line and off-line cryptography) should be limited.

8. CBMs dealing with weapons.
:a. Agreement should be reached on levels and types of weapons, with emphasis on the exclusion of high-performance and expensive weapons systems.
:b. Agreement should be reached on levels of military arms budgets.
:c. Defensive weapons (anti-aircraft artillery, anti-tank weapons, mines) should be given preference in ceilings over offensive weapons (tanks, artillery, aircraft).

9. CBMs dealing with extra-military contacts
:a. Encourage visits by military athletic teams.
:b. Encourage social and professional contacts through the attaché network and the various elements of the regional military system.

10. CBMs dealing with training and education.
:a. Teach CBM approaches in national military academies, staff schools, and war colleges, as well as in the multinational military schools.
:b. Apply CBM techniques in command post and field exercises.
:c. Encourage the development of military trans-nationalism (i.e., a sense of military professionalism and mutual respect that transcends national boundaries).
:d. Examine primary and secondary school curricula and texts for aggressive, hostile or false information on potential adversaries.

11. CBMs and regional military systems.
:a. The institutions and activities of regional military systems such as the Inter-American Military System should be examined to see how they can be used in support of a confidence-building regime. The CBM support functions can include verification, contacts, channel of communications and a forum for expressing a wide range of ideas. (The institutions of the Inter-American Military System include: [[Inter-American Defense Board]], [[Inter-American Defense College]], multinational military schools in Panama, Service Chief's Conferences, military attaches, joint exercises, communications links, etc).
:b. Consideration should be given to lowering the presently high U.S. profile in most of the institutions of the Inter-American Military System, and to the possibility of moving key institutions (Board and College) to a Latin American country.

12. CBMs and functionalism.
Certain functional areas of military-to-military cooperation should be assessed for their possible value as confidence-builders, even between adversary nations. These include: search and rescue (SAR) missions for aircraft and shipping; disaster relief; hurricane tracking; civic action; humanitarian projects.

13. CBMs dealing with ways of expanding CBMs.
:a. Establish a regional or subregional mechanism, similar to the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE) to study confidence-building measures and ways to improve and increase them.
:b. Discuss CBMs at the periodic conferences of service chiefs.
:c. Explore the possibility of extending CBMs geographically to other areas. In the Central American case to the Caribbean and South America.

==People to people contacts==
Confidence-building measures between [[sovereign states]] have for many centuries also included the existence of and increased activities by [[embassy|embassies]], which are state institutions geographically located inside the territory of other states, staffed by people expected to have extremely good [[interpersonal relations|interpersonal skills]] who can explain and resolve misunderstandings due to differences in language and culture which are incorrectly perceived as threatening, or encourage local knowledge of a foreign culture by funding artistic and cultural activities.

A much more [[grassroots]] form of confidence building occurs directly between ordinary people of different states. Short visits by individual children or groups of children to another state, and longer visits (6–12 months) by secondary and tertiary students to another state, have widely been used in the [[European Union]] as one of the methods of decreasing the tensions which had earlier led to many centuries of inter-European wars, culminating in the first and second [[World War I|world wars]].

==Validity of the model==
If the [[feedback]] model assumed by the confidence-building measure mechanism is correct, then the rapidly developing improvement in communication between ordinary people by the [[internet]] should provide extremely robust, fast methods of information exchange and verification, as well as improved people-to-people contacts and general building of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] networks, reducing the intensity and frequency of [[war]]s.  Evidence to date, however, suggests that the internet is as likely to inflame opinion and increase conflict (or at least tensions) as individuals are exposed to significantly different points of view.

==Confidence building viewed as a process==

An alternative analytic approach to understanding confidence building looks at broader process concepts rather than concentrating on specific measures. This approach finds its fullest expression in ''Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View'' (James Macintosh (Ottawa, Canada: Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Arms Control and Disarmament Studies Number 2, 1996. JX 1974.M32 1996)).

''Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View'' sees conventional understandings of confidence building as incomplete and focuses on why and how developing confidence-building arrangements can help to improve security relations. Confidence building, according to the transformation view, is a distinct activity undertaken by policy makers with the minimum intention of improving some aspects of a traditionally antagonistic security relationship through security policy coordination and cooperation. It entails the comprehensive process of exploring, negotiating, and then implementing tailored measures, including those that promote interaction, information exchange, and constraint. It also entails the development and use of both formal and informal practices and principles associated with the cooperative development of CBMs. When conditions are supportive, the confidence building process can ''facilitate, focus, synchronize, amplify, and generally structure the potential for a significant positive transformation in the security relations of participating states''. Thus, the confidence-building process involves more than simply the production of a confidence building agreement and definitely should not be confused with what specific CBMs do.

The serious pursuit of legitimate confidence-building arrangements, according to the transformation view, is an activity that is particularly well-suited to fostering positive changes in security thinking (transformation) when conditions are supportive. This is due to the activity's fundamentally cooperative character and the reinforcing nature of the confidence-building measures that comprise an arrangement. Confidence building, because of its basic character, is able to facilitate and structure the potential for change in security relationships when at least some states are dissatisfied with, and beginning to question, status quo security policies and approaches.

A particularly important dimension of the transformation view is the proposition that the changes in security thinking facilitated by confidence building can become ''institutionalized as a collection of new rules and practices stipulating how participating states should cooperate and compete with each other in their security relationship''. This restructured relationship redefines expectations of normal behaviour among participating states. Without at least a modest transformation of basic security expectations flowing from its application, ''it is difficult to see how confidence building can improve basic security relations in meaningful ways''.

Confidence building appears to offer considerable promise as a security management approach. However, this potential cannot be fully realized unless a policy-relevant and conceptually sound understanding of the confidence-building process and how it works animates application efforts. Relying on the traditional "minimalist" accounts of confidence building, with their tendency to reify the operational content of confidence-building measures as the essence of "confidence building," is unlikely to provide much help. This latter approach does not speak to the conditions that should be in place for effective confidence building to occur and ''lacks a convincing account of why and how adopting these measures will improve security relations''. (Text drawn from the executive summary of ''Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View'', with permission of the author and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.)

==Confidence building in Iraq and Afghanistan==

Through trial and error, service members have learned that COIN and stabilization operations require confidence-building measures. For the counterinsurgent, the first critical factor required to build trust is the ability to understand the context of the situation fully.  Cultural differences in education systems, religion, symbols, or behavioral norms could impede communication and the development of trust. As such, the counterinsurgent must always be aware of societal and cultural areas of sensitivity. Overall, the ability to understand underlying assumptions, past experiences, and the limiting factors of context will help set the stage for building trust.

The second critical factor is that it will take time. The time required to build trust can range from a few weeks to six months or more. With focused effort and regular interaction, trust typically forms at around the two- to- three-month mark. If the parties share significant risk, such as high levels of enemy contact, a strong bond of trust can form in a matter of weeks. 

The third critical factor is the use of confidence-building measures. Confidence-building measures are the activities that can bring conflicts closer to positive resolution through of promotion the belief that, in the future, each party will act in a mutually beneficial manner. In COIN operations, confidence-building measures generally fall into the following categories: a) Physical measures, b) Communication measures, and c) Relationship measures (See Figure Below).

The '''Duchy of the Archipelago''' ({{lang-it|Ducato dell'arcipelago}}, {{lang-ell|Δουκάτο του Αρχιπελάγους}}), or also '''Duchy of Naxos''' ({{lang-it|Ducato di Nasso}}, {{lang-ell|Δουκάτο της Νάξου}}) or '''Duchy of the Aegean''' ({{lang-it|Ducato dell'Egeo}}, {{lang-ell|Δουκάτο του Αιγαίου}}), was a maritime state created by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] interests in the [[Cyclades]] [[archipelago]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], in the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]], centered on the islands of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]] and [[Paros]]. It included all the [[Cyclades]] (except [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]). In 1537 it became a tributary of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and was annexed by the Ottomans in 1579; however, Christian rule survived in islands such as [[Siphnos]] (conquered by the Ottomans in 1617) and [[Tinos]] (conquered only in 1714).

==Background and establishment of the Duchy==
The [[Italian city states]], especially the [[Republic of Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], and the Republic of Venice, had been interested in the islands of the Aegean long before the Fourth Crusade. There were Italian trading colonies in [[Constantinople]] and Italian [[pirate]]s frequently attacked settlements in the Aegean in the 12th century. After the collapse and partitioning of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1204, in which the Venetians played a major role, Venetian interests in the Aegean could be more thoroughly realized.

The Duchy of the Archipelago was created in 1207 by the Venetian nobleman [[Marco Sanudo]], a participant in the Fourth Crusade and nephew of the former [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], who had led the Venetian fleet to Constantinople. This was an independent venture, without the consent of the [[Latin Empire|Latin emperor]] [[Henry of Flanders]]. Sanudo was accompanied by [[Marino Dandolo]] and [[Andrea Ghisi|Andrea]] and [[Geremia Ghisi]] (as well as [[Filocalo Navigajoso]], possibly). He arranged for the loan of eight [[galley]]s from the [[Venetian Arsenal]], set anchor in the harbor of Potamides (now Pyrgaki, in the southwest of Naxos), and largely captured the island.

The Naxiotes continued to resist, however, and established a base inland, around the fortress of Apalyros/Apalire. The latter fell to Sanudo after a five or six weeks' siege, despite the assistance rendered to the Greeks by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], Venice's main competitors.

With the entire island occupied in 1210, Sanudo and his associates soon conquered [[Melos]] and the rest of the islands of the [[Cyclades]], and he established himself as ''Duke of Naxia'', or ''Duke of the Archipelago'', with his headquarters on Naxos. Sanudo rebuilt a strong fortress and divided the island into 56 provinces, which he shared out as [[Fiefdom|fiefs]] among the leaders of his men, most of whom were highly autonomous and apparently paid their own expenses. Navigaojso had been granted his island domain by Henry of Flanders and was technically vassal of the Latin Empire; Sanudo himself recognized the Latin Empire's authority rather than making the Duchy a [[vassalage|vassal]] of Venice. The conqueror himself ruled for twenty years (1207–27). He held in his personal possession [[Paros]], [[Antiparos]], [[Milos]], [[Sifnos]], [[Kythnos]], [[Ios (island)|Ios]], [[Amorgos]], [[Kimolos]], [[Sikinos]], [[Syros]], and [[Pholegandros]].

Sanudo's fellow crusaders conquered lordships of their own, sometimes as vassals of Sanudo like Dandolo for [[Andros]]. Although they are often considered to have become Sanudo's vassals as well,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Longnon (1969), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; the Ghisi brothers, who held [[Tinos]], [[Mykonos]], and the [[Northern Sporades]] ([[Skiathos]], [[Skyros]], [[Skopelos]]) never recognized the suzerainty of Sanudo. Instead, like him they were directly vassals of the Latin Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1976), p. 19 note 78&lt;/ref&gt; Some families thought earlier&lt;ref&gt;cf Longnon (1969), pp. 238–239, basing himself on the works of Karl Hopf&lt;/ref&gt; to have settled at this time in the islands ([[Querini]], [[Barozzi]]) were in fact established in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Buenger Robbert, ''Venice and the Crusades'' in ''A History of the Crusades vol.V'' p 432, citing the works of Silvano Borsari and of R-J Loenertz&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, [[Kythera]] (or ''Cerigo''), held by [[Marco Venier]], and [[Antikythera]] (or ''Cerigotto''), held by [[Jacopo Viaro]] chose to become vassals of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Longnon (1969), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration, faith and economics==
[[Image:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|right|380px|The Duchy of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]] and states in the [[Morea]], carved from the [[Byzantine Empire]], as they were in 1265 (William R. Shepherd, ''Historical Atlas'', 1911)]]

The institution of European [[feudalism]] caused little disruption to the local islanders who were familiar with the rights of a [[landowner]] class under the Byzantine system of the ''[[pronoia]]''. The significant legal distinctions between the Byzantine ''pronoia'' and feudalism were of little immediate consequence to those who farmed the land or fished the waters in question.  In most cases, the local population submitted relatively peacefully to the authority of their new Venetian lords. Sanudo and his successors prudently followed a conciliatory course with their Byzantine subjects, granting even fiefs to certain among them, in an effort to bind them to the dynasty.

The Venetians brought the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] with them, but, as they were a minority of habitually absentee landowners, most of the population remained [[Greek Orthodox]]. Marco Sanudo himself established a Latin archbishopric on Naxos, but in contrast to his successors, did not attempt to forcibly convert the Greek Orthodox majority. These moves consisted primarily in imposing restrictions on Orthodox clergy and the exclusion of Orthodox Christians from positions of authority.

The islands were of great importance in Venetian [[grand strategy]], with their valuable trade routes to [[Anatolia]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], which the Venetians could now control; Aside from providing safe traveling routes to Venetian ships, the Venetians also exported to Venice [[corundum]] and [[marble]], which they mined on Naxos. Certain Latin feudal rights survived in the island of Naxos and elsewhere until they were abrogated in 1720 by the Ottomans.

==Later history==
The ''Annals'' of the Latin Archipelago center on the family histories of Sanudo and Dandolo, Ghisi, [[Crispo]] and Sommaripa, Venier and Quirini, Barozzi and Gozzadini. Twenty-one dukes of the two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, successively as vassals of the Latin Emperors at Constantinople, of the [[Villehardouin family|Villehardouin]] dynasty of [[Principality of Achaea|princes of Achaea]], of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (in 1278), and after 1418 of the Republic of Venice.

In 1248,&lt;ref&gt;R-J Loenertz, ''Les seigneurs tierciers de Négrepont'', Byzantion, vol. 35, 1965, re-edited in ''Byzantina et Franco-Graeca : series altera'' p 152. The date of 1236, proposed by Hopf without justification, has been rejected by Longnon in ''Problèmes de l'histoire de la principauté de Morée'', ''Journal des savants'' (1946) pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; the Duchy was nominally granted to [[William II Villehardouin|William of Villehardouin]], Prince of Achaea. Marco II Sanudo lost many of the islands, except Naxos and Paros, to the forces of the renewed Byzantine Empire under the admiral [[Licario]] in the late 13th century. The Byzantine revival was to prove short-lived though, as they relinquished control of their gains in 1310.

In 1317 the [[Catalan Company]] raided the remnants of the Duchy; in 1383, the Crispo family led an armed insurrection and overthrew Sanudo's heirs as Dukes of Archipelago. Under the Crispo dukes, social order and agriculture decayed, and piracy became dominant.

==Collapse and Ottoman conquest==
[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|280px|Eastern Mediterranean in 1450]]
Before the last Latin Christian duke, Jacopo IV Crispo, was deposed in 1566 by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Selim II]], he was already paying the Sultan tribute. The Sultan's appointed representative, the last Duke of Archipelago (1566–79) was a [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portuguese Jew]] (''[[Marrano]]''), [[Joseph Nasi]].

Latin Christian rule was not entirely removed after that date: the [[Gozzadini family]] in [[Bologna]] survived as lords of [[Siphnos]] and other little islands in the Cyclades until 1617, and the island of [[Tenos]] remained Venetian until 1714. The last Venetian ports in [[Morea]] (the [[Peloponnese]]) were captured in 1718. [[Gaspar Graziani]], a [[Dalmatia]]n nobleman, was awarded the title of ''Duke of the Archipelago'' in 1616, but the island was again under direct Ottoman rule at the end of 1617; he was the last to hold the title.

==Legacy and influence==
Today, Cyclades islands such as [[Syros]] and [[Tinos]] have some entirely Catholic villages and parishes, while many Greeks from the Cyclades have surnames with a distinctly Italo-Venetian origin e.g. Venieris, Ragousis, Dellaportas, Damigos etc.

==History==
To ensure compliance with the Fairtrade standards relating to labour standards, cooperative organization, and the governance of the Fairtrade benefits, the organization was divided in January 2004 into two independent organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=isH8ceNFj_UC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=%22Fairtrade+international%22++organization+divided+into+FLOCert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nv_WtZPhut&amp;sig=icTNAPG0U8k5dr5UCnHDyRuAz6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fairtrade%20international%22%20%20organization%20divided%20into%20FLOCert&amp;f=false|title=The Processes and Practices of Fair Trade: Trust, Ethics and Governance|last=Dine|first=Janet|last2=Granville|first2=Brigitte|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781136231803|location=|page=238|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''FLO International''' develops and reviews Fairtrade Standards and assists producers in gaining and maintaining certification and in capitalizing on market opportunities on the Fairtrade market. To ensure the transparency of the system, the standards are developed and reviewed by the FLO Standards and Policy Committee, in which FLO members, producer organizations, traders and external experts participate.
* [[FLOCert]] ensures that producers and traders comply with the FLO Fairtrade Standards and that producers invest the benefits received through Fairtrade in their development. Operating independently from any other interests, it follows the international [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards for certification bodies (ISO 65).

== Structure ==

Fairtrade International is divided into three units:

* Standards—sets and maintains fair trade standards
* Finance and Central Services—ensures coordinated communications, finance, human resources, fundraising, and IT services
* Producer Services and Relations—supports producers in gaining and maintaining fair trade certification and capitalizing on market opportunities&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2011). [http://www.fairtrade.net/liaison_officers.0.html Liaison Officers]. URL accessed on February 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairtrade standards ==

Given the development focus of fair trade, related standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organisations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time.

There are two types of fair trade standards for disadvantaged{{Vague|date=March 2009}} producers: standards for small farmers' organizations and for hired labor situations.

* Small farmers' organization standards include requirements for [[democracy|democratic]] decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the fair trade premiums are invested, etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.
* Hired labour situation standards seek to ensure that employees receive decent{{Vague|date=March 2009}} wages and may join [[trade union|unions]] and [[collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]. Fairtrade certified [[plantation]]s must also ensure that there is no [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced]] or [[child labour]] and that [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety requirements]] are met. In a hired labor situation, fair trade standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both management and employees. This joint body decides on how fairtrade premiums will be spent to benefit plantation employees.

For some products, such as [[coffee]], only fair trade standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as [[tea]], both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified.

Fair trade standards and procedures are approved by the FLO Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers, and traders) and external experts. Fair trade standards are set in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standards setting and are in addition the result of an extensive consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2011). [http://www.fairtrade.net/setting_the_standards.0.html Standard Setting]. URL accessed on February 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Fairtrade Certification Mark ==
{{main|International Fairtrade Certification Mark}}

The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|FAIRTRADE Mark]] is an international independent consumer Mark which appears on products as a guarantee that producers and traders have met fair trade standards. The FAIRTRADE Mark is owned and protected by FLO, on behalf of its 25 member and associate member labeling initiatives and producer networks.

For a product to carry the FAIRTRADE Mark, it must come from FLOCert inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade Standards set by Fairtrade International. The supply chain is also monitored by FLOCert to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only authorized licensees can use the FAIRTRADE Mark on their products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">The '''Hannut Formation''' ({{lang-fr|Formation de Hannut}}; {{lang-nl|Formatie van Hannut}}; abbreviation: Hn) is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formation]] in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of northern [[Belgium]]. The formation consists of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[clay]] and [[silt]], alternating with moer [[sand]]y layers. On top of this the [[lithology]] changes to [[limestone]], [[siltstone]] and [[sandstone]] and the top of the formation is formed by a layer of [[glauconite]] bearing sand. The Hannut Formation was formed during the early to middle [[Thanetian]] age (Late [[Paleocene]], about 57 million years ago).

The formation is named after the town of [[Hannut]] in the [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]].

==Lithologies==
The Hannut Formation can be about 100 meters thick in the [[Campine Basin]] and about 55 meters thick in the [[Mons Basin]]. In between these two basins the thickness varies between 40 and 20 meters. The formation is subdivided into five [[member (stratigraphy)|members]]:
*The [[Chercq Member]], [[tuffite]], clay and [[glauconite]] bearing sand layers. This member is most distinctively recognizable in the [[Hainaut (province)|province of Hainaut]];
*The [[Lincent Member]], a locally [[lithification|lithified]], predominantly clayey layer. It occurs in and around the [[Hesbaye]] region;
*The [[Halen Member]], clayey silt and silty sand;
*The [[Waterschei Member]], calcareous clay and silty clay. It occurs in the northeast of Belgium;
*The [[Grandglise Member]], the upper glauconiferous sand. It is almost always present.

==Stratigraphic relations==
In Belgian [[lithostratigraphy]] the Hannut Formation is one of the two formations of the [[Landen Group]]. The other formation is the younger [[Tienen Formation]] (continental and [[lagoon]]al sands and clays from the late Thanetian age), which is normally found on top of the Hannut Formation. In the northern and eastern parts of [[Flanders]] the Hannut Formation lies stratigraphically on top of the [[Heers Formation]] (middle Paleocene sands and marls).

The Hannut Formation [[correlation|correlates]] with parts of the [[Landen Formation]] in the [[Netherlands]].

The '''Kabras''', or Kabarasi, are a subtribe of the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] people of [[Kenya]]. They reside in [[Malava]] that is in the Kabras Division of [[Kakamega District]], which is neighboured by the [[Isukha]], Banyala, [[Tsotso]], and the [[Tachoni]]. The exact origin of the Luhya people is currently disputed, but there are historians who believe that the group came from [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] and migrated to their present-day location by way of the so-called [[Bantu expansion|Great Bantu Migration]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/luhya-tribe.html|title=The Luhya Tribe of Kenya: Their History and Culture|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Kabras dialect called Lukabaras&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/19916/KE|title=Luhya, Kabras in Kenya|last=Project|first=Joshua|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[Tachoni dialect (Luhya)|Tachoni]]. However, the Kabras have spread to other regions as a result of intermarriages and movement to seek greener pasture in formal employment. These people are described as adaptable, easily absorbing other culture's values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can be demonstrated in the way many Kabras practice the Christian and Muslim faiths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One notable cultural practice involves circumcision and pride-price required for marriage.  

Kabrasi clans were named after the heads of the families. They include Avatali, Abawande, Abamutama, Basonje, Abakhusia, Bamachina, Abashu, Abamutsembi, Baluu, Batobo, Bachetsi, and Bamakangala. Along with 17 other Luhya subtribes, the Kabras constitute 14 percent of the Kenyan population, making the ethnic group the second largest in the country, next to the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Before the colonial era, the Kabaras were under the rulership of Nabongo Mumia, the king of the [[Wanga]]. They were represented by an elder in his Council of Elders. The last known elder in the king's council was Soita Libukana Samaramarami. The Kabaras are said to have originally been Banyala.

When Quaker missionaries came to Kenya in the early part of the twentieth century, they spread out to Kabaras from [[Kaimosi]] in [[Tiriki]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} During the British colonization, the Kabras - along with the Wanga tribe - collaborated with the colonialists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These tribes, especially the [[Bukusu]], which waged strong resistance to the invaders, avoided the fate of most of the Luhya people, who lost their fertile lands to the British colonial rule.

== Politics ==
In politics, one of the famous Kabras politician is [[Dr. Noah Mahalang'ang'a Wekesa]], the former Kwanza MP and he as well served as Wildlife and Forestry minister under President [[Mwai Kibaki]]. Besides, another notable Kabras politician is Late[[Soita Shitanda]], who represented Malava Constituency in parliament and served as a Housing Minister in President Mwai Kibaki's cabinet. He was instrumental in the revival of the Sugar Cane industry in Western Kenya, spearheading the establishment of West Kenya Sugar factory in Malava. Former Chief Justice, the Late [[Zacchaeus Chesoni]], hailed from the [[Kabras]] sub tribe Bamachina clan close to Chimoi area near Webuye.  

== Economic activities ==
Kabras people are farmers, practicing livestock rearing and crop farming. The main cash crop is Sugarcane, which is harvested and taken to West Kenya Sugar Company as well as Mumias Sugar Company.

'''''Karpatska Rus'''''' ('''Карпатска Русь''') is a [[Rusyn language]] newspaper published in the [[United States]] for the [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]-speaking [[Lemkos|Lemko]] immigrant community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horbal |first1= Bogdan|authorlink1= Bogdan Horbal|last2=Magocsi |first2= Paul|editor1-first= Paul|editor1-last= Magocsi|editor1-link=Paul Magocsi |editor2-first= Ivan|editor2-last= Pop|editor2-link=  Ivan Pop|title=Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture |year= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=230|chapter=Karpatska Rus'|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA230 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is the successor to [[Lemko (Philadelphia)|''Lemko'']], which began publication in 1927.

Originally, the paper was published weekly or twice a week, and was entirely in the [[Lemkos|Lemko]] form of the [[Rusyn language]].  Its largest circulation was during [[World War II]], when it provided reporting from the war in the Carpathian mountains.  It later added articles in [[English (language)|English]], and eventually became a bi-lingual paper.  It was still in active publication in 2006, but with a reduced circulation. Since 2008 it has been published in English as a quarterly.

The newspaper had a [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile]] orientation, and avoided any suggestion that some researchers consider [[Lemkos]] a branch of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]s as opposed to Lemko being a synonym for Rusyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Magocsi|first1=Paul |authorlink1= Paul R.

'''''{{lang|fr|Les Damnés de la mer}}''''' is a 2008 [[documentary film]].

== Synopsis ==
In [[Dakhla, Western Sahara|Dakhla]] (in the southernmost part of [[Morocco]]), one of the richest fishing regions in the world, hundreds of Moroccan fishermen, pushed by the increasing shortage of resources in the north, huddle together in tents sprayed by the ocean. However, their quest for a miraculous catch has revealed itself to be a tragic trap. As they have no licenses, they are sentenced to remain a few yards from the shoreline and catch what they can, while foreign trawlers equipped with the latest in [[sonar]] technology, captures the sea's riches to export them to other continents.

==Overview==
The aim of a Maker Faire Africa is to create a space on the African continent where Afrigadget-type innovations, inventions and initiatives can be sought, identified, brought to life, supported, amplified and propagated. At the same time, ''Maker Faire Africa'' would seek to imbue creative types in science and technology with an appreciation of fabrication and by default manufacturing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1604">'''Microprudential regulation''' or  '''microprudential supervision''' is firm-level oversight or [[financial regulation]] by regulators of financial institutions, "ensuring the balance sheets of individual institutions are robust to shocks".&lt;ref&gt;Dr Alan Bollard, Bernard Hodgetts, and Mike Hannah. Where we are going with macro and micro-prudential policies in New Zealand? A speech delivered to the Basel III Conference in Sydney On 25 March 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/speeches/2011/4327011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811165837/http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/speeches/2011/4327011.html |archivedate=2013-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The motivation for micro-prudential regulation is rooted in [[consumer protection]]: ensuring [[solvency]] of financial institutions strengthens consumer confidence in the individual firms and the financial system as a whole. In addition, if a large number of financial firms fail at the same time, this can disrupt the overall financial system. Therefore, micro-prudential regulation also reduces [[systemic risk]].

==Standards==
Micro-prudential regulation involves enforcing standards, e.g. the [[Basel III]] global regulatory standards for bank capital adequacy, leverage ratios and liquidity.

'''Odersun''' was a German [[photovoltaic]] (PV) company that developed and manufactured [[CIGS cell]]s on a flexible [[copper]] backing, specifically designed for [[building-integrated photovoltaics]]. The insolvent company went into administration on 1 June 2012 and filed for bankruptcy.

Odersun employed more than 320 people in production, research and management in [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]], [[Fürstenwalde]] and [[Berlin]], Germany. In cooperation with partner and investor AT&amp;M, the company was setting up a joint venture in Beijing, China.

The company produced its flexible photovoltaic modules according to a proprietary and patented manufacturing process. These [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film modules]] converted sunlight into electricity using a thin layer of a [[copper indium gallium selenide]] (CIGS) [[semiconductor]] which was deposited on copper tape. These were cut, interconnected and built into different forms of modules depending on their application such as [[facade]]s, [[roof]]s, [[canopy (building)|canopies]] or [[louver]]s.

In 2008, the company topped the inaugural Guardian/Library House "CleanTech 100" list, which showcased the then best companies in European clean technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100.news2  Revealed: Europe's hottest clean technology companies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/table/2008/sep/18/cleantech100top10.cleantechnology100 Top 10: The hottest clean technology companies in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Drummers of Burundi''', commonly known in recordings as '''The Drummers of Burundi''', is a [[percussion]] ensemble originally from [[Burundi]].  Their performances are a part of [[ceremony|ceremonies]] such as births, funerals, and [[coronation]]s of ''[[mwami]]'' (Kings).  Drums (called [[karyenda]]) are [[sacred]] in Burundi, and represent the mwami, [[fertility]] and regeneration. The Royal Drummers use drums made from hollowed tree trunks covered with animal skins. In addition to the central drum, called ''Inkiranya'', there are ''Amashako'' drums which provide a continuous beat, and ''Ibishikiso'' drums, which follow the rhythm established by the Inkiranya.

The performance of the Royal Drummers has been the same for centuries, and their techniques and traditions are passed down from father to son. The members of the ensemble take turns playing the Inkiranya, dancing, resting, and playing the other drums, rotating throughout the show without interruptions. At the start of their performance, the drummers enter balancing the heavy drums on their heads and singing and playing. There are some extra members who carry ornamental [[spear]]s and [[shield]]s and lead the procession with their dance. They then perform a series of rhythms, some accompanied by song, and exit the stage the same way, carrying the drums on their heads and playing.

Beginning in the 1960s, the Drummers have toured the world. They have recorded at least three albums - ''Batimbo (Musiques Et Chants)'' in 1991,''The Drummers of Burundi'' (1992, recorded 1987) ''Real World'' (retitled ''Live at [[Real World Studios|Real World]]'' in 1993) and ''The Master Drummers of Burundi'' (1981 lp, 1994&amp;nbsp;cd). They have also appeared on [[Joni Mitchell]]'s ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]'' (1975), on ''Zimbo'', the B-side of the [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] 12" single of ''[[The Cutter (song)|The Cutter]]'' (1983), and the [[Def Leppard]] single "[[Rocket (Def Leppard song)|Rocket]]". They have influenced artists such as [[Adam and the Ants]] and [[Bow Wow Wow]], and inspired [[Thomas Brooman]] to organize the [[WOMAD]] festival in 1982, which shaped the burgeoning [[world music]] genre.

The Drummers were featured inn Werner Herzog's film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'', as the "drumming of the bushmen".

'''Statehood Day''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: Дан државности / ''Dan državnosti'') is a holiday that occurs every year on [[13 July]] in [[Montenegro]]  to commemorate the day in 1878 on which the [[Berlin Congress]] recognized Montenegro as the twenty-seventh independent state in the world.

Statehood Day is not to be confused with Montenegro's [[Independence Day]], which is held each year on 21 May in honor of the 2006 [[plebiscite]] that indicated that 55.5% of Montenegrins were in favor of becoming a [[sovereign nation]].

== History ==

The Total Economy Database was developed at the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) in the [[University of Groningen]] in the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Starting in the late 1990s, it began to be produced jointly by GGDC and [[The Conference Board]], a nonprofit founded in 1916 that works on the relationship between business and labor in 60 countries. In 2007, the database was transferred over to The Conference Board, and remains with The Conference Board as of 2017.&lt;ref name=tcb-about/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcb-about-ggdc&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ggdc.net/databases/ted.htm.|title = Total Economy Database|publisher = Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the [[University of Groningen]]|accessdate = October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data and refresh frequency ==

The database used to be refreshed annually, in January to include data till the most recent completed year.&lt;ref name=tcb-archive&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/index.cfm?id=30565|title = Total Economy Database™ - Archive|accessdate = October 21, 2017|publisher = The Conference Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcb-archive-historical/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcb-about-ggdc/&gt; However, starting 2015, the database has been updated twice a year, once in May and once later in the year (September or November).&lt;ref name=tcb-archive/&gt; The database usually includes:

* Output, labor, and productivity from 1950 to the present or most recently completed year
* Regional aggregates from 1990 to the most recently completed year
* Growth accounting and total factor productivity from 1990 or 1995 to the most recently completed year

== Reception ==

Economist and ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]] has called the Total Economy Database "the easy source for 1950 onwards" for obtaining GDP data&lt;ref name=krugman-debt-and-growth-data/&gt; and has cited it in blog posts and articles about economic performance, employment, and number of work hours versus leisure hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/japanese-relative-performance/|title = Japanese Relative Performance|date = January 9, 2013|accessdate = October 21, 2017|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/the-wal-mart-decade/|title = The Wal-Mart Decade|date = January 28, 2011|accessdate = October 21, 2017|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/what-we-have-less-of/|title = What We Have Less Of|date = January 26, 2013|accessdate = October 21, 2017|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/japanese-demography/|title = Japanese Demography|date = September 8, 2010|accessdate = October 21, 2017|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Financial Times]]'' columnist [[Martin Wolf]] called the Total Economy Database invaluable while using it to make a point about the effects of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref name=wolf/&gt;

''[[Our World In Data]]'', a website with data-driven discussion of a number of topics related to long-run economic and human development, uses the Total Economy Database as one of its sources.&lt;ref name=roser/&gt;

[[McKinsey &amp; Company]] has cited the Total Economy Database in its report on Mexico's "two-speed" development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/americas/a-tale-of-two-mexicos|title = A tale of two Mexicos: Growth and prosperity in a two-speed economy|last = Bolio|first = Eduardo|last2 = Remes|first2 = Jaana|last3 = Lajous|first3 = Tomás|last4 = Manyika|first4 = James|last5 = Ramirez|first5 = Eugenia|last6 = Rossé|first6 = Morten|publisher = [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Total Economy Database is included in a [[University of California, Berkeley]] library guide as a source of macroeconomic data.&lt;ref name=berkeley-lib-guide&gt;{{cite web|url = http://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=4395&amp;p=15528|title = Economics: Data|publisher = University of California, Berkeley Library|accessdate = October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
