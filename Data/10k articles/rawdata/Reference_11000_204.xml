The club was modelled on the [[Roxburghe Club]], of which Scott himself had been a member, as well as the [[Bannatyne Club]], which was founded by Scott, and the [[Glasgow]]-centred [[Maitland Club]]. The founder and first secretary of the club was [[William Barclay Turnbull]], a young Edinburgh lawyer. The stated objective of the Abbotsford Club was "the printing of Miscellaneous Pieces, illustrative of History, Literature, and Antiquities".&lt;ref name=Matthews/&gt; Through its publishing activity, the club did much to promote the proliferation of [[Middle English]] literature. The Abbotsford Club effectively ceased publication in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/abbotsfordclub.pdf |publisher=Royal Historical Society |title=Abbotsford Club publications (listing) |accessdate=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The club was housed at 25 Great King Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory'' 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete publications of the Abbotsford Club are available online from the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/84240851|title=Abbotsford Club, Publications by Scottish clubs|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">The '''Anne and Bernard Spitzer Hall of Human Origins''' is an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]. It focuses on [[human evolution]], [[Paleontology|human paleontology]], [[archaeology]] and [[genetics]]. At the time of its opening in 1921, it was the first museum exhibit to discuss the controversial topic of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/107236a0|last=Osborn|first=Henry Fairfield|authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn|title=The Hall of the Age of Man in the American Museum|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=107|pages=236–240|date=1921-04-21|issue=2686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its many highlights include the [[Cave paintings|Dordogne cave paintings]] and the skeleton of [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]].

==Mission==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hall of Human Origins at the American Museum of Natural History.jpeg| thumb |left|900px|]] --&gt;
As stated upon its 2007 reopening, the mission of the hall is to "combine discoveries in the fossil record with the latest genomic science to explore the most profound mysteries of humankind: who we are, where we came from, and what is in store for the future of our species. We will explore human biology and anatomy, trace the path of human evolution, and examine the origins of human creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spitzer Hall of Human Origins|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/anne-and-bernard-spitzer-hall-of-human-origins|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The hall starts with the present [[homo sapiens]] and traces its evolution backwards through time, while examining anthropology including [[music]], [[art]] and [[technology]]. As the visitor winds through the hall, significant stops are made by life sized dioramas of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', [[Neanderthal]], and [[Cro-Magnon]] in an attempt to demonstrate the behaviors and capabilities of human predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilford|first=John|title=The Hall of Human Origins Reopens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/arts/design/09orig.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York TImes|accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the dioramas are actual archeological finds that showcase the evolution of creativity and brain development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|authorlink=John Noble Wilford|title=Meet the Relatives. They're Full of Surprises|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-02-09|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/arts/design/09orig.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also displayed are full-sized casts of important fossils, including the 3.2-million-year-old [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] skeleton and the 1.7-million-year-old [[Turkana Boy]], and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' specimens including a cast of [[Peking Man]].

==In popular culture==

In the 1999 film [[Election (1999 film)|Election]], [[Matthew Broderick]]'s character compares his humiliating story to the apelike model of [[Homo ergaster]].

'''ArchiveGrid''' is a collection of over five million archival material descriptions, including [[MARC standards|MARC records]] from [[WorldCat]] and finding aids harvested from the web.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/|title=ArchiveGrid|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=OCLC Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains archival collections held by thousands of libraries, museums, historical societies, and archives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/about/|title=ArchiveGrid -- About ArchiveGrid|website=beta.worldcat.org|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contribution to the system is available to any institution.&lt;ref&gt;Making Archival and Special Collections More Accessible. 2015.

oclcresearch-making-special-collections-accessible-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the contributions are from United States based institutions, but many other countries are represented, including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ArchiveGrid is associated with [[OCLC|OCLC Research]] and helps to advance their goals of making archival collections and materials easier to find.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ArchiveGrid is described as "the ultimate destination for searching through family histories, political papers, and historical records held in archives around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=RLG Announces Archivegrid|journal=Advanced Technology Libraries|date=January 2006|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
[[Research Libraries Group]] (RLG) was founded in 1974 by three universities ([[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) and [[The New York Public Library]].  In 1998, RLG launched the RLG Archival Resources database, which offered online access to the holdings of archival collections.  RLG began to redesign the database in 2004 in order to make it more useful for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RLG Archival Resources Redesign for ArchiveGrid|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/arrredesign.html|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this redesign, RLG launched ArchiveGrid in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Item/RLG-Launches-ArchiveGrid-15263.htm|title=RLG Launches ArchiveGrid|date=2006-03-07|work=EContent Magazine|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of a grant, ArchiveGrid was freely accessible until May 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=RLG Launches ArchiveGrid|journal=Advanced Technology Libraries|date=April 2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RLG/OCLC Partnership==     
In 2006, the RLG and the [[OCLC|Online Computer Learning Center, Inc.]] (OCLC) announced the combining of the two organizations.  RLG Programs was formed on July 1, 2006 and became part of the OCLC Programs and Research division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the OCLC Research Library Partnership|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership/history.html|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ArchiveGrid was offered as an OCLC subscription-based discovery service from 2006 until it was discontinued in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ArchiveGri|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/archivegrid.html|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, RLG Programs became known as RLG Partnership.  The OCLC Research Library Partnership replaced the RLG Partnership in 2011.  The five-year period of successfully integrating the RLG Partnership into OCLC was completed 30 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the OCLC Research Library Partnership|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership/history.html|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ArchiveGrid became a free system, while remaining a part of the OCLC Research project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Content and Use ==
ArchiveGrid provides access to material descriptions, finding aids, and contact information of many archival institutions from many countries. The materials on ArchiveGrid are described as "historical documents, personal papers, family histories, and more," which users can access through a search or the map feature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the website, the content is accessible through a clickable map, where users can search in specific areas by clicking on the map or by entering a location. The collections are searchable, initially alphabetically, and can also be seen all together as a list or summary. Users can save and download item descriptions, or search through the recently added section on the homepage. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falk|first=Patricia K.|date=2017-03-20|title=ArchiveGrid|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1286855|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=218–219|doi=10.1080/07317131.2017.1286855|issn=0731-7131}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArchiveGrid considers it's main users to be researchers, specifically faculty, students, and genealogists, and improves the site based on the needs of that group; however, there is an increase in people who want to search through archival materials for hobbies, jobs (such as writers and filmmakers), and other personal interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Collections are included directly from archives, and also MARC records from WorldCat which the ArchiveGrid team identifies as archival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Archives who want to be included can submit a form so that the records can be harvested. Content is re-harvested and re-indexed about every six weeks so finding aids are updated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Use statistics are available on the ArchiveGrid website, as well as statistics regarding contributors, through [[Google Analytics]]. ArchiveGrid includes collections from:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/|title=ArchiveGrid|website=beta.worldcat.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1897">Dr. '''Arlow Burdette Stout''' (1876-1957) was an American [[botanist]] and the pioneer breeder of the modern hybrid [[daylily]].

Dr. Stout was born in [[Albion, Dane County, Wisconsin|Albion, Wisconsin]] on March 10, 1876. He worked between 1911 and 1948 at the [[New York Botanical Garden]]. In over 50,000 [[cross-pollination]] experiments, Dr. Stout produced over one hundred viable ''Hemerocallis'' hybrids, revolutionizing nursery breeding and popular interest in daylilies. Without a doubt, Dr. Stout's public renown rested largely on the knowledge and innovation he brought to the breeding of daylilies.

In 1950, [[American Hemerocallis Society]] established an annual [[Stout Award]] in his honor.

'''Art Apart Fair''' is Singapore's first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.stcommunities.sg/entertainment/show/st-review/more-art-fairs-are-being-launched |title=More art fairs are being launched |date=11 January 2014 |website=The Straits Times |last=Shetty |first=Deepika |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216095717/http://dev.stcommunities.sg/entertainment/show/st-review/more-art-fairs-are-being-launched |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hotel-based boutique art fair. Initially called Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013, the success of the fair encouraged a second edition, later renamed as Art Apart Fair as part of a series of "Apart Fairs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sea.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/920838/art-apart-hotel-fair-returns-at-parkroyal-on-pickering|title = Art Apart hotel fair returns at Parkroyal on Pickering|date = 25 June 2013|website = Blouin Art Info|publisher = Blouin Art Info Southeast Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Apart coincides with Singapore Art Week, an initiative launched by the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]], along with the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and [[Economic Development Board|Singapore Economic Development Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nac.gov.sg/art-forms/visual-arts/festivals-events/singapore-art-week-2015 |title=Singapore Art Week 2015 |website=National Arts Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033328/http://www.nac.gov.sg/art-forms/visual-arts/festivals-events/singapore-art-week-2015 |archivedate=13 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairs take place twice biannually – during January and July – in Singapore. Art Apart made its international debut in London in October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/london/about-art-apart-fair/|title = About Art Apart Fair|website = Art Apart Fair London}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Town Hall Hotel. It will be setting its stage in New York in October 2016.

Art Apart Fair serves as a platform to provide support towards emerging artists with the potential to become established. The fair gives artists the opportunity to showcase their works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/about-art-apart-fair/|title = About Art Apart Fair|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gain recognition among art lovers and collectors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ssphere.com/news/latest-blogs/entry/art-apart-fair-2013-presents-a-canvas-for-the-next-wave-of-asian-artists-to-the-rest-of-the-world.html|title = Art Apart Fair 2013 presents a canvas for the next wave of Asian artists to the rest of the world|date = 15 June 2013|website = SSphere Online|last = Tan|first = Billy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, some 33 galleries and 1,500 artists' work from countries such as Taiwan, China, Australia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Japan, Vietnam, Austria, Cambodia, South Korea, Russia, Spain and Germany, were featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/arts/art-apart-fair-go-international|title = Art Apart Fair to go international|date = 8 January 2014|website = TODAY Online|last = Aljaru|first = Mysara Bte Mohamad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the galleries that have exhibited with Art Apart are South Korea's [[Seoul Arts Centre]], Shanghai's Nancy Gallery, Madrid's Jorge &amp; Fernando Alcolea Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.herworldplus.com/lifestyle/stuff-do/art-apart-fair-2013 |title=Art Apart Fair 2013 |website=Her World Plus |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025955/http://www.herworldplus.com/lifestyle/stuff-do/art-apart-fair-2013 |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's Gallery 11.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.expatliving.sg/Things_to_do/whats_on_calendar/art-and-culture/Art-Fair-Art-Apart-Fair-2015-76210.ece|title = Art Apart Fair 2015|website = Expat Living}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to other art fairs, Art Apart focuses on selecting galleries with emerging artists with a possibility of becoming established in their national or international market.

Due to the high costs of exhibiting at art fairs and the presence of many artists struggling to succeed financially,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/london/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pressrelfinallogo.pdf|title = Art Apart Fair – Singapore returns for its fourth edition|date = 8 May 2014|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an "Adopt An Artist" initiative, where a Patron of the Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/patrons/|title = Patron of the Arts|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsors help to fund these artists. Galleries that are invited to showcase new works at Art Apart also help support the emerging artists by paying for the exhibiting fee. Works have to be new and not shown at other art fairs before.

Besides providing support for emerging artists, part of the revenue generated from the sales of art works and tickets goes towards helping the young and elderly in Singapore. One of the beneficiaries includes [[Halogen Foundation (Singapore)|Halogen Foundation]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://main.artapartfair.com/assets/uploads/files/aaf_jan_catalogue.pdf |title=Art Apart Fair 3rd Edition Catalogue |website=Art Apart Fair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216102258/http://main.artapartfair.com/assets/uploads/files/aaf_jan_catalogue.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational charity that helps to develop young leaders and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.halogen.sg/home/about-us/|title = About Us|publisher = Halogen Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another beneficiary is the Lions Befrienders Service Association,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Singapore's largest direct service voluntary welfare organisation, that assists the elderly and helps them engage with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/aboutlbsa_ourhistory.html |title=Our History |website=Lions Befrienders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216103049/http://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/aboutlbsa_ourhistory.html |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea of holding an art fair in a hotel first originated in 1994 as the [[The Armory Show (art fair)|Gramercy International Art Fair]] in the rooms of [[Gramercy Park Hotel]] in New York City. The fair was highly successful, and it is now renamed "[[The Armory Show (art fair)|The Armory Show]]".

The concept of a hotel-based art fair breaks the conventional presentation of art in a whitewashed gallery space.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sg.asia-city.com/events/news/art-apart-fair-2014-brings-art-hotel-third-time-jan-17-19|title = Art Apart Fair is set to take place at PARKROYAL hotel this month|date = 14 January 2014|website = The Insider's Guide to Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are provided with a good idea of how these works would look like in a home setting, as they are being displayed in a more informal setting, such as on beds, table tops, chairs and even bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artitute.com/2013/01/24/a-new-art-fair-worlds-apart-singapore/|title = A new art fair – Worlds Apart Singapore|date = 24 January 2013|website = Artitute|last = Anthony|first = Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by this layout, Art Apart founder and director Rosalind Lim decided to bring the idea over to Singapore. With over 38 years of experience in diverse fields, such as Public Relations, Branding, Marketing and Event Management, she built the foundation for the first successful hotel art fair – the Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/about-the-organizer/|title = About the Organizer|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Conrad Centennial Singapore]]. The fair was later renamed Art Apart Fair&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and moved to [[Parkroyal|Parkroyal on Pickering]], where the entire 14th floor – rooms, lobbies and corridors – is converted into art galleries.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/welcome/|title = Welcome|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore Editions ==

The '''''Bibliothèque de la Pléiade''''' ({{IPA-fr|bi.bli.jɔ.tɛk də la ple.jad|}}, "[[Pleiades]] Library") is a [[France|French]] [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] which was created in 1931 by [[Jacques Schiffrin]], an independent young editor. Schiffrin wanted to provide the public with reference editions of the complete works of classic authors in a pocket format. [[André Gide]] took an interest in Schiffrin's project and brought it into [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], under which it is still published.

The Pléiade has a strong emphasis on works that were originally written in [[French language|French]], though the collection also includes classics of world literature, such as bilingual editions of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], or French editions of [[Jane Austen]]'s work. To date, more than eight hundred books have been published in the series, with eleven books generally published every year. The "entry into the Pléiade" is considered a major sign of recognition for an author in France, and it is extremely rare that a living author is published in the ''Pléiade''.

In 1992, Gallimard and [[Giulio Einaudi Editore|Einaudi]] began a similar series of literature in Italian, the ''[[Biblioteca della Pléiade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat, "[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22biblioteca+della+pleiade%22&amp;fq=dt%3Abks&amp;dblist=638&amp;qt=sort&amp;se=yr&amp;sd=asc&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc Biblioteca della Pléiade]".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Library of America]]'' series, launched in 1979, is a similar project in the United States inspired by the ''Bibliothèque de la Pléiade''.

== History ==

The ''Bibliothèque de la Pléiade'' was founded by Jacques Schiffrin in 1931. The first volume published was the first tome of the complete works of [[Charles Baudelaire]], on 10 September 1931. André Gide and [[Jean Schlumberger]], creators of the ''Nouvelle Revue française'' (NRF), took interest in this, and integrated the collection into [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]] on 31 July 1936. In 1939, André Gide became the first author to be published while still living, with the partial publication of his diary. In 1940, Jacques Schiffrin was fired by [[Gaston Gallimard]] because of the anti-Jewish laws. Jean Paulhan took the direction of the collection. After moving to New York to escape Nazism, Schiffrin became a founder of [[Pantheon Books]].

Directors of the collection:
* 1931–1940 : Jacques Schiffrin
* 1960–1966 : Jean Ducourneau
* 1966–1987 : Pierre Buge
* 1988–1996 : Jacques Cotin
* After 1997 : Hugues Pradier

[[File:Top10 Pleiade.JPG|thumb|]]

=== Binding ===

All the books offer a similar high quality appearance—leather bound, with gold lettering on the spine and [[bible paper]], and they have a practical small format which makes them look like small Bibles. The use of bible paper allows the books to contain a high number of pages; it is common for a Pléiade book to contain 1500. The longest volume in the Pléiade is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Les mille et une nuits]]'' I, II et III, at 3504 pages.

The leather covers of the books are also colour-coded according to period: 20th century literature comes in tobacco leather, 19th century in emerald green, 18th century in blue, 17th century in Venetian red, 16th in Corinthian brown, the Middle Ages purple, Antiquity green, spiritual texts grey, and anthologies red. The books are sold in a transparent [[Celluloid|rhodoïd]] [[dust jacket]], and inserted in a white printed cardboard slipcase, although multiple volumes are often sold in a single slipcase.

=== Edition ===
The books are critical editions, with annotations, comments, manuscript and editorial variants and accompanying documents. The preparation of these critical editions can take many years for a team of specialists, which accounts partly for the books' generally steep cost. For works written in languages other than French, new French translations are usually created.&lt;ref&gt;One example where a new translation was not made is ''Ulysses'', by [[James Joyce]].  The Morel translation from 1929 was used.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, an ''Encyclopédie de la Pléiade'' in the same format was also created, under the direction of [[Raymond Queneau]].

== Authors published ==
At the beginning of 2017, the collection includes nearly  800 books and more than 250 authors (collective works excluded):
* ''Bibliothèque de la Pléiade'' : 787 volumes;
* ''Albums de la Pléiade'' : 56 volumes;
* ''[[Encyclopédie de la Pléiade]]'' : 54 volumes

== Albums ==
{{Main article|Album de la Pléiade}}

The ''Bibliothèque de la Pléiade'' also publishes an [[Album de la Pléiade]] every Summer, which is an illustrated book in the same format as the rest of the series, usually dedicated to one of the writers but sometimes also dedicated to writers from a specific time period (1989 album) or to an important topic (1970 and 2009 albums) from the collection. The Albums are offered for free with the purchase of three books in the series. They are often collected.

'''Bird v Bicknell''' [1987] 2 NZLR 542 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding [[fraud]] merely being a factor (albeit an important factor) in determining whether an [[exclusion clause]] is valid or not.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=243|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted  with [[M E Torbett Ltd v Keirlor Motels Ltd]] where is held that an exclusion clause is simply not valid where a party has committed fraud.

==Background==
Bird was in the business of selling franchises regarding a [[chemical process]], which they told Bicknell was secret only to them, and that a patent application was pending. These claims were later discovered to be fraudulent, and Bicknell refused to make the final payment on his franchise. Bird pointed out the contract had a clause agreeing to no warranties were given about the patent.

Bird sued Bicknell.

==Held==
The court found that the exclusion clause was not "fair and reasonable".

The '''Blaeu Atlas of Scotland''' (''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Sive Atlas Novus'', Volume V) is the first known Atlas of Scotland, compiled by [[Joan Blaeu]], containing 49 engraved maps and 154 pages of descriptive text written in [[Latin]] and first published in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.nls.uk/atlas/blaeu/ |title=Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, 1654 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher= |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1725 [[Andrew Millar]] - then still an apprentice to the Scottish bookseller James McEuen - was advertising this work as 'finely bound' to customers - clearly there was a continuing value set on the work in the 18th century by booksellers and buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725.

}}'''''Boule et Bill''''' (known in English as '''''Billy &amp; Buddy''''') is a popular [[comics|comic]], created in 1959 by the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Belgian]] [[comic book creator|writer-artist]] [[Jean Roba]] in collaboration with [[Maurice Rosy]].&lt;ref name="Lambiek-Roba"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Jean Roba|url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/roba.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the artistic responsibility of the series was passed on to Roba's former assistant Laurent Verron. The stories center on a typical family: a man and his wife, their young son Boule and Bill the [[English Cocker Spaniel|cocker spaniel]].

==History==
''Boule et Bill'' first appeared in the [[Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' on December 24, 1959.&lt;ref name="BDO1959"&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Spirou année 1959|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/annees/1959.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambition was to make a sort of European [[Peanuts]]. The debut was made in a so-called ''[[Spirou (magazine)#Rejuvenation in the 1960s and 1970s|mini-récit]]'' (mini-story), a story in 32 very small pages, printed on the inner spread of the magazine. Roba had until then mainly made illustrations for the magazine and had helped some other authors (including [[André Franquin]]), and now started with his own series. A few months later, a four-page comic with the same heroes appeared, and shortly thereafter Roba created a weekly one page comic. For the next twenty-five years, ''Boule et Bill'' was one of the most popular series of the magazine, and appeared mostly on the back cover. Some of the strips were even published in the rival ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'', which was based mainly around [[Walt Disney]] characters like [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]].
From 1961 to 1965, the strip appeared in British comic [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]], renamed ''It's A Dog's Life''. Boule's name was changed to Pete and Bill's was changed to Larry. Apart from those changes this strip was mostly the same.
21 Albums were edited by [[Dupuis]] until 1985, containing one long story and some 800 gags. Thereafter, Roba changed from editor, moving to [[Dargaud]]. In 2006, Jean Roba died, but he had announced that he wanted the series to be continued, and had appointed Verron as his successor.

==Story==
''Boule et Bill'' relates the homely adventures of seven-year-old boy Boule and his dog Bill, a [[Cocker Spaniel]], as well as that of Boule's mother and father and Caroline the [[turtle]]. Bill, while slightly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]], basically acts as a normal dog, and the whole series places comical adventures in the [[slice of life|realistic setting of a normal family in a normal town, with normal lives]]. Most of the gags happen in or around the house, but also include an almost yearly holiday setting with the family travelling away from home, usually at the beach.

===Characters===
* '''Boule''' is a young boy, always dressed  in a blue overalls and a yellow T-shirt. He is an ordinary boy who goes to school and has friends with whom he plays a lot.
* '''Bill''' is a [[Cocker Spaniel]]. He can't speak but resorts to many tricks to make himself understood. He can communicate with other animals, such as his best friend, Caroline. He is very resourceful and cunning to find food, likes sleeping on sofas but dislikes bathing. Some of the most recurring gags revolve around Boule and his dad tricking Bill into a bathtub for a reluctant wash. His long ears provide him with many abilities.
* '''Boule's mother''' stays at home and complies with domestic tasks. Her concerns are to keep the house clean and to prevent disasters from Boule and Bill's ideas.
* '''Boule's father''' tries to educate his son properly by taking advantage of his questions and blunders. However, he fails most of the time, even if he is quite proud of his personal knowledge. He works for an advertising company, likes gardening and sleeping on the sofa, which is also appreciated by Bill, which provides some recurring gags.
* '''Caroline''' is a green turtle who belongs to Boule's family. She lives in the garden. When Bill first met her, he feared she could eat his bones, but was then reassured, for she eats only lettuce. Caroline is [[insomnia]]c.
* '''Madame Stick''' is the neighbour of Boule's family. The widow of a colonel, she is very strict and severe. She is the owner of Corporal, a cat who is Bill's arch enemy.
* '''Gérard''' is a young snobbish boy and owns a dog similar to him. He tries to dwarf Boule and Bill but ends up being overcome by their inventiveness.
* '''Monsieur Coupon-Dubois''' is the boss of Boule's father. A very respectable man, Boule's father sometimes invites him to his home or is being trusted with precious objects, and finds it difficult to prevent Bill's blunders.
* '''Pouf''' is Boule's best friend, but is also a rival for Bill, who often teases him. He wears long hair which covers most of his head and a cap.
* '''Hildegarde''' is Pouf's cousin who lives in the country. She appeared a few times in the series.
* '''Boule's teacher'''

===Film adaptations===

In 2013 a Belgian-French-Luxembourgian film was released, "Boule et Bill", based on the comics. It stars Franck Dubosc as the father, Marina Foïs as the mother, and Charles Crombez as Bill. It received bad reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=134691.html|title=Boule &amp; Bill|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was commercially successful enough to warrant a sequel "Boule et Bill 2", released in 2017.

===Television adaptations===
Four animated television series based on ''Boule and Bill'' were produced:
*[[Boule et Bill (1960 TV series)]] broadcast on [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]]
*[[Boule et Bill (2000 TV series)]] broadcast on [[TF1]]
*[[Boule et Bill (2004 TV series)]] broadcast on [[Unis (TV channel)]] with 104 episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unis.ca/boule-et-bill/?e=mj5h2a7xooeph |title=Plein les yeux - Boule et Bill - Émissions - Unis TV |website=[[Unis.ca]] |quote=ÉPISODE 104 ANNÉE DE PRODUCTION : 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video game adaptations===

In the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] in [[Brussels]] the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of [[Belgian comics]], among them Jean Roba and his series ''Boule et Bill''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Boule et Bill is among the many Belgian comics characters to jokingly have a Brussels street named after them. The Rue au Beurre/ Boterstraat has a [[commemorative plaque]] with the name ''Rue Boule et Bill / Bollie en Billie straat'' placed under the actual street sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebru.be/Other/Strips/bruxelles-1000-noms-de-rue-bd.html|title=eBru - Bruxelles Capitale de la Bande Dessinėe (BD) - Noms de rue|website=www.ebru.be|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 a wall painting representing ''Boule and Bill'' was painted in the Rue du Chevreuil in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://marocomicsblog.wordpress.com/boule-et-bill/#boulebill|title=Boule et bill|date=18 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by G. Oregopoulos and D. Vandegeerde.

In 2000 &lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lesoir.be/boule-et-bill-jouent-a-saute-mouton-a-jette_t-20001002-Z0JR8C.html&lt;/ref&gt; a statue of Boule and Bill was erected in [[Jette]], [[Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdmurales.skynetblogs.be/tag/1/boule+et+bill|title=boule et bill : BD &amp; Fresques murales|website=bdmurales.skynetblogs.be|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; next to where Roba lived. It was sculpted by Tom Frantzen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectible.net/objectible/Interviews/InterviewRoba/|title=Interview de Roba|website=www.objectible.net|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the statue was subject of vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacapitale.be/1115906/article/2014-10-03/scandale-a-jette-l-oreille-de-bill-le-chien-sciee|title=Scandale à Jette: l'oreille de Bill le chien sciée!|first=|last=sudinfo.be|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 [[La Poste (France)|La Poste]], France's [[post office]] system, issued two [[postage stamp]]s illustrating Boule and Bill. Three out of eight were [[semi-postal]] stamps benefiting the [[French Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dominique.hochereau.free.fr/bd/boule%20et%20bill.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COCORIOKO''' is a [[Somerset]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]] based [[newspaper]]. It is published from different parts of the world including [[Sierra Leone]]. The websites's owner and [[editor in chief]] is [[Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs-Kanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.musicinafrica.net/directory/cocorioko||title= Bio|year=2016|work=Music In Africa|publisher= In-house Nigeria |format=[article] |accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published as an online website that covers political concerns, action news, commentary, editorial, sports and obituary of Sierra Leone, and the [[African diaspora]]. The Assistant Executive Officer is Foday Mansaray, Assistant CEOs are Mr. Pavi Jalloh and Bankole Gibson, and Assistant Editor is Jacob Sax-Conteh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://cocorioko.net/about-cocorioko/|title= About Cocorioko|year=2016|work= Cocorioko Newspaper|publisher=Cocorioko|format=[article] |accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==COCORIOKO Newspaper (1973 - 1976)==
[[University of Sierra Leone]] alumni students including [[His Excellency|HE]] [[Dr.]] [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] had confirmed that COCORIOKO Newspaper was first published in 1973 when the editor in chief [[Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs-Kanu]] was a student at the University.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/kabs-kanu-is-director-of-communications|title = Kabs-Kanu is Director of Communications|date = December 11, 2007|accessdate = November 9, 2018|website =thepatrioticvanguard.com|publisher = LeoneNews|last = Vanguard|first = Patriot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sierra Leonean newspaper publishers had also said that the first COCORIOKO newspaper started with a revolutionary student's union government led by the late Boubacar Njai-Bahled, an influential student on campus. Others have affirmed that Rev. Leeroy Kabs Kanu was the Minister of [[Propaganda]] in that student's government. To them, COCORIOKO Newspaper was the voice of that student's union when they were concerned with what they described as a "battle of wits and supremacy with the college administration and political powers in the country."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://cocorioko.net/about-cocorioko/|title= About Cocorioko|year=2011|work= Cocorioko Newspaper|publisher=Cocorioko|format=[article] |accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the 1973 to 1977 alumni had stated that COCORIOKO's [[Editor-In-Chief]] was Ben Ikeakor, a [[Nigerian]] student. They have said that the newspaper's editorial board members were Florence Iscandri, Millicent Macauley, Mohamed Lamin, Anthony Brewah, Princetta Godwin, Joan Mundoma, and Jaiah Kallon, who were student activists.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The paper was said to cover the [[entertainment news]] on campus as well as the student's goals and aspirations. They claim that the student government aimed to effect change in the welfare of students on the campus.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many believe that this [[student government]] "set the stage for the student revolution in 1977 headed by [[Hindolo Trye]] and that the massive students' action against the lethargic political powers forced the government to make wholesale reforms in governance which led to a snap General Elections that brought intellectuals into the national government for the first time.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; In an "About COCORIOKO" article Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs Kanu stated that the paper folded up in 1976 when the main publishers graduated from college. They attest that the newspaper was very influential on the [[college campus]], attracting the attention of senior [[government officials]] and the [[media of Sierra Leone]]. However, upon graduating, they discontinued the paper.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://cocorioko.net/about-cocorioko/ |title = About Cocorioko|date = April 22, 2008|accessdate = November 8, 2018|website =Cocorioko.net|publisher = Cocorioko|last = Newspaper|first = Cocorioko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==COCORIOKO Newspaper from the Year 2002 - 2007==
Years later, Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs Kanu was featured [[editor]] of "The West African Journal"" between 1995 and 1998 and "Expo Times" between 2000 and 2003.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://allafrica.com/stories/200103290037.html|title=Sierra Leone: Journalist Persecuted For His Views|year=2001|work= All Africar|publisher=Mariama Massaquoi|format=[article] |accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revived his newspaper from college, COCORIOKO in 2002.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rscsl.org/Clippings/2008/2008-12/pc2008-12-15.pdf|title = Special court for sierra leone outreach and public affairs office|date = December 15, 2008|accessdate = November 8, 2018|website =rscsl.org|publisher = rscsal|last = pdf|first = rscsal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[AllAfrica.com]], Kabs Kanu resumed publishing his newspaper at "Leonenet - UMBC", which was the first Sierra Leone discussion forum set up at the advent of the internet, by Claude Meama- Kajue.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; At the time the newspaper was called "Daily News Inquirer." The Reverend later changed the paper's name to "COCORIOKO," the name of his first newspaper the he published as a student at the University of Sierra Leone. In 2015 he stated that the “present mission of the newspaper is the rebranding of Sierra Leone.”&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

==COCORIOKO Newspaper 2007 - 2018==
Some Sierra Leoneans believe that the diligent reporting on Cocorioko newspaper greatly contributed to the [[regime change]] that took place during Sierra Leone’s 2007 [[General Elections]]. Others gather that an overwhelming number of the Sierra Leone people voted for [[Dr.]] [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] and his [[All People’s Congress]] Party (A. P. C.) during the democratic [[Presidential]] and [[Legislative]] [[Elections]] since the citizens believed Cocorioko newspaper's widely broadcast reports that the [[Sierra Leone People’s Party]] (S. L. P. P.) government of the late [[President]] HE [[Dr.]] [[Ahmed Tejan Kabbah]] was inefficient and corrupt.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

==History==
The CCI originated within the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in 1957, as its Conservation and Scientific Research Division under the leadership of Dr. Nathan Stolow.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; In 1964, the division was granted greater autonomy and became the National Conservation Research Laboratory ("NCRL").&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in [[Doors Open Ottawa]], held June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vergelijk.nl (Compare Group)''' is a privately held company which holds four [[price comparison services]] in three countries and was founded in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] in 1999.

== History ==

Vergelijk.nl was founded in 1999 by Ben Kerkhof, Jean Paul Soethout and Tjibbe de Jong and was the first [[price comparison services|price comparison website]] in the [[Netherlands]]. In 2000, Vergelijk.nl co-founder [[Ben Kerkhof]] started Vertaa.fi, a price comparison website based in [[Finland]]. Business was expanded to [[Belgium]] in 2002 with the start of Vergelijk.be and in 2006 Vergelijk.nl acquired Dutch competitor Elcheapo.nl.

Early 2015 Vergelijk.nl launched their omni-channel localised price comparison service in which not just products and offers from webshops are compared but also those of the traditional brick and mortar merchants.

'''Compare Group''' was founded shortly after the acquisition of Elcheapo.nl in 2006, in order to centralize the management of the different labels. Since the founding of the Compare Group, business was expanded further to [[France]] and French-speaking Belgium with the foundation of Comparer.fr and Comparer.be in 2009.

Although Compare Group provides some insights in monthly visitor amounts, it does not publish exact visitor numbers. It is known that in 2004 Vergelijk.nl welcomed its 20&amp;nbsp;millionth visitor since its founding in 1999 and passed the 40&amp;nbsp;million visitors mark in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/40_miljoen_bezoekers_voor_vergelijknl 40 miljoen bezoekers voor Vergelijk.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

Vergelijk.nl’s [[business model]] consists of three main revenue drivers:

*Lead generation for web shops using a [[Pay per click|cost per click]] model.
*A monthly subscription fee for the traditional brick &amp; mortar merchants.
*A [[Pay Per Sale|cost per sale]] model which provides Vergelijk.nl a percentage of the order value for every order placed on Vergelijk.nl's websites. Although Vergelijk.nl receives the orders, the actual processing of orders is done by web shops. Web shops receive the order value subtracted by Vergelijk.nl’s compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twinklemagazine.nl/nieuws/2011/08/vergelijk.nl-met-shopping-beslist.nl-te-snel-af/ Vergelijk.nl met shopping Beslist.nl te snel af]. This model has been discontinued as of July 2014. [http://twinklemagazine.nl/nieuws/2014/08/vergelijk.nl-verder-zonder-winkelmandje/index.xml]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2014 Vergelijk.nl decided to terminate their marketplace /[[cost per sale model]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws/vergelijknl-geen-webwinkel-meer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws/nieuwe-strategie-nieuwe-site-vergelijknl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://twinklemagazine.nl/nieuws/2014/08/vergelijk.nl-verder-zonder-winkelmandje/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conflict Lens''' is an on-line [[conflict management]] tool which identifies an individual’s behavior in conflict situations and assesses  the outcome.

==Development==
[[Conflict Style Inventory|Conflict style inventories]] are most often used in leadership and management training courses or in executive coaching sessions.
Conflict style inventories, which first appeared in the 1960s, were most often based on the work of [[Robert R. Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] using their [[Managerial Grid Model]]. Blake and Mouton used two axes. “Concern for people” is plotted on the Y axis and “Concern for task” is plotted on axis X. Using this group they developed five differing styles of approaching conflict resolution often referenced as: win-win, win-lose, compromise, avoid, and comply. In 1974, Kenneth W. Thomas and Ralph H. Kilman adopted this model and created the [[Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument]]. This is the best known of the conflict style inventories. Another often used instrument is the [[Conflict Dynamics Profile]] offered by Eckerd College in Florida. This is primarily designed to be offered as a 360 degree instrument.

In 2001 Glenn Hallam, Ph.D., Paul Seymour Ph.D. and Gina Hallam, M.A. published the Conflict Lens, an on-line instrument based on the premise that conflict management is a skill that can be learned if people know which behaviors lead to constructive outcomes and which behaviors lead to destructive outcomes. The Conflict Lens is founded on the belief that the concept of style is limited in that it does not inform a person what behaviors would be most valuable in successfully resolving conflict and that conflict resolution is based more on situational context  than on dominant style (Callanan, Benzing, and Perri, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callanan|first=G.|author2=Benzing, C. |author3=Perri, D. |title=Choices of Conflict-Handling Strategy: A matter of context|journal=Journal of Psychology|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviors were identified through empirical research and indicate how to approach the relational aspects of conflict resolution and the actual issue itself. The instrument is based on a taxonomy of behaviors considering research by Johnson and Johnson (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D. |author2=Johnson, R. |author3=Tjosvold, D.|title=Constructive controversy: the value of intellectual opposition.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=K.|title=Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology|year=1975|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Conflict and Conflict Management|isbn=0891060413|url=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=handbook+of+industrial+and+organizational+psychology+dunnette&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;resnum=5&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;ix=sea&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=952&amp;bih=991&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=1838065442150832648&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HttgT6-oM6ne2QXc9Kn6Bw&amp;ved=0CFMQ8wIwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Deutch (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|title=The resolution of conflict: constructive and destructive processes|journal=Yale University Press|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Conflict Lens asks a person to identify two actual conflicts they were involved in, and then asks them to answer 53 items about what they did, felt, or thought during the conflict and 13 items about the outcomes of each conflict. A 12-page computer generated report shows scores on how the person behaved on 10 dichotomous behavioral dimensions and whether the person saw the outcome as destructive or constructive. The scales are: Affiliate vs. Alienate; Analyze vs. Intuit; Compromise vs. Stand Firm; Control vs. Comply; Empathize vs. Egoize; Engage vs. Avoid; Own vs. Blame; Seek Support vs. Go Solo; Self-Restrain vs. Emote; and Trust vs. Distrust. The report contrasts the two conflicts so that the person can see how they behaved similarly or differently depending on the circumstances. The report also gives participants specific suggestions on what they did particularly well and how they might be more effective in the future.  A Group Report for use in team building is also available. Trainers who use the instrument must be certified to order and interpret the instrument. The Conflict Lens is published and distributed by [[Work Effects Inc.]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

===Strengths===
The Conflict Lens focuses on specific behaviors instead of delineating style.  The instrument asks the person to identify specific conflicts they were involved in vs. the usual method of asking people how they generally behaved. Sandy et al. (2000) write, “(T)here is reason to believe that conflict behavior is determined by both situational and dispositional influences.” Research by Rahim (1986) indicates that a manager in conflict with a supervisor typically yields, while with peers the manager compromises and with subordinates the manager problem solves. The instrument allows respondents to analyze how they responded in different situations. The ten behavioral dimensions are researched based best practices which allow a person to create a behavioral roadmap to use in the future and instructs people on both what to do and what not to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Paul|author2=Hallam, G. |author3=Hallam, G |title=Conflict Lens Participant's Guide|journal=Available from Publisher|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliability and Validity data is available in a technical report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallan|first=G. |author2=Hallam, G. |author3=Seymour, P.|title=Conflict Lens Development and Technical Specifications|journal=Available from Publisher|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average Cronbach’s alpha is .71. It is available in 19 languages and has been used worldwide. Support materials for interpretation and training are available in each language.

===Weaknesses===
The Conflict Lens was normed on a US population and cross cultural analysis is not yet available. Some respondents who tend to avoid conflict sometimes find it difficult to identify two conflicts they were personally involved in. The Conflict Lens is based on self-reports and how a person perceives themselves to have behaved which may differ from how others perceived the behavior. Also, the instrument measures how a person believes they behaved but does not assess how well they actually executed the behavior.

The '''Democracy Ranking''' is an index compiled by the Association for Development and Advancement of the Democracy Award, an [[Austria]]-based non-partisan organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/?page_id=8 See "about us" of the Democracy Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/?page_id=29 See contact details of the Democracy Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy Ranking produces an annual global [[ranking]] of democracies. The applied conceptual [[formula]], which measures the quality of democracy, integrates [[Political freedom|freedom]] and other characteristics of the [[political system]] with the performance of non-political dimensions ([[gender]], [[economy]], [[knowledge]], [[health]], and [[social environment|environment]]). Democracy Ranking has emphasized a broader understanding of democracy, creating a conceptual link between [[politics]] and the output and performance of [[society]]. The Democracy Ranking has compared several-year intervals, delivering ranking results, which show how ranking positions and score levels have developed recently. Referring to that information, a Democracy Improvement Ranking has been regularly released.

==Vision==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Democracy Ranking is interested in contributing to the global enhancement of the Quality of Democracy in a world-wide understanding and approach."&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/?page_id=497 Vision and mission of the Democracy Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Theory, conceptual formula and methodology==
The Democracy Ranking initiative applies the following conceptual formula for defining democracy and measuring the quality of democracy:

:: Quality of Democracy = (freedom &amp; other characteristics of the political system) &amp; (performance of the non-political dimensions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/ranking/basic_concept.pdf Campbell, David F. J. (2008). The Basic Concept for the Democracy Ranking of the Quality of Democracy. Vienna: Democracy Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach includes also the output of democracies. Democracy Ranking refers to [[List of sovereign states|countries]] (country-based democracies) with a [[population]] of one million or more and that are classified by [[Freedom House]] as "free" or at least as "partly free" (see also [[Freedom in the World (report)|the Freedom House report]]). The Democracy Ranking makes explicit the "theoretical basis", which governs the theoretical self-understanding of the Democracy Ranking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/?page_id=590 See "theoretical basis" of the Democracy Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democracy Ranking understands and measures democracies in a multi-dimensional framework and approach. By this, the Democracy Ranking contributes to a further development of measurement of democracy. According to the ranking, democracy consists of six dimensions (one political, five non-political), with different weights for the overall quality of democracy. Their weights are distributed accordingly:

:# politics (or the [[political system]]) 50%; 
:# gender ([[gender equality]] in socioeconomic and educational terms) 10%; 
:# economy (or the [[economic system]]) 10%; 
:# knowledge ([[knowledge society]], research and education) 10%; 
:# health (or the [[health system]] and health status) 10%; 
:# and environment ([[environmental sustainability]]) 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracyranking.org/downloads/feasibility_study-a4-e-01.pdf Campbell, David F. J. / Miklós Sükösd (eds.) (2002). Feasibility Study for a Quality Ranking of Democracies. Vienna: Global Democracy Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical basis of the Democracy Ranking encourages a broader approach for explaining and measuring democracy while covering and integrating non-political dimensions. This is enabled by an understanding that democracy represents not only a concept of the political system, but also a concept that extends to society and the context of society, and includes interfaces between politics, society, economy, and even the environment.. Politics (policy) has or should have a responsibility for economic (socioeconomic) performance. Furthermore, there is also a need that democracy reflects the context of the (natural) environment.

Concepts of democracy turn out to be more demanding, the more they move from a mainly [[electoral democracy]] (emphasizing [[election]]s and [[political rights]]) to a [[liberal democracy]] (also encompassing [[civil liberties]]), and further extending to a liberal democracy of an advanced high quality. In that logic, the Democracy Ranking reflects and requires a "demanding type" of democracy.

Methodically, the Democracy Ranking does not create new indicators, but relies on already existing indicators that are being released regularly by renowned international and/or private [[non-profit organization]]s. The Democracy Ranking draws on available indicators according to a distinct conceptual formula and six-fold dimensional structure, thus providing a theoretically based conceptual design (a basic concept) of how to combine and aggregate these indicators. Depending on the source, the content of the indicators varies, extending from peer review assessment (for example, on freedom) to indicators that capture performance (e.g., socioeconomic behavior). The Democracy Ranking initiative acknowledges the work of organizations such as [[Freedom House]], the [[World Bank]], and also the [[United Nations Development Program]] (more specifically the [[Human Development Index]]).

==Outcome: Democracy Ranking and Democracy Improvement Ranking scores==
The Democracy Ranking analyzes several-year intervals, revealing relative ranking positions as well as changes of score levels over time. Typically, more than hundred countries are being compared in context of a specific Democracy Ranking. Based on ranking results and their shifts, a Democracy Improvement Ranking is being carried out, with a full result release. The Democracy Improvement Ranking places the emphasis on increases or decreases of the ranking scores of democracies. Individual annual rankings of the Democracy Ranking are also published in separate book volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Ranking-Edition-2012-Quality/dp/3848217988/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398164577&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=Campbell%2C+David+F+J Campbell, David F.

'''Domain drop catching''', also known as '''domain sniping''', is the practice of registering a [[domain name]] once registration has lapsed, immediately after expiry.

==Background==
When a domain is first registered, the customer is usually given the option of registering the domain for one year or longer, with automatic renewal as a possible option.&lt;ref name="ICANNbegin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beginner’s Guide to Domain Names|url=http://www.icann.org/en/about/learning/beginners-guides/domain-names-beginners-guide-06dec10-en|date=6 December 2010|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some [[domain registrars]] often make multiple attempts to notify a registrant of a domain name's impending expiration, a failure on the part of the original registrant to provide the registrar with accurate contact information makes an unintended registration lapse possible. Practices also vary, and registrars are not required to notify customers of impending expiration.&lt;ref name="ICANNbegin" /&gt; Unless the original registrant holds a [[trademark]] or other legal entitlement to the name, they are often left without any form of recourse in getting their domain name back. It is incumbent on registrants to be proactive in managing their name registrations and to be good stewards of their domain names. By law there are no perpetual rights to domain names after payment of registration fees lapses, aside from trademark rights granted by [[common law]] or [[statute]].

===Redemption Grace Period (RGP)===
The Redemption Grace Period is an addition to [[ICANN]]'s Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) which allows a registrant to reclaim their domain name for a number of days after it expires.&lt;ref name="kiwihost"&gt;[http://domains.kiwihosting.net.nz/kb/servlet/KBServlet/faq460.html "Restoring a Deleted Domain Name from the Redemption Grace Period"]&lt;/ref&gt; This length of time varies by domain, and is usually around 30 to 90 days.&lt;ref name="kiwihost" /&gt; Prior to the RGP, individuals could easily engage in domain sniping to extort money from the original registrant to buy their domain name back.

Once time is up, the domain status changes to a "redemption period" when an owner may be required to pay a fee (usually around $70 - $250 (enom)) to re-activate and re-register the domain.&lt;ref name="Mike"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Snatch an Expiring Domain|url=http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain|date=6 March 2005|author=Mike Industries|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ICANN's RAA &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 3. Registrar Obligations|url=http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/raa/raa-17may01-en.htm#3|work=Registrar Accreditation Agreement|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires registrars to delete domain registrations once a second notice has been given and the RGP has elapsed. At the end of the deletion phase of 5 days, the domain will be dropped from the ICANN database.&lt;ref name="Mike" /&gt;

===Drop Catch Services===

For particularly popular domain names, there are often multiple parties anticipating the expiration. Competition for expiring domain names has since become a purview of drop catching services. These services offer to dedicate their servers to securing a domain name upon its availability, usually at an auction price.&lt;ref name="Mike" /&gt; Individuals with their limited resources find it difficult to compete with these drop catching firms for highly desirable domain names.&lt;ref name="Mike" /&gt;
 
Retail registrars such as [[GoDaddy]] or [[eNom]] retain names for auction through services such as TDNAM or Snapnames through a practice known as [[domain warehousing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoDaddy Uses Standard Tactics To Warehouse Domains|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/03/godaddy-uses-standard-tactics-to-warehouse-domains/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=16 October 2012|author=Robin Wauters|date=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drop catch services are performed by both [[accredited registrars|ICANN-accredited registrars]] and non-accredited registrars.

===Domain Futures / Options or Back-Orders===
Some registry operators (for example dot-РФ, dot-PL, dot-RU, dot-ST, dot-TM, dot-NO) offer a service by which a back-order (also sometimes known as a "domain future" or "domain option") can be placed on a domain name. 

If a domain name is due to return to the open market, then the owner of the back-order will be given the first opportunity to acquire the domain name before the name is deleted and is open to a free-for-all. In this way back-orders will usually take precedence over drop-catch.

There may be a fee for the back-order itself, often only one back-order can be placed per domain name and a further purchase or renewal fee may be applicable if the back-order succeeds.

Back-Orders typically expire in the same way domain names do, so are purchased for a specific number of years.

Different operators have different rules. In some cases back-orders can only be placed at certain times, for example after the domain name has expired, but before it has returned to the open market (see [[Redemption Grace Period]]).

In the [[Commodity market]] sense, a back-order is often more like an "option" than a "future" as there is often no obligation for the new registrant to take the name, even after it has been handed to the owner of the back-order. For example, some registries give the new registrant 30 days to purchase a renewal on the name before it is once again returned to the open market (or any new back-order registrant).

{{lowercase|title=eMedicine}}

'''eMedicine.com, Incorporated''' is an online clinical medical knowledge base founded in 1996 by two medical doctors, Scott Plantz and Jonathan Adler, and by Jeffrey Berezin, a computer engineer.  The fundamental concept was to create a large repository of professional level medical content that could be both updated and accessed continuously to assist in clinical care and physician education.  The eMedicine website consists of approximately 6,800 medical topic review articles, each of which is associated with one of 62 clinical subspecialty "textbooks".  Pediatrics, for example, has 1,050 articles organized into 14 subspecialty "textbooks" (Pediatric endocrinology, genetics, cardiology, pulmonology, etc.); the emergency medicine volume has 630 articles and internal medicine is near 1,400.  The knowledge base includes about 25,000 clinically relevant images.  Each article is authored by board certified specialists in the subspecialty to which the article belongs and undergoes three levels of physician peer-review, plus review by a Doctor of Pharmacy. The article's authors are identified with their current faculty appointments.  Each article is updated yearly, or more frequently as changes in practice occur, and the date is published on the article.&lt;ref name="pmid10786388"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyers|first1=AD|title=eMedicine Otolaryngology: an online textbook for ENT specialists.|journal=Ear, nose, &amp; throat journal|date=Apr 2000|volume=79|issue=4|pages=268–71|pmid=10786388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  eMedicine.com was sold to [http://www.webmd.com/ WebMD] in January, 2006 and is available as the [[Medscape]] Reference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/webmd-acquires-emedicinecom-for-255m|title=WebMD acquires eMedicine.com for $25.5M|last=Hunt|first=Katherine|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Dr. Plantz, Dr. Adler and Mr. Berezin evolved the concept for eMedicine.com in 1996 and deployed the initial site via Boston Medical Publishing, Inc., a corporation in which Plantz and Adler were principals.  Over a period of 1.5 years the Group Publishing System was developed that allowed large numbers of contributors to collaborate simultaneously.  That system was first used to create a knowledge base in Emergency Medicine with 600 contributing MDs creating over 630 chapters in just over a year.  In 1997 eMedicine.com, Inc. was legally spun off from Boston Medical Publishing. Several key individuals made investments in the company, including Richard Lavely, MD, JD who led recruitment and execution for the Internal Medicine volume, Julie Bohlen who ran editorial operations for many years and became a board member, and others.  In that year the decision was made to broaden the scope of eMedicine to effectively all specialties.

Several years were then spent creating the tables of contents, recruiting expert physicians and in the creation of the additional 6,170 medical articles.  Operation were based out of a main office in Omaha, NE and the company was operated "virtually" with key staff in multiple sections of the US.  

eMedicine.com became widely trafficked.  In 2005, eMedicine entered into discussions for acquisition.  The board of directors at the time of sale, consisting of Jonathan Adler, Jeffrey Berezin, Craig Burson, Lilian Shackelford Murray and Michael P. Tierney, unanimously recommended approval for sale of the company to WebMD.  The sale was completed in January 2006 and the content is available via WebMD's Medscape site.

Content now includes [[allergy]] and [[immunology]], [[cardiology]], [[clinical procedures]], [[intensive-care medicine|critical care]], [[dermatology]], [[emergency medicine]], [[endocrinology]], [[gastroenterology]]. [[genomic medicine]], [[hematology]], [[infectious diseases]], [[nephrology]], [[neurology]], [[OB-GYN|obstetrics/gynecology]], [[oncology]], [[pathology]], [[perioperative care]], physical medicine and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]], [[psychiatry]], [[pulmonology]], [[radiology]], [[rheumatology]], and [[sports medicine]]. Surgical subspecialties include [[neurosurgery]], [[ophthalmology]], [[orthopedic surgery]], [[otolaryngology|(ENT)]] and facial [[plastic surgery]], [[plastic surgery]], [[thoracic surgery]], [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]], [[physical trauma|Trauma]], [[urology]], and [[vascular surgery]].&lt;ref name="pmid10786388" /&gt;   

The site is free to use, requiring only registration.  More than 10,000 physician contributors from several countries participated in the creation of the articles. Novel at the time, eMedicine content could also be accessed as an [[E-reader|e-book]], and could be downloaded into a [[Palm (PDA)|palm top device]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=0hbyMlOSHccC&amp;pg=PA80 80–82] | last = Platt | first = AF | year = 2008 | title = Evidence-Based Medicine for PDAs: A Guide for Practice | isbn = 0-7637-5476-5 | publisher = [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage among specialists==

In 2012 Volsky et al.&lt;ref name="pmid22770592"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volsky|first1=PG|last2=Baldassari|first2=CM|last3=Mushti|first3=S|last4=Derkay|first4=CS|title=Quality of Internet information in pediatric otolaryngology: a comparison of three most referenced websites.|journal=International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology|date=Sep 2012|volume=76|issue=9|pages=1312–6|pmid=22770592|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2012.05.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated the most frequently used internet information sources by the public, (1) identifying the three most frequently referenced Internet sources; (2) comparing the content accuracy of each of the three sources and (3) ascertaining user-friendliness of each site; and (4) informing practitioners and patients of the quality of available information. They found Wikipedia, eMedicine, and NLM/NIH [[MedlinePlus]] were the most referenced sources. For content accuracy, eMedicine scored highest (84%; p&lt;0.05) over MedlinePlus (49%) and Wikipedia (46%). The highest incidence of errors and omissions per article was found in Wikipedia (0.98±0.19), twice more than eMedicine (0.42±0.19; p&lt;0.05). Errors were similar between MedlinePlus and both eMedicine and Wikipedia. On ratings for user interface, which incorporated Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Level and Flesch Reading Ease, MedlinePlus was the most user-friendly (4.3±0.29). This was nearly twice that of eMedicine (2.4±0.26) and slightly greater than Wikipedia (3.7±0.3). All differences were significant (p&lt;0.05). There were 7 topics for which articles were not available on MedlinePlus. They concluded "Knowledge of the quality of available information on the Internet improves pediatric otolaryngologists' ability to counsel parents. The top web search results for pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses are Wikipedia, MedlinePlus, and eMedicine. Online information varies in quality, with a 46-84% concordance with current textbooks. eMedicine has the most accurate, comprehensive content and fewest errors, but is more challenging to read and navigate. Both Wikipedia and MedlinePlus have lower content accuracy and more errors, however MedlinePlus is simplest of all to read, at a 9th Grade level.

In 2012, Laraway and Rogers reported a structured review of journal articles that quoted The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale for head and neck cancer patients.

"The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale (UW-QoL) is one of the most frequently reported health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) questionnaires in head and neck cancer, and since its first publication in 1993 has been used in many different cohorts. There is a considerable amount of information to assimilate and, to date, we know of no attempt that has been made to summarise publications specific to its use in a peer review journal. The aim of this review was to systematically search published papers that report its use, identify common themes, and present a tabulated summary. Several search engines were used (PubMed, Medline, Medical-Journals.com, eMedicine), and 222 abstracts were found and hand searched. A total of 66 papers were eligible for inclusion, 21 on functional outcome, 25 on predictors of HR-QoL, 19 on development or validation of the questionnaire, and one clinical trial. The review includes a diversity of studies and a range of HR-QoL outcomes following head and neck cancer. It provides clinicians and their colleagues in multidisciplinary teams with a source of quick reference to relevant papers reporting the UW-QoL, and gives a short summary of the pertinent conclusions drawn from each paper."

What is significant for eMedicine, is that Laraway and Rogers used PubMed, Medline Medical Journals.com and eMedicine as primary sources of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bjoms.2010.12.005 |title=A structured review of journal articles reporting outcomes using the University of Washington Quality of Life Scale |year=2012 |last1=Laraway |first1=D.C. |last2=Rogers |first2=S.N. |journal=British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=122–31 |pmid=21239091}}{{psc|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant because medline is the compendium of all NIH sponsored research.  Emedicine is made up of articles translating the body of current research in medline into clinical practice guidelines from the perspective of each subspeciality.&lt;ref name="pmid10786388" /&gt;
 
Cao, Liu, Simpson, ''et al'' revealed that medline and emedicine were used as primary resources in developing the online system AskHERMES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.004 |title=AskHERMES: An online question answering system for complex clinical questions |year=2011 |last1=Cao |first1=Yonggang |last2=Liu |first2=Feifan |last3=Simpson |first3=Pippa |last4=Antieau |first4=Lamont |last5=Bennett |first5=Andrew |last6=Cimino |first6=James J. |last7=Ely |first7=John |last8=Yu |first8=Hong |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=277–88 |pmid=21256977 |pmc=3433744}}{{psc|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians were asked to solve complex clinical problems using three different sources of information: AskHermes, Google and UpToDate.  Surveys of the physicians who used all three systems were asked to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A 2009 study showed that "89.1% of ophthalmologist respondents accessed peer-reviewed material online, including Emedicine (60.2%)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19491979 |year=2009 |last1=Somal |first1=K |last2=Lam |first2=WC |last3=Tam |first3=E |title=Computer and internet use by ophthalmologists and trainees in an academic centre |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=265–8 |doi=10.3129/i09-057 |journal=Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

A 2007 study showed that 12% of [[radiology]] [[Residency (medicine)|residents]] used eMedicine as their first source when doing research on the Internet.&lt;ref name="pmid17707320"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.acra.2007.06.002 |title=Learning Radiology |year=2007 |last1=Kitchin |first1=Douglas R. |last2=Applegate |first2=Kimberly E. |journal=Academic Radiology |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=1113–20 |pmid=17707320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study ranking 114 sites rated it the second-highest Internet-based source of information for pediatric neuro-oncology, after the site of the [[National Cancer Institute]].&lt;ref name="pmid16533758"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1215/15228517-2005-008 |title=Quality of health information on the Internet in pediatric neuro-oncology |year=2006 |last1=Hargrave |first1=D.

A 2002 study described the site's coverage of [[dermatology]] as "excellent and comprehensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=bovHd9jaNtEC&amp;pg=PA289 289–91] | first = HI | last = Maibach |author2=Bashir SJ |author3=McKibbon A | title = Evidence-based dermatology | isbn = 1-55009-172-7 | publisher = PMPH-USA | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 an article in the Journal of Ear Nose and Throat by AD Meyers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, announced the unveiling of the ENT textbook online at emedicine.com.&lt;ref name="pmid10786388" /&gt;

Supp. 821 (E.D.N.Y. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; was an important [[Case law|case]] before the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] that concerned [[copyright infringement]], which held that secondary persons or entities could be liable for that [[tort]] under certain circumstances, and is also called the "'make-a-tape' case".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;Jane Ginsburg, "Secondary Liability for Copyright Infringement in the U.S.: Anticipating the Aprés-Grokster", found at [http://www.law.columbia.edu/law_school/communications/reports/winter06/facforum1 Secondary Liability for Copyright Infringement in the US, from Columbia Law School website].  Retrieved December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The facts were that:

Federal courts have held that secondary tort [[legal liability|liability]] exists when:

The '''''Epic Level Handbook''''' is a rule-book by [[Wizards of the Coast]] for the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition]] of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. The book was published in 2001, and contains optional game rules for playing [[player characters|characters]] who have reached a higher [[Level (role-playing games)#Level-based progression|experience level]] than is covered in the standard rules. This is referred to in the book as "[[epic level]]" play.

== Contents ==

The ''Epic Level Handbook'' contains rules for [[player characters|characters]] to attain levels above 20, the highest level covered by the rules in the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' and ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', the core rule-books for the game. It provides [[Epic level|epic-level progression]] information for all the core [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|classes]], the [[Prestige Classes|prestige classes]] from the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and the [[Psionics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|psionic]] classes from the ''[[Psionics Handbook]]''. It also provides new epic-level prestige classes, magical items, monsters and  "Epic Spells", all of which follow somewhat different rules than the standard game.

== Publication history ==

The ''Epic Level Handbook'' was designed by [[Andy Collins (game designer)|Andy Collins]] and [[Bruce R. Cordell]], and published in 2001. The cover art is by [[Arnie Swekel]], with interior art by Daren Bader, [[Gerald Brom|Brom]], [[David Day (artist)|David Day]], [[Brian Despain]], [[Larry Dixon (fantasy artist)|Larry Dixon]], Michael Dutton, [[Jeff Easley]], [[Lars Grant-West]], [[Rebecca Guay]], [[Jeremy Jarvis]], Alton Lawson, [[Todd Lockwood]], [[David L. Martin|David Martin]], [[Raven Mimura]], [[Matthew Mitchell (artist)|Matthew Mitchell]], [[Vinod Rams]], [[Wayne Reynolds]], Darrell Riche, [[Richard Sardinha]], Marc Sasso, [[Mark Smylie]], Arnie Swekel, and [[Anthony S. Waters|Anthony Waters]].

Collins was the first designer scheduled for the book, and handled the core of the rules, while Cordell handled the epic spellcasting and epic monsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20020712a| title=Product Spotlight: Epic Level Handbook| date=July 17, 2002| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 1, 2013| last=Ryan| first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was updated for the 3.5 edition via an update document available from the Wizards of the Coast website.

The 4th Edition covers this in an alternate manner with continuous 1-30 level progress.  WotC covered the topic in their 2009 conference.&lt;ref name="level 30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/2009/08/07/4th-edition-dd-beyond-level-30/|title=Beyond Level 30|last=Rupp|first=Danny|date=August 7, 2009|website=|publisher=Critical Hits|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (need more details)

== Reception ==

The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' commented that before the ''Epic Level Handbook'', the third edition did not make it easy to play powerful characters, especially compared to prior editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2936 |title=Pyramid: Pyramid Review: The Epic Level Handbook (for Dungeons &amp; Dragons) |publisher=Sjgames.com |date=2002-08-09 |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer commented that the book "addresses how to keep the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' system functioning after 20th level. Due to the nature of the system, many conventions of the system such as save and attack bonus conventions do not work as well if extrapolated out past 20th level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=3590 |title=Pyramid: Review of Epic Level Handbook |publisher=Sjgames.com |date=2002-08-14 |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Voelpel from mania.com commented: "A landmark book from Wizards of the Coast, the ''Epic Level Handbook'' not only helps dungeon masters run high level games but encourages smart players to strive for it's {{sic}} unlimited greatness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/handbooks-sourcebooks-novelsoh-my_article_36518.html |title=Handbooks and Sourcebooks and Novels...Oh My! |publisher=Mania.com |date=October 13, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227081234/http://www.mania.com/handbooks-sourcebooks-novelsoh-my_article_36518.html |archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''filmarchives online''' is a web gateway providing easy access to moving image collections from various European [[film archive]]s. It allows the search throughout a growing number of individual archival databases. Since February 2007, catalogue information on around 25.000 film works – mainly non-fiction material – is searchable in various languages – among them English, German, French, Italian, and Czech. The database is constantly growing. Where available, streaming videos and [[screenshot]]s are provided with the respective film work entry. 

As locating moving images often is a complex, time consuming, and costly process, ''filmarchives online'' aims at simplifying the access and distribution of archival films in Europe. The portal addresses user groups ranging from the professional media and film production domain to the area of scientific research. Moving images can be searched by content, filmographic data and physical characteristics. Search results provide available information about existence and location of the materials. In addition to the search function, the website provides contact information to facilitate the access to the moving image items and, if available, links to digital content available for online viewing.

''filmarchives online'' is the result of the MIDAS project (Moving Image Database for Access and Re-use of European Film Collections). MIDAS was initiated in January 2006 as a pilot project in the [[MEDIA Programme]] of the [[European Commission]] and ended in January 2009. It was coordinated by the [[Deutsches Filminstitut]] together with other institutions dedicated to collecting and preserving the European film heritage. The consortium comprises eighteen institutions – among them the [[British Film Institute]], Národní Filmový Archiv (Prague), the [[Cinematek|Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique]] (Brussels) and the [[DEFA Film Library|DEFA Foundation]].

'''Gundulf''' (or '''Gundulph''') was a [[Normans|Norman]] monk who went to England following the Conquest. He was appointed [[Bishop of Rochester]] and [[Prior]] of the Cathedral Priory there. He built several [[castle]]s, including [[Rochester Castle|Rochester]], [[Colchester Castle|Colchester]] and the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] of the [[Tower of London]] and the [[Rochester Cathedral|Priory and Cathedral Church of Rochester]].

==Life==

Gundulf was a monk of [[Bec Abbey]] in [[Normandy]] and a friend, pupil and also chamberlain of [[Lanfranc]]. He was a monk of [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|St. Etienne]] in [[Caen]] before he went to England in 1070, as one of several clergy from Bec and St Etienne.&lt;ref name=BHORoch&gt;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33873 British History Online Bishops of Rochester] accessed on 30 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most important of those chosen by Lanfranc to help him with the reorganisation of English monasticism, as Lanfranc had been charged to do, following his appointment as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] by [[William I of England|King William I]].

In 1075 at Lanfranc's instigation, King William I agreed to the appointment of Gundulf as [[Rochester Cathedral|Bishop of Rochester]] and Gundulf was consecrated on 19 March 1077.&lt;ref name=Handbook266&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year Lanfranc had recovered much of the lands once belonging to St. Andrews Church at Rochester from the king's half-brother [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]] and when Gundulf was enthroned Lanfranc endowed much of this property back to the church. This restored income enabled Gundulf to start reconstruction work on the almost derelict church building in 1080.

[[Image:Mapofrocheseterenglandfromfreemanswilliamrufus1882e.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Medieval Rochester, showing the tower that Gundulf built. From E. A. Freeman's ''The Reign of William Rufus'' 1882]]
In 1078 King William used Gundulf's skill in the construction of the White Tower: the keep of the Tower of London, he was described as "competent and skilled at building in stone and was the principle overseer and surveyor of the White Tower of London";&lt;ref&gt;Textus Roffensis, pages 145-8, T. Hearne editor, London 1720&lt;/ref&gt; also the castle at Colchester which was started around 1080.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Colchester is attributed to Gundulf on the basis of the similarity in plan and design to the White Tower. In 1080 he was responsible for [[St Leonard's Tower, West Malling|St. Leonard's Tower]] which became the tower of the monastic cell of St. Leonard's, belonging to Malling Abbey.&lt;ref name=Greenwood6&gt;Greenwood p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime around 1092 Gundulf founded the abbey of St Mary's, at [[West Malling]], Kent for Benedictine nuns.&lt;ref name=Burton94&gt;Burton ''Monastic and Religious Orders'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also responsible for the founding of [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester]], the chapel of which is original and still extant.

In 1083 the Cathedral Priory of St. Andrew the Apostle was founded at Rochester with Gundulf as Prior. He personally purchased a great deal of property for his house and also acquired other properties as the Priory found continued favour with the Norman kings. Together with Archbishop Lanfranc he began the construction of the monastery buildings and continued work on the church. Later Gundulf had the relics of [[Paulinus of York|St. Paulinus]], a previous Bishop of Rochester, housed in a silver shrine at the church.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer p.13&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Gundulf's death on 7 March 1108&lt;ref name=Handbook266/&gt; the nave and western front of the church had been completed.

==King's Engineers and the Corps of Royal Engineers==

Bishop Gundulf's talent for architecture had been spotted by [[William I of England|King William I]] and was put to good use in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] where he was sent as [[bishop]]. Almost immediately  the king appointed him to supervise the construction of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], now part of the [[Tower of London]] in 1078. Under [[William Rufus]] he also undertook building work on [[Rochester Castle]]. Having served three Kings of England and earning "the favour of then all". Gundulf is accepted as the first King's Engineer. Gundulf died in 1108 and his statue adorns the west door of Rochester Cathedral.

Because of his 'military' engineering talent, Bishop Gundulf is regarded as the "father of the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]]", military engineers of the [[British Army]]. The Corps claims a line of 'King's Engineers' pre-dating the engineers of the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1414 and the formal founding of the corps in 1716 all the way back to Gundulf of Rochester. This shared heritage and the close proximity to the cathedral of the [[Royal School of Military Engineering]] in [[Brompton, Medway|Brompton]] means the Corps of [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Rochester Cathedral]] maintain strong links to this day.

The '''Herzliya Cinematheque''' is located on a passage between Sokolov Street and HaRishonim Street in [[Herzliya]]. Subsequent to the renovation of two out of three of former "Star" cinema complex's original halls in 2008, the Cinematheque was reopened, and since then [[films]] and [[movies]] are screened in the two halls, which can seat up to 275 people.

The Cinematheque screens premiere and pre-premiere industrial films, as well as [[Israel]]i [[documentaries]] and [[feature films]], foreign movies, new and old movies, and others.

The third hall was opened in 2009, and can seat up to 60 people. It is mainly used for the screenings of films that require an intimate environment. It is also where the pub "Theodore" is located. Themed evenings, shows, and lectures are carried out in this hall, as well as the screening of some movies.

The Herzliya Cinematheque hosts Israeli and foreign filmmakers, and has regular screenings which are carried out and directed by [[film critics]], [[actors]], [[academics]], and creators, as well as the hosting of short [[Film Festival|festivals]] which center different [[culture]]s, for example [[Indian Cinema]] (a collaboration between the Cinematheque and the Indian Embassy in Israel) and [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese Cinema]] (a collaboration between the Cinematheque and the Israel-Japan Friendship Association).

The Cinematheque is accessible to handicapped and disabled persons. The complex has an elevator for [[wheelchairs]], special seating, special hearing devices for the hearing impaired and other special services.

[[File:House of Dreams, 42 Melbourne Grove, East Dulwich, 2018 (1).jpg|thumb|House of Dreams, 45 Melbourne Grove, East Dulwich.]]
'''The House of Dreams Museum''' is a terraced house in East [[Dulwich]] transformed into the personal art museum of former textile designer and art director Steven Wright. Wright has lived in the house since 1982, and began developing it "just as something decorative" in 1998.&lt;ref name="btr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belowtheriver.co.uk/wednesday-picture-inside-the-house-of-dreams-east-dulwich/|title=Wednesday Picture: Inside the House of Dreams, East Dulwich|work=Below The River}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is dedicated to his dreams, life and love 
and as a monument to his dead partner and deceased parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/articles/stephen-wrights-house-dreams|title=Stephen Wright's House of Dreams|work=rawvision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright worked on the museum in secret until the 2010s, when he began to open it to the public several days each year.&lt;ref name="btr"/&gt;

Wright, a fashion and textile designer,&lt;ref name="btr"/&gt; has been influenced by [[Jarvis Cocker]]'s work on [[outsider art]], [[Bodan Litnianski]] and the folk arts of Mexico, South America and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outsider-environments.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/stephen-wright-house-of-dreams-museum.html|title=Outsider  Environments Europe|author=henk van es|work=outsider-environments.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has shown his work at the [[Halle St. Pierre]] in Paris and the museum is bequeathed to [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2011/01/28/welcome-to-the-house-of-dreams/|title=Welcome to the House of Dreams|work=dulwichonview.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is the subject of a BBC documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southlondonartmap.com/galleries/house-of-dreams-museum|title=South London Art Map|work=southlondonartmap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire ground floor, gardens and exterior has been turned into one sculpture, with rooms subdivided and every inch of the ceiling, walls, floors and space taken up. Wright lives in a flat upstairs, which is currently habitable but he aims to complete the transformation of the entire house before he dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourhomeislovely.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/introducing-artist-stephen-wright.html|title=Your Home is Lovely: interiors on a budget: From the archives: Introducing... artist Stephen Wright|work=yourhomeislovely.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3003">'''James Nowell Wood''' (March 20, 1941 &amp;ndash; June 11, 2010) was an [[Americans|American]] [[museum director]] who spent 25 years as head of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and later served as head of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], starting in 2006.

==Biography==
Wood was born in [[Boston]] on March 20, 1941. He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Williams College]] with a major in art history and earned a master's degree from the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]]. Early in his career, Wood worked at positions at the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and served for six years as the director of the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/design/15wood.html "James N. Wood, President of the Getty Trust, Dies at 69"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 14, 2010. Accessed June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Art Institute of Chicago starting in the early 1980s, Wood conducted a major expansion of its collection and oversaw a major renovation and expansion project for its facilities. As "one of the most respected museum leaders in the country", as described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wood created major exhibitions of works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] that set records for attendance at the museum.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He retired from the museum in 2004.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

In 2006, Wood was named to head the J. Paul Getty Trust, succeeding [[Barry Munitz]]. Wood was the first person with strong experience in the management of museums to head the trust, which oversees the operation of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' credited Wood with having restored the museum's reputation by reorganizing the trust and restructuring its staff.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In 2009, after a substantial drop in the trust's assets, Wood cut nearly 100 employees at the trust's various operations, most at the Getty Museum. Fees for parking at the museum and the [[Getty Villa]] were raised by 50% to $15.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Ed. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/arts/design/30gett.html "Getty Fees and Budget Are Reassessed"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 29, 2009. Accessed June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood died of natural causes at age 69 on June 11, 2010, at his home in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]]. He was survived by his wife, Emese Forizs, as well as by two daughters and three grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''KE Software''' is a formerly Australian-owned [[computer software]] company based in [[Manchester, United Kingdom]], which specialises in collection management programs for museums, galleries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeofficesearch.co.uk/OfficeSpaceNews/KE-Software-Relocates-To-New-Manchester-Offices KE Software relocates to new Manchester offices Office Space News, 31 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.axiell.com/ The Axiell Group] purchased the firm in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/axiell/pressreleases/ke-software-becomes-a-part-of-the-swedish-axiell-group-980472 My News Desk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

KE Software had its origins in investigations into electronic systems for managing natural science collections conducted in the late 1970s under a joint program of the [[University of Melbourne]], the then [[National Museum of Victoria]] and the [[Australian Museum]], which led to the development of the Titan Database in 1984. This evolved into Textpress, and by 2000, the KE EMu database program.&lt;ref name=Hart&amp;Hallett/&gt;

==Products==
The firm has two main products: the [http://alm.axiell.com/collections-management-solutions/technology/emu-collections-management/ Ke EMu Electronic Museum management system],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipaustralia.com.au/applicant/ke-software-pty-ltd/trademarks/811519/ Intellectual Property in Australia, Trade Mark Details]&lt;/ref&gt; a collections management system for museums; and [http://vitalrecords.axiell.com/ Vitalware Vital Records Management System].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kesoftware.com/ke-software/about-ke-software KE Software Corporate Web Page kesoftware.com 'About' accessed 21/09/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of Ke EMu was launched in 1997 and uses the Texpress database engine with client/server architecture on a Windows or Unix/Linux server.&lt;ref&gt;[https://emu.kesoftware.com/support/documentation/the-database-engine/about-emu-s-database-engine/417-about-texpress About EMu's Database Engine]&lt;/ref&gt; Ke Emu is consistent with the [[Dublin Core]] / [[Darwin Core]] standards for archive and museum catalogue [[metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/images/1/18/EmuBeka.pdf Rebekah Baquiran, 'KE Emu:Getting a Flightless Bird Off the Ground', ''Field Museum of Natural History'']&lt;/ref&gt; "The company’s clients include the three largest museums in the world.:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kesoftware.com/news-and-events/news/2088-ke-software-becomes-a-part-of-the-swedish-axiell-group KE Software becomes a part of the Swedish Axiell Group, Published: Friday, 04 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==KE EMu==

KE EMu is considered one of the more effective and purpose-designed museum cataloguing programs.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, B &amp; Lord, G.D., 1997, ''The Manual of Museum Management'', Rowman, Altamira Press, pp.72-73&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the creation of public interfaces to museum catalogue data.&lt;ref&gt;''The Museums Journal'', Volume 106, Issues 7-12 Museums Association, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Collections: A Journal for Museum and Archives Professionals'', Volume 5, AltaMira Press, 2009, pp.152-7&lt;/ref&gt;

KE EMu was further developed in 1997 as a multilingual platform, which has been utilised in bilingual institutions such as the Canadian Museum of Civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3jFgeRT_YW0C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22KE+Emu%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRy8AaLAYO&amp;sig=-AhZ12oz7keg86VYnlOpshGZC9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjarM_31a_PAhVSImMKHT48B5YQ6AEISDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22KE%20Emu%22&amp;f=false Lucy A. Tedd, J. A. Large ''Digital Libraries: Principles and Practice in a Global Environment'', Walter de Gruyter, 2005 p.120]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently this evolved into Texpress and KE EMu (standing for Electronic MUseum) in 2000, which is "now used across the world in natural science museums with huge collections'".&lt;ref name=Hart&amp;Hallett&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/research/understanding-museums/THart_MHallett_2011.html Tim Hart and Martin Hallett, 2011, 'Australian museums and the technology revolution', in ''Understanding Museums: Australian Museums and Museology'', Des Griffin and Leon Paroissien (eds), National Museum of Australia] {{ISBN|978-1-876944-92-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KE EMu is used by a large number of museums and galleries around the world, including the [[National Anthropological Archives|Smithsonian Anthropological Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;''Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology'', Volume 48, Smithsonian Institution Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Museum of Natural History]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.amnh.org/hiddencollections/about/ Hidden Connections, Expeditionary Field Work at the American Museum of Natural History]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Vancouver Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;''Art Museum Libraries and Librarianship'', By Joan M.

There are over 300 clients, and more than 5000 users of the EMu software worldwide. The program has been described as providing "...comprehensive museum management (collection management plus other administrative needs for a museum), workflow and project management, flexible metadata, various stats and metrics, and comprehensive web interface with support for mobile devices and kiosks"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/04/07/collection-management-systems-museums-and-the-web-2011/ Chris Fincham, head of U.S. operations, ''Collection management systems: Museums and the Web 2011'' 7-Apr-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==KE Vitalware==

The firm's vitalware software   is used by a number of governments and commercial organisations for managing and accessing large data sets, such as the birth records of the Trinidad and Tobago Registrar General,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.tt/archives/news/general/2009/05/21/birth-certificate-minutes-minister#sthash.Dfj77KVu.dpuf Corey Connelly, Birth certificate in minutes—minister ''Trinidad &amp; Tobago Guardian'' Friday, May 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttparliament.org/hansards/hs20041102.pdf Government of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Hansard, SENATE Tuesday, November 02, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the Government of Anguilla, Ministry for Infrastructure, Communications, Utility and Housing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ai/documents/budget/2015%20Budget%20Final.pdf Government of Anguilla2015 estimates of recurrent revenue, expenditure and capital]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raw.development01.com/health/mississippi_department_of_health.html Mississippi Department of Health Bureau of Public Health Statistics State of Mississippi, USA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.ms.gov/procurement/rfps/3619rfp.doc  Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services, procurement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further development==

A specialist tracking component for KE EMu has been developed by Forbes Hawkins of [[Museum Victoria]]. This enables locations to be barcoded, and data to be updated as items are moved around the stores, or between venues, display, laboratories and other locations. This system has been considered by Museums around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/19/1053196515387.html  Jenny Sinclair, 'Tracking 16 million artefacts', ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' May 20 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been working with Australian government agencies to digitize birth deaths and marriage registers in order to cross match identity data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/birth-death-records-prone-to-id-thefts/story-e6frgakx-1226157594537 Chris Griffith, 'Backlogs of birth, death records prone to ID thefts' ''The Australian'', October 04, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The program has also been used for managing the Australian Plant Disease Database and the Australian Plant Pest Database as the program "...has several features that have proven to be invaluable for a plant disease database".&lt;ref&gt;Shivas, R.

'''Luzia Woman''' ({{IPA-pt|luˈzi.ɐ}}) is the name for an Upper Paleolithic period skeleton of a [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] woman who was found in a cave in [[Brazil]]. Some archaeologists believed the young woman may have been part of the first wave of immigrants to South America. The 11,500-year-old skeleton was found in a [[grotto]] in Lapa Vermelha,  Pedro Leopoldo, Great Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1974 by archaeologist [[Annette Laming-Emperaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/luzia.html |title=Luzia Woman |publisher=[[Discovery Communications Inc.]] |first=C. |last=Smith |date=18 February 2000 |access-date=21 December 2007 |work=[[Cabrillo College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2018/10/03/interna_gerais,993745/busca-pelo-cranio-de-luzia-continua-um-mes-apos-incendio-no-rio.shtml|title=Busca pelo crânio de Luzia continua um mês após incêndio no Museu Nacional|publisher=em.com.br|language=pt|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname "Luzia" pays homage to the Australopithecus fossil "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://epoca.globo.com/o-cranio-de-luzia-mais-antiga-habitante-das-americas-pode-ter-desaparecido-no-incendio-do-museu-nacional-23045647|title=O crânio de Luzia, a mais antiga habitante das Américas, pode ter desaparecido no incêndio do Museu Nacional|publisher=O Globo|language=pt|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil was kept at the [[National Museum of Brazil]], where it was shown to the public until it was fragmented during a [[National Museum of Brazil fire|fire]] that destroyed the museum on September 2, 2018.&lt;ref name="skull-found"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Solá-Santiago |first1=Frances |title=The Story of Luzia, the Oldest Human Skull Found in the Americas |url=http://remezcla.com/features/culture/the-story-of-luzia-the-oldest-human-skull-found-in-americas/ |accessdate=25 September 2018 |agency=Remezcla |date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2018, it was announced that most of Luzia's remains was identified from the Museu Nacional debris, which allows them to rebuild part of her [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45926733|title=Brazil museum fire: Prized 'Luzia' fossil skull recovered|work=BBC|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Salviano |first1=Murilo |title=Crânio de Luzia é encontrado nos escombros do Museu Nacional, dizem pesquisadores |url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/10/19/fossil-de-luzia-pode-ter-sido-encontrado-em-escombros-do-museu-nacional-dizem-pesquisadores.ghtml |accessdate=October 19, 2018 |agency=G1 |language=pt |date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museu Nacional resgata crânio de Luzia quebrado e identifica 80% das partes|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/ciencia/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2018/10/19/equipe-resgata-cranio-da-luzia-no-museu-nacional.htm|accessdate=October 19, 2018|agency=UOL|language=pt|date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Luzia skull 3D photogrammetry.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Photogrammetry of all [[skull]] sides by [[Cícero Moraes|Cicero Moraes]]]]
Luzia was originally discovered in 1974 in a [[rock shelter]] by a joint French-Brazilian expedition that was working not far from [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil. The remains were not articulated. The skull, which was separated from the rest of the skeleton but was in surprisingly good condition, was buried under more than forty feet (12 meters) of mineral deposits and debris.

There were no other human remains at the site. New dating of the bones announced in 2013 confirmed that at an age of 10,030 ± 60 14C yr [[Before Present|BP]] (11,243–11,710 cal BP), Luzia is one of the most ancient American human skeletons ever discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fontugne|first=MIchel|title=New Radiocarbon Ages of Luzia Woman, Lapa Vermelha IV Site, Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil|journal=Proceedings of the 21st International Radiocarbon Conference|year=2013|volume=55|issue=2–3|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16253|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16253/pdf|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic]]s have determined that Luzia died in her early 20s. Although flint tools were found nearby, hers were the only human remains found in Vermelha Cave.

The fossil of Luzia was believed to have been destroyed when the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum]] burned, according to officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brazils-first-human-luzia-destroyed-in-rio-de-janeiros-museum-fire-1910767|title=Brazil's First Human "Luzia" Destroyed In Rio De Janeiro's Museum Fire|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noticias.r7.com/rio-de-janeiro/especialista-compara-perda-do-fossil-luzia-com-destruicao-da-mona-lisa-03092018|title=Especialista compara perda do fóssil Luzia com destruição da Mona Lisa

Her facial features included a narrow, oval cranium, projecting face and pronounced chin, strikingly dissimilar to most Native Americans and their [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous Siberian forebears]]. Anthropologists variously described Luzia's features as resembling those of [[Negroid]]s, [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Melanesians]] and the [[Negrito]]s of [[Southeast Asia]]. [[Walter Neves]], an anthropologist at the University of São Paulo, suggested that Luzia's features most strongly resembled those of Australian Aboriginal peoples. [[Richard Neave]] of Manchester University, who undertook a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] of Luzia, described it as negroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01EFDC1438F935A15753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=An Ancient Skull Challenges Long-Held Theories|author=Larry Rohter|publisher=New York Times|date=26 Oct 1999|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves and other Brazilian anthropologists theorized that Luzia's Paleo-Indian predecessors lived in South East Asia for tens of thousands of years after migrating from Africa and began arriving in the [[New World]] as early as 15,000 years ago. The oldest confirmed date for an archaeosite in the Americas is 18,500 and 14,500 cal BP for the [[Monte Verde]] site in southern Chile.&lt;ref name="Dillehay 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillehay|first1=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=[[PLoS ONE]]|date=November 18, 2015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some anthropologists have hypothesized that a population from coastal [[East Asia]] migrated in boats along the Kuril island chain, the Beringian coast and down the west coast of the Americas during the decline of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://natural-history.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/mnch/Erlandson_and_Braje_2011.pdf|author1=Erlandson, Jon M. |author2=Braje, Todd J.,  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=From Asia to the Americas by boat?

Neves' conclusions have been challenged by research done by anthropologists Rolando González-José, Frank Williams and William Armelagos, who have shown in their studies that the cranio-facial variability could just be due to [[genetic drift]] and other factors affecting cranio-facial plasticity in Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Vark GN, Kuizenga D, Williams FL |title=Kennewick and Luzia: lessons from the European Upper Paleolithic |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=181–4; discussion 185–8 |date=June 2003  |pmid=12740961 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.10176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stuart J. |last1=Fiedel |year=2004 |title=The Kennewick Follies: 'New' Theories about the Peopling of the Americas |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=75–110 |jstor=3631009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González-José R, Bortolini MC, Santos FR, Bonatto SL |title=The peopling of America: craniofacial shape variation on a continental scale and its interpretation from an interdisciplinary view |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=175–87 |date=October 2008  |pmid=18481303 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison in 2005 of [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] specimens with modern [[Aimoré people]] of the same region also showed strong affinities, leading Neves to classify the Aimoré as Paleo-Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jornaldaciencia.org.br/Detalhe.jsp?id=32121 |title=Os sobreviventes: Crânios de índios extintos do Brasil Central indicam elo com primeiros povoadores da América |trans-title=Survivors: skulls of extinct Indians of Central Brazil indicate link with the first settlers of America |language=Portuguese |first=Reinaldo José |last=Lopes |journal=Jornal da Ciência |date=10 Oct 2005 |accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers recreated the skull of Luzia with [[3D printing|3D printers]] by studies resumed in a laboratory of the National Institute of Technology (INT) by master's and doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/09/21/pesquisadores-recriam-parte-do-acervo-do-museu-nacional-incluindo-o-cranio-de-luzia-com-impressoras-3d.ghtml|title=Pesquisadores recriam parte do acervo do Museu Nacional, incluindo o crânio de Luzia, com impressoras 3D|work=Globo|access-date=2018-09-22|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, scientists of the [[University of São Paulo]] and [[Harvard University]] released a study that contradicts the alleged [[Australo-Melanesian]] physical appearance of Luzia. Using [[DNA sequencing]], the results showed that Luzia had [[Mongoloid]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/ciencia-e-saude/noticia/2018/11/08/estudo-contradiz-teoria-de-povoamento-da-america-e-sugere-que-rosto-de-luzia-era-diferente-do-que-se-pensava.ghtml|title=Estudo contradiz teoria de povoamento da América e sugere que rosto de Luzia era diferente do que se pensava|author=César Menezes|publisher=G1|date=8 Nov 2018|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropometry ==
Luzia stood just under five feet (1.5 m) tall; about one-third of her skeleton has been recovered. Her remains seem to indicate that she died when she was approximately 20 years old, either in an accident or as the result of an animal attack. She was a member of a group of [[hunter-gatherer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1317934/|title=Cranial morphology of early Americans from Lagoa Santa, Brazil: Implications for the settlement of the New World|work=NCBI|date=December 20, 2005|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moira Gemmill''' (18 September 1959 – 9 April 2015)  was head of design and exhibitions at the [[Museum of London]] and director of design at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from 2002 until early 2015. She had recently been appointed to the job of director of capital programmes at the [[Royal Collection Trust]]. Gemmill died after being in collision with a lorry at the Millbank roundabout, near [[Lambeth Bridge]], while cycling from her home at Kennington to her job at [[St James's Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11527969/Moira-Gemmill-design-director-obituary.html|title=Moira Gemmill, design director – obituary|date=10 April 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/19/moira-gemmill|title=Moira Gemmill obituary|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32249804|title=Tributes paid to killed cyclist Moira Gemmill|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cyclist-death-arts-and-design-visionary-moira-gemmill-killed-by-hgv-on-way-to-work-10168021.html|title=Cyclist death: Arts and design visionary Moira Gemmill killed by HGV on way to work|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Qatar''' is a [[museum]] currently under construction, located across from the [[Doha Corniche|Corniche]] in the [[Qatar]]i capital [[Doha]]. The building, which is being constructed in place of the [[Qatar National Museum]], was designed by architect [[Jean Nouvel]]. It was originally scheduled to open in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://dohanews.co/qatars-national-museum-eyeing-2016-opening/|title=Qatar’s National Museum eyeing 2016 opening|author=Shabina S. Khatri |accessdate=2 June 2015|date=6 July 2014 |work= |publisher=Doha News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its opening was pushed back to 28 March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gulf-times.com/story/611834/National-Museum-to-open-on-March-28|title=Qatar’s national museum by Jean Nouvel opening date announced|publisher=Gulf Times Qatar|date=4 November 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new under-construction National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) features an innovative design by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[Jean Nouvel]] that is inspired by the [[desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]] and grows organically around the original 20th century [[palace]] of [[Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani|Sheikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani]]. The historic Palace was restored by Berlin-based Architecture and Engineering firm [https://zrs-berlin.de/project/old-palace-doha/ ZRS Architekten Ingenieure]. This important monument to Qatar’s past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qma.org.qa/index.php/en/collections/national-museum-of-qatar National Museum of Qatar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512212926/http://www.qma.org.qa/index.php/en/collections/national-museum-of-qatar |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between the new and old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani|Sheikha Al Mayassa]] for it is the way to "define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others […]" and "celebrating our identity." &lt;ref name="Hanley 32–33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=D.C.|title=A Desert Rose takes shape: plans for National Museum of Qatar Unveiled|journal=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]|volume=29|series=4|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|430,000| sqft|m2}} museum is created by a series of interlocking discs that create cavities to protect visitors from the desert heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeoutdoha.com/art/features/25687-qatar-national-museum#.UfDvF43fBKc Take a first look at the upcoming Qatar National Museum], 28 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Located on a 1.5 million-square-foot site at the south end of Doha’s Corniche, the NMoQ building will rise from the sea and will be connected to shore by two pedestrian bridges and a vehicular bridge.

==Contractor==

The main building is contracted to Hyundai E&amp;C in 2011. The project involves the construction of the new National Museum situated next to the existing Qatar National Museum which is located across from the Corniche in the Qatari capital Doha, Qatar. The museum will be designed according to the [[Bedouin]] tradition of Qatar. It will include a building that will have the design of the desert rose and a 1.2 million square foot landscaped park. The project also includes an 115,000-square meter park with an artificial lagoon and parking spaces for 400 vehicles, a 220 seat auditorium, a research center, laboratories, a dedicated food forum, two restaurants, a café and a museum shop.  

==Collection==

A tour of the future museum will take visitors through a loop of galleries that address three major, interrelated themes. The galleries will be loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the [[natural history]] of the desert and the [[Persian Gulf]], artifacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars and the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of [[Fuel oil|oil]] to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/arts/design/23doha.html?_r=0 Celebrating the Delicate Beauty of the Desert Landscape] by NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF in [[The New York Times]], 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The displays and installations that explore these themes will integrate exciting and involving [[audiovisual]] displays with carefully selected treasures from the museum’s collections. These collections currently consist of approximately 8,000 objects and include archaeological artefacts, architectural elements, heritage household and traveling objects, [[textiles]] and [[costume]]s, [[jewellery]], decorative arts, [[books]] and [[Historical Documents|historical documents]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=37035&amp;int_modo=2#.UfDosI3fBKd Qatar Museums Authority Unveils Jean Nouvel Design for New Museum] in the ArtDaily&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's mission will be to celebrate the [[culture]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[future]] of Qatar and its people, embodying the pride and traditions of Qataris while offering international visitors a dialogue about rapid change and modernization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatarisbooming.com/2012/06/22/new-qatar-national-museum%E2%80%A6a-journey-in-a-world-of-fantasy/ New Qatar National Museum…a journey in a world of fantasy!]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6090">''' Operational bills''' are a [[Call for bids|tendering]] document for [[estimating]] costs prepared by [[architects]] that describes a [[construction]] project in terms of the operations (which include [[laborers|labour]] and plant) needed to build it. This form of document contrasts with that of [[bill of quantities|bills of quantities]] in which such tendering and estimation is limited to the [[Building material|materials]] in the completed work. Operational bills have the advantages of enhancing communication between design and production, enabling realistic tender pricing, and making the preparation of [[Critical path method|critical-path analysis]] easy for the [[General contractor|contractor]].&lt;ref name="Skoyles66"&gt;Skoyles, E.

Operational bills were proposed and developed by [[Edward Skoyles]]  at [[Building Research Establishment]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Skoyles66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoyles67"/&gt; Priced-activity schedules of the [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract]] are a modern related form, prepared by the contractor.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt; Potts, K. (2008). Construction Cost Management: Learning from Case Studies, Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-44286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

An operation is defined as a piece of construction work which can be carried out by a gang of operatives without interruption from another gang. A procedure diagram is provided that shows the relationship of operations to each other and so which are done in sequence and which are done in parallel. This allows a critical-path analysis to be quickly created by the contractor. There are two sections: the first deals with site operations in terms of schedules of materials, labour and plant requirements, and the second, any work prefabricated adjacent or off site. At the end of the bill, management and plant resources are given so they are included.&lt;ref name="Skoyles66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoyles67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Royal Institute of  Surveyors (Republic of Ireland Branch) (1970). The bill of quantities and the operational bill: Seminar, Dublin, March. An Foras Forbartha (Irish National Institute for Physical Planning and Construction Research) {{ISBN|978-0-900115-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

After operational bills were proposed, a second half-way house version with bills of quantities was suggested initially called “activity bills”, but then as “Bills of quantities (operations)”. In this, the operations are described in terms of the rules of the standard method of measurement rather than labour and materials.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoyles, ER. (1970).

The '''''Paston Letters''''' are a collection of correspondences between members of the Paston family of [[Norfolk]] [[gentry]] and others connected with them in England between the years 1422 and 1509. The collection also includes state papers and other important documents.

== History of the collection ==
The large collection of letters and papers was acquired in 1735 from the executors of the estate of [[William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth]], the last in the Paston line, by the antiquary [[Francis Blomefield]]. On Blomefield's death in 1752 they came into the possession of [[Thomas Martin of Palgrave|Thomas Martin]] of [[Palgrave, Suffolk]]. On his death in 1771 some letters passed into the hands of John Ives, while many others were purchased by John Worth, a chemist at [[Diss]], whose executors sold them in 1774 to Sir [[John Fenn (antiquarian)|John Fenn]] of [[East Dereham]].

==Published editions==

===Edited by John Fenn===
In 1787, [[John Fenn (antiquarian)|John Fenn]] published a selection of the letters in two volumes, bringing general interest to the collection. In 1789, Fenn published two further volumes of letters. Before he died in 1794 he prepared a fifth volume for publication, which was posthumously published in 1823 by his nephew, William Frere. In 1787, Fenn presented the originals of his first two volumes to King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]], who knighted Fenn on 23 May 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stoker |first=David |year=1995 |title=Innumerable letters of good consequence in history: the discovery and first publication of the Paston Letters |journal=The Library: Transactions of the Bibliographical Society |volume=XVII |issue=2 |pages=107–155 |publisher=The Bibliographical Society |location=London }} pp.108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the manuscripts for all five volumes disappeared {{when|date=December 2015}}, casting doubt on the authenticity of the letters. In 1865 their authenticity was questioned by [[Herman Merivale]] in the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'', but [[James Gairdner]] countered that they were genuine in the same periodical. Within a year, Gairdner was proven right by the discovery of the originals of the fifth volume, together with other letters and papers, by Frere's son, Philip Frere, in his house at [[Dungate]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (1995), pp.152–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, the originals of Fenn's third and fourth volumes with ninety-five unpublished letters were found at Roydon Hall, [[Norfolk]], the seat of George Frere. Finally the originals of the two remaining volumes were discovered in 1889 at Orwell Park, [[Ipswich]], in the residence of Captain E.G. Pretyman. The last letters to be found were the letters presented to George III; they may have reached Orwell through Sir [[George Pretyman Tomline]], the tutor and friend of [[William Pitt the Younger]].

Most of the Paston letters and associated documents are now in the [[British Library]], but some are in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], with a few at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].

===Edited by James Gairdner===
Fenn's edition of the ''Paston Letters'' were considered definitive until 1872, when James Gairdner published the first volume of a new edition. Taking Fenn's work as a basis, Gairdner ultimately published over four hundred previously unpublished letters in three volumes. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Gairdner's edition included notes and an index, along with introductions to each volume containing a survey of the reign of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. Before he had published all the volumes of his edition, some letters were discovered in 1875 at [[Roydon, South Norfolk|Roydon]] that he had written about. These unpublished letters were added as a supplement to a subsequent three-volume edition published in 1896. In 1904, Gairdner edited a complete edition of the ''Paston Letters'' in six volumes, containing 1,088 letters and papers with a new introduction.

===Edited by Norman Davis===
In 1971, [[Norman Davis (academic)|Norman Davis]] published a new edition, which was revised and expanded by Richard Beadle and Colin Richmond in 2004.

==Biographies of Paston family==
Two recent books have presented the story of the fifteenth-century Pastons for a wide audience, ''[[Blood and Roses (book)|Blood and Roses]]'' by [[Helen Castor]] (2004) and ''A Medieval Family'' by [[Frances and Joseph Gies]] (1998).

==Chronology==

===The early Pastons===
The family of Paston takes its name from a [[Paston, Norfolk|Norfolk village]] about twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Norwich]]. The first member of the family about whom anything is known was Clement Paston (d.1419), a yeoman holding and cultivating about one hundred acres (40 hectares) of land. His wife, Beatrice Somerton (d.1409), is said to have been 'a bond woman', but her brother, Geoffrey Somerton (d.1416), became a lawyer, and it was Geoffrey who paid for the education, both at grammar school and at the [[Inns of Court]], of his nephew, [[William Paston (died 1444)|William Paston]] (1378–1444), son of Clement and Beatrice.{{sfn|Richmond|2010}} William, who is described as a "right cunning man" in the law, attained an influential position in his profession, and in 1429 became a [[Justice of the Common Pleas]]. He bought a good deal of land in [[Norfolk]], including property in Paston and [[Gresham Castle]], and improved his social position by his marriage with Agnes Barry (d.1479), the daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Barry or Berry of Horwellbury. &lt;ref&gt;According to some sources, Harlingbury Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Therfield]] and [[Royston, Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43611 'Parishes: Kelshall', ''A History of the County of Hertford'': volume 3 (1912), pp. 240–244] Retrieved 22 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richmond|1990|p=117}}{{sfn|Richmond|Virgoe|2004}}{{sfn|Jones|1993|p=81}} Agnes emerges from the letters as a difficult and quick-tempered woman, whose  quarrels with the Paston villagers leave some valuable examples of colloquial English in the 1450s. She frequently quarreled with her children.

On his death, he left a large and valuable inheritance to [[John Paston (died 1466)|John Paston]], the eldest of his five sons, who was already married to Margaret (d. 1484), daughter of John Mautby of [[Mautby]], Norfolk. England was experiencing instability at this time; the nobles surrounding the king did not allow him sufficient power to govern, and much of England was effectively lawless. A lawyer like his father, Paston spent much of his time in London, leaving his wife to look after his business in Norfolk, a task  which Margaret, a sensible and competent woman,   managed with considerable skill. Many of the letters were written by Margaret to her husband in London. The letters written during the lifetimes of John Paston and his eldest son, also named [[John Paston (died 1479)|John]], are most numerous and provide the most insight, not only on their family matters but on the overall history of England.

In 1448 Paston's manor of Gresham was seized by [[Robert Hungerford, Lord Moleyns]] (1431–1464), and, although it was afterwards recovered, the owner could obtain no redress for the loss and injury he had sustained. Moreover, Paston had become intimate with the wealthy knight [[John Fastolf|Sir John Fastolf]], who was a kinsman of Paston's wife, Margaret, and who had employed him on several matters.

At his death, Fastolf left his affairs in disorder. As was customary in his time, he left many of his estates in Norfolk and [[Suffolk]] to [[feoffee]]s including [[William Yelverton|Sir William Yelverton]], [[John Paston (died 1466)|John Paston]] and his brother William, retaining the revenues for himself. His written will tasked his ten executors with founding a college at [[Caister]]. However, two days before his death, according to [[John Paston (died 1466)|John Paston]], Fastolf made a [[nuncupative]] (spoken) will in which he bequeathed all his lands in Norfolk and Suffolk to Paston, for a payment of 4000 [[Mark (money)|marks]] and the duty of founding the college at [[Caister-on-Sea|Caister]].

Taking possession of the lands, Paston's claims were challenged. Different noblemen claimed his estates. The excluded executors litigated, and Paston fell under the threat of violence. A feud broke out between [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk|John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]], and the Pastons under Margaret and her eldest son, John, around [[Drayton, Norfolk|Drayton]] and [[Hellesdon]]. Caister Castle was seized by [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], while similar occurrences took place at other estates. In 1460 and 1461, Paston returned to parliament as a knight of the shire for Norfolk, and, enjoying the favour of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], had regained his castle at Caister. He fell out of favor, however, and was imprisoned on three occasions. Paston died in May 1466, with the suit concerning Fastolf's will still proceeding in the church courts.

===John Paston's sons and descendants===
John Paston left five sons. The eldest, [[John Paston (died 1479)|Sir John Paston]] (1442–1479), had been knighted during his father's lifetime. He was frequently at the court of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], but afterwards favoured the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] party, and, with his younger brother, also named John, fought for [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. Meanwhile, the struggle over Paston's estates continued, although in 1461 the king and council had declared that Paston's ancestors were not bondmen, and consequently that his title to his father's lands was valid. [[Caister Castle]] was taken after a siege by [[John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk|John Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk]] (1444–1476), and then recovered by the Pastons, and retaken by the duke. But in 1474 an arrangement was made with [[William Waynflete]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], the representative of the excluded executors, by which some of the estates were surrendered to the bishop for charitable purposes, while Paston was secured in the possession of others. Two years later the death of the Duke of Norfolk made the restoration of Caister Castle possible, but in 1478 a quarrel broke out with [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk]].

Sir John Paston, who was a cultured man, was anxious to recover Caister, but he left the task to his mother and to the younger John. Owing to his carelessness and extravagance, the family lands were also diminished by sales, but nevertheless when he died unmarried in November 1479 he left a substantial inheritance to his younger brother John. About this time the Letters become scanty and less interesting, but the family continued to flourish. The younger John Paston (d. 1504), after quarrelling with his uncle William over the manors of [[Oxnead]] and [[Marlingford and Colton|Marlingford]], was knighted at the [[Battle of Stoke]] in 1487. He married Margery, daughter of Sir Thomas Brewes, and left a son, William Paston (c. 1479–1554), who was also knighted, and who was a prominent figure at the court of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Sir William's second son, John Paston (1510–1575) was the father-in-law of Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Sir William's third son, Clement (c. 1515–1597), served his country with distinction on the sea, and was wounded at the [[Battle of Pinkie]].

The family was continued by Sir William's eldest son, Erasmus (b. 1502-d. 1540), whose son William succeeded to his grandfather's estates in 1554, and to those of his uncle Clement in 1597. This William (1528–1610) was knighted in  1578. He was the founder of the Paston grammar-school at [[North Walsham]], and made Oxnead Hall, near Norwich, his principal residence. Christopher Paston was Sir William's son and heir, and Christopher's grandson, William (d. 1663), was created a baronet in 1642; being succeeded in the title by his son [[Sir Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth|Robert]] (1631–1683), who was a member of parliament from 1661 to 1673, and was created [[Earl of Yarmouth]] in 1679. Robert's son William (1652–1732), who married a natural daughter of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was the second earl, and, like his father, was in high favour with the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]]. When he died in 1732 he left no son, and his titles became extinct, his estates being sold to discharge his debts.

The disorder revealed by the ''Paston Letters'' reflects the general condition of England during this period. The weakness of the government left every branch of the administration disorganized. The succession to the crown itself was contested. Nobility fought a civil war. The prevailing discontent led to the rising of [[Jack Cade]] and of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The correspondence reveals the Pastons in a variety of relations to their neighbours — both friendly and hostile. It abounds with illustrations of public events, as well as of the manners and morals of the time, and some valuable examples of colloquial English, such as Agnes Paston's quarrel with her  neighbour, Warren Harman, c.1451,  where she told him  "if his father had do as he  did he would a be  ashamed to say to me as he said". Particularly remarkable is the habitual acquaintance of educated persons, both men and women, with the law, which was evidently indispensable to persons of substance. Of most interest, however, are the occasional love letters, notably those from Richard Calle to Margery Paston, and Margery Brews' famous [[Valentines]] to John Paston III.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', '''Phobetor''' ('Frightener'), so called by men, or '''Icelos''' ('Like'), so called by the gods, is one of the thousand sons of [[Somnus]] (Sleep). He appeared in dreams "in the form of beast or bird or the long serpent".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.638&amp;ndash;641].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ovid, two of his brothers were [[Morpheus]], who appeared in dreams in human form, and [[Phantasos]]  ('Fancy'), who appears in dreams in the form of inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.635&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt; The three brothers names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp calls these three figures "literary, not mythical concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; However Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Phobetor and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp. 179, 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14325">In [[statistics]], '''qualitative comparative analysis''' ('''QCA''') is a [[data analysis]] technique for determining which logical conclusions a [[data set]] supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of [[logical inference]] to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by [[Charles Ragin]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | first = Charles C.
 | title = The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies 
 | publisher = [[University of California Press]]
 | date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of technique==
In the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were [[dichotomous]] (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.

In QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the "prime implicates" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference "(A and B) implies the particular value of D".

To establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-qualitativecomparatvnlyss.html qualitative comparative analysis - History Of qualitative comparative analysis | Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Sociology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used in [[social science]] and is based on the [[wikt:binary|binary]] logic of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.

==Motivation==
The technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables.  The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible.&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE&gt;J. Goldthorpe, "Current issues in comparative macrosociology" in ''Comparative social research'', 16, 1997, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.

==Criticism==
As this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with "crisp-set" QCA ([[csQCA]]), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values).&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE/&gt; Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA ([[mvQCA]]) and fuzzy set QCA ([[fsQCA]]). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA.&lt;ref name="rihoux2006"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Related Systematic Comparative Methods: Recent Advances and Remaining Challenges for Social Science Research | journal= International Sociology | year=2006 | volume=21 | page=679 | doi=10.1177/0268580906067836 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to [[type I error]]. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses [[Monte Carlo simulations]] to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Qualitative Comparative Analysis: How Inductive Use and Measurement Error Lead to Problematic Inference|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/252|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2013-04-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 252–265|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1093/pan/mps061|first = Simon|last = Hug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fuzzy Sets on Shaky Ground: Parameter Sensitivity and Confirmation Bias in fsQCA|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/21|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 21–41|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpu016|first = Chris|last = Krogslund|first2 = Donghyun Danny|last2 = Choi|first3 = Mathias|last3 = Poertner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guarding Against False Positives in Qualitative Comparative Analysis|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/24/pan.mpv017|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-07-25|issn = 1047-1987|pages = mpv017|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpv017|first = Bear F.|last = Braumoeller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the [[null hypothesis]] and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCAfalsePositive/index.html|title = QCAfalsePositive: Tests for Type I Error in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)|date = 2015-05-19|accessdate = 2015-08-26|website = Comprehensive R Archive Network|publisher = R Project|last = Braumoeller|first = Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to criticisms==
QCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y.  However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher.  For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the "coverage" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the "consistency" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.

Fuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.&lt;ref name="rihouxMarx2013"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=QCA, 25 Years after"The Comparative Method": Mapping, Challenges, and Innovations--Mini-Symposium | journal= Political Research Quarterly | year=2013 | volume=66 | pages=167–235 | doi=10.1177/1065912912468269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Zinn''''',&lt;ref&gt;1946 AD 346.&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in South African law, was heard in the Appellate Division on 6 December 1945, with judgment handed down on 13 March 1946. Watermeyer CJ, Tindall JA, Greenberg JA, Schreiner JA, and Davis AJA. NE Rosenberg KC (with him D. Gould) appeared for the appellant, and C. Norman Scoble, for the Crown.

== Facts ==
The appellant had been convicted of a contravention of Volksraad Besluit No. 104 of 25 September 1871, in that he had allowed [[coloured person]]s, other than those exempted by the Besluit, to occupy an [[Cadastre|erf]] in the village of belonging to the appellant, and had been fined £1. This decision was appealed on the grounds

# that a breach of the provisions of the Besluit was not a crime; and
# that the Besluit, in so far as it referred to coloured persons, had been impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation.

== Judgment ==
The Appellate Division, allowing an appeal, did not think it necessary, for the purposes of this case, to attempt to lay down any specific test for deciding whether an enactment creates a criminal offence. It was sufficient, the court found, to apply the general rule of giving effect to the lawgiver's intention. It considered, therefore, whether or not the language of the Besluit, together with its surrounding circumstances, showed that it was a penal enactment. The court began by comparing the Besliut with other legislative enactments preceding and following it, and found none whose terms showed it to be a criminal enactment but which did not expressly mention a penalty: "A survey of the legislation up to and including the period when the Besluit was passed affords good reason for holding that, as a matter of practice, 'when the Volksraad intended to create a crime, it prescribed a penalty.'"&lt;ref&gt;357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held, for this reason and for others, that the Besluit in question did not create a crime. Although it did not make the assumption that, if an enactment is to create a crime, it should provide, either expressly or by reference, for a punishment, "I think it improbable that if the lawgiver had intended that the Besluit should create a crime, he would not have taken the precaution of inserting a penalty—more particularly as this is what appears generally to have been done."&lt;ref&gt;361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the [[Transvaal Provincial Division]] (where Barry JP and Millin J dismissed an appeal from conviction in the Magistrate's Court of [[Johannesburg]]), was thus reversed.

In '''''S v Morrison''''', an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], the court considered whether or not there is a duty on the presiding officer to inform the accused of his [[Right to counsel|right to legal representation]].

In terms of section 73(2) of the [[Criminal Procedure Act, 1977|CPA]], the accused has a right to legal representation, but the court held that this right is generally known to most people, and that no rule of law or practice requires a trial court to spell this out to every unrepresented accused.

The court held that whether there is such a duty depends on the circumstances of the case.

This case was heard before the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] came into force. The Constitution now explicitly protects the right of the accused to be informed of his right to legal representation.

A '''solar deity''' (also '''sun god''' or '''sun goddess''') is a [[sky deity]] who represents the [[Sun]], or an aspect of it, usually by its perceived power and strength. Solar deities and sun worship can be found throughout most of [[recorded history]] in various forms. The Sun is sometimes referred to by its [[Latin]] name ''Sol'' or by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''[[Helios]]''. The [[English language|English]] word ''sun'' stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''sunnǭ''.&lt;ref&gt;In most romance languages the word for "sun" is masculine (e.g. ''le soleil'' in French, ''el sol'' in Spanish, ''Il Sole'' in Italian).
In most Germanic languages it is feminine (e.g. ''Die Sonne'' in German). In [[Proto-Indo-European]], its gender was inanimate.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Neolithic]] concept of a  "solar barge" (also "solar bark", "solar barque", "solar boat" and "sun boat", a mythological representation of the sun riding in a [[boat]]) is found in the later myths of [[ancient Egypt]], with [[Ra]] and [[Horus]]. Predynasty Egyptian beliefs attribute [[Atum]] as the sun-god and Horus as a god of the sky and sun. As the [[Old Kingdom]] theocracy gained power, early beliefs were incorporated with the expanding popularity of Ra and the Osiris-Horus mythology. Atum became Ra-Atum, the rays of the setting sun. [[Osiris]] became the divine heir to Atum's power on Earth and passes his divine authority to his son Horus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Civilizations- Egypt- Land and lives of Pharaohs revealed|publisher=Global Book Publishing|isbn=1740480562|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Egyptian myths imply the sun is within the lioness, [[Sekhmet]], at night and is reflected in her eyes; or that it is within the cow, [[Hathor]], during the night, being reborn each morning as her son (''bull'').

Mesopotamian [[Shamash]] plays an important role during the [[Bronze Age]], and "my Sun" is eventually used as an address to royalty. Similarly, South American cultures have a tradition of Sun worship, as with the Incan [[Inti]].

[[Proto-Indo-European religion]] has a solar chariot, the sun as traversing the sky in a [[chariot]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In Germanic mythology this is ''[[Sól (Sun)|Sol]]'', in Vedic [[Surya]], and in Greek [[Helios]] (occasionally referred to as [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]) and (sometimes) as [[Apollo]]. In Proto-indo-European mythology the sun appears to be a multilayered figure, manifested as a goddess but also perceived as the eye of the sky father [[Dyeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Miriam Robbins (Fall–Winter 1984). "Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon". Mankind Quarterly. 25 (1 &amp; 2): 137–144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sick, David H. (2004), "Mit(h)ra(s) and the Myths of the Sun", Numen, 51 (4): 432–467, {{JSTOR|3270454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman Empire]], a [[Roman festival|festival]] of the birth of the ''[[Sol Invictus|Unconquered Sun]]'' (or ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'') was celebrated on the [[winter solstice]]—the "rebirth" of the sun—which occurred on December 25 of the [[Julian calendar]]. In [[late antiquity]], the theological centrality of the sun in some Imperial religious systems suggest a form of a "solar monotheism". The religious commemorations on December 25 were replaced under Christian domination of the Empire with the birthday of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"Sun worship." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
[[File:Egypt.IsisHorus.01.png|100px|thumb|left|[[Isis]], bearing her solar disk and horns nurses her infant, Horus]]

The [[Tiv people]] consider the Sun to be the son of the [[God|supreme being]] [[Awondo]] and the Moon Awondo's daughter. The [[Lozi people|Barotse tribe]] believes that the Sun is inhabited by the sky god [[Nyambi]] and the Moon is his wife.
Some [[Sara people]] also worship the sun.
Even where the sun god is equated with the supreme being, in some African mythologies he or she does not have any special functions or privileges as compared to other deities. The ancient Egyptian god of creation, [[Amun]] is also believed to reside inside the sun. So is the [[Akan people|Akan]] creator deity, [[Nyame]] and the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] deity of creation, Nommo. Also in Egypt, there was a religion that worshipped the sun directly, and was among the first monotheistic religions: [[Atenism]].

Sun worship was prevalent in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. The earliest deities associated with the sun are all goddesses: [[Wadjet]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Hathor]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], and [[Menhit]]. First Hathor, and then Isis, give birth to and nurse [[Horus]] and [[Ra]]. Hathor the horned-cow is one of the 12 daughters of Ra, gifted with joy and is a wet-nurse to Horus.

From at least the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]], the sun was worshipped as the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Ra|Re]] (pronounced probably as Riya, meaning simply {{'}}'''the sun'''{{'}}), and portrayed as a falcon headed god surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent.  Re supposedly gave warmth to the living body, symbolised as an [[ankh]]: a "T" shaped [[amulet]] with a looped upper half.  The ankh, it was believed, was surrendered with death, but could be preserved in the corpse with appropriate mummification and [[funerary cult|funerary rite]]s. The supremacy of Re in the Egyptian [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] was at its highest with the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]], when open air solar temples became common. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], Re lost some of his preeminence to [[Osiris]], lord of the West, and judge of the dead. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Empire]] period, the sun became identified with the [[dung beetle]], whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the sun. In the form of the sun disc [[Aten]], the sun had a brief resurgence during the [[Amarna Period]] when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teeter|first1=Emily|title=Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521848558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frankfort|first1=Henri|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: an Interpretation|date=2011|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0486411389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun's movement across the sky represents a struggle between the Pharaoh's soul and an avatar of Osiris. Ra travels across the sky in his solar-boat; at dawn he drives away the demon king [[Apep]]. The "solarisation" of several local gods (Hnum-Re, Min-Re, Amon-Re) reaches its peak in the period of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|fifth dynasty]].

{{Hiero|Akhet (horizon)|&lt;hiero&gt;N27&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
Rituals to the god Amun who became identified with the sun god Ra were often carried out on the top of temple [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]]. A Pylon mirrored the hieroglyph for 'horizon' or ''[[akhet (hieroglyph and season)|akhet]]'', which was a depiction of two hills "between which the sun rose and set",&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, op. cit., p.195&lt;/ref&gt; associated with recreation and rebirth. On the first Pylon of the temple of Isis at [[Philae]], the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies in the presence of Isis, Horus and Hathor.
In the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]], the earliest-known monotheistic head of state, [[Akhenaten]] changed the polytheistic religion of Egypt to a monotheistic one, Atenism of the solar-disk and is the first recorded state monotheism. All other deities were replaced by the Aten, including [[Amun-Ra]], the reigning sun god of Akhenaten's own region. Unlike other deities, the Aten did not have multiple forms. His only image was a disk—a symbol of the sun.

Soon after Akhenaten's death, worship of the traditional deities was reestablished by the religious leaders (Ay the High-Priest of Amen-Ra, mentor of Tutankhaten/Tutankhamen) who had adopted the Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.

===Aztec mythology===
In [[Aztec mythology]], ''[[Tonatiuh]]'' ({{lang-nah|Ollin Tonatiuh}}, "Movement of the Sun") was the sun god. The [[Aztec]] people considered him the leader of ''[[Tollan]]'' ([[heaven]]). He was also known as the fifth sun, because the Aztecs believed that he was the sun that took over when the fourth sun was expelled from the sky. According to their [[cosmology]], each sun was a god with its own cosmic era. According to the Aztecs, they were still in Tonatiuh's era. According to the Aztec [[creation myth]], the god demanded [[human sacrifice]] as tribute and without it would refuse to move through the sky. The Aztecs were fascinated by the sun and carefully observed it, and had a [[solar calendar]] similar to that of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Many of today's remaining Aztec monuments have structures aligned with the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diccionario de Mitología Nahua|editor=Biblioteca Porrúa. Imprenta del Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Historia y Etnología|authorlink=Cecilio Agustín Robelo|language=Spanish|year=1905|location=México|pages=648, 649, 650|isbn=978-9684327955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Aztec calendar]], Tonatiuh is the lord of the thirteen days from 1 Death to 13 Flint. The preceding thirteen days are ruled over by [[Chalchiuhtlicue]], and the following thirteen by [[Tlaloc]].

===Arabia===

Sun worship was apparently practiced in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]], abolished only under [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Haykal&gt;"The Sun and the Moon are from among the evidences of God. They do not eclipse because of someone's death or life." [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], Translated by Isma'il Razi A. al-Faruqi, ''The Life of Muhammad'', American Trush Publications, 1976, {{ISBN|0-89259-002-5}} [http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/campaign_of_tabuk_and_death_of_ibrahim.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabian solar deity appears to have been a goddess, [[Shams (deity)|Shams]]/[[Shamsun]], most likely related to the [[Canaan]]ite [[Shapash]] and broader middle-eastern [[Shamash]]. She was the patron goddess of [[Himyar]], and possibly exalted by the [[Sabaeans]] and early [[Bedouin]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoel Natan, Moon-o-theism, Volume I of II, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Baldick (1998). Black God. Syracuse University Press. p. 20. {{ISBN|0815605226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, 1999 - 1181 páginas&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
In [[Buddhist cosmology]], the [[bodhisattva]] of the Sun is known as ''[[Suryaprabha|Sūryaprabha]]'' ("having the light of the sun"); in Chinese he is called ''Rigong Riguang Pusa'' (The Bright Solar Bodhisattva of the Solar Palace), ''Rigong Riguang Tianzi'' (The Bright Solar Prince of the Solar Palace), or ''Rigong Riguang Zuntian Pusa'' (The Greatly Revered Bright Solar Prince of the Solar Palace), one of the 20 or 24 guardian ''[[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]''.

Sūryaprabha is often depicted with ''[[Candraprabha]]'' ("having the light of the moon"), called in Chinese ''Yuegong Yueguang Pusa'' (The Bright Lunar Bodhisattva of the Lunar Palace), ''Yuegong Yueguang Tianzi'' ( The Bright Lunar Prince of the Lunar Palace), or ''Yuegong Yueguang Zuntian Pusa'' (The Greatly Revered Bright Lunar Prince of the Lunar Palace). Together with [[Medicine Buddha|Bhaiṣajyaguru Buddha]] (Chinese: ''Yaoshi Fo'') these two bodhisattvas constitute the ''Dongfang San Sheng'' (Three Holy Sages of the Eastern Quarter).

===Chinese mythology===
[[File:TaiYangXingJun.jpg|thumb|right|Taiyang Shen, the Chinese solar deity]]
[[File:Xi He.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of the sun goddess [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]] charioteering the sun, being pulled by a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], in [[Hangzhou]]]]
In [[Chinese mythology]] (cosmology), there were originally ten suns in the sky, who were all brothers. They were supposed to emerge one at a time as commanded by the Jade Emperor. They were all very young and loved to fool around. Once they decided to all go into the sky to play, all at once.  This made the world too hot for anything to grow. A hero named [[Hou Yi]] shot down nine of them with a bow and arrow to save the people of the earth. He is still honored this very day. In another myth, the [[solar eclipse]] was caused by the magical dog of heaven biting off a piece of the sun. The referenced event is said to have occurred around 2,160BCE.  There was a tradition in China to make lots of loud celebratory sounds during a solar eclipse to scare the sacred "dog" away.
The Deity of the Sun in Chinese mythology is Ri Gong Tai Yang Xing Jun (Tai Yang Gong / Grandfather Sun) or Star Lord of the Solar Palace, Lord of the Sun. In some mythologies, Tai Yang Xing Jun is believed to be Hou Yi. 
Tai Yang Xing Jun is usually depicted with the Star Lord of the Lunar Palace, Lord of the Moon, Yue Gong Tai Yin Xing Jun (Tai Yin Niang Niang / Lady Tai Yin). Worship of the [[moon goddess]] [[Chang'e]] and her festivals are very popular among followers of [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]]. Similar to [[Santa Claus]] and [[Christmas]] in the West, the goddess and her holy days are ingrained in [[Chinese popular culture]].

===Baltic mythology===
Those who practice [[Dievturība]], beliefs of traditional [[Latvian culture]], celebrate the Sun [[goddess]], [[Saulė|Saule]], known in traditional [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]] beliefs as Saulė. Saule/Saulė is among the most important [[deities]] in [[Baltic mythology]] and traditions.

===Celtic===
The sun in [[Insular Celts|Insular Celtic culture]] is assumed to have been feminine,&lt;ref name="monaghan433"&gt;[[Patricia Monaghan]], ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore'', page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John T., ''Celtic Culture: Aberdeen breviary-celticism'', page 1636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dexter, Miriam Robbins |title=Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon |journal=Mankind Quarterly |volume=25 |number=1 &amp; 2 |date=Fall–Winter 1984|pages=137–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several goddesses have been proposed as possibly solar in character. In [[Continental Celts|Continental Celtic culture]], the sun gods, like [[Belenos]], [[Grannus|Grannos]], and [[Lugh|Lug]], were masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/354152038|title=Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise : une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental|last=X.|first=Delamarre,|date=2003|publisher=Errance|year=|isbn=9782877723695|edition=2e éd. rev. et augm|location=Paris|pages=72 &amp; 183 &amp; 211|oclc=354152038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=NJ57DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|title=The Book of Celtic Myths: From the Mystic Might of the Celtic Warriors to the Magic of the Fey Folk, the Storied History and Folklore of Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, and Wales|last=Media|first=Adams|date=2016-12-02|publisher="F+W Media, Inc."|year=|isbn=9781507200872|location=|pages=45|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=xyWvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|title=The Celtic and Scandinavian Religions|last=MacCulloch|first=J.

In [[Irish language|Irish]], the name of the sun, ''[[Grian]]'', is feminine. The figure known as [[Áine]] is generally assumed to have been either synonymous with her, or her sister, assuming the role of Summer Sun while Grian was the Winter Sun.&lt;ref name="McKillop2"&gt;MacKillop (1998) pp. 10, 70, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Étaín]] has at times been considered to be another theonym associated with the sun; if this is the case, then the pan-Celtic [[Epona]] might also have been originally solar in nature,&lt;ref name="McKillop2"/&gt; though Roman syncretism pushed her towards a [[lunar deity|lunar]] role.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The British [[Sulis]] has a name cognate with that of other Indo-European solar deities such as the Greek [[Helios]] and Indic [[Surya]],&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Errance, 2003, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zair, Nicholas, Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals in Celtic, Brill, 2012, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; and bears some solar traits like the association with the eye as well as epithets associated with light. The theonym [[Sulevia]], which is more widespread and probably unrelated to Sulis,&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Jufer &amp; Thierry Luginbühl (2001). ''Les dieux gaulois : répertoire des noms de divinités celtiques connus par l'épigraphie, les textes antiques et la toponymie.'' Editions Errance, Paris. pp. 15, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes taken to have suggested a pan-Celtic role as a solar goddess.&lt;ref name="monaghan433"/&gt; She indeed might have been the ''de facto'' solar deity of the Celts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] [[Olwen]] has at times been considered a vestige of the local sun goddess, in part due to the possible etymological association&lt;ref&gt;Simon Andrew Stirling, The Grail: Relic of an Ancient Religion, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; with the wheel and the colours gold, white and red.&lt;ref name="monaghan433"/&gt;

[[Brighid]] has at times been argued as having had a solar nature, fitting her role as a goddess of fire and light.&lt;ref name="monaghan433"/&gt;

===Hinduism===
[[File:Runner of Sky - God Surya.jpg|thumb|The Hindu solar deity Surya being driven across the sky in his chariot|359x359px]]
The [[Ādityas]] are one of the principal deities of the [[Vedic]] classical Hinduism belonging to Solar class. In the [[Vedas]], numerous hymns are dedicated to [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Savitr]] etc.

Even the [[Gayatri mantra]], which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to [[Savitr]], one of the principal Ādityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the [[Brahmana]] period numbering twelve. The ritual of ''[[Surya Namaskaar]]'', performed by [[Hindu]]s, is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.

The sun god in [[Hinduism]] is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic Ādityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity, [[Surya]], the Sun. The attributes of all other Ādityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other [[Ādityas]] became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.

The ''[[Ramayana]]'' has [[Rama]] as a descendant of the [[Surya]], thus belonging to the [[Suryavansha]] or the clan of the Sun. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes one of its warrior heroes, [[Karna]], as being the son of the Pandava mother [[Kunti]] and [[Surya]].

The sun god is said to be married to the goddess Ranaadeh, also known as Sanjnya. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.

The charioteer of Surya is [[Aruṇa|A]]runa, who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week.

In India, at [[Konark]], in the state of [[Odisha]], a temple is dedicated to Surya. The [[Konark Sun Temple]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Surya is the most prominent of the ''[[navagrahas]]'' or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. ''Navagrahas'' can be found in almost all Hindu temples. There are  further temples dedicated to Surya, one in Arasavilli, Srikakulam District in AndhraPradesh, one in Gujarat at [[Modhera]]  and another in Rajasthan. The temple at Arasavilli was constructed in such a way that on the day of Radhasaptami, the sun's rays directly fall on the feet of the Sri Suryanarayana Swami, the deity at the temple.

[[Chhath]] (Hindi: छठ, also called ''Dala Chhath'') is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and the [[Terai]]. This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of [[India]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and parts of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Hymns to the sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the ''surya''.

The [[Gurjar]]s (or Gujjars), were Sun-worshipers and are described as devoted to the feet of the sun god Surya. Their copper-plate grants bear an emblem of the Sun and on their seals too, this symbol is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sun-worship in ancient India|author=Lālatā Prasāda Pāṇḍeya|publisher=Motilal Banarasidass|year=1971|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chronography of 354|Philocalian calendar]] of AD 354 gives a festival of "Natalis Invicti" on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff 2001: 174–177. Hoey (1939: 480) writes: "An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December 19". The inscription (Dessau, ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 8940) actually prescribes an annual offering to Sol on ''November'' 18 (die XIV Kal(endis) Decemb(ribus), i.e. on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of December).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Text at [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Chronography_of_354] Parts 6 and 12 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The charioteer in the mosaic of Mausoleum M has been interpreted by some as Christ.

The idea that Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Jesus on 25 December because this was the date of an already existing festival of the Sol Invictus was expressed in an annotation to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop [[Jacob Bar-Salibi]]. The scribe who added it wrote: "It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day." &lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea became popular especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-54956551-2}}), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://melkite.org/tag/feast-of-the-annunciation|title=» Feast of the Annunciation|website=melkite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia: Christmas]: ''Natalis Invicti''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men lived a whole number of years, without fractions, so that Jesus was considered to have been conceived on 25 March, as he died on 25 March, which was calculated to have coincided with 14 Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Colinge, ''Historical Dictionary of Catholicism'' (Scarecrow Press 2012 {{ISBN|978-0-81085755-1}}), p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (c.160 – c.240) gave 25 March as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F.

Among those who have put forward this view are Louis Duchesne,&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution'' (London: SPCK, 1903), pp 261–265)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas J. Talley,&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Liturgical Year (New York: Pueblo, 1986), pp. 87–103&lt;/ref&gt; David J.

The ''Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'' also remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and the birthday of Jesus: "This 'calculations' hypothesis potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, Hugh Pyper (editors), ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'' (Oxford University Press 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-19860024-4}}), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Susan K. Roll calls "most extreme" the unproven hypothesis that "would call Christmas point-blank a 'christianization' of Natalis Solis Invicti, a direct conscious appropriation of the pre-Christian feast, arbitrarily placed on the same calendar date, assimilating and adapting some of its cosmic symbolism and abruptly usurping any lingering habitual loyalty that newly-converted Christians might feel to the feasts of the state gods".&lt;ref&gt;Susan K. Roll, ''Toward the Origin of Christmas'' (Kempen 1995 {{ISBN|90-390-0531-1}}), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beit alfa01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, with the sun in the centre, surrounded by the twelve zodiac constellations and with the four seasons associated inaccurately with the constellations]]
The nimbus of the figure under Saint Peter's Basilica is described by some as ''rayed'',&lt;ref name=Weitzmann1979/&gt; as in traditional pre-Christian representations, but another has said: "Only the ''cross-shaped'' nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kemp, ''The Oxford History of Western Art'' (Oxford University Press 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-19860012-1}}), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another has interpreted the figure as a representation of the sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans (2009), pp. 567-578&lt;/ref&gt; Among scholars who view the celebration of the birth of Jesus on 25 December as motivated by choice of the [[winter solstice]], rather than that he was conceived and died on 25 March, some reject the idea that this choice constituted a deliberate Christianization of a festival of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun. For example, Michael Alan Anderson writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both the sun and Christ were said to be born anew on December 25. But while the solar associations with the birth of Christ created powerful metaphors, the surviving evidence does not support such a direct association with the Roman solar festivals. The earliest documentary evidence for the feast of Christmas makes no mention of the coincidence with the winter solstice. Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect. The origins of Christmas, then, may not be expressly rooted in the Roman festival.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-54956551-2}}), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same point is made by Hijmans: "It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ ... While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans (2009), p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that, "while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas".&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans (2009), p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study of [[Augustine of Hippo]] remarks that his exhortation in a Christmas sermon, "Let us celebrate this day as a feast not for the sake of this sun, which is beheld by believers as much as by ourselves, but for the sake of him who created the sun", shows that he was aware of the coincidence of the celebration of Christmas and the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, although this pagan festival was celebrated at only a few places and was originally a peculiarity of the Roman city calendar. It adds: "He also believes, however, that there is a reliable tradition which gives 25 December as the actual date of the birth of our Lord."&lt;ref&gt;F. van der Meer, Brian Battershaw, G. R. Lamb, ''Augustine the Bishop: The Life and Work of a Father of the Church'' (Sheed &amp; Ward 1961), pp. 292-293&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of Christ with the astronomical [[Sun]] is common in ancient Christian writings.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Miethe, Hilde Heyduck-Huth, ''Jesus'' (Taylor &amp; Francis), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century, [[Pope Leo I]] (the Great) spoke in several sermons on the Feast of the Nativity of how the celebration of Christ's birth coincided with increase of the sun's position in the sky. An example is: "But this Nativity which is to be adored in heaven and on earth is suggested to us by no day more than this when, with the early light still shedding its rays on nature, there is borne in upon our senses the brightness of this wondrous mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/360326.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Sermon 26 (Leo the Great)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians adopted the image of the Sun ([[Helios]] or Sol Invictus) to represent Christ. In this portrayal he is a beardless figure with a flowing cloak in a chariot drawn by four white horses, as in the mosaic in Mausoleum M discovered under [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and in an early-4th-century catacomb fresco.&lt;ref name=Weitzmann1979&gt;{{cite book |first=Kurt |last=Weitzmann |title=Age of Spirituality |location=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=1979 |ISBN= 978-0-87099179-0 |page= 522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement of Alexandria had spoken of Christ driving his chariot in this way across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Matilda Webb, ''The Churches and Catacombs of Early Christian Rome'' (Sussex Academic Press 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-90221058-2}}), p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian mythology===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Solar gods have a strong presence in [[Indonesian mythology]]. In some cases the Sun is revered as a "father" or "founder" of the tribe. This may apply for the whole tribe or only for the royal and ruling families. This practise is more common in Australia and on the island of Timor, where the tribal leaders are seen as direct heirs to the sun god.

Some of the initiation rites include the second reincarnation of the rite's subject as a "son of the Sun", through a symbolic death and a rebirth in the form of a Sun. These rituals hint that the Sun may have an important role in the sphere of funerary beliefs. Watching the Sun's path has given birth to the idea in some societies that the deity of the Sun descends in to the underworld without dying and is capable of returning afterward. This is the reason for the Sun being associated with functions such as guide of the deceased tribe members to the underworld, as well as with revival of perished. The Sun is a mediator between the planes of the living and the dead.

===Theosophy===
{{Main|Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun}}
The primary local deity in [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] is the Solar Logos, "the consciousness of the sun".&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution). Lucifer, represented by the sun, the light.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar myth==
Three theories exercised great influence on nineteenth and early twentieth century mythography, beside the [[Tree worship]] of [[Wilhelm Mannhardt|Mannhardt]] and the [[Totemism]] of [[J. F. McLennan]], the "Sun myth" of [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] and [[Max Müller]].

[[R. F. Littledale]] criticized the Sun myth theory when he illustrated that Max Müller on his own principles was himself only a Solar myth, whilst [[Alfred Comyn Lyall|Alfred Lyall]] delivered a still stronger attack on the same theory and its assumption that tribal gods and heroes, such as those of [[Homer]], were mere reflections of the Sun myth by proving that the gods of certain [[Rajput clans]]  were really warriors who founded the clans not many centuries ago, and were the ancestors of the present chieftains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/origins/ridgeway003.html |title=Solar Myths, Tree Spirits, and Totems, The Dramas and Dramatic Dances of Non-European Races |author=William Ridgeway |date=1915 |pages=11–19 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]  |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar barge and sun chariot==
[[File:Ra Barque.jpg|thumb|[[Ra]] aboard the ''[[Atet]]'', his solar barge]]
A "solar barge"—also known as a "solar bark", "solar barque", "solar boat", or "sun boat"—is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a [[boat]]. The most famous of these is the ''[[Atet]]'', the barge of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian]] sun god [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. The "[[Khufu ship]]", a 43.6-meter-long vessel that was sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque. This boat was rediscovered in May 1954 when archeologist Kamal el-Mallakh and inspector Zaki Nur found two ditches sealed off by about 40 blocks weighing 17 to 20 tonnes each. This boat was disassembled into 1,224 pieces and took over 10 years to reassemble. A nearby museum was built to house this boat.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti, Alberto, Zahi Hawass, 1997 "Guide to the Pyramids of Egypt" p. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sun boats were found in Egypt dating to different pharonic dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/egyptian_solar_boat.htm |title=Egypt solar boats |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:
* Neolithic [[petroglyph]]s which (it has been speculated) show solar barges
* The many early Egyptian goddesses who are related as sun deities and the later gods [[Ra]] and [[Horus]] depicted as riding in a [[Atet|solar barge]]. In Egyptian myths of the afterlife, Ra rides in an underground channel from west to east every night so that he can rise in the east the next morning.
* The [[Nebra sky disk]], which is thought to show a depiction of a solar barge.
* [[Nordic Bronze Age]] petroglyphs, including those found in [[Tanumshede]] often contains barges and [[sun cross]]es in different constellations.

A "sun chariot" is a [[mythology|mythological]] representation of the sun riding in a [[chariot]]. The concept is younger than that of the solar barge, and typically [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], corresponding with the Indo-European expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC.

Examples include these:
* In Norse mythology, the chariot of the goddess [[Sól (Sun)|Sól]], drawn by [[Arvak and Alsvid]]. The [[Trundholm sun chariot]] dates to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], more than 2,500 years earlier than the Norse myth, but is often associated with it.
* Greek [[Helios]] riding in a chariot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html |title=Helios |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Phaethon|Phaëton]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thanasis.com/helios.htm |title=Helios &amp; Phaethon |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Thanasis.com |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sun itself also was compared to a wheel, possibly in Proto-Indo-European, Greek ''hēliou kuklos'', Sanskrit ''suryasya cakram'', Anglo-Saxon ''sunnan hweogul'' ([[PIE]] {{PIE|*swelyosyo kukwelos}}).

==Male and female==

Solar deities are often thought of as male while the [[lunar deity]] is female, but the opposite case is also seen. The [[cobra]] (of Pharaoh Son of Ra), the [[lion]]ess (daughter of Ra), the [[cow]] (daughter of Ra), the dominant symbols of the most ancient Egyptian deities, carried their relationship to the sun atop their heads; they were female and their cults remained active throughout the history of the culture. Later a ''sun god'' (Aten) was established in the [[eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] on top of the other solar deities, before the "aberration" was stamped out and the old pantheon re-established. When male deities became associated with the sun in that culture, they began as the offspring of a mother (except Ra, King of the Gods who gave birth to himself).

In [[Germanic mythology]] the Sun is female and the Moon is male. The corresponding Old English name is Siȝel {{IPA-ang|ˈsɪjel|}}, continuing Proto-Germanic *Sôwilô or *Saewelô. The Old High German Sun goddess is [[Sól (sun)|Sunna]]. In the Norse traditions, Sól rode through the sky on her chariot every day, pulled by two horses named Arvak and Alsvid. Sól also was called Sunna and Frau Sunne.

Other cultures that have sun goddesses include the Lithuanians ([[Saulė]]) and Latvians (Saule), the Finns ([[Päivätär]], [[Beiwe]]) and the related Hungarians. Sun goddesses are found around the world in Australia ([[Bila (deity)|Bila]], [[Walo (deity)|Walo]]), India ([[Bisal-Mariamna]], [[Bomong]], [[Kn Sgni]]), among the Hittites ([[Wurusemu]]), and Egyptians ([[Sekhmet]]), in the Canary Islands ([[Chaxiraxi]])/([[Magek]]), in Native America, among the Cherokee ([[Unelanuhi]]), Natchez ([[Wal Sil]]), Inuit ([[Malina (mythology)|Malina]]), and Miwok ([[Hekoolas]]), and in Asia among the Japanese ([[Amaterasu]]).

'''Sources''' is a [[web portal]] for journalists, freelance writers, editors, [[authors]] and [[researchers]], focusing especially on human sources: [[expert]]s and spokespersons who are prepared to answer [[Reporter]]s' questions or make themselves available for on-air [[interview]]s.

==Structure==
The Sources website is built around a [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled-vocabulary]] subject index comprising more than 20,000 topics. This [[Subject indexing|subject index]] is underpinned by an 'Intelligent Search' system which helps reporters focus their searches by suggesting additional subjects related to their search terms. For example, a search for "cancer" will suggest terms such as "chemotherapy", "melanoma", "oncology", "radiation therapy", "tobacco diseases" and "tumours", as well as topics that actually contain the word "cancer".

Each topic reference links in turn to experts and spokespersons on that topic, with profiles describing their expertise and, where relevant, their approach to the issue, along with their phone numbers and other contact information. Sources includes listings for universities and research institutes, non-profit associations and NGOs, government and public sector bodies, businesses, and individuals including academics, public speakers, and consultants.

The subject index and the search menus are being translated into French, Spanish and German to make Sources more of an international resource.

==History==

===Print supplement===
Based in Canada, Sources was founded in 1977 as a print directory for reporters, editors, and story producers. It was first published as a supplement to ''Content'' magazine, an influential and controversial magazine of journalism criticism. ''Content'', founded by Dick MacDonald in 1970 and published by [[Barrie Wallace Zwicker|Barrie Zwicker]] after MacDonald's death in 1974, frequently took journalists to task for always relying on the same narrow range of sources representing the same conventional points of view for their stories. Zwicker and MacDonald argued in ''Content'' and in their book ''The News: Inside the Canadian Media''&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Dick; Zwicker, Barrie. ''The News: Inside the Canadian Media''. Deneau. 1982. {{ISBN|0-88879-053-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a “terrible sameness” in the media’s coverage of many important issues, and a shutting out of other, potentially valuable, perspectives and sources of information.

Zwicker decided to do something about the problem, and in summer 1977, ''Content'' published its first directory issue, called Sources. Billed as “A Directory of Contacts for Editors and Reporters in Canada”, Sources listed “information officers, public relations officers, media relations and public affairs people, and other contacts for groups, associations, federations, unions, societies, institutions, foundations, industries and companies and federal, provincial and municipal ministries, departments, agencies and boards.”&lt;ref&gt;Sources: A Directory of Contacts for Editors and Reporters in Canada. ''Content''. 1977. {{ISSN|0045-835X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the rationale behind Sources, Zwicker said that “It’s a cliché that every story has two sides. An untrue cliché. Most have several. The reporter’s challenge is digging out all sides. Sources can help.”&lt;ref&gt;Sources 50. 2002. {{ISBN|0-920299-55-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, Zwicker saw Sources as a public service as well as a tool for journalists. He said that Sources aimed “to help promote a system of information fairness. Communications resources are equivalent to other basic needs – shelter, food, health care, for example. Everyone should have reasonable access to all.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sources 36. 1995. {{ISBN|0-920299-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he said “we attempt to provide true diversity: access to people in organizations large and small, for-profit and not-for-profit, from low-tech to high-tech, long-established to just-launched.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Zwicker told users that “within Sources you will find both mainstream and alternative information. Some may consider alternative as off to one side, not quite up to par, more or less second hand. Here at Sources ‘alternative’ is considered differently, considered as authentic and substantial, even if normally less accessible. The surprises, the jarring notes, the flashes of insight, the ‘odd takes’, the pearls of wisdom, the cries de coeur, the avant garde, tomorrow’s news, the prophesies, the unfiltered, the exciting, the elsewhere-squelched, the memorable, the eccentric, the thought-out-at-length, the unmentionable in polite company, the outrageous, the uncensored ... these are what ‘alternative’ media offer. So far as we can, we will include the alternative with Sources. Sources’ driving philosophy is flat-out informational democracy enabled by user-friendly technology. The assumption is that there is a significant fraction of Canadians who want to use and benefit from such an information resource. The assumption is that a significant fraction of Canadians want to expand their search for solutions, and deepen their understandings, rather than chant conventional wisdoms (however freshly minted) to each other."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Separate publications===
After a few years, Sources become so big that it could no longer fit into ''Content'' (the print directory eventually grew to more than 500 pages), and in 1981 it became an independent publication. ''Content'' itself eventually folded, but Zwicker continued to devote a substantial editorial section in Sources to coverage of topics of interest to journalists, ranging from practical topics such as grammar, style, [[fact-checking]], [[photojournalism]], [[copyright]], fees for freelancers and [[self-publishing]], to feature articles on the state of journalism and the media, to book reviews. From the early 1990s, Sources began to feature articles about online research, notably the regular feature 'Dean's Digital World'&lt;ref&gt;[Dean's Digital World – http://www.sources.com/SSR/DeansDigital.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by informatics expert Dean Tudor.

===World Wide Web===

====Content====
Sources went on the Internet in 1995 and has been expanding its online portal ever since. It continues to publish a print edition of the directory, primarily for the benefit of freelancers who use it as a source of story ideas, but is now primarily a Web-based resource.

The Sources website includes not only the Sources directory itself, but a separate government directory, Parliamentary Names &amp; Numbers; a directory of the media, Media Names &amp; Numbers; and The Sources HotLink  [http://www.hotlink.ca (www.hotlink.ca)], which features articles about media relations and public relations. Also on the site is [http://www.sources.com/Fandf/Index.htm Fame and Fortune], a directory of awards, prizes, and scholarships available to writers and journalists, and a portal linked into the online archive of [[Connexions (Information Sharing Services)|Connexions]], a library of documents related to alternatives and social justice.

The site also houses Sources Select Resources,&lt;ref&gt;Sources Select Resources – http://www.sources.com/SSR.htm&lt;/ref&gt; a large library of articles and reviews about journalism and the media, spanning a period of more than 30 years.

====Controversy====
While much of the editorial content has focused on the nitty-gritty of writing, editing and research, Sources has also regularly published articles that have sparked controversy on topics such as censorship and [[media bias]]. One campaign waged by Zwicker and others challenged the [[journalism ethics|ethics]] of journalists accepting free gifts from the people they are supposed to cover. This campaign eventually led Canadian managing editors to agree among themselves that their newspapers would not accept free tickets from travel agencies, resorts, and hotels.

A series of articles by Zwicker on "War, Peace, and the Media"&lt;ref&gt;Zwicker, Barrie. ''War, Peace and the Media''. Sources. 1983, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; (later collected and published as a booklet) provoked a furor from readers upset by its criticisms of how the media cover [[United States foreign policy|U.S. foreign policy]]. As Zwicker put it in a publisher's letter in the next issue, the "reaction ranged from high praise to angry denunciation." The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' newspaper devoted three stories to the series. The columnist Claire Hoy was left "trembling with rage" and the editor [[Peter Worthington]] felt "outraged" and a lead editorial denounced Zwicker.

Other controversial articles included one by Wendy Cukier on the public relations battle surrounding proposed [[Gun politics in Canada|gun control]] legislation, which drew the ire of the gun lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Cukier, Wendy. "Anatomy of the Gun Control Debate". Sources. 1996 – http://www.sources.com/SSR/Docs/PNN5-1-GunControl.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Ulli Diemer, who succeeded Zwicker as publisher in 1999, came under attack from the [[Fraser Institute]] for his article "Ten Health Care Myths: Understanding Canada’s Medicare Debate”, in which he argued that opponents of [[public health care]] were spreading [[Misinformation|mis-information]] designed to mislead and frighten the public.&lt;ref&gt;Diemer, Ulli. 'Ten Health Care Myths: Understanding Canada’s Medicare Debate’. Sources. 1995. – http://www.diemer.ca/Docs/Diemer-TenHealthCareMyths.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====New resources====
In keeping with its mandate of encouraging a wide diversity of points of view in the media, Sources has added extra resources over time to help organizations and individuals to be heard. These include a calendar of events open to the media&lt;ref&gt;Sources Calendar – http://calendar.sources.com&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[news release]] service which Sources members can use to distribute their statements and communiques via online posting and [[RSS]]. The releases are also subject indexed and integrated into the overall search structure for information on the Sources site.

[[File:FiveStarsInline3.svg|thumb|A typical format for a star rating, showing three out of five stars]]

'''Stars''' are often used as symbols for ratings. They are used by reviewers for ranking things such as films, TV shows, restaurants, and hotels. For example, a system of one to five stars is commonly employed to rate [[hotel]]s, with five stars being the highest quality.

==Historical usage==

Repeated symbols used for ranking date to [[Mariana Starke]]'s 1820 guidebook, which used [[exclamation point]]s to indicate works of art of special value:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...I have endeavoured... to furnish Travellers with correct lists of the objects best worth notice...; at the same time marking, with one or more exclamation points (according to their merit), those works which are deemed peculiarly excellent.&lt;ref&gt;Mariana Starke, ''Travels on the Continent: written for the use and particular information of travellers'', London: John Murray, 1820 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rLRfAAAAcAAJ full text], p. x; later editions are entitled ''Information and Directions for Travellers on the Continent''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers]] and then the [[Baedeker Guides]] (starting in 1844) borrowed this system, using stars instead of exclamation points, first for points of interest, and later for hotels.&lt;ref&gt;David M Bruce, "Baedeker: the Perceived Inventor of the Formal Guidebook", in Richard Butler, ed., ''Giants of Tourism'', {{ISBN|1845936523}}, p. 93-110&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Michelin Guide|Michelin restaurant guide]] introduced a star as a restaurant rating in 1926, and expanded to a system of one to three stars in 1931.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505100337/http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/tpl/mag6/art200903/htm/tour-saga-michelin.htm "The Michelin Guide: 100 editions and over a century of history"] ViaMichelin, accessed 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Books===
In 1915, [[Edward Joseph Harrington O'Brien|Edward O'Brien]] began editing [[The Best American Short Stories]]. This annual compiled O'Brien's personal selection of the previous year's best short stories. O'Brien was known to work indefatigably: he claimed to read as many as 8,000 stories a year, and his editions contained lengthy tabulations of stories and magazines, ranked on a scale of zero to three stars (representing O'Brien's notion of their "literary permanence.")&lt;ref name="Kennison (1999)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best American Short Stories of the Century|last=Kenison|first=Katrina|date=1999|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]]|isbn=0-395-84368-5|pages=viii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each book, O'Brien listed all the stories published during the preceding year. O'Brien awarded no stars to those stories which failed "to survive either the test of substance or the test of form." O'Brien listed these stories without comment or a qualifying asterisk. O'Brien awarded one star to "those stories which may fairly claim to survive either the test of substance or the test of form. Each of these stories may claim to possess either distinction of technique alone, or more frequently, I am glad to say, a persuasive sense of life in them to which a reader responds with some part of his own experience." O'Brien awarded two stars to stories "of still greater distinction" that warranted a second reading "because each of them has survived both tests, the test of substance and the test of form." O'Brien awarded three stars&amp;nbsp;– the highest rating&amp;nbsp;– to "a small group of stories" which had "an even finer distinction—the distinction of uniting genuine substance and artistic form in a closely woven pattern with a spiritual sincerity so earnest, and a creative belief so strong, that each of these stories may fairly claim, in my opinion, a position of some permanence in our literature as a criticism of life. O'Brien further listed these stories "in a special 'Roll of Honor.'" In this special list O'Brien further attached an additional asterisk to those stories that O'Brien personally enjoyed. "Stories indicated by this asterisk seem to me not only distinctive, but so highly distinguished as to necessitate their ultimate preservation between book covers. It is from this final short list that the stories reprinted in this volume have been selected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best Short Stories of 1915 And the Yearbook of the American Short Story|last=O'Brien|first=Edward J.|authorlink=Edward Joseph Harrington O'Brien|date=1916|location=Boston|publisher=Small, Maynard &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Herford]]'s essay ''Say it with Asterisks'', quips "Never, I think, were a mob of overworked employees so pitifully huddled together in an ill-ventilated factory as are the Asterisks in this Sweatshop of Twaddle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herford|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Herford|title=Neither Here Nor There|chapter=Say it with Asterisks|date=1922}}First published in the [[Ladies' Home Journal]].&lt;/ref&gt; Literary editor Katrina Kenison dismisses O'Brien's grading systems as "excessive at best, fussy and arbitrary at worst."&lt;ref name="Kennison (1999)" /&gt;

Book reviewers generally do not use a star-rating system though there are exceptions. The ''West Coast Review of Books'' rates books on a scale of one ("poor") to five ("superior") stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|title=(trade ad)|date=December 1977|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to editor D. David Dreis, readers love the ratings but publishers don't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|title=Book Review Aims at Masses|page=89|date=15 November 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
In the 31 July 1928 issue of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', the newspaper's film critic Irene Thirer began grading movies on a scale of zero to three stars. Three stars meant 'excellent,' two 'good,' and one star meant 'mediocre.' And no stars at all 'means the picture's right bad,'" wrote Thirer. [[Carl Bialik]] speculates that this may have been the first time a film critic used a star-rating system to grade movies.&lt;ref name="Bialik (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123265679206407369|title=Let's Rate the Ranking Systems of Film Reviews: The Stars, Grades and Thumbs Applied to Movies Suffer From Lackluster Performance, Low Production Values|date=23 January 2009|last=Bialik|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Bialik|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The one-star review of ''[[The Port of Missing Girls (1928 film)|The Port of Missing Girls]]'' launched the star system, which the newspaper promised would be 'a permanent thing.'&lt;ref name="Bialik (2009)" /&gt;

According to film scholar [[Gerald Peary]], few newspapers adopted this practice until the French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' "started polling critics in the 1950s and boiling their judgment down to a star rating, with a [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]] reserved for movies that the magazine didn't like."&lt;ref name="Bialik (2009)" /&gt; The highest rating any film earned was five stars. &lt;!--- Dundan Shepherd claims only "four stars" ---&gt; The British film magazine ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' also rated films on a scale of one to four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1996/sep/19/duncan-shepherd-replies-his-critics/?page=2|title=Duncan Shepherd Replies to His Critics|last=Shepherd|first=Duncan|date=19 September 1996|authorlink=Duncan Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics use a "half-star" option in between basic star ratings. Leonard Maltin goes one further and gives ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' a 2⅓ star rating.{{sfn|Maltin||p=}}

Critics do not agree what the cutoff is for a recommendation, even when they use the same scale. [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] "both consider[ed] a three-star rating to be the cutoff for a "thumbs up" on their scales of zero to four stars.&lt;ref name="Caro (1990)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Caro|first=Mark|title=A Journey Through The Stars - and Beyond: When It Comes To Rating Entertainment, You've Gotta Have A System; Star Gazing With The Movie Critics|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2 March 1990|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-03-02/entertainment/9001180289_1_stars-siskel-ebert-rate-films}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--- Either Siskel or Ebert once said they will on occasion recommend a two-and-a-half star film. Can't find the source. ---&gt; Film critic [[Dave Kehr]]&amp;nbsp;– who also uses a 0–4 star scale&amp;nbsp;– believes "two stars is a borderline recommendation".&lt;ref name="Caro (1990)" /&gt; On a five-star scale, regardless of the bottom rating, 3 stars is often the lowest positive rating, though judging on a purely mathematical basis, 2 1/2 stars would be the dividing line between good and bad on a 0-5 scale. [[Common Sense Media]] uses a scale of one to five, where 3 stars is "Just fine; solid" and anything lower is "Disappointing" at best.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/about-our-ratings Common Sense Media: About our ratings]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no agreement on what the lowest rating should be. Some critics make "one star" or a "half-star" their lowest rating. Dave Kehr believes that "one star" indicates the film has redeeming facets,&lt;ref name="Caro (1990)" /&gt; and instead uses zero stars as his lowest rating.

Examples of rating scales:
*0–4: [[Roger Ebert]], [[Gene Siskel]], [[David Kehr]] and [[Peter Travers]]
*0.5–4: [[Steven H. Scheuer]]'s now defunct film guide grades films from a half-star ("abysmal") to four stars ("excellent").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies on TV and Video Cassette 1989-1990|last=Scheuer|first=Steven H.|authorlink=Steven H. Scheuer|edition=13th|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|date=1989|isbn=9780553277074|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this Scheuer's guide intentionally gives [[Wes Craven]]'s film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' no stars making it the lowest-rated film in the book.{{sfn|Scheuer|1989|p=440}}
*0–5: ''[[The Times]]''
*1–4: Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] rates films on a scale of one through four stars, although his guide notes that there is no actual "one star" rating. For these "bottom-of-the-barrel movies", Maltin's guide uses the citation "BOMB".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leonard Maltin's 2012 Movie Guide|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|authorlink=Leonard Maltin|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|date=2011|isbn=9780451234476|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Maltin, the 1981 [[Bo Derek]] film ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' "nearly forced the editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB".{{sfn|Maltin|2011|p=1378}}
*1–5: [[Common Sense Media]]

Critics have different ways of denoting the lowest rating when this is a "zero". Some such as [[Peter Travers]] display empty stars. [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] and [[Dave Kehr]] use a round black dot.&lt;ref name="rosenbaum"/&gt; [[Leslie Halliwell]] uses a blank space.&lt;ref name="halliwell"/&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' uses a "0", or as their former film critic dubbed it, the "death doughnut".&lt;ref name="Scott (1992)" /&gt; Roger Ebert used a thumbs-down symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010315/1023|title=''Death Wish II'' review by Roger Ebert|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=24 July 2011|date=1 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics use a [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black dot]].

Critics also do not agree on what the lower ratings signify, let alone the lowest rating. While Maltin's and Scheuer's guides respectively explain that lowest rated films are "BOMB(s)" and "abysmal", British film critic [[Leslie Halliwell]] instead writes that no star "indicates a totally routine production or worse; such films may be watchable but are at least equally missable."&lt;ref name="halliwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=Leslie|authorlink=Leslie Halliwell|title=Halliwell's Film Guide|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|date=1987|edition=5th|page=xxiv|isbn=9780684188263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Halliwell and Dave Kehr, film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] believes one-star films have some merit, however unlike Halliwell, Rosenbaum believes that no stars indicate a "worthless" movie.&lt;ref name="rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Placing Movies: The Practice of Film Criticism|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=1995|page=17|isbn=9780520086333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] occasionally gave zero stars to films he deemed "artistically inept and morally repugnant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bronson's Loose!: The Making of the Death Wish Films|page=53|last=Talbot|first=Paul|publisher=[[iUniverse]]|date=2006|isbn=9780595379828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheuer's guide calls "one and a half star" films "poor", and "one star" films "bad".{{sfn|Scheuer|1989|p=}}

Not all film critics have approved of star ratings. Film scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wondered if ''Sight and Sound'' readers accepted "such blackening of their characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Wood (critic)|title=Hitchcock's Films Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|date=2002|page=61|isbn=9780231126953}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Scott]] of Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' was an opponent of using symbols to summarize a review and wrote in 1992 that "When Globe editors first proposed the four-star system of rating movies about a year ago, the response from Globe critics was, to put it mildly, underwhelming."&lt;ref name="Scott (1992)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jay Scott on Film: Introducing the death doughnut (or, this one rates a zero)|last=Scott|first=Jay|authorlink=Jay Scott|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto, Ontario|date=10 January 1992|page=C.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Mark Kermode]] has expressed a dislike of star ratings (assigned to his online reviews but not his print or radio reviews) on the grounds that his verdicts are sometimes too complex to be expressed as a rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/mark-kermode/mark-kermode-interview-film-critics-pr-joe-cornish-star-ratings|title=Mark Kermode interview|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy and theatre===
Star ratings are also given out at [[stand-up comedy]] performances and [[theatre]] productions. Star ratings are given at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], the largest arts festival in the world. Since 2010, the [[British Comedy Guide]] has collected over 4,300 reviews of around 1,110 different acts, across 83 different publications in the form of a star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2014/features/edinburgh_fringe_best_shows_2014/|title=Best reviewed Edinburgh Fringe shows 2014|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of star ratings is controversial because the public may ignore the reviews and concentrate more the star ratings alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Steve|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2014/08/26/20814/isnt_it_time_the_stars_went_out%3F|title=Isn't it time the stars went out?|publisher=[[Chortle Awards|Chortle]]|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Star ratings are not often used to rate the quality of a video game, but are rather used within certain games for varying purposes.  One notable use of the star system is to grade a player's performance in completing a [[Level (gaming)|level]] with up to three stars, used in many modern multi-level games like ''[[Angry Birds (video game)|Angry Birds]]''.  This three-star rating system challenges the player to [[Replay value|repeat and fully master previously beaten levels]] in order to receive a perfect 3-star rating, which may confer other benefits or bonus content.  Another use of star ratings is to denote the rarity of characters in video games where players are tasked in collecting numerous characters, such as ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]'' and ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', in which stronger and rarer characters are marked with more stars to make them appear more valuable.

==Restaurant ratings==
{{main|Restaurant rating}}
Restaurant guides and reviewers often use stars in [[restaurant rating|restaurant ratings]]. The Michelin system reserves stars for exceptional restaurants, and gives up to three; the vast majority of recommended restaurants have no star at all. Other guides now use up to four or five stars, with one-star being the lowest rating. The stars are sometimes replaced by symbols such as a fork or spoon. Some guides use separate scales for food, service, ambiance, and even noise level.

The Michelin system remains the best known star system. A single star denotes "a very good restaurant in its category", two stars "excellent cooking, worth a detour", and three stars, "exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey".&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book
  | title = Le Guide Rouge: Paris 2003
  | publisher =Michelin Editions de Voyages
  |date= 2003
  | location = Paris, France
  | page = 16
  | isbn = 2-06-100694-9
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelin stars are awarded only for the quality of food and wine; the luxury level of the restaurant is rated separately, using a scale of one ("quite comfortable") to five ("luxury in the traditional style") crossed fork and spoon symbols.

==Hotel ratings==
{{main|Hotel rating}}
[[File:The Leading Hotels of the World.jpg|thumb|"Five-star superior" rating at the [[Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski]] in [[Munich]], Germany]]

Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars.

Other classifiers, such as the [[AAA Five Diamond Award]], use [[Lozenge|diamonds]] instead of stars to express hotel ratings levels.

Hotels are  assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an [[elevator]] would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vine |first1=P.A.L. |date=March 1981 |title=Hotel classification; art or science? |journal=International Journal of Tourism Management |publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1016/0143-2516(81)90014-1 }} (Requires purchase of a document for $31.50)&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some{{who|date=September 2018}} who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.

== Financial product ratings ==
In the UK, providers and comparison websites often use Stars to indicate how feature-rich financial products are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defaqto Ratings at Gocompare.com|url = http://www.gocompare.com/defaqto/|website = www.gocompare.com|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Defaqto]] is an organisation that independently assess every financial product in the UK. Each of these products is awarded a rating from 1 to 5 Stars, allowing consumers to see where it sits in the market. The higher the Star Rating, the more comprehensive a product.

[[Defaqto|Defaqto Star Ratings]] are calculated using a scoring system of between 40 and 100 features and benefits for each product or insurance policy, with each scored from 1 to 5. The scores for each product are totalled and all products ranked. Our industry experts determine the scores necessary to achieve 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Star Ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are Star Ratings? {{!}} Defaqto|url = https://www.defaqto.com/star-ratings/star-ratings/what-are-star-ratings/|website = www.defaqto.com|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ranks==
The most senior [[military rank]]s in all services are classified by a star system in many countries, ranging from [[one-star rank]] which typically corresponds to [[brigadier]], [[brigadier general]], [[commodore (rank)|Commodore]] or [[air commodore]], to the most senior [[five-star rank]]s which include [[Admiral of the Fleet]], [[Grand Admiral]], [[Field Marshal]], [[General of the Army]] and [[Marshal of the Air Force]] which typically only exist during large-scale conflicts. The North Korean rank of [[Taewonsu]] has been compared to a seven-star rank.

In the [[Irish Army|army]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the most junior ranks are classified by stars. A three-star [[private (rank)|private]]/[[gunner (rank)|gunner]]/[[trooper (rank)|trooper]] is one who is considered a fully trained soldier. Two-star privates/gunners/troopers are those who have completed basic training but have not yet completed other specialised training necessary for their roles. One-star privates do not exist: the lowest rank is recruit. Senior officers are classified as Brigadiers, Majors General and Lts General.

==Other==
===Manufactured home park rating===
There is no official star rating system for manufactured home parks because there is no rating organization. For such an organization to exist would require agreement between the owners of approximately 50,000 parks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rolfe | first = Frank | title = Let’s Give up on the Star System | work = MobileHomeParkStore.com | publisher = NicheInvestments.com | date = 17 September 2012 | url = http://www.mobilehomeparkstore.com/articles/lets-give-up-on-the-star-system/ | accessdate = 29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A residual belief in such a system probably originated in a directory of mobile home parks printed in the 1970s, in which each park was assessed with a five star rating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Alcorn | first = Ray | title = Mobile Home Park "Star" Ratings: Fact or Illusion? | publisher = CRE Online | url = http://www.creonline.com/mobile-home-park-star-ratings.html | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American college football ===
Recruits entering American [[college football]] are commonly ranked on a five-star scale, with five representing what scouts think will be the best college players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football-recruiting/2018/1/26/16936186/recruiting-stars-rankings-high-school-football|title=This is how rare it is to be a blue-chip college football recruit|work=SBNation.com|first=Alex|last= Kirshner|date=Jan 26, 2018|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2017-pro-bowl-rosters-do-recruiting-star-ratings-actually-predict-nfl-success/|title=2017 Pro Bowl rosters: Do recruiting star ratings actually predict NFL success?|work=CBS Sports|first= Ben|last= Kercheval|date=Dec 21, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport safety===
International organisations use a star rating to rank the safety of transportation.  [[EuroRAP]] have developed a Road Protection Score which is a scale for Star Rating roads for how well they protect the user from death or disabling injury when a crash occurs. The assessment evaluates the safety that is 'built into' the road through its design, in combination with the way traffic is managed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurorap.org/rps|title=What is Star Rating?|work=EuroRAP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316211923/http://www.eurorap.org/rps| archivedate=16 March 2008|dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RPS protocol has also been adapted and used by AusRAP, usRAP and iRAP.

[[EuroNCAP]] awards 'star ratings' based on the performance of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side and pole impacts, and impacts with pedestrians.

The United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) also uses a star ranking to rank the safety of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side, pole impacts, and rollovers, with 5 stars being the most secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings|title=Ratings|work=NHTSA|accessdate=November 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130185222/https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings|archive-date=November 30, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting and preferences===
Some [[Web content voting]] systems use five-star grades. This allows users to distinguish content more precisely than with binary "[[like button]]s".

Many [[recommender system]]s, such as [[MovieLens]] or [[Amazon.com]], ask people to express preferences using star ratings, then predict what other items those people are likely to enjoy. Predictions are often expressed in terms of the number of predicted stars.

==Unicode==
The [[Unicode]] Standard encodes several characters used for star ratings:&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16254-n4747-halfstars.pdf|title=L2/16-254: Final proposal to encode four half star symbols|date=12 September 2016|first1=Ken|last1=Shirriff|first2=Andrew|last2=West|authorlink2=Andrew West (linguist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org|title=Unicode character database|work=The Unicode Standard|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5439">The '''Symmachian forgeries''' are a sheaf of [[Forgery|forged documents]] produced in the papal [[curia]] of [[Pope Symmachus]] (498–514) in the beginning of the sixth century, in the same cycle that produced the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]''.{{refn|[[Ignaz von Döllinger|Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger]], ''Die Papst-Fabeln des Mittelalters'' 1890:57ff; [[Louis Duchesne]] and Friedrich Maassen, ''Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des Canonischen Rechts'', vol. I 1870:798ff; W. T. Townsend, "The so-called Symmachian Forgeries", ''The Journal of Religion'' '''13'''.2 (April 1933:165-174): Townsend made a plea that these "reconstructions of history" were not ''intended'' as forgeries and that critics "have not given their first readers due credit for a saving sense of humor" (p. 165, 167), and identifies subjects of criticism as the supporters of [[Theoderic the Great|Theodoric]], namely [[Cassiodorus]], [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|archpresbyter Liberius]] and Faustus.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend does not precisely identify who Faustus was. One possibility is [[Anicius Acilius Aginantius Faustus]] ("Faustus ''albus''"), who is known to have served under [[Odoacer]], Theodoric's immediate predecessor. Theodoric wrote a letter to one Faustus, ''[[Praepositus sacri cubiculi|praepositus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/481294 |title=The So-called Symmachian Forgeries |first=W. T. |last=Townsend |website=[[University of Chicago]] |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of the conflict between partisans of Symmachus and [[Antipope Laurentius]] the purpose of these ''[[Libellus|libelli]]'' was to further papal pretensions of the independence of the [[Bishops of Rome]] from criticisms and judgment of any ecclesiastical tribunal, putting them above law clerical and secular by supplying spurious documents supposedly of an earlier age. "During the dispute between Pope St. Symmachus and the [[Antipope Laurentius|anti-pope Laurentius]]," the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reports, "the adherents of Symmachus drew up four apocryphal writings called the 'Symmachian Forgeries'. ... The object of these forgeries was to produce alleged instances from earlier times to support the whole procedure of the adherents of Symmachus, and, in particular, the position that the Roman bishop could not be judged by any court composed of other bishops."&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|prescript=|title=Pope St. Symmachus|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14377a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their editor [[Louis Duchesne]] divided them in two groups, a group produced in the heat of the conflict involving Symmachus and a later group. Among writings to support Symmachus, ''Gesta de Xysti purgatione'' narrated a decision by [[Pope Sixtus III|Sixtus III]], who cleared his name from defamation and permanently excommunicated the offender; ''Gesta de Polychronii episcopi Hierosolynitani accusatione'' concerned a purely apocryphal [[Simony|simonical]] [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]] "Polychronius", who claimed Jerusalem as the first see and his supremacy over other bishops;  ''Gesta Liberii papae'' concerned mass baptisms carried out by [[Pope Liberius]] during his exile from the seat of Peter; ''[[Pseudo-Council of Sinuessa|Sinuessanae synodi]] gesta de Marcellino'' recounted the accusation brought against [[Pope Marcellinus]], that in the company of the Emperor [[Diocletian]] he had offered incense to the pagan gods, making the point that when Marcellinus eventually confessed to the misdeed it was declared that the pope had [[papal renunciation|condemned himself]], since no one had ever judged the pontiff, because the first see will not be judged by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 1933:168–171.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most important in this group of forgeries was ''Silvestri constitutum'', a report of a fictitious synod convoked by [[Pope Sylvester I|Pope Sylvester]], giving twenty promulgated canons, among which was a prohibition of bringing a solitary accusation upon an ecclesiastic of a degree higher than the accuser's: a bishop might only be accused by seventy-two, and a pope could not be accused by anyone. ''Silvestri constitutum'' was also an early instance of the fable that Sylvester had cured [[Constantine the Great]] of [[leprosy]] with the waters of [[baptism]], incurring the Emperor's abject gratitude, which was elaborated and credited to the point that, in greeting [[Pope Stephen II]] in 753, [[Pepin II]] dismounted to lead the Pope's horse to his palace on foot, as Constantine would have done.&lt;ref&gt;This anecdote itself is reported in the ''Vita Stefani'' of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', a source concerned to maintain papal ''auctoritas''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, somewhat later group centers on the figure of Sylvester, who accepts the decree of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] on the [[Easter controversy|date of Easter]]. One of these forgeries reports a fictitious synod convoking 275 bishops in the [[Baths of Trajan]]; several canons exalt the position of the cleric.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 1933:171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of Korea''''' (영문 디지털 한국백과사전) – a part of the [[Australian National University|Open Research Library]] Digital Collections &lt;ref&gt;[https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/10445]&lt;/ref&gt;– is the first comprehensive [[English language]] [[encyclopedia]] of Korea that covers multifarious fields of information on [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Asian Library Resources of Australia [http:// www.alra.org.au/newslwtter /No.68/July/2016/ "The First comprehensive  Encyclopedia on  [[Korea]] Written in English"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty Koreanists  worldwide contributed some 1300 entries.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Library Resources of Australia [http://www.alra.org.au/Newsletter/No.68/July/2016/ "The Encyclopaedia was reviewed and mounted as an ANU open access digital collection in 2011"]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Korean scholars contributed about 30 per cent and 70 per cent were from Koreanists  including [[Martina Deuchler]], David R. McCann, [[James Palais]], Keith Howard, [[James Hoare]] and others from mainly English-speaking countries. Of the minor entries, many are English translations from the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Korean Culture]]'' (''Han’guk munhwa taepaeggwa sajon'') and relevant Japanese and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] sources.

The contributors’ names are recorded in the ‘List of Contributors and Translators’ and also at the end of the entry itself, complete with bibliographical references for further readings. The ‘Index of Entries’ is extensive (about 120 pages), and its contents include the entries in both [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] and English.

The ''Encyclopaedia'' is aimed at meeting a wide assembly of interest from academics, broadcasters, journalists, politicians, students, teachers and the general public, who want to know more about Korea in the English language.

The encyclopaedia has about 1500 pages. Korean words are Romanized according to the McCune–Reischauer Romanization System, with some minor exceptions. Overall Statistics (ANU Open Research Library Statistic for "Encyclopaedia of Korea") available since the ''Encyclopaedia'' became part of the ANU's Open Access Digital Collection in 2011, there have been 4,918+ views and 12,002+ downloads of whole and part articles.

'''''The Literature of Australian Birds''''' is a book published in 1954 by Paterson Brokensha in [[Perth, Western Australia]].  Its full title is '''''The Literature of Australian Birds: A History and a Bibliography of Australian Ornithology'''''.  It was authored by [[Hubert Whittell|Hubert Massey Whittell]].  It is in large [[octavo]] format (252 x 184&amp;nbsp;mm) and contains some 900 pages, two separately paginated parts bound in one volume in brown buckram.  It contains a coloured frontispiece (Plate 1) of a drawing of the [[superb lyrebird]] by Lieutenant-General [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]] from 1799, with another 31 [[black-and-white]] plates bound between Parts 1 and 2.

Part 1, titled “A History of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1850”, is 116 pages in length.  It covers the period from the exploratory Dutch voyages of the early 17th century to the voyages of [[HMS Fly (1831)|HMS ''Fly'']] and [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']] during 1842-1850.  Much the larger part of the book, however, lies in the 788 pages of Part 2, titled “A Bibliography of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1950, with Biographies of Authors, Collectors and Others”, where Whittell has attempted to be exhaustively comprehensive in compiling mentions of Australian birds, not only from the scientific literature but also from newspapers, magazines and other published sources, and including potted biographies of their authors.  The two parts of the book are dedicated separately, Part 1: "To [[Dominic Serventy|D.L.S.]] in Appreciation of our long Association in Australian Ornithology", and Part 2: "In Memoriam. [[Gregory Mathews|GREGORY MACALISTER MATHEWS C.B.E.]]. A Pioneer Bibliographer of the Literature of Australian Birds. OBIT 1947."&lt;ref&gt;Whittell (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

A facsimile edition was published by Oak Knoll Press in 1993 ({{ISBN|1888262680}}).  In 1995 the [[Bird Observers Club of Australia]] (BOCA) published BOCA Report Number 6 – “Whittell (1618-1950) Supplemented. Additions and Emendations to H.M. Whittell’s The Literature of Australian Birds”, compiled by Tess Kloot.  In the preface to this latter work Kloot comments, with regard to Whittell:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”In his monumental work, ''The Literature of Australian Birds'', (Paterson Brokensha Pty Ltd, 1954), the late Major H. M. Whittell paid tribute to those who went before him : In 1925 [[Gregory Mathews|Gregory M. Mathews]] issued, as a supplement to his ''Birds of Australia'', a bibliography of books and articles studied in the preparation of his work, plus brief biographical notes on the authors; and in 1935 Anthony Musgrave published his ''Bibliography of Australian Entomology 1775-1930''. In turn, I can do no better than pay tribute to Major Whittell. With his book constantly before me as I worked, I never ceased to wonder at his exhaustive research and meticulous attention to detail. It is indeed a remarkable achievement. I offer this modest contribution (and later, ''A Bio-bibliography of Australian Ornithology: 1951-1975'') in the hope that others who come after me will build upon my work.”&lt;ref&gt;Kloot (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">'''The Power of Poison''' is an immersive [[Science museum|science exhibit]] designed by the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]. The exhibit explores poison’s roles in nature, health, history, literature, and myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Power of Poison" is Fall's Special Exhibition|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/news-posts/fall-s-special-exhibition-is-the-power-of-poison|publisher=AMNH|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show attempts to unify various studies prevalent with the museum's research facilities in order to illustrate the fluidity between the fields. It was designed by the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]].

==Layout==
The exhibit has four major sections, each highlighting poison as viewed by a different branch of science.

'''Biology'''
*Poison Alive
The exhibit opens with three small live animals, showing poison as a universal characteristic of the biosphere.
*The Chocó Rainforest
Ascending a small platform, visitors enter a lengthy walkthrough diorama of Colombia’s dense Chocó lowland forest. As visitors walk through the rainforest, they encounter specimens that utilize poison in their daily lives. The purpose of the section is to examine poison in a context of multiple evolutionary strategies—including linked variations in the strength of a predator’s poison and the resistance of its prey.

'''Anthropology'''
*Myths and Legends
Exiting the forest, visitors find themselves in a fairytale-like series of dioramas depicting poison in mythology. These include [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Grimm's Folktales]], [[Alice in Wonderland]] and [[Macbeth]]. Curated by the museum's social sciences departments, a selection of prominent historical artifacts are incorporated into the dioramas, revealing ways humans have imagined the presence of poisons. These, in the words of the designers, are meant to show "the potent power of poison as a longstanding motif in fairy tales, legends, and children’s stories."
*Poison in History
A winding gallery takes visitors past life-sized models of some of history's most famous poisonings, such as Mozart's supposed death, Cleopatra’s snakebite and Napoleon’s poisoning by arsenic.

'''Forensics'''
*Dissecting Poison Theater
The "Dissecting Poison Theater" is a live show that describes how forensic anthropologists can detect poison. Visitors explore a real-world poisoning case that highlights advances in toxicology and forensics since the 19th century. This section is tied in with an iPad game, where visitors can solve their own forensic mystery.

'''Health Sciences'''
*Poison by Accident
This section uses three large forced perspective dioramas to tell stories about poison's dangerous and mercurial nature.
*Poison as Cure
The exhibit's finale takes guests through a diorama illustrating natural poisons that can ameliorate cancer, quinsy, laryngitis, croup, and other global health problems.

'''''Where Once We Walked''''' (full title: ''Where Once We Walked: A Guide to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in The Holocaust''), compiled by noted [[genealogist]] [[Gary Mokotoff]] and [[Sallyann Amdur Sack]], is a [[gazetteer]] of 37,000 town names in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] focusing on those with [[Jewish people|Jewish]] populations in the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries and most of whose Jewish communities were almost or completely destroyed during [[The Holocaust]].

== Overview ==
The book includes a [[cross-reference]]d listing of some 23,000 towns (plus [[Cities' alternative names|alternate names]]), with the contemporary spelling being primary, associated country (according to contemporary borders), orientation and distance in kilometers from the country's [[capital city]], and [[map coordinates]]. The main list is followed by an additional listing organized according to a [[phonetic]] index based on the [[Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokotoff|first1=Gary|authorlink1=Gary Mokotoff|last2=Amdur Sack|first2=Sallyann|title=Where Once We Walked: A Guide to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in the Holocaust|url= |edition=first|year=1991|publisher=Avotaynu|location=Teaneck, N.J.|isbn=0-9626373-1-9|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revised edition ==
A second, revised edition (2002), expanded with additional entries and alternate names, provides updated spellings reflecting current geopolitical naming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokotoff|first1=Gary|authorlink1=Gary Mokotoff|last2=Amdur Sack|first2=Sallyann|title=Where Once We Walked: A Guide to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in the Holocaust|url= |edition=second, revised|year=2002|publisher=Avotaynu|location=Bergenfield, N.J.|isbn=1-886223-15-7|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Judaica Librarianship'' called ''Where Once We Walked'', "the de facto print gazetteer of the [[Shtetl|shtetlekh]] of the [[Pale of Settlement]]."&lt;ref name="DwoskinUpdate"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dwoskin |first1=Beth |title=Genealogy in the Jewish Library: An Update |journal=JJudaica Librarianship |date=2009 |volume=15 |page=13 |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/876181053/F71FB64C2C564715PQ/2?accountid=10226 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
