'''Amarna Miller''' (born 29 October 1990) is a Spanish former [[adult film]] actress, producer, director and writer, her real name is Marina.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jotdown.es/2014/12/amarna-miller-me-parece-hipocrita-que-se-omita-el-sexo-en-todas-las-obras-supuestamente-artisticas/ |title=Amarna Miller: "Me parece hipócrita que se omita el sexo en todas las obras supuestamente artísticas" |first=Kiko |last=Amat |date=29 December 2014 |access-date=17 October 2015 |magazine=Jot Down Cultural Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller, whose stage name comes from an Egyptian archaeological site [[Amarna]] and the writer [[Henry Miller]], graduated in [[fine art]]s from the [[European University of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ecoteuve.eleconomista.es/ecoteuve/prensa/noticias/6248803/11/14/La-actriz-de-cine-X-Amarna-Miller-desnuda-en-la-portada-de-Interviu.html |title=La actriz de cine X Amarna Miller, desnuda en la portada de 'Interviú' |date=16 November 2014 |access-date=5 August 2018 |newspaper=[[El Economista (Spain)|El Economista]] |publisher=Ecoprensa, [[Sociedad Anónima|SA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is openly [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] and practices [[BDSM]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Career ==
Miller joined the [[adult film]] industry at 19 years-old, producing her first adult film and working on her own film production company called Omnia-X for five years.&lt;ref name="entrevista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnecruda.es/2015/05/28/porno-swing-y-otros-placeres-de-la-carne-2/|title=Amarna Miller: mucho más que porno|author=carecruda|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has appeared in over 100 adult films according to [[IAFD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=amarnamiller/gender=f/amarna-miller.htm|title=Amarna Miller in IAFD|author=IAFD}}&lt;/ref&gt; working for adult film studios such as [[Private Media Group|Private]], [[Marc Dorcel|Dorcel]], [[Bang Bros]], Blacked or Sex Art, as well as filming erotic, artistic and self-managed films with Four Chambered Heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5383062/|title=Amarna Miler|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also collaborating in the magazines ''PlayGround'', ''Primera Línea'' and on the Orgasmatrix website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnamiller.com/#about|title=Página Oficial|author=Amarna Miller|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a supporter of [[feminist pornography]], she acknowledges that she works in "an industry made by and for men" and that "if I only shot feminist porn, I would not pay half a bill”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/10/05/catalunya/1475688811_276538.html|title=Amarna Miller in El Pais|author=El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept widely used by her is ethical pornography, based on respect for actors and actresses: salary, contracts, working conditions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orgasmatrix.com/entrevista-amarna-miller/|title=Entrevistamos a Amarna Miller|author=Orgasmatrix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Primera Persona Festival of 2015 explained that these rights are not respected, only the [[United States]] has mechanisms of control and complaint of these situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE9uPP62Ipc&amp;t=3s&amp;list=PLqBgWUE-rsypVghi_Tsb3uDIqgXmUkKHf&amp;index=15|title=Amarna Miller in Primera Persona|author=Primera Persona Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the spokeswoman and protagonist of the controversial promotional spot of the Erotic Salon of Barcelona 2016. The advertisement, called ''Patria'' and awarded with a Silver Lion at the [[Cannes Lions]] festival, criticizes Spanish [[double standard]] and ends with the phrase "We live in a disgustingly hypocritical country, but some of us do not give up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20160928/41639259997/actriz-porno-amarna-miller-musa-salon-erotico-barcelona-2016.html|title=Amarna Miller in SEB|author=SEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, she starred in her first feature film called ''Contigo no, bicho'' directed by Álvaro Alonso and Miguel Ángel Jiménez, which premiered at the [[Málaga Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2017-03-26/amarna-miller-contigo-no-bicho-festival-de-malaga-porno_1352039/|title=Amarna Miller in the Málaga Film Festival|author=El cofidencial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2018 she has a [[Patreon]] page, a [[crowdfunding]] site that allows her to subsidize her videos and activities, rewarding her followers with exclusive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/AmarnaMiller/overview|title=Amarna Miller in Patreon|author=Amarna Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she has not said a definite goodbye to pornography, she has stopped shooting voluntarily since the beginning of 2017 because it is no longer a challenge and she wants to live new experiences. She is aware of the difficulty of this new path due to the stigma she suffers from having devoted herself to [[sex work]], according to her own words "I will always be the porn actress who...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/entrevista-amarna-miller.html|title=Amarna Miller in Diario Publico|author=Diario Publico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, she held a talk with the deputies of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] Beatriz Gimeno and Clara Serra titled "Sex, porn and feminism" in which she said that pornography can not be used for [[sex education]], but her presence in this talk was not well received by some feminist sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnamiller.com/cosas-interesantes/sexo-porno-y-feminismo-una-charla-con-beatriz-gimeno-y-clara-serra|title=Porn and Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a talk again with Clara Serra in 2017, this time accompanied by the pornographic actor Aday Traun, at the [[Charles III University of Madrid]] titled "Pornography and diversity" in which she criticized some [[clichés]] of the pornographic industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQmEj_ley6U|title=Porn and diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dialectos español de Perú y Ecuador.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Dialectal map of [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. '''Andean Spanish''' is in red.]]

'''Andean Spanish''' is a dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in the central [[Andes]], from western [[Venezuela]], southern [[Colombia]], with influence as far south as northern [[Chile]] and Northwestern [[Argentina]], passing through [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]]. It is influenced principally by [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]] and [[Andalusian Spanish]], which is favoured in the cities, but in rural areas and some cities, there is influence of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous languages]].

==Phonology==
* In Andean Spanish, the {{IPA|/s/}} is never aspirated in the final position and so is pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}, not {{IPA|[h]}}, but it is sometimes pronounced apical, rather than laminal,&lt;ref name=Lip320&gt;{{cite book |title= Latin American Spanish|last= Lipski|first= John|authorlink= |year= 1994|publisher= Longman Publishing|location= New York|isbn= |page= 320|pages= |accessdate=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a trait characteristic of Northern Spain. The latter sound is transitional between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, unique in the Americas, and it is associated with a large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean region.
* As in every other American dialects, Andean Spanish has ''[[seseo]]'' ({{IPA|/θ/}} is not distinguished from {{IPA|/s/}}). Thus, ''casa'' ("house") and ''caza'' ("hunt") are homophones. However, in [[Cusco Region]], many speakers realize {{IPA|/s/}} as {{IPA|[θ]}} in some words, particularly in ''once, doce, trece''.&lt;ref name=Lip320 /&gt; ''Seseo'' is common to all of America, the Canary Islands, and several areas in southern Spain.
* Especially in the Ecuadorian variant, coda {{IPA|/s/}} is often voiced to {{IPAblink|z}} before a vowel or before a voiced consonant (including sonorants), but the latter is also a feature of most other Spanish dialects. In the Peruvian variant, it is palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}}.
* In Bolivia, Ecuador, and southern Peru, {{IPAslink|ʎ}} and {{IPAslink|ʝ}} do not merge (lack of [[yeísmo]]).
* Often the vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are merged because of the influence of the trivocal system of Quechua and Aymara.
*{{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} are assibilated to {{IPAblink|r̝}} and {{IPAblink|ɾ̞}}, respectively.
*{{IPA|/x/}} is velar {{IPAblink|x}} rather than glottal {{IPAblink|h}}.
*{{IPA|/f/}} is realised as bilabial {{IPAblink|ɸ}}, the same one that adds an epenthetic {{IPA|/w/}} is often confused with {{IPA|/x/}}.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}
*Emphasis is given to the consonants but the vowels are weakened, especially for unstressed syllables (like in [[Mexico]], but not as marked).
*Stress is or tends to be penultimate.

==Influence on nearby areas==
In northwest Argentina and northern Chile today, it is possible to say that there is a certain fusion in the dialects of both countries, but the local dialects are more dominant.

The Andean dialect can be heard in the northeast, with respect to the pronunciation and lexicon. The [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense dialect]] provides some of the pronunciation, a variety of modes, and the Argentine dialect.

Rioplatense replaces the Andean use of "tú" as the second person singular familiar pronoun with "vos". It is very similar in Chile, but "tú" and "vos" are there both used as the singular familiar second-person pronoun. Also, there is influence of [[Chilean Spanish]] and some Andean Spanish.

His television roles include [[Danny Tanner]] on the ABC sitcom ''[[Full House]]'' (1987–95) and its Netflix sequel ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'', and hosting ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' from 1989 to 1997. Saget is also known for his [[Blue comedy|adult-oriented]] stand-up routine.&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Thomson Gale |title=Biography – Saget, Bob |year=2004 |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the voice of the future [[Ted Mosby]] on the CBS sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' from 2005 to 2014.

Saget's 2014 [[comedy album]], ''That's What I'm Talkin' About'', was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]].

== Early life ==
Saget was born in [[Philadelphia]] to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family. His father, Benjamin (August 28, 1917 – January 30, 2007),&lt;ref name="Benjamin M., Saget, supermarket chain senior executive; 89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/obituaries_20070216|title=Benjamin M., Saget, supermarket chain senior executive; 89|publisher=JewishJournal.com|date=2007-02-16|accessdate=2015-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113629/http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/obituaries_20070216|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a supermarket executive, and his mother, Rosalyn "Dolly" (February 12, 1925 – February 15, 2014),&lt;ref name="Rosalyn C.

Saget lived in [[California]] before moving back to Philadelphia and graduating from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bob Saget | publisher = film.com | url = http://www.film.com/celebrities/bob-saget/14646642 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914072843/http://www.film.com/celebrities/bob-saget/14646642 |archivedate=2008-09-14| accessdate = 2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldberg | first = Jennifer | title = Irreverent Bob Saget plays to full houses | work = Jewish News of Greater Phoenix Online | date = 2007-09-07 | url = http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070907+saget | accessdate = 2008-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205183022/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070907+saget | archivedate = 2008-12-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saget originally intended to become a [[Physician|doctor]], but his [[Honors course|Honors]] English teacher, Elaine Zimmerman, saw his creative potential and urged him to seek a career in films.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

Saget attended [[Temple University]]'s film school, where he created ''Through Adam's Eyes'', a [[black-and-white]] film about a boy who received reconstructive facial surgery and was honored with an award of merit in the [[Student Academy Awards]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/saa/winners/winners.pdf |title=Student Academy Awards Winners |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207061453/http://www.oscars.org/saa/winners/winners.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saget intended to take graduate courses at the [[University of Southern California]] but quit a few days later. Saget describes himself at the time in an article by Glenn Esterly in the 1990 ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'': "I was a cocky, overweight twenty-two-year-old. Then I had a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] taken out, almost died, and I got over being cocky or overweight."&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Bob-Saget-328690 "Bob Saget"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113093830/http://www.biography.com/articles/Bob-Saget-328690 |date=January 13, 2010 }}. Biography.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Saget talked about his burst appendix on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', saying that it happened on the [[Fourth of July]], at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] and that they at first just iced the area for seven hours before taking it out and finding that it had become gangrenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.

== Career ==

===1987–2001 ===
Following a short stint as a member of CBS' ''[[The Morning Program]]'' in early 1987, Saget was cast as [[Danny Tanner]] in ''[[Full House]]'', which became a success with family viewers, and landed in the [[Nielsen ratings]]' Top 30 beginning with season three. In 1989, Saget began as the host of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', a role he held until 1997. During the early 1990s, Saget worked both on ''Full House'' and ''AFV'' simultaneously. In 2009, he returned to ''AFV'' for the 20th-anniversary one-hour special co-hosted with [[Tom Bergeron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Snierson | first = Dan | title = Bob Saget returns to 'America's Funniest Home Videos' for 20th anniversary celebration | newspaper = Entertainment Weekly | date = September 16, 2008   | url =http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/09/16/bob-saget-returns-to-americas-funniest-home-videos-for-one-episode/ | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saget directed the 1996 ABC [[television movie]] ''[[For Hope]]'', which was inspired by the life story of his sister, Gay Saget, who died from [[scleroderma]] three years earlier.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

In 1998, Saget directed his first feature film, ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'', starring [[Norm Macdonald]] and [[Artie Lange]]. Released one year after he left his long-running role as host of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'', the film received broadly negative reviews from critics and earned low box office returns. However, it has since become a cult favorite, due partially to Artie Lange's later popularity on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' where the film is sometimes mentioned, often in unflattering terms.

In 1998, Saget made a [[cameo appearance]] as a [[cocaine]] addict in the stoner comedy ''[[Half Baked]]''.

===2001–present===
[[File:Bob_Saget_Traveling_Virus_Worcester_2006.jpg|thumb|right|Bob Saget on stage during the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2006)|Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]] in 2006]]
Saget had a sitcom on [[The WB]] titled ''[[Raising Dad]]''. It co-starred [[Kat Dennings]], [[Brie Larson]], and [[Jerry Adler]] and lasted only one season.

Saget was host of NBC's game show ''[[1 vs. 100 (U.S. game show)|1 vs. 100]]'' from 2006 to 2008.

Saget served as the voice of the future [[Ted Mosby]], who narrated the [[CBS]] [[sitcom]] ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', which premiered on September 19, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Harnick, Chris (April 11, 2014). [http://www.eonline.com/news/530959/bob-saget-reveals-what-he-really-thought-about-the-how-i-met-your-mother-series-finale "Bob Saget Reveals What He Really Thought About the ''How I Met Your Mother'' Series Finale"]. [[E! Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[HBO]] comedy special, ''That Ain't Right'', came out on DVD on August 28, 2007. It is dedicated to his father, Ben Saget, who died at age 89 on January 30, 2007, due to complications from congestive heart failure.

From 2005 to 2010, Saget had a recurring role in four episodes of the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' playing a parody of himself. He would later appear in the 2015 feature film based on the series.

[[File:Bob Saget.jpg|thumb|left|Saget performing in 2007]]
Saget wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Farce of the Penguins]]'', a parody of 2005's ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', which was released [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]], in January 2007.

Saget appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'' for a limited four-month engagement. He played "Man in Chair" while [[Jonathan Crombie]], who normally played the character on Broadway, was with the national tour of the musical. On January 4, 2008, Saget's [[caricature]] was unveiled at [[List of caricatures at Sardi's restaurant|Sardi's Restaurant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=24093 "Photo Coverage: Bob Saget Receives Sardi's Portrait"]. BroadwayWorld.com. January 7, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109024550/http://my.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=24093 |date=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, he debuted in a new sitcom along with his co-star [[Cynthia Stevenson]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] called ''[[Surviving Suburbia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=020409_02 "ABC Announces New Sitcom 'Surviving Suburbia'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221234828/http://www.abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=020409_02 |date=February 21, 2009 }}. ABC.com. Press Release. February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The series, which was originally to air on [[The CW]], ended after one abbreviated season.

In 2010, Saget starred in an [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] series ''Strange Days'' in which he follows others in different activities and lifestyles, documenting their adventures in unusual ways.

In 2014, his book ''Dirty Daddy'' was released, in which Saget writes about his career, comedy influences, and experiences with life and death. He embarked on a small tour in support of the book, including the [[Pemberton Music Festival]], where he introduced [[Snoop Dogg]] prior to performing his own set. In the same year, he toured [[Australia]] for the first time, with a stand-up show called ''Bob Saget Live: The Dirty Daddy Tour''. The show was performed in the major cities of [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], and [[Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/books-magazines/bob-saget-reveals-in-his-memoir-dirty-daddy-what-really-went-on-behind-the-scenes-of-full-house/news-story/d7152b28213f4221e975b7bfa5a3e7a9|title=Bob Saget: Secrets from Full House|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, he guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[Grandfathered (TV series)|Grandfathered]]'', starring and produced by his ''Full House'' co-star, [[John Stamos]].

== Charity work ==
Saget is currently a board member of the [[Scleroderma Research Foundation]]. His [[scleroderma]] efforts have further benefited such celebrities as ''[[Scary Movie (film series)|Scary Movie]]'' star [[Regina Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abilitymagazine.com/regina-hall.html |title=Regina Hall Discusses Scleroderma |work=Ability Magazine |issue="Regina Hall Issue" |date=April–May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Ability (magazine)|''Ability Magazine'']], Saget discussed how his sister was diagnosed with scleroderma at 43 and died at 47. Before that, she had been misdiagnosed many times. {{blockquote|"Unfortunately, rheumatologists in a lot of places don’t have very many scleroderma patients come through their labs, and no one knew what to do with her. I wish I’d known then what I know now." Because of this, Saget is involved in fundraising efforts towards finding a cure for the disease, saying, "There’s also a Scleroderma Foundation, and we’re separate from them, but one of the Scleroderma Foundation board heads is also on the Scleroderma Research Foundation board. We're all basically trying to cure the same thing. Our organization has raised $25 million for research. Our chairman, Luke Evnin, is an amazing man and lives up in San Francisco with his wife, Deann Wright. They’re both brilliant scientists and doctors. Dana Delany’s on the board, Caryn Zucker, Kristen Baker Bellamy, who lost her mother to scleroderma, and is married to Bill Bellamy. Robin Williams worked our first benefit. A number of celebrities sign on, which helps to give the disease a higher profile. As you may know, Regina, a significant number of the people who get scleroderma are African-American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Bob-Saget.html|title=Bob Saget Interview with Regina Hall and Chet Cooper|work=Ability Magazine |issue="Bob Saget Issue" |date=April–May 2011 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="103346">[[Chewa language|Chichewa]] (a [[Bantu language]] of Central Africa, also known as Chewa, Nyanja, or Chinyanja) is the main language spoken in south and central [[Malawi]], and to a lesser extent in Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Like most other Bantu languages, it is [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]; that is to say, pitch patterns are an important part of the pronunciation of words. Thus, for example, the word ''ch&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;manga'' (high-low-low) "maize" can easily be distinguished from ''chinangw&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' (low-low-high) "cassava" not only by its consonants but also by its pitch pattern.

Tones (the rises and falls in pitch) also play an important grammatical role in Chichewa verbs, helping to distinguish one tense from another. They also play a part in intonation and phrasing and in distinguishing statements from questions.

Most nouns have either one high tone (usually on one of the last three syllables) or none, although a few nouns (mostly compounds) have two tones. Verbs also usually have no more than one tone per morpheme. Chichewa thus in some respects can be considered to be a [[pitch-accent language]] with a "mixture of accentual and tonal properties".&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 132–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specialists, notably [[Larry Hyman]], however, have argued that the term "pitch-accent language" is an over-simplification and should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He considers it best to consider such languages simply as one variety of [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]].

==Overview==
===Lexical tones===
====Nouns====
Certain syllables in Chichewa words are associated with high pitch. Usually there is one high pitch per word or morpheme, but some words have no high tone. In nouns the high pitch is usually in one of the last three syllables:&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ch'''í'''manga'' 'maize'
*''chik'''ó'''ndi'' 'love'
*''chinangw'''á''''' 'cassava'

In a few nouns (often compound words) there are two high tones. If these tones are separated by only one unaccented syllable, they usually join in a plateau of three high-toned syllables; that is, HLH becomes HHH:
*''chiz'''ó'''lowez'''í''''' 'habit'
*''b'''í'''rím'''á'''nkhwe'' 'chameleon'
*''g'''á'''l'''í'''moto'' 'car'
*''ts'''á'''ból'''á''''' 'pepper'

In addition there are a large number of nouns which have no high tone, but which, even when focussed or emphasised, are pronounced with all the syllables low (as in the word ''station'' in the English phrase ''police station''):
*''chipatala'' 'hospital'
*''mkaka'' 'milk'

Because there is usually only one high tone per morpheme, it can be considered as a kind of tonal accent (see [[Pitch-accent language]]).&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1988), pp. 51ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from a stress-accent such as in English in that it always retains the same pitch contour (e.g. high-low, never low-high). It is also possible for an accent to contrast with a lack of accent:
*''mt'''é'''ngo'' 'tree'
*''mtengo'' 'price'

====Verbs====
Verbal roots too can have a lexical tone, but only on the final vowel ''-a'' of the verb. Most verbs, however, are toneless:
*''thandiza'' 'help'
*''thamang'''á''''' 'run'

The tones are not inherited from proto-Bantu, but appear to be an independent development in Chichewa.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 122f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosyllabic verbs are always toneless:
*''-dya'' 'eat'

Often a verb has a tone not because the root has one but because a stative or intensive suffix is added to it:
*''dziwa'' 'know'
*''dziwik'''á''''' 'be known'

===Grammatical tones===
One of the main features of the Chichewa verb system is that each tense is associated with one of about eight different tonal patterns; there are different patterns again when the verb is in a relative clause or is negative.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, L.J. and Al Mtenje (2017), ''The Phonology of Chichewa'' (OUP), [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198724742.001.0001/oso-9780198724742-chapter-7 Chapter 7].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the present simple (near future) is accented on the initial syllable, the remote perfect on the tense-marker ''-na-'', the present continuous on the syllable following the tense-marker ''-ku-'', the present habitual on the initial and penultimate, the remote imperfect on the tense-marker ''-k'''á'''-'' and the penultimate, the subjunctive on the final, the perfect is toneless, and so on:
*''nd'''í'''-fotokoza'' 'I will explain'
*''ndi-n'''á'''-fotokoza'' 'I explained (yesterday)'
*''ndi-ku-f'''ó'''tokoza'' 'I am explaining'
*''nd'''í'''-ma-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I (usually) explain'
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I used to explain'
*''ndi-fotokoz'''é''''' 'I should explain'
*''nd-a-fotokoza'' 'I have explained'

These tonal patterns apply (with minor modifications) whether the verb is long or short. In some dialects it is common in longer verbs to hear tonal spreading, so that for example the first verb above is heard as ''nd'''í'''fótokoza'' and the second as ''ndin'''á'''fótokoza''. However, in the present habitual, the first tone does not spread. Tones will also spread, even in shorter verbs, when a verb is followed by an object, except for the subjunctive ''-é''.

Negative verbs have different tonal patterns. For example, the negative infinitive, negative subjunctive, negative "not yet" tense, and negative future all have a single tone on the penultimate syllable. This tone causes all the other tones, such as the tone of the negative-marker ''sí'', to be omitted:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''si-ndi-dza-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I am not going to explain (at some future time)'

When used in a relative clause, several tenses have a different intonation. Usually there is an extra accent on the first syllable, and often another on the penultimate:
*'''''á-'''nk'''á'''-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'who used to explain'

When the verb-root itself has a tone, this can be heard on the final vowel. However, if the tense has a penultimate or final accent, the tone cannot be heard:
*''nd-a-thamang'''á''''' 'I have run'
*''ndi-ku-th'''á'''máng'''á''''' 'I am running' (with a plateau)
*''nd'''í'''-ma-tham'''á'''nga'' 'I usually run' (final tone deleted)

===Intonational tones===
Lexical and grammatical tones are not the only tones heard in a Chichewa sentence, but there are intonational tones as well. One common tone  is a boundary tone rising from low to high which is heard whenever there is a pause in the sentence, for example after a topic or subordinate clause.

Tones are also added to questions. For example, the toneless word ''kuti'' 'where?' becomes ''k'''ú'''ti'' in the following question:
*''kw'''á'''nu ndi k&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;ti?'' 'where is your home?'

Further details of intonational tones are given below.

==How tones are pronounced==
[[File:Pitchtrack_of_sentence_'anadyetsa_nyani_nsomba'.jpg|thumb|right|Pitch-track of the sentence ''anádyétsa nyaní nsómba'' 'they fed the baboon (with) fish' recorded by Al Mtenje (from Downing et al. (2004))]]

The accompanying illustration&lt;ref&gt;Downing et al. (2004), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; shows the pitch-track of the following sentence:
*''an'''á'''dyétsa nyan'''í''' ns'''ó'''mba'' 'they fed the baboon (some) fish'

The first word, ''an'''á'''dyétsa'' 'they fed', has an accent theoretically on the antepenultimate syllable. However, in this example, the peak (high point) of the accent does not coincide with the syllable but is delayed, giving the impression that it has spread to two syllables. This process is known as "tone doubling" or "peak delay", and is usual whenever a verb is followed by an object.

The second word, ''nyan'''í''''' 'baboon', has an accent on the final syllable, but as usually happens with final accents, it has spread backwards to the penultimate syllable, showing a nearly level or gently rising contour, with only the initial ''n'' being low-pitched. Another feature of a final accent is that it tends not to be very high.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Louw (1987), vol. 3, pp. 22, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

If it comes at the end of a sentence a final-tone word such as ''nyaní'' can optionally be pronounced as ''nyăni'' with a rising tone on the penultimate and the final syllable low. But if a suffix is added, the stress moves to the new penultimate, and the word is pronounced with a full-height tone: ''nyan'''í'''-yo'' 'that baboon'.&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1983), p. 206; Mtenje (1986), p. 206; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 20; Louw (1987), vol. 3, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third word, ''ns'''ó'''mba'' 'fish', has penultimate accent. Since the word ends the sentence, the tone falls from high to low.

Another point shown in the voice track is that the first accent is higher than the second. This is normal in declarative sentences and is known as [[downdrift]]. But when two tones come together, as in ''nyan'''í''' ns'''ó'''mba'', there is no downdrift.

The intensity reading at the top shows that the intensity (loudness) is greatest on the penultimate syllable of each word.

==Number of tones==
Two pitch levels, high and low, conventionally written H and L, are usually considered to be sufficient to describe the tones of Chichewa.&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chichewa itself the high tone is called ''mngóli wókwéza'' ('tone of raising'), and the low tone ''mngóli wótsítsa'' ('tone of lowering').&lt;ref&gt;Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja (c.2000), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Kulemeka (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; add a mid-height tone but most do not, but consider a mid-height tone to be merely an allophone of nearby high tones.

From a theoretical point of view, however, it has been argued that Chichewa tones are best thought of not in terms of H and L, but in terms of H and Ø, that is to say, high-toned vs toneless syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that H tones are much more dynamic than L tones and play a large role in tonal phenomena, whereas L-toned syllables are relatively inert.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tones are not marked in the standard orthography used in Chichewa books and newspapers, but linguists usually indicate a high tone by writing it with an acute accent, as in the first syllable of ''ns'''ó'''mba''. The low tones are generally left unmarked.

==Works describing Chichewa tones==
The earliest work to mark the tones of Chichewa words was the Afro-American scholar [[Mark Hanna Watkins]]' ''A Grammar of Chichewa'' (1937). This was a pioneering work, since not only was it the first work on Chichewa to include tones, but it was also the first grammar of any African language to be written by an American.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; The informant used by Watkins was the young [[Hastings Banda|Kamuzu Banda]], who in 1966 was to become the first President of the Republic of Malawi.

Another grammar including Chichewa tones was a handbook written for [[Peace Corps]] Volunteers, [[Earl Stevick|Stevick]] et al., ''Chinyanja Basic Course'' (1965), which gives very detailed information on the tones of sentences, and also indicates intonations.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick, Earl et al. (1965) [http://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/Chinyanja/Fsi-ChinyanjaBasicCourse-StudentText.pdf ''Chinyanja Basic Course''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307012900/https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/Chinyanja/Fsi-ChinyanjaBasicCourse-StudentText.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, Scotton and Orr (1980) ''Learning Chichewa'',&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980) [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED206157.pdf ''Learning Chichewa''].&lt;/ref&gt; is much less detailed. All three of these works are available on the Internet. J.K. Louw's ''Chichewa: A Practical Course'' (1987) [1980], which contained tone markings, is currently out of print.
 
From 1976 onwards a number of academic articles by Malawian and Western scholars have been published on different aspects of Chichewa tones. The most recent work discussing the tones of Chichewa is ''The Phonology of Chichewa'' (2017) by Laura Downing and Al Mtenje.

Four dictionaries also mark the tones on Chichewa words. The earliest of these was volume 3 of J.K. Louw's ''Chichewa: A Practical Course'' (1987) [1980]; ''A Learner's Chichewa-English, English-Chichewa Dictionary'' by Botne and Kulemeka (1991), the monolingual ''Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja/Chichewa'' (c.2000) produced by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi (available online),&lt;ref&gt;Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja (c.2000); Kishindo (2001), pp. 277-79; Kamwendo (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Common Bantu On-Line Chichewa Dictionary'' (2001) formerly published online by the University of California in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="Mtenje 2001"&gt;Mtenje (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

So far all the studies which have been published on Chichewa tones have dealt with the Malawian variety of the language. There is no published information available on the tones of Chinyanja spoken in Zambia and Mozambique.

==Some tonal phenomena==
In order to understand Chichewa tones, it is necessary first to understand various tonal phenomena that can occur, which are briefly outlined below.

===Downdrift===
Normally in a Chichewa sentence, whenever tones come in the sequence HLH or HLLH, it is usual for the second high tone to be a little lower than the first one. So for example in the word ''n&lt;u&gt;d'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ma&lt;u&gt;p'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ta'' 'I usually go', the tone of ''ndí'' is pronounced a little higher than the tone of ''pí''. Thus generally speaking the highest tone in a sentence is the first one. This phenomenon, which is common in many Bantu languages, is known as '[[downdrift]]'&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1996); see also Myers (1999a).&lt;/ref&gt; or 'automatic downstep'.&lt;ref&gt;Yip (2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several exceptions to this rule. Downdrift does not occur, for example, when a speaker is asking a question,&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1996), pp. 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or reciting a list of items with a pause after each one, or sometimes if a word is pronounced on a high pitch for emphasis. There is also no downdrift in words like ''wápolísi'' 'policeman', where two high tones in the sequence HLH are bridged to make a plateau HHH (see below).

===High tone spreading ('HTS')===
In some dialects a high tone may sometimes spread to the following syllable; this is known as 'High Tone Spreading' or 'Tone Doubling'.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter term cf. Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; So where some speakers say ''ndin'''á'''thandiza'' 'I helped', others will say ''ndin&lt;u&gt;'''á'''thá&lt;/u&gt;ndiza''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Mtenje (1986), p. 240 vs. Mtenje (1987), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Some phoneticians argue that what happens here, in some cases at least, is that the highest part or 'peak' of the tone moves forward, giving the impression that the tone covers two syllables, a process called 'peak delay'.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1999b).&lt;/ref&gt; An illustration of peak delay can be seen clearly in the pitch-track of the word ''an'''á'''dyetsa'' 'they fed', here pronounced ''an&lt;u&gt;'''á'''dyé&lt;/u&gt;tsa'', in Downing et al. (2004).

In order for HTS to occur, there must be at least 3 syllables following the tone, although not necessarily in the same word.

One very frequent use of spreading, at least in some dialects, is to link together two words (such as verb + [[Object (grammar)|object]], or verb of motion + destination, or noun + possessive) into a single phrase. In transcriptions one frequently finds phrases such as ''kuph&lt;u&gt;'''í'''ká&lt;/u&gt; nyama'' 'to cook meat'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 59; Mchombo (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''kus&lt;u&gt;'''á'''má&lt;/u&gt;la mk'''á'''zi'' 'to care for a wife',&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1983), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ch&lt;u&gt;'''í'''má&lt;/u&gt;nga ch'''á'''nga'' 'my maize'&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1983), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; ''mik&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ngó&lt;/u&gt; iyo'' 'those lions'&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. in which the second tone in each phrase is not original but due to spreading. It should be noted, however, that the contexts where spreading occurs vary from one dialect to another.

There are some verbal forms in which spreading does not occur; for example, the first tone in the present habitual does not spread: ''nd'''í'''-ma-thand'''í'''za'' 'I usually help'. The tone on -''ngá''- and ''-má-'' in negative tenses such as ''&lt;u&gt;s'''í'''-ndí-m'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;-thandiza'' 'I never help' and ''si-ndi-ng'''á'''-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I can't help' also does not spread, although it may form a plateau with a 'bumped' tone: ''si-ndi-ng&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-wá-ph'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I can't kill them'.&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 193, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonal plateau===
It sometimes happens that the sequence HLH in Chichewa becomes HHH, making a tonal 'plateau'. A tonal plateau is common after the words ''á'' 'of' and ''ndí'' 'and':
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''pol'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;si'' 'policeman' (from ''w'''á''''' 'of' and ''pol'''í'''si'' 'police')
*''ch&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kudy'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'food' (from ''ch'''á''''' 'of' and ''kudy'''á''''' 'to eat')
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í''' Mal'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;wi'' 'and Malawi'

Before a pause the final tone may drop: ''ch&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kúdy&lt;/u&gt;a''. Sometimes a succession of tones is bridged in this way, e.g. ''g&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''lew'''á'''mk'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;lu'' 'masked dancer', with one long continuous high tone from ''gú'' to ''kú''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stevick et al. (1965), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another place where a plateau is found is after the initial high tone of subordinate clause verbs such as the following:
*''&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kuth'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'when he is helping'; 'who is helping'
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''tath'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'after I helped'

At the end of words, if the tones are HLH, a plateau is common:
*''mp&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''ngoz'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'mother-in-law'
*''kus&lt;u&gt;'''í'''yan'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'difference'

However, there are exceptions; for example, in the word ''ny'''é'''nyez'''í''''' 'star' the two tones are kept separate, so that the word is pronounced ''ny'''é'''nyēz'''ī''''' (where ''ī'' represents a slightly lower tone than ''í'').&lt;ref&gt;Louw, vol. 3, s.v. ''nyenyezi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequences with two or more toneless syllables between the high tones (e.g. HLLH) do not normally make a plateau in Chichewa. This also applies to words in which one of the syllables has been lost by contraction, such as:
*''s'''á'''naf'''é''''' (contracted from ''s'''í'''-á-na-f'''é''''') 'he didn't die'

===Tone shifting ('bumping')===
When a word or closely connected phrase ends in HHL or HLHL, there is a tendency in Chichewa for the second H to move to the final syllable of the word. This process is known as 'tone shifting'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), pp. 151-215.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'bumping'.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Local bumping'''

In one type of bumping (called 'local bumping') LHHL at the end of a word or phrase becomes LHHH (where the two tones are joined into a plateau): 
*''*nyumb&lt;u&gt;'''á''' y'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nga'' &gt; ''nyumb&lt;u&gt;'''á''' yáng'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'my house'
*''*kup&lt;u&gt;'''í'''t'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;-nso'' &gt; ''kup&lt;u&gt;'''í'''tá-ns'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to go again'
*''*ndink&lt;u&gt;'''á'''p'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ta'' &gt; ''ndink&lt;u&gt;'''á'''pít'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I used to go'
*''*an&lt;u&gt;'''á'''m'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;pha'' &gt; ''an&lt;u&gt;'''á'''múph'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'they killed him'
At the end of a sentence the final high tone may drop again, reverting the word to ''an'''á'''m'''ú'''pha''.

However, in certain verb tenses such as the Present Habitual when the tones are HHL, the penultimate tone is shifted to the final, but there is no plateau. Instead, the two tones are kept separate:
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;mady&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I eat'

There is no bumping in HHL words where the first syllable is derived from '''''á''''' 'of':
*''kw&lt;u&gt;'''á'''mb'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ri'' 'very much'

'''Non-local bumping'''

In another kind (called 'non-local bumping'), HLHL at the end of a word  or phrase changes to HLLH or, with spreading of the first high tone, HHLH:
*''*mb&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;zi y&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nga'' &gt; ''mb&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;zi ya&lt;u&gt;ng'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' (or ''mb&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''zí&lt;/u&gt; yang&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'') 'my goat' 
*''*b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nja l&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;nse'' &gt; ''b&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nja lons&lt;u&gt;'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the whole family'
*''*chim&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;dzim&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;dzi'' &gt; ''chim&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''&lt;/u&gt;dzimodz&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'in the same way'

Again, the Present Habitual is an exception, and when the tones are HLHL, bumping does not occur:
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;map&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ta'' 'I go'

'''Reverse bumping'''

A related phenomenon, but in reverse, is found when the addition of the suffix ''-tú'' 'really' causes a normally word-final tone to move back one syllable, so that LHH at the end of a word becomes HLH:
*''*ndipit&lt;u&gt;'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I should go' &gt; ''ndip&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;te-t&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'really I should go'
*''*chifukw&lt;u&gt;'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'because' &gt; ''chif&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;kwa-t&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'because in fact'

===Enclitic suffixes===
Certain suffixes, known as [[Clitic|enclitics]], add a high tone to the last syllable of the word to which they are joined. When added to a toneless word or a word ending in LL, this high tone can easily be heard. Bumping does not occur when the tones are HLHL:
*''Lilongwe'' &gt; ''Lilongw'''é'''-nso'' 'Lilongwe also'
*''akuth'''á'''ndiza'' &gt; ''akuth'''á'''ndiz'''á'''-be'' 'he's still helping'

But when an enclitic is combined with word which has penultimate high tone, there is local bumping, and the result is a triple tone: 
*''ns'''ó'''mba'' &gt; ''ns'''ó'''mbá-ns'''ó''''' 'the fish also'

When added to a word with final high tone, it raises the tone higher (in Central Region dialects, the rising tone on the first syllable of a word like ''nyŭmbá'' also disappears):&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nyumb'''á''''' &gt; ''nyumb'''á'''-nso'' 'the house also'

Not all suffixes are tonally enclitic in this way. For example, when added to nouns, locative suffixes (''-ko'', ''-po'', ''-mo'') do not add a tone, e.g.:
*''ku Lilongwe-ko'' 'there in Lilongwe'

However, when added to verbs, the same suffixes add an enclitic tone:
*''wachok'''á'''-po'' 'he's not at home' (lit. 'he has gone away from there')

===Proclitic prefixes===
====Proclitic tenses====
Conversely, certain prefixes transfer their high tone to the syllable which follows them. Prefixes of this kind are called 'proclitic'&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'post-accenting'. The following tenses have a proclitic prefix:

The infinitive:
*''ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'to help'

The Present Continuous, Recent Past, Recent Past Imperfective, and Immediate Imperative:
*''ndi-ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I am helping'
*''ndi-na-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I helped just now'
*''ndi-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I was helping'
*''ta-th'''á'''ndiza!'' 'help (now)!'&lt;ref name="Stevick et al. 1965, p. 111"&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Present and Perfect participial tenses:
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''-kú-th'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'while (I was/am) helping'
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''-tá-th'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'after I helped'

Verbal Adjective with ''-'''ó'''-'' (derived from '''''á''''' 'of' + the Infinitive): 
*''w'''ó'''-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'who helps'

Any tense with the infix ''-ngo-'' 'just'. But other prefixes used with ''-ngo-'' are no longer proclitic; instead, the accent goes on the prefix itself:
*''nda-ngo-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I have just helped'
*''ndi-k'''ú'''-ngo-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I'm just helping'
*''ndi-m'''á'''-ngo-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I was just helping'

====Proclitic object-markers====
Object-markers such as ''nd'''í'''-'' 'me', ''m'''ú'''-'' 'him/her' etc. also become proclitic when added to an imperative or subjunctive:
*''ndi-th&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ndíz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;-ni!'' 'help me!'
*''mu-ndi-th&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ndíz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'could you help me?'

However, the aspect-marker ''-ka-'' 'go and' is not proclitic. With an imperative it is toneless, and with a subjunctive it puts tones on itself and the penultimate:
*''ka-thandiz'''é''''' 'go and help!'
*''ndi-k'''á'''-thand'''í'''ze'' 'let me go and help'

====Aspect or object-marker with a proclitic tense====
When, as often happens, an aspect-marker or object-marker is added to a proclitic tense, extra tones appear on the verb stem, either on the penultimate or on the final:
*''ku-m'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'to be always helping'
*''ku-k'''á'''-thandiz'''á''''' 'to go and help'
*''ku-m'''ú'''-thandiz'''á''''' 'to help him'

Further details are given below.

===Meeussen's Rule===
[[Meeussen's rule|Meeussen's Rule]] is a process in several Bantu languages whereby a sequence HH becomes HL. This is frequent in verbs. An example in Chichewa is the infinitive ''kú- + goná'' 'to sleep', where the addition of the proclitic ''kú-'' would normally be expected to produce ''ku-góná'' with two high tones; but by Meeussen's Rule the second tone is dropped, leaving ''ku-góna'' with a high tone on the penultimate only. In the Southern Region, ''a-ná-mú-thandiza'' 'he helped him' is pronounced ''a-ná-mu-thandiza'', presumably also by Meeussen's Rule.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeussen's Rule does not apply in every circumstance. For example, a tone derived from spreading is unaffected by it, e.g. ''ku-góná bwino'' 'to sleep well', where the tone of the verb-stem ''goná'', having been deleted by Meeussen's Rule to make ''ku-góna'' 'to sleep', is replaced by spreading when the word is used in a phrase.&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Mtenje 1999a, p. 104"&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance where Meeussen's Rule does not apply in Chichewa is when the aspect-marker ''-ká-'' 'go and' is added to a verb, for example: ''a-ná-ká-thandiza'' 'he went and helped'. So far from being deleted, this tone in some circumstances can itself spread to the next syllable, e.g. ''a-ná-ká-thándiza''.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of an object-marker such as ''-mu-'' 'him' in the same position, however, is deleted by Meeussen's Rule and then replaced by spreading; it does not itself spread: ''a-ná-mú-thandiza'' 'he helped him'.

===Tone of consonants===
Just as in English, where in a word like ''zoo ''or ''wood'' or ''now'' the initial voiced consonant has a low pitch compared with the following vowel, the same is true of Chichewa. Thus Trithart marks the tones of initial consonants such as [m], [n], [z], and [dz] in some words as Low.&lt;ref&gt;Trithart (1976), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an initial nasal consonant is not always pronounced with a low pitch. After a high tone it can acquire a high tone itself, e.g. ''wá ḿsodzi'' 'of the fisherman'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 71, 66, 70; cf. Stevick p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  The consonants ''n'' and ''m'' can also have a high tone when contracted from ''ndí'' 'and' or high-toned ''-mú-'', e.g. ''ḿmakhálá kuti?'' (short for ''múmakhálá kuti?'') 'where do you live?'.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Southern African Bantu languages such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] a voiced consonant at the beginning of a syllable not only has a low pitch itself, but can also lower the pitch of all or part of the following vowel. Such consonants are known as '[[depressor consonant]]s'. The question of whether Chichewa has depressor consonants was first considered by Trithart (1976) and further by Cibelli (2012). According to data collected by Cibelli, a voiced or nasalised consonant does indeed have a small effect on the tone of a following vowel, making it a semitone or more lower; so that for example the second vowel of ''ku-gúla'' 'to buy' would have a slightly lower pitch than that of ''ku-kúla'' 'to grow' or ''ku-khála'' 'to sit'. When the vowel is toneless, the effect is less, but it seems that there is still a slight difference. The effect of depressor consonants in Chichewa, however, is much less noticeable than in Zulu.

==Lexical tones==
Lexical tones are the tones of individual words - or the lack of tones, since quite a large number of words in Chichewa (including over a third of nouns and most verbs in their basic form) are toneless and pronounced with all their syllables on a low pitch.

===Nouns===
In the CBOLD Chichewa dictionary,&lt;ref name="Mtenje 2001"/&gt; about 36% of Chichewa nouns are toneless, 57% have one tone, and only 7% have more than one tone. When there is one tone, it is generally on one of the last three syllables. Nouns with a tone more than three syllables from the end are virtually all foreign borrowings, such as ''sékondale'' 'secondary school'.

Comparison with other Bantu languages shows that for the most part the tones of nouns in Chichewa correspond to the tones of their cognates in other Bantu languages, and are therefore likely to be inherited from an earlier stage of Bantu.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is that nouns which at an earlier period had HH (such as ''nsómba'' 'fish', from proto-Bantu ''*cómbá'') have changed in Chichewa to HL by [[Meeussen's rule]]. Two-syllable nouns in Chichewa can therefore have the tones HL, LH, or LL, these three being about equally common, but (discounting the fact that LH words are usually in practice pronounced HH) there are no nouns with the underlying tones HH.

The class-prefix of nouns, such as (class 7) ''chi-'' in ''chikóndi'' 'love', or (class 3) ''m-'' in ''mténgo'' 'tree', is usually toneless. However, there are some exceptions such as ''chímanga'' 'maize'. The three nouns ''díso'' 'eye', ''dzíno'' 'tooth', and ''líwu'' 'sound or word' are irregular in that the high tone moves from the prefix to the stem in the plural, making ''masó'', ''manó'', and ''mawú'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{colbegin}}
*''b'''ó'''tolo'' 'bottle'
*''k'''á'''lata'' 'letter'
*''m'''á'''kina'' 'machine'
*''mb'''á'''tata'' 'sweet potatoes'
*''ns'''á'''pato'' 'shoe'
*''p'''é'''pala'' 'paper'
{{colend}}

====Nouns with two tones====
A small number of words (mostly compounds) have more than one tone. Some are compounded with '''''á''''' 'of', which has a high tone, so that ''w'''á''''' + ''ntch'''í'''to'' 'man of work' becomes ''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ntch'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;to'' 'worker' with two tones joined in a plateau. In words with the sequence HLH like ''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-pól'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;si'' 'policeman' the high tones usually bridge to make HHH. Verbal forms such as ''L&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''l'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;mba'' 'Monday' (short for ''L&lt;u&gt;'''á''' kúl'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;mba'' 'the (day) of writing') are also originally plateaux. Plateaux are marked with underlining:
{{colbegin}}
*''ch&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kúdy'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'food'
*''L&lt;u&gt;'''á'''chíw'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;ri'' 'Tuesday'
*''L&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''l'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;mba'' 'Monday'
*''L&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''w'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;ruka'' 'Saturday'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''kúb'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'thief'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ntch'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;to'' 'worker'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''pól'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;si'' 'policeman'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''dw'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;la'' 'sick person'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''ph'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;nzira'' 'pupil'
*''z&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''f'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;nda'' 'bedclothes'
*''z&lt;u&gt;'''óó'''&lt;/u&gt;na'' 'truth'
{{colend}}

The prefix ''chi-'' in some words adds two high tones, one following ''chi-'' and one on the final. The first may spread forwards and the second backwards, but the two tones are kept separate with the second lower than the first:
{{colbegin}}
*''chiz'''ó'''lowez'''í''''' (or ''chiz'''ó'''l'''ó'''wez'''í''''') 'habit, custom'
*''chil'''á'''kolak'''ó''''' 'desire'
*''chipw'''í'''rikit'''í''''' 'riot'
*''chith'''ú'''nzithunz'''í''''' 'picture'
*''chits'''é'''kerer'''ó''''' 'stopper'
*''chiv'''ú'''ndikir'''ó''''' 'lid'
*''chiw'''ó'''ngoler'''ó''''' 'steering-wheel'
{{colend}}

If there are only three syllables following the prefix ''chi-'', the two tones link into an HHH plateau:
{{colbegin}}
*''chikw&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ngwán'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'banner, sign'
*''chip&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''lów'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'violence, riot'
{{colend}}

The (L)HHH pattern is also found in a few other words (all of them compounds):
{{colbegin}}
*''kus&lt;u&gt;'''í'''yán'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'difference'
*''mas&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''mphény'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'vision'
*''mk&lt;u&gt;'''á'''mwín'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'son-in-law'
*''ts&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ból'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'pepper'
{{colend}}

Less common patterns are found in:
{{colbegin}}
*''b&lt;u&gt;'''í'''rím'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;nkhwe'' 'chameleon'
*''g&lt;u&gt;'''á'''l'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;moto'' 'car'
{{colend}}

The following, however, have two separate tones and no plateau. The second tone is lower than the first:
{{colbegin}}
*''ny'''é'''nyez'''í''''' (also ''ny'''é'''nyezi'') 'star'&lt;ref&gt;cf. MWC, entry 'nyenyezi'.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''k'''á'''ngach'''é'''pe'' 'small bribe, tip' (lit. 'though it may be little')
{{colend}}

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Chichewa are usually formed with word ''á'' (''wá'', ''yá'', ''chá'', ''zá'' etc. according to noun class) 'of', which has a high tone. The high tone tends to spread to the following word. When there is a sequence of HLH, the tones will bridge to make HHH:
*''w'''á'''-bwino'' 'good'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-ḿk'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;zi'' 'female'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-mwám'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;na'' 'male'

Combined with an infinitive, '''''á''''' and ''ku-'' usually merge (except usually in monosyllabic verbs) into a high-toned '''''ó-''''':
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''-'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;pa'' 'bad'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''-p'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;nga'' 'mad'
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''-dw'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;la'' 'sick'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-kú-y'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'deep'

Some people make a slight dip between the two tones:
*''w&lt;u&gt;'''ô'''-d'''ú'''&lt;/u&gt;la'' 'expensive'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 155, cf. p. 101-2, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessive adjectives are also made with ''á-''. As explained in the section on bumping, their tone may change when they follow a noun ending in HL, LH or HH. The concords shown below are for noun classes 1 and 2:

*''w'''á'''nga'' 'my'
*''w'''á'''ko'' 'your'
*''w'''á'''ke'' 'his, her, its' (also 'their' of non-personal possessors)
*''w'''á'''thu'' 'our'
*''w'''á'''nu'' 'your' (of you plural, or polite)
*''w'''á'''o'' 'their' (or 'his, her' in polite speech)

The adjective ''w'''í'''na'' 'another, a certain' has similar tones to ''w'''á'''nga'':
*''w'''í'''na'' (plural '''''é'''na'') 'another, a certain'

The adjective ''wamba'' 'ordinary', however, is not made with '''''á''''' and has a low tone on both syllables. The first syllable ''wa'' in this word does not change with the class of noun.

===Pronominal adjectives===
The following three adjectives have their own concords and are not formed using ''á''. Here they are shown with the concords of classes 1 and 2:

*''y'''é'''nse'' (plural '''''ó'''nse'') 'all of'
*''y'''é'''mwe'' (plural '''''ó'''mwe'') 'himself'
*''y'''é'''kha'' (plural '''''ó'''kha'') 'only'

As with possessives, the high tone of these may shift by bumping after a noun ending in HL or LH or HH.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these three the high tone also shifts before a demonstrative suffix: ''yemw'''é'''-yo'' 'that same one', ''zons'''é'''-zi'' 'all these'.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 69, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; (In this they differ from ''w'''á'''nga'' and ''w'''í'''na'', which do not shift the tone with a demonstrative suffix, e.g. ''anthu '''é'''na-wa'' 'these other people'.) The tone also shifts in the word '''''á'''lí-yens'''é''''' 'each, each and every', in which '''''á'''li'' has the tones of a relative-clause verb.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following demonstrative adjectives (shown here with the concords for noun classes  1 and 2) usually have a low tone:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1986), pp. 248-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''uyo'' (plural ''awo'') 'that one'
*''uyu'' (plural ''awa'') 'this one'
*''uno'' (plural ''ano'') 'this one we're in'
*''uja'' (plural ''aja'') 'that one you mentioned'
*''uti?'' (plural ''ati?'') 'which one?'

The first of these (''uyo''), however,  can be pronounced '''''ú'''yo!'' with a high tone if referring to someone a long way away.&lt;ref name="Kulemeka 2002, p. 91"&gt;Kulemeka (2002), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''uti/ati?'' can also acquire an intonational tone in certain types of questions (see below).

===Numbers===
Chichewa has the numbers 1 to 5 and 10. These all have penultimate high tone except for ''-sanu'' 'five', which is toneless. The adjectives meaning 'how many?' and 'several' also take the number concords and can be considered part of this group. They are here illustrated with the concords for noun classes 1 and 2 (note that ''khúmi'' has no concord):
*''munthu mm'''ó'''dzi'' 'one person'
*''anthu aw'''í'''ri''  'two people'
*''anthu at'''á'''tu''  'three people'
*''anthu an'''á'''yi''  'four people'
*''anthu asanu''  'five people' (toneless)
*''anthu kh'''ú'''mi''  'ten people'
*''anthu ang'''á'''ti?'' 'how many people?'
*''anthu ang'''á'''po'' 'several people'

The numbers ''zan'''á''''' '100' and ''chikw'''í''''' '1000' exist but are rarely used. It is possible to make other numbers using circumlocutions (e.g. 'five tens and units five and two' = 57) but these are not often heard, the usual practice being to use English numbers instead.

===Personal pronouns===
The first and second person pronouns are toneless, but the third person pronouns have a high tone:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 163, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{colbegin}}
*''ine'' 'I'
*''iwe'' 'you sg.'
*''iy'''é''''' 'he, she'
*''ife'' 'we'
*''inu'' 'you pl., you (polite)'
*''iw'''ó''''' 'they, he/she (polite)'
{{colend}}

These combine with ''ndi'' as follows:
{{colbegin}}
*''ndine'' 'I am'
*''ndiy'''é''''' 'he is' (etc.)
*''s'''í'''ndine'' 'I am not'
*''s'''í'''nd'''í'''y'''é''''' 'he is not' (also 'surely')
{{colend}}

===Monosyllables===
The following monosyllabic words are commonly used. The following are toneless:
*''ndi'' 'it is, they are'
*''ku'' 'in, to, from'
*''pa'' 'on, at'
*''mu'' (''m''') 'in'

The following have a high tone:
*''á'' (also ''wá'', ''yá'', ''zá'', ''kwá'' etc. according to noun class) 'of'
*''ndí'' 'with, and'
*''sí'' 'it isn't'

These words are joined rhythmically to the following word. The high tone can spread to the first syllable of the following word, provided it has at least three syllables:&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1983), pp. 204f.&lt;/ref&gt; They can also make a plateau with the following word, if the tones are HLH:
*''Lilongwe'' 'Lilongwe' &gt; ''á Lílongwe'' 'of Lilongwe'
*''pemphero'' 'prayer' &gt; ''ndí pémphero'' 'with a prayer'
*''Maláwi'' &gt; ''á Máláwi'' 'of Malawi'

The word ''pa'' has a tone when it means 'of' following a noun of class 16:
*''pa bédi'' 'on the bed' but ''pansí pá bédi'' 'underneath (of) the bed'

It also has a tone in certain idiomatic expressions such as ''pá-yekha'' or ''pá-yékha'' 'on his own'.

===Ideophones===
The tones of [[ideophone]]s (expressive words) have also been investigated by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are: ''bálálábálálá'' 'scattering in all directions' (all syllables very high), ''lólolo'' 'lots and lots' (with gradually descending tones), ''bii!'' 'very dark or dirty' (low pitch). It can be seen that the tonal patterns of ideophones do not necessarily conform to the patterns of other words in the language.

===Lexical tones of verbs===
Chichewa verbs are mostly toneless in their basic form, although a few have a high tone (usually on the final vowel). However, unlike the situation with the lexical tones of nouns, there is no correlation at all between the high-toned verbs in Chichewa and the high-toned verbs in other Bantu languages. The obvious conclusion is that the high tones of verbs are not inherited from an earlier stage of Bantu but have developed independently in Chichewa.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 122f.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a verbal extension is added to a high-toned root, the resulting verb is also usually high-toned, e.g.
*''goná'' 'sleep' &gt; ''gonaná'' 'sleep together'

Certain extensions, especially those which change a verb from transitive to intransitive, or which make it intensive, also add a tone. According to Kanerva (1990) and Mchombo (2004), the passive ending ''-idwa/-edwa'' also adds a high tone, but this appears to be true only of the Nkhotakota dialect which they describe.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), pp. 16-17; see Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
High-toned verb roots are comparatively rare (only about 13% of roots),&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; though the proportion rises when verbs with stative and intensive extensions are added. In addition there are a number of verbs, such as ''peza/pezá'' 'find' which can be pronounced either way. In the monolingual dictionary ''Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja'' 2683 verbs are given, with 10% marked as high-toned, and 4% as having either tone. In the Southern Region of Malawi, some speakers do not pronounce the tones of high-toned verbs at all or only sporadically.

The difference between high and low-toned verbs is neutralised when they are used in a verb tense which has a high tone on the penultimate or on the final syllable.

Three irregular verbs, ''-téro'' 'do so', ''-tére'' 'do like this', and ''-táni?'' 'do what?', have a tone on the penultimate syllable.

The view held in Mtenje (1986) that Chichewa also has 'rising-tone' verbs has been dropped in his more recent work.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), pp. 169, 206f.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''dya'' 'eat'
*''fa'' 'die'
*''mva'' 'hear'

*''pezá'' 'find'
*''sowá'' 'miss, be missing'
*''thokozá'' 'thank'
*''yabwá'' 'irritate, make itch'
{{colend}}

'''Stative verbs'''

Most intransitive verbs with the endings ''-iká'', ''-eká'', ''-uká'', ''-oká'' derived from simpler verb-stems are high-toned. This is especially true when a transitive verb has been turned by a suffix into an intransitive one:
{{colbegin}}
*''chitiká'' 'happen' (cf. ''chita''  'do')
*''duká'' 'be cut' (cf. ''dula'' 'cut')
*''dziwiká'' 'be known' (cf. ''dziwa'' 'know')
*''funiká'' 'be necessary' (cf. ''funa'' 'want')
*''masuká'' 'be at ease' (cf. ''masula'' 'free')
*''mveká'' 'be understood' (cf. ''mva'' 'hear')
*''onongeká'' 'be damaged' (cf. ''ononga'' 'damage')
*''theká'' 'be possible' (cf. ''tha'' 'finish, manage to')
*''thyoká'' 'be broken' (cf. ''thyola'' 'break')
*''vutiká'' 'be in difficulty' (cf. ''vutitsa'' 'cause a problem for')
{{colend}}

However, there are some common exceptions such as the following which are low-toned:
*''oneka'' 'seem' (cf. ''ona'' 'see')
*''tuluka'' 'come out, emerge' (cf. ''tula'' 'remove a burden')

'''Intensive verbs'''

Intensive verbs with the endings ''-its(its)á'' and ''-ets(ets)á'' always have a high tone on the final syllable, even when derived from low-toned verbs. A few intensive verbs with the endings ''-irirá'' or ''-ererá'' are also high-toned:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{colbegin}}
*''yang'angitsitsá'' 'examine carefully' (cf. ''yang'ana''  'look at')
*''onetsetsá'' 'inspect' (cf. ''ona'' 'see')
*''mvetsetsá'' 'understand well' (cf. ''mva'' 'hear')
*''menyetsá'' 'beat severely' (cf. ''menya'' 'hit')
*''pitirirá'' 'go further' (cf. ''pita'' 'go')
*''psererá'' 'be overcooked' (cf. ''psa'' 'burn, be ripe')
{{colend}}

==Grammatical tones of verbs==
===Tonal melodies of positive tenses===
{{see|Chichewa tenses}}
In addition to the lexical tones which go with individual words, Chichewa also has grammatical tones which apply to verbs. Each different tense has its own tonal pattern or melody, which is superimposed on top of whatever lexical tone the verb-stem itself may have.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are at least eight different tonal patterns in ordinary positive tenses, while others are used in negative tenses or relative clause tenses.&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 132-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and are distinguished by tone alone, as with the Present Habitual and the Past Imperfective. The Present Habitual has two tones, one on the subject-marker and the other on the penultimate, while the Past Imperfective has a tone following the tense-marker:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-thand'''í'''za'' 'I help'
*''ndi-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I was helping'

In the examples, hyphens have been added for clarity; they are not used in the standard orthography.

====Toneless====
Some tenses, such as the Perfect, are toneless. In toneless tenses all the syllables are pronounced low, unless the verb-stem itself has a high tone (e.g. ''nd-a-gon'''á''''' 'I have lain down'):
*''nd-a-fotokoza'' 'I have explained'
*''nd-a-werenga'' 'I have read'
*''nd-a-ona'' 'I have seen'
*''nd-a-dya'' 'I have eaten'

Other toneless tenses are the simple Imperative (''thandiza!'' 'help!'), the Potential (also called 'Permissive') (''ndi-nga-thandize'' 'I can help'),&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 140, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''-ka-'' tense meaning 'when' or 'if' (''ndi-ka-fotokoza'' 'if/when I explain').&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final tone====
One tense, the Subjunctive, has a high tone on the final vowel:
*''ndi-fotokoz'''é''''' 'I should explain'
*''ndi-wereng'''é''''' 'I should read'
*''ndi-on'''é''''' 'I should see'
*''ndi-dy'''é''''' 'I should eat'

====Proclitic====
The Infinitive, Present Progressive, Recent Past, and Past Imperfective all have a proclitic tone, that is, a high tone is heard on the syllable immediately following the tense-marker:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 147–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'to help'
*''ndi-ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I am helping'
*''ndi-na-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I helped' (just now)
*''ndi-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I was helping'

If the verb is monosyllabic, the tone often spreads backwards or regresses to the penultimate:
*''ndi-ku-dy'''á''''' (pronounced ''ndi-k'''ú'''-dy'''á''''' or ''ndi-k'''ú'''-dya'')&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; 'I am eating'

====Tense-marker tone====
In the Past Simple/Remote Perfect, whether made with ''-na-'' or ''-da-'', the tone comes on the tense-marker itself. This tone can also spread to the next syllable in longer verbs in some dialects:&lt;ref name="Mtenje_203–04"/&gt;
*''ndi-n'''á'''-fotokoza'' (or ''ndi-n'''á'''-f'''ó'''tokoza'') 'I explained'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 195; (1987), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-n'''á'''-werenga'' (or ''ndi-n'''á'''-w'''é'''renga'') 'I read'
*''ndi-n'''á'''-ona'' 'I saw'
*''ndi-n'''á'''-dya'' 'I ate'

Another tense with tense-marker tone is the perfect conditional:
*''ndi-kad'''á'''-fotokoza'' (or ''ndi-kad'''á'''-f'''ó'''tokoza'') 'I would have explained'

====Subject-marker tone====
The Present Simple, which often refers to events in the near future, has a high tone on the initial syllable, that is, on the subject-marker ''ndi-'' 'I'.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 79; Kanerva (1990), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In some dialects this high tone will spread (or shift forward) to the second syllable in longer verbs (that is, verbs where the high tone is followed by at least three toneless syllables):&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í-'''fotokoza'' (or ''nd'''í'''-f'''ó'''tokoza'') 'I will explain'
*''nd'''í'''-werenga'' (or ''nd'''í'''-w'''é'''renga'') 'I will read'
*''nd'''í'''-ona'' 'I will see'
*''nd'''í'''-dya'' 'I will eat'

====Subject-marker and tense-marker====
In some dialects the two future tenses with ''-dz'''á'''-'' and ''-k'''á'''-'' have a tone on both the subject prefix and the tense-marker:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2018), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-dz'''á'''-fotokoza'' 'I will explain (at a future time)'

However, in other dialects the first tone is dropped, and only the tense-marker has a tone:
*''ndi-dz'''á'''-fotokoza''

====Subject-marker and penultimate====
The Present Habitual has a high tone on the initial syllable and another on the penultimate. But if the verb-stem is monosyllabic, the second tone is heard on the final syllable instead of the penultimate.&lt;ref name="Mtenje_203–04"&gt;Mtenje (1986), pp. 203–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of downdrift, the second high tone is slightly lower in pitch than the first.&lt;ref&gt;See the voice-track in Myers (1986), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-ma-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I usually explain'
*''nd'''í'''-ma-wer'''é'''nga'' 'I usually read' 
*''nd'''í'''-ma-'''ó'''na'' 'I usually see'

When the verb is monosyllabic, the second tone is on the final, unless there is an object-marker: 
*''nd'''í'''-ma-dy'''á''''' 'I usually eat'&lt;ref name=HM99a-99&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-ma-m'''ú'''-dya'' 'I usually eat it (e.g. sugar)'

In this tense the first tone never spreads to ''-ma-''.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 7n.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Future Continuous also has this tonal pattern:
*''nd'''í'''-zi-(dza)-wer'''é'''nga'' 'I shall be reading'

====Initial, peninitial, and penultimate====
The Remote Past (with ''-naa-'' or ''-daa-'') is similar, but the first tone usually spreads to the second syllable:
*''nd'''í'''-n'''á'''-a-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I explained (but...)'
*''nd'''í'''-n'''á'''a-dy'''á''''' 'I had eaten'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tense with this tone-pattern is the not commonly used 'continuative' subjunctive:&lt;ref&gt;But see Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''t'''í'''-b'''á'''a-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'let us continue explaining'

====Tense-marker and penultimate====
The Remote Past Imperfective also has two tones, but on the tense-marker and the penultimate. The second tone disappears if the verb is monosyllabic. The tone on ''-ká-'' never spreads:&lt;ref name=DM154&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-fotok'''ó'''za'' 'I was explaining'
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-wer'''é'''nga'' 'I was reading' 
*''ndi-nk&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-ón'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' or  ''ndi-nk'''á'''-on'''á''''' 'I was seeing' 
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-dya'' 'I was eating'

The same pattern is found in the Necessitative (= Imperfective Subjunctive). In some dialects this tense is formed with ''-dzi-'' instead of ''-zi-'':&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mu-z'''í'''-wer'''é'''nga'' 'you must (always) read'

===Lexical tone combined with tense===
As noted above, some verb stems have an inherent lexical tone, for example ''goná'' 'lie down', ''siyá'' 'leave (something)', ''yang'anitsitsá'' 'examine carefully'. When such a verb is used to make a tense, the tone can usually be heard on the final syllable. The tone can be heard most easily when the tense-melody is toneless, as in the Perfect tense:&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd-a-siy'''á''''' 'I have left (it)'

However, it can also be heard when there is another high tone in the verb, provided this tone is not in one of the last two syllables:
*''ku-kh'''ú'''lulukir'''á''''' 'to forgive'

If the tense-pattern puts a tone on the antepenultimate syllable (so that the verb ends HLH), the two tones will link up, making a plateau:
*''ku-g&lt;u&gt;'''ó'''nán'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to sleep with one another'

However, if the tonal pattern of the tense puts a tone on the penultimate or the final syllable, the tone of the verb-stem cannot be heard; in the first case because it is deleted by Meeussen's Rule,&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second, because the two tones coincide:
*''ku-g'''ó'''na'' (not *''ku-g'''ó'''n'''á''''') 'to lie down'
*''ndi-gon'''é''''' 'I should lie down'

===Modifications with shorter verbs===
Certain modifications of the tones of a tense take place when the verb-stem is a short one, i.e. of only one syllable, such as ''-dya'' 'eat', or two syllables, such as ''ona'' 'see'.

In most tenses, a penultimate tone moves to the final if the verb is monosyllabic. But if there is an aspect-marker or object-marker, the penultimate tone goes on that:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-p'''í'''ta'' 'I usually go'
*''nd'''í'''-ma-dy'''á''''' 'I usually eat'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-ma-k'''á'''-dya'' 'I usually go and eat'

In the 'not yet' tense with ''-na-'', however, the penultimate tone remains penultimate:
*''si-ndi-n'''á'''-dya'' 'I have not yet eaten'

It also remains penultimate in the negative future with ''-dza-'' or ''-ka-'':
*''si-ndi-dz'''á'''-dye'' 'I will not eat'

When the shortening of a verb would mean that the verb ends LHH, the second tone disappears:
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-dya'' 'I used to eat'

When a verb has two syllables, in most cases, if the ending would normally be HHL, the second tone shifts to the final, usually making a tonal plateau:
*''ku-k&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-mény'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to go and hit'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-n&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-mú-ph'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we killed him'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-nk&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-pít'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' or ''ndi-nk'''á'''-pit'''á''''' "I used to go'

However, when a monosyllabic verb is preceded by ''-ná-ká-'' 'went and', this bumping does not occur:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-ná-k'''á'''-pha'' 'we went and killed'

===Tonal patterns of negative tenses===
Negative tenses in Chichewa tend to have a different tonal pattern from the corresponding positive ones.&lt;ref&gt;For different negative tenses see Mtenje (1986), p. 244ff; Mtenje (1987), p. 183ff; Kanerva (1990), p. 23; Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 174–195.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, negative intonations can be divided into two groups: 
*(a) Those with a tone on the negative-marker ''sí-'' (which spreads to the subject-marker). This intonation is used for negative past tenses and negative present tenses.
*(b) Those with no tone on the initial syllable of the verb, but a tone on the penultimate and sometimes also on the tense-marker. This intonation is used for all negative future tenses, tenses meaning "not yet", and also for the negative infinitive and subjunctive.

Consequently in some tenses, there are two negative intonations with different meanings. For example, the Remote Perfect (Simple Past) has a tone on ''sí-'' and the penultimate when it means "didn't", but a single tone on the penultimate when it means "have not yet":&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I didn't help'
*''si-ndi-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I haven't helped yet'

The negative Present Simple / Near Future also has two intonations, depending on whether the meaning is present or future:
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-thandiza'' 'I don't help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''si-ndi-thand'''í'''za'' 'I won't help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative tonal melodies are as follows:

====''sí-'' only====
The Present Simple, in its habitual, non-future sense, has a tone on the initial syllables only. This second tone does not spread even in longer verbs and is presumably itself due to spreading:&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Mtenje (1987), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-thandiza'' 'I don't help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if an object-marker is added, there is an extra tone on the penultimate syllable:
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I don't help him'&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stevick et al. (1965), p. 124, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In monosyllabic verbs, in the Central Region, the tone on the subject-marker disappears in the Present Simple and the tones are:
*''s'''í'''-ndi-dya'' 'I don't eat'

====''sí-'' and penultimate====
The negative Remote Perfect tense with ''-na-'' or ''-da-'' has tones on the negative prefix ''s'''í'''-'' and the penultimate. The first tone may spread. The ending changes to ''-e'':
*''s'''í'''-ndi-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I did not help'
*''s'''í'''-ndi-na-fotok'''ó'''ze'' 'I did not explain'

In a monosyllabic verb, the second tone goes on the final, unless there is an object-marker:
*''s'''í'''-ndi-na-dy'''é''''' 'I didn't eat'
*''s'''í'''-ndi-na-m'''ú'''-dye'' 'I didn't eat it (e.g. the sugar)'

The negative perfect participial tense has tones very similar to the above, with the first tone on the initial syllable and the second on the penultimate. The first tone may spread:&lt;ref name=DM187&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-sa-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'without my having helped', 'before I help(ed)'
*''nd'''í'''-sa-na-dy'''é''''' 'before I eat/ate'&lt;ref name=DM187 /&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-sa-na-m'''ú'''-dye'' 'before I eat/ate it (e.g. the sugar)'

====''sí-'', tense-marker, and penultimate====
The Remote Past Imperfective has three tones when negative. The first may spread. The ''n'' of ''nk'''á''''' is syllabic and low-toned, so there is no plateau between the first and second tone:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''s'''í'''-ndi-nk'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'I didn't use to help'

In a monosyllabic verb, the third tone is lost:
*''s'''í'''-ndi-nk'''á'''-dya'' 'I didn't use to eat'

====''sí-'' and proclitic tone====
Tenses with proclitic tense-markers, such as the Present Continuous, have a tone on ''s'''í''''' and a second tone immediately following the tense-marker:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I'm not helping'
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I wasn't helping'
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-na-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I didn't help just now' (rarely used)

====''sí-'' and aspect-marker====
If the aspect-marker ''-ma-'' is added to any negative tense, it carries a high tone; otherwise the tones are similar to the same tenses without ''-ma-'':
*''s&lt;u&gt;'''í'''-ndí-m'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;-thandiza'' 'I never help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''s&lt;u&gt;'''í'''-ndí-m'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;-dya'' 'I never eat'

When an object-marker is added there is an additional tone on the penultimate:
*''s&lt;u&gt;'''í'''-ndí-m'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I never help him'

The negative Perfect Conditional can also optionally have this intonation:
*''s'''í'''-ndí-kad'''á'''-thandiza'' 'I would not have helped' (but also ''s'''í'''-ndí-kada-thand'''í'''za'')

====Penultimate tone only====
Any negative tense with future meaning, or with the meaning 'not yet', has only one tone, on the penultimate syllable. Other tones, such as those of the negative prefix ''s'''í-''''' and the object-marker, are suppressed:
*''si-ndi-thand'''í'''za'' 'I won't help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''si-ndi-dza-thand'''í'''za'' 'I won't help' (in future)&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''si-ndi-dza-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I won't help him'
*''si-ndi-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I haven't helped yet'

The same intonation, with a tone on the penultimate, is found in non-finite tenses such as the negative Infinitive and negative Subjunctive, which have the negative-marker ''-sa-'' following the subject-marker:
*''ku-sa-thand'''í'''za'' 'not to help'&lt;ref name=DM186&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-sa-thand'''í'''ze'' 'so that I shouldn't help'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

When these patterns are used with a monosyllabic verb such as ''-dya'' 'eat', the tone usually goes on the final syllable:
*''si-ndi-dy'''á''''' 'I won't eat'&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-sa-dy'''á''''' 'not to eat'&lt;ref name=DM186 /&gt;
*''ndi-sa-dy'''é''''' 'I should not eat'

However, in the forms with ''-dza-'' and ''-na-'' the tone goes on the penultimate:
*''si-ndi-dz'''á'''-dya'' 'I will not eat' (at a future time)
*''si-ndi-n'''á'''-dye'' 'I have not yet eaten'

It also goes on the penultimate if a monosyllabic verb is preceded by an object-marker:
*''si-ndi-m'''ú'''-dya'' 'I won't eat it' (e.g. the sugar)
*''ku-sa-m'''ú'''-dya'' 'not to eat it'&lt;ref name=DM186 /&gt;

====Tense-marker and penultimate====
The negative Future Continuous and negative Potential have tones on tense-marker and penultimate. The tone on the tense-marker does not spread:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''si-ndi-z'''í'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'I won't be helping'
*''si-ndi-ng'''á'''-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I won't be able to help'

In a monosyllabic verb, the two tones coincide:
*''si-ndi-ng'''á'''-phe'' 'I cannot kill'

The negative infinitive with the aspect-marker ''-ma-'' has the same tones:
*''ku-sa-m'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'to be never helping'

In a monosyllabic verb, the second tone is lost by [[Meeussen's rule|Meeussen's Rule]]:
*''ku-sa-m'''á'''-dya'' 'to be never eating'
*''si-ndi-ng'''á'''-dye'' 'I can't eat'

===Relative clause intonation===
====Introduction====
Certain tenses have a different tonal pattern when used in certain kinds of [[dependent clause]]s. Stevick calls this intonation the 'relative mood' of the verb,&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; since it is frequently used in [[relative clause]]s; however, it is also used in a range of other dependent clauses, such as [[Conditional sentence|conditional clauses]] ('if...'), [[cleft sentence]]s ('it is he who...'), and [[adverbial clause]]s of time, place, manner, and concession. Often the use of relative clause intonation alone can show that a verb is being used in the meaning of a relative or conditional clause.&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====How it is made====
The dependent-clause intonation generally has two high tones, one on the initial syllable and another on the penultimate. High tones between these two are suppressed. The first high tone may spread. When the tones are HLHL, some dialects have bumping; for example, ''nd'''í'''-na-g'''ú'''la'' '(which) I bought' can become ''nd'''í'''-n'''á'''-gul'''á'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2011), p. 9; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''a-n'''á'''-thandiza'' 'he helped' becomes '''''á'''-na-thand'''í'''za'' (or '''''á'''-n'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'')
*''wa-thandiza'' 'he has helped' becomes ''w'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' (or when used as a noun or adjective ''w'''á'''-th'''á'''nd'''í'''za'')
*''ndi-nga-thandize'' 'I can help' becomes ''nd'''í'''-nga-thand'''í'''ze''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

But when the tense has a proclitic prefix the second high tone comes on the syllable after the tense-marker. There is usually&lt;ref&gt;But cf. Stevick (1965), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; bridging of the two tones, as well as a bridging with the tone of the relative pronoun ''am'''é'''ne'':&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pitchtrack p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''am&lt;u&gt;'''é'''né '''á'''-kú-th'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'who is helping'
*''am&lt;u&gt;'''é'''né '''á'''-má-th'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'who was helping'

If the verb has only one syllable, the second high tone is dropped at the end of a phrase:
*''watha'' 'it has finished' becomes ''w'''á'''tha'' 'which has finished'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be noted that the participial tenses also use the relative clause intonation.
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''kúth'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'while I am helping'
*''nd&lt;u&gt;'''í'''táth'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;ndiza'' 'after I helped', 'having helped'&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''sanathand'''í'''ze'' 'with me not yet having helped', 'before I help(ed)'

If the verb tense already has a high tone on the initial syllable, such as the Present Simple, Present Habitual, and Remote Future, there is no change when the verb is used in a relative clause.&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative tenses, such as ''s-a-na-thand'''í'''ze'' 'he hasn't helped yet', are also unaltered when used in dependent clauses.

====Where it is used====
The relative clause intonation is used most often in relative clauses, for example after ''améne'' or ''yemw'''é''''' 'who'. The tone of ''am'''é'''ne'' spreads to make a plateau with the high tone of the relative clause verb:
*''malálánjé am&lt;u&gt;'''é'''né m'''ú'''ná&lt;/u&gt;gul'''á''' alí kuti?''&lt;br /&gt;'where are the oranges which you bought?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''ápézá galú am&lt;u&gt;'''é'''né '''á'''ná&lt;/u&gt;musow'''é'''tsa''&lt;br /&gt;'he will find the dog which he lost.''&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative clause intonation is also used in temporal clauses after ''paméne'' 'when' and in clauses of manner after ''momwé'' 'in the way in which', which are derived from the same roots:
*''amavála paméné nd'''í'''mál'''ó'''wa''&lt;br /&gt;'he was getting dressed when I entered'
*''momwé '''á'''nkachit'''í'''ra''&lt;br /&gt;'as he used to do'

It is also used if the word ''améne'' or ''paméne'' is omitted, the relative clause intonation alone showing that the verb is being used in a relative way:
*''amadwála kwámbíri '''á'''lí mwaná.''&lt;br /&gt;'he was very sick when he was a child'&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mvúlá '''í'''lí kugwá''&lt;br /&gt;'when rain is falling'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mwezí w'''á'''-tha''&lt;br /&gt;'the month which has finished, i.e. last month'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions with ''ndaní?'' 'who?' and ''nchiyáni?'' 'what?' are expressed as [[cleft sentence]]s, using relative clause intonation:
*''w'''á'''khál'''á''' pa-mpando ndaní?''&lt;br /&gt;'who is sitting on the chair?' (lit. 'the one who has sat down on the chair is who?')
*''ch'''á'''chítik'''á''' n'chiyáni?''&lt;br /&gt;'what's happened?' (lit. 'the thing that has happened is what?')

The dependent clause intonation is also used in [[Conditional sentence|conditional clauses]], except those with the toneless ''-ka-'' tense. An example can be observed in the following proverb, where the dependent verb has a different intonation from the main verb:
*''nd'''í'''kanadz'''í'''wa, ndikan'''á'''phika thereré''&lt;br /&gt;'If I'd known (that you were going to come back from the hunt empty handed), I'd have cooked some vegetables!'&lt;ref&gt;Chakanza, J.C. (2000). ''Wisdom of the People: 2000 Chinyanja Proverbs''. CLAIM Blantyre (Malawi) p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is similarly used after ''ngati'' 'if' and in clauses after ''ngakhále'' 'although':
*''sízíkudzíwíká ngati w'''á'''mwal'''í'''ra'' (or ''w'''á'''mwálir'''á''''')&lt;br /&gt;'it isn't known if she has died'
*''ngakhálé mvúla '''í'''kubv'''ú'''mba''&lt;br /&gt;'even when rain is falling'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when ''ngati'' means 'as if', the ordinary intonation is used.

===Tones of ''-li'' ('am', 'are', 'is')===
As well as the word ''ndi'' 'is/are' used for identity (e.g. 'he is a teacher') Chichewa has another verb ''-li'' 'am, are, is' used for position or temporary state (e.g. 'he is well', 'he is in Lilongwe'). The tones of this are irregular in that in the Present Simple, there is no tone on the subject-marker.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 79; Stevick et al. (1965), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Remote Past, both ''á-naa-lí'' and ''a-ná-li''&lt;ref&gt;Mpanje (1983), p. 141; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; can be heard, apparently without difference of meaning. In the dependent Applied Present (''-lili''), used in clauses of manner, the two tones make a plateau.

In main clauses:
*Present: ''a-li'' 'he is, they are'
*Recent Past: ''a-na-l'''í''''' 'he was (today)'
*Remote Past: '''''á'''-n'''á'''a-l'''í''''' ('''''á'''naal'''í''''') or ''a-n'''á'''-li'' 'he was' (in the past)
*Persistive: ''a-kada-l'''í''''' (or ''a-ka-l'''í''''') 'he is still'

In dependent clauses:
*Present: '''''á'''-li'' 'when he is/was'
*Persistive: '''''á'''-kada-l'''í''''' 'when he is/was still'&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applied Present: ''momwé '''á'''-l'''í'''l'''í''''' 'the way that he is'

The dependent-clause form of the Persistive tense is frequently heard in the phrase ''pá-kada-lí pano'' 'at the present time' (literally, 'it still being now').

===Aspect-markers===
After the tense-marker, there can be one or more aspect-markers, which add precision to the meaning of the tense.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), pp. 94f.&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether there are four aspect-markers, ''-má-'' 'ever, usually, always', ''-ká-'' 'go and', ''-dzá-'' 'in future', and ''-ngo-'' 'just', which are always added in that order, though not usually all at once. These infixes add extra high tones to the verb.

====''-má-''====
The aspect-marker ''-má-'' 'always, ever, generally' usually adds two high tones, one on ''-má-'' itself and one on the penultimate syllable. For example, when added to the 'when' tense, which has the toneless tense-marker ''-ka-'', it adds two tones:
*''ndi-ka-m'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'whenever I help'

However, in the Present Habitual, the tone on ''-má-'' is lost:&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 7n.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-ma-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I usually help him'

On the other hand, in the negative Present Habitual, the tone on ''-má-'' is retained while the penultimate tone is lost, unless there is an object-marker: 
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-m'''á'''-thandiza'' 'I never help'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-m'''á'''-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I never help him'

''-má-'' can also be used as a tense-marker itself to make the Imperfect tense, in which case its high tone is proclitic: 
*''ndi-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I was helping'
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I wasn't helping'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''-ká-'' and ''-dzá-''====
The aspect-markers ''-ká-'' 'go to' and ''-dzá-'' 'in future' or 'come to' have the same tones as each other. In the Remote Perfect, the tone is high, and in longer verbs sometimes spreads:&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Mtenje 1999a, p. 104"/&gt;
*''ndi-n'''á'''-k'''á'''-thandiza'' (or ''ndi-n'''á'''-k'''á'''-th'''á'''ndiza'') 'I went to help'

In a monosyllabic verb in this tense, unlike with the object-marker, the tone of ''-ká-'' does not bump to the final:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-n'''á'''-k'''á'''-pha'' 'we went and killed'

(Contrast: ''ti-n&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-mú-ph'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we killed him'.)

In tenses which have a tone on the penultimate, ''-ká-'' and ''-dzá-'' usually lose their tone:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-ka-thand'''í'''za'' 'I (always) go to help'
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-na-ka-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I didn't go to help'
*''si-ndi-dza-p'''í'''ta'' 'I won't go'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-sa-ka-thand'''í'''za'' 'not to go and help'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in monosyllabic verbs, the tone remains:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-k'''á'''-dya'' 'I usually go and eat'

The high tone is also lost in the Imperative, where there is a tone on the final syllable only:
*''ka-thandiz'''é''''' 'go and help!'
*''ka-dy'''é''''' 'go and eat!'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990) p. 44 (with pausal form).&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the positive Subjunctive ''-ká-'' and ''-dzá-'' retain their tone, and there is a second tone on the penultimate. This second tone is lost in monosyllabic verbs:
*''ndi-k'''á'''-thand'''í'''ze'' 'I should go and help'
*''ndi-k&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-ón'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I should go and see'
*''ndi-k'''á'''-dye'' 'I should go and eat'

====''-ngo-''====
The aspect-marker ''-ngo-'' 'just' is derived from the infinitive, and like the infinitive it is proclitic, that is to say, there is a high tone on the syllable after ''-ngo-''. (The syllable ''-ngo-'' itself is always toneless.)

In toneless tenses, the syllables before it are toneless: 
*''i-ngo-bw'''é'''ra!'' 'just come!' 
*''nda-ngo-bw'''é'''ra'' 'I have just come'

In all other tenses, ''-ngo-'' also has a high tone in front of itself:
*''nd'''í'''-m'''á'''-ngo-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I usually just help'

If ''-ngo-'' is added after a proclitic tense-marker such as the Present Continuous ''-ku-'', the tense-marker keeps its high tone and is no longer proclitic:&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), pp. 166–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I'm helping'
*''ndi-k'''ú'''-ngo-th'''á'''ndiza'' 'I'm just helping'

===Object-markers===
Between the aspect-markers and the verb stem, it is possible to add an object-marker such as ''-mú-'' 'him/her/it' or ''-zí-'' 'those things' etc. In some tenses, the object-marker retains its tone, but in some the tone is lost. In others, the object-marker adds a tone, but not on itself.

====With toneless tenses====
When an object-marker is added to a toneless tense, such as the Perfect, it has a high tone. (In verbs of three syllables or longer, the tone may spread in some dialects.)&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nda-m'''ú'''-thandiza'' 'I have helped him'
*''ndi-ka-'''mú'''-thandiza'' 'if I help him'
*''ndi-nga-'''mú'''-thandize'' 'I can help him'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

====With penultimate-tone tenses====
In tenses which have penultimate tone the object-marker is usually toneless:
*''mu-sa-mu-thand'''í'''ze'' 'do not help him'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd'''í'''-ma-mu-thand'''í'''za'' 'I usually help him'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick at al. (1965), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

But when the verb is monosyllabic, the penultimate tone goes on the object-marker itself:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-z'''í'''-dya'' 'I usually eat them' (e.g. fruits)
*''ku-sa-dz'''í'''-pha'' 'not to kill oneself'&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''si-ndi-m'''ú'''-pha'' 'I will not kill him'&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

====With the Remote Perfect====
In the Remote Perfect (Past Simple) tense, which has the tense-marker ''-ná-'' or ''-dá-'', the tone of the object-marker is lost in southern dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), pp. 240-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In dialects with high tone spreading, the object-marker has a high tone, but it is thought that this tone is due to spreading, as it does not spread further to the following syllable, unlike the tone of ''-ká-''.&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Mtenje 1999a, p. 104"/&gt; 
*''ndi-n'''á'''-mu-thandiza'' 'I helped him' (southern speakers)
*''ti-n'''á'''-m'''ú'''-thandiza'' 'we helped him' (Central Region)

With monosyllabic verb-stems, however, the high tone of the object-marker is retained and (unlike the tone of ''-ká-'') undergoes bumping, making a plateau:&lt;ref name="Hyman &amp; Mtenje 1999a, p. 126"&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-n&lt;u&gt;'''á'''-mú-ph'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'we killed him'

====With proclitic tenses====
Where the tense-marker or aspect-marker has proclitic tone, for example in the infinitive, Present Continuous, or Recent Past, there is an additional tone on the penultimate in longer verbs, or on the final in verbs of 2 or 3 syllables. This second tone disappears if the verb has only one syllable:&lt;ref name=HM102&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-m'''ú'''-fotokoz'''é'''ra'' 'to explain to him'
*''ku-m'''ú'''-thamang'''í'''tsa'' 'to chase him'
*''ku-m'''ú'''-thandiz'''á''''' 'to help him'
*''ku-m&lt;u&gt;'''ú'''-mény'''á'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'to hit him'
*''ku-m'''ú'''-pha'' 'to kill him'

This is similar to the effect of adding the aspect-marker ''-m'''á'''-'', except that in three-syllable verbs with ''-m'''á'''-'' the second tone is heard on the penultimate:
*''ku-m'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' 'to be always helping'

====With Subjunctive and Imperative====
In the Subjunctive and Imperative the high tone of the object-marker becomes proclitic and is heard on the syllable which follows it. The final vowel changes to ''-e'' and has a tone. There is a plateau if the verb stem has three syllables:&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 7; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-mu-th&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ndíz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I should help him'
*''mu-chi-g'''ú'''le'' 'you should buy it'&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mu-f'''ó'''tokozer'''é''''' 'explain to him!'
*''mu-th&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ndíz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'come and help him!'

If the verb has two syllables, the tone on the final is dropped by [[Meeussen's rule]]:
*''(ndi-)p'''á'''tse-ni'' 'give me!'
*''mu-ndi-p'''á'''tse'' 'you should give me'

If the verb is monosyllabic, the tone remains on ''-mú-'', and the high tone of the final vowel is dropped: 
*''m'''ú'''-dye'' 'eat it!'&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 23; Kanerva (1990), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mu-m'''ú'''-dye'' 'you should eat it'

When the Imperative is preceded by the aspect-markers ''ta-'' ('do it now!') or ''i-ngo-'' ('just do it!'), which are proclitic, the rules for proclitic verbs given above apply:
*''i-ngo-m'''ú'''-thandiz'''á'''!'' 'just help him!'
*''ta-nd'''í'''-fotokoz'''é'''ra!'' 'explain to me now please'

When ''-ka-'' or ''-dza-'' are added to an Imperative, they are toneless, and the tone of the object-marker remains proclitic:
*''dza-mu-th&lt;u&gt;'''á'''ndíz'''é'''&lt;/u&gt;'' 'come and help him!'

But when ''-ká-'' or ''-dzá-'' is added to the Subjunctive, there are tones on ''-ká-'' and the penultimate, and the object-marker loses its tone:
*''mu-dz'''á'''-mu-thand'''í'''ze'' 'you should come and help him'

===Reflexive-marker===

The reflexive-marker ''-dzí-'' in most dialects has exactly the same tones as object-markers such as ''-mú-'', but for some speakers in parts of the Central Region there is also an extra tone on the penultimate or final syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), pp. 103, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''a-n'''á'''-dz'''í'''-thandiza'' 'he helped himself' (Lilongwe dialect)
*''a-n'''á'''-dz'''í'''-thand&lt;u&gt;'''í'''&lt;/u&gt;za'' 'he helped himself' (Nkhotakota dialect)

==Intonational tones==

In addition to the ordinary lexical tones which go with individual words, and the grammatical tones of verb tenses, other tones can be heard which show phrasing or indicate a question.

===Boundary tones===
[[File:Myers_boundary_tone_illustration.png|thumb|right|Voicetrack of the sentence ''Mwamúna, ámulamúlá amáyi'' ('A man, he rules women') (Myers (1996), p. 34), illustrating a boundary tone after ''mwamúna'', and also the typical downdrift of tones through the sentence.]]
Quite often, if there is a pause in the middle of sentence, such as might be indicated by a comma in writing, the speaker's voice will rise on the syllable just before the pause. This rising tone is called a [[boundary tone]].&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1996), pp. 29-60.&lt;/ref&gt; A boundary tone is typically used after the topic of a sentence, at the end of a dependent clause, after items on a list, and so on. The illustration included here of the sentence ''Mwamúna, ámulamúlá amáyi'' ('A man, he rules women')&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1996), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; clearly shows the rise in the voice on the last syllable of the word ''mwamúna'', which is here taken to be the topic of the sentence.

A typical sentence where the dependent clause precedes the main clause is the following:
*''mu-ka-chí-kónda{{IPA|↗}}, mu-chi-gúle''&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; 'if you like it, please buy it'

As Kanerva points out, the rising boundary tone is not used when the order is reversed and the dependent clause follows the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of tone considered to be a boundary tone, but this time a low one, is the optional fall in the speaker's voice at the end of sentences which causes the final high tone on words like ''chákúdyá'' 'food' to drop to become ''chákúdya''. The end-of-sentence boundary tone is marked L% in Myers' illustration.

Both Kanerva and Stevick also mention a 'level' boundary tone, which occurs mid-sentence, but without any rise in pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p.138; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tones of questions===
====Wh-Questions====

Questions in Chichewa often add high tones where an ordinary statement has no tone. For example, with the word ''kuti?'' 'where?', ''liti'' 'when?', ''yani'' 'who?' or ''chiyáni'' 'what?' some people add a tone on the last syllable of the preceding word. This tone does not spread backwards, although it may form a plateau with an antepenultimate tone, as in the 3rd and 4th examples below:
*''al'''í''' kuti?'' 'where is he?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndiw'''é''' yani?'' 'who are you?'
*''mu-ná-fík'''á''' liti?'' 'when did you arrive?'&lt;ref name="Stevick et al. 1965, p. 15"&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mu-k'''á'''-ch'''í'''t'''á''' chiyáni?'' 'what are you going to do there?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

But as Stevick points out, not all speakers do this, and others may say ''mu-n'''á'''-fika liti?''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''kuti?'' 'which place?' or ''liti?'' 'which day?' are preceded by ''ndi'' 'is', they take a high tone on the first syllable:
*''kwánú ndi k'''ú'''ti?'' 'where is your home?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that with some speakers the high tone after ''ndi'' is heard on the final syllable in forms of this adjective which begin with a vowel; but with other speakers it is heard on the first syllable:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 254-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mipando yáikúlu ndi it'''í'''?'' 'which are the large chairs?'
*''msewu wópíta ku Blántyre ndi '''ú'''ti?'' 'which is the road going to Blantyre?'

A high tone also goes on the final syllable in ''ndan'''í'''?'' '(it is) who?' (which is derived from ''ndi yani?'')&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this word and ''nchiyáni?'' '(is) what?', since such questions are phrased as a [[cleft sentence]] or [[relative clause]], the verb has its relative-clause intonation:
*''w'''á'''kh'''á'''l'''á''' pampando ndan'''í'''?'' '(the one who is) sitting on the chair is who?', i.e. 'who is it who's sitting on the chair?'

The relative-clause intonation of the verb is also used when a question begins with ''bwánji?'' 'how come?', but not when it ends with ''bwánji?'', when it has the meaning 'how?'

====Yes-no questions====

With yes-no questions, intonations vary. The simplest tone is a rising boundary tone on the final syllable:
*''mwa-landir'''á'''?'' 'did you receive it?'&lt;ref&gt;cf. Myers (1996), p. 35; Hullquist, C.G. (1988) ''Simply Chichewa'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more insistent question often has a HL falling boundary tone on the last syllable. Pitch transcriptions show that the voice rises up on the penultimate and falls on the final:&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2017), p. 382; Downing (2008), p. 61; cf. Hullquist, C.G. (1988) ''Simply Chichewa'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mwa-landir'''â'''?'' 'did you receive it?'

But in other dialects, it seems that this fall may begin on the penultimate syllable:
*''ku Z'''ó'''mba?'' 'in Zombá?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 34, 48, 53, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is already a penultimate high tone it may simply be raised higher:
*''ku Bal'''á'''ka?'' 'in Baláka?'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 225, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, there can be two successive falling tones, one on the penultimate, and another on the final.&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2017), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, however, there is no particular intonational tone and the question has the same intonation as a statement, especially if the question starts with the question-asking word ''kod'''í'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 42, 47, 75, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is a choice between two things in a disjunctive question, the first half of the question ends in a high boundary tone, but the voice drops in the second half:&lt;ref&gt;See the voicetrack in Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mukuf'''ú'''ná kh'''ó'''fí (H%), kapéná th'''í'''yi (L%)?'' 'do you want coffee or (would you prefer) tea?'

===Other idiomatic tones===
Some speakers add intonational tones also with the toneless word ''kale'' 'already', making not only the final syllable of ''kale'' itself high but also the last syllable of the verb which precedes it:
*''ndabvin'''á''' k'''á'''l'''é''''' 'I have danced already'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndin'''á'''f'''í'''k'''á''' kal'''é''''' 'I arrived a short time ago'&lt;ref name="Stevick et al. 1965, p. 15"/&gt;

Other speakers do not add these intonational tones, but pronounce ''ndavina kale'' with Low tones.

Occasionally a verb which is otherwise low-toned will acquire a high tone in certain idiomatic usages, e.g. ''ndapitá'' 'I'm off' (said on parting), from the normally toneless ''pita'' 'go'. This can perhaps also be considered a kind of intonational tone.

===Focus and emphasis===
In European languages it is common for a word which is picked out for contrast to be pronounced on a higher pitch than the other words in a sentence, e.g. in the sentence ''they fed the &lt;u&gt;baboon&lt;/u&gt; fish, not the elephant'', it is likely that the speaker will draw attention to the word ''baboon'' by pronouncing it on a high pitch, while the word ''fish'', which has been mentioned already, will be on a low pitch. This kind of emphasis is known as '[[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]'.  In tonal languages it appears that this raising or lowering of the pitch to indicate focus is either absent or much less noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;Cruttenden (1986), pp. 10ff; Downing (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have examined how focus is expressed in Chichewa and whether it causes a rise in pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990); Myers (1996); Downing (2004); Downing (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; One finding was that for most speakers, focus has no effect on pitch. For some speakers, however, it appears that there is a slight rise in pitch if a word with a tone is focussed.&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Pompino-Marschall (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; A toneless word, when in focus, does not appear to rise in pitch.

A different kind of emphasis is emphasis of degree. To show that something is very small, or very large, or very distant, a Chichewa-speaker will often raise the pitch of his or her voice considerably, breaking the sequence of downdrift. For example, a word such as ''kwámbíri'' 'very much' or ''pang'óno'' 'a little' is sometimes pronounced with a high pitch. The toneless demonstrative ''uyo'' 'that man' can also acquire a tone and become ''úyo!'' with a high pitch to mean 'that man over there in the distance'.&lt;ref name="Kulemeka 2002, p. 91"/&gt;

==Tonal minimal pairs==
Sometimes two nouns are distinguished by their tone patterns alone, e.g. 
*''mténgo'' 'tree' vs ''mtengo'' 'price' 
*''khúngu'' 'blindness' vs ''khungú'' 'skin'

Verbs can also sometimes be distinguished by tone alone:
*''ku-lémera'' 'to be rich' vs ''ku-lémérá'' 'to be heavy'
*''ku-pwéteka'' 'to hurt' vs ''ku-pwétéká'' 'to be hurt'

There is also a distinction between:
*''ndi'' 'it is' vs ''ndí'' 'and, with'

However, minimal pairs of this kind which differ in lexical tone are not particularly common.

More significant are minimal pairs in verbs, where a change of tones indicates a change in the tense, or a difference between the same tense used in a main clause and in a subordinate clause, for example:

*''ndí-ma-werénga'' 'I usually read' vs ''ndi-ma-wérenga'' 'I was reading'
*''sá-na-bwére'' 'he did not come' vs ''sa-na-bwére'' 'he has not come yet'
*''ndi-kaná-pita'' 'I would have gone' vs ''ndí-kana-píta'' 'if I had gone'
*''chaká chatha'' 'the year has finished' vs ''chaká chátha'' 'last year'
*''ndí-kana-dzíwa'' 'if I had known' vs ''ndi-kaná-dziwa'' 'I would have known'

==Reduplicated words==
[[Reduplication|Reduplicated words]] are those in which an element is repeated, such as ''chipolopolo'' 'bullet'. The tones of these have been extensively studied in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1988); Kanerva (1990), pp. 37, 49-54; Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), pp. 107-124; Myers &amp; Carleton (1996); Moto (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduplication in nouns===
In nouns, the two elements join as follows (note that hyphens have been added here for clarity, but are not used in the standard orthography of Chichewa).

LL + LL becomes LLLL (i.e. there is no additional tone):
*''chi-ng'ani-ng'ani'' 'lightning'
*''chi-were-were'' 'sex outside marriage'

LH + LH becomes LHLL (i.e. the second tone is dropped):
*''chi-mas'''ó'''-maso'' 'adultery'
*''m-leng'''á'''-lenga'' 'sky, atmosphere'
*''chi-bol'''í'''-boli'' 'wooden carving'

HL + HL becomes HLLH (or HHLH), by 'bumping':
*''chi-l'''á'''ko-lak'''ó''''' (or ''chi-l'''á'''k'''ó'''-lak'''ó''''') 'desire'
*''chi-th'''ú'''nzi-thunz'''í''''' (or ''chi-th'''ú'''nz'''í'''-thunz'''í''''') 'picture'
*''a-m'''ú'''na-mun'''á''''' (or ''a-m'''ú'''n'''á'''-mun'''á''''') 'real men'

===Reduplication in adverbs===
When adverbs are reduplicated, however, and there is an element of emphasis, the first two types have an additional tone. Thus:

LL + LL becomes LLHL (i.e. there is an additional high tone on the second element):
*''bwino-bw'''í'''no'' 'very carefully'
*''kale-k'''á'''le'' 'long ago' (or 'far off in the future')

LH + LH is also different when emphatic, becoming LHHH (or in the Southern Region HHHH):
*''kwen'''í'''-kw'''é'''n'''í''''' (or ''kw'''é'''n'''í'''-kw'''é'''n'''í''''') 'really'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''okh'''á'''-'''ó'''kh'''á''''' (or '''''ó'''kh'''á'''-'''ó'''kh'''á''''') 'only, exclusively'

When a three-syllable element is repeated, there is no special change:
*''pang''''ó'''no-pang''''ó'''no'' 'gradually'
*''kaw'''í'''ri-kaw'''í'''ri'' 'often'

===Reduplication in verbs===
A high tone following a proclitic tense-marker does not repeat when the verb is reduplicated:&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), pp. 107, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-th'''á'''ndiza-thandiza'' 'to help here and there'

However, a final or penultimate tone will usually repeat (unless the verb has only two syllables, in which case the middle tone may be suppressed):&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-thandiz'''é'''-thandiz'''é''''' 'let's help here and there'
*''nd'''í'''-ma-thand'''í'''za-thand'''í'''za'' 'I usually help here and there'
*'''''á'''-ma-yenda-y'''é'''nda'' 'they move about here and there'

===Reduplication in ideophones===
[[Ideophone]]s (expressive words) have slightly different types of reduplication. Moto (1999) mentions the following types:

All High:
*''g'''ó'''b'''é'''d'''é'''-g'''ó'''b'''é'''d'''é''''' (noise of dishes clattering)
*''b'''á'''l'''á'''l'''á'''-b'''á'''l'''á'''l'''á''''' (scattering of people or animals in all directions)

All low:
*''dzandi-dzandi'' (walking unsteadily)

High on the first syllable only:
*''ch'''é'''te-chete'' (in dead silence)

Taulbert's book ''[[Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored]]'' was adapted into the film ''[[Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Biography==
Clifton Taulbert  was born in [[Glen Allan, Mississippi]], a small town in the [[Mississippi Delta]], in 1945.  He graduated from O'Bannon High School in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] in 1963 and went on to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Oral Roberts University]] and a [[master's degree|graduate degree]] from  [[Southern Methodist University|Southwest Graduate School of Banking at Southern Methodist University]]. Taulbert served in the 89th Presidential Wing of the United States Air Force and has been inducted in the Enlisted Airmen Hall of Fame.

A former Oklahoma Banker, Taulbert is president and founder of The Freemount Corporation, a consulting company focused on human capital development and organizational effectiveness. Since the founding of the company, his philosophy has been embraced by such companies as Lockheed Martin, Bank of America, Baxter Healthcare, Pacific Coast Gas, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and K-12 and post-secondary academic leadership around the world-from China to the Mississippi Delta.

Taulbert was chosen by CNN at the turn of the millennium to represent one of the many voices of community. Taulbert who has served as a guest professor/lecturer at Harvard University, the University of Virginia Darden School of Business, and the United States Air Force Academy said he could have failed had it not been for the community of unselfish people who surrounded his life. We should never underestimate the power of our influence on the life of others, according to Taulbert.

Taulbert has authored thirteen books, several of which are foundational to his consulting philosophy: Eight Habits of the Heart and Who Owns the Ice House-Eight Life Lessons from an Unlikely Entrepreneur [Who Owns the Ice House is part of a Kauffman Foundation sponsored education initiative to expose the impact of the entrepreneurial mindset at all levels] and more recently, Shift Your Thinking: Win Where You Stand and The Invitation-living beyond the lingering lessons of race and place. Taulbert's Eight Habits has become foundational to his work on leveraging community as an asset in the workplace, and garnered him an invitation to address members of the United States Supreme Court as a personal guest of former Supreme Court Justice, Sandra Day O’Connor.

Clifton L. Taulbert is a trustee of the University of Tulsa has been recognized international by the Sales and Marketing Academy of Achievement, the Library of Congress, the NAACP, Rotary International as a Paul Harris Fellow and has been a recipient of the Jewish Humanitarian of the Year Award and the Richard Wright Literary Award. The Freemount Corporation is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

He lives in [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], with his wife Barbara Taulbert

[[File:Columella.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of Columella, holding a [[sickle]] and an [[yoke|ox-yoke]], in the Plaza de las Flores, [[Cádiz]]]]
'''Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|j|ə|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ə}}; 4 – c. 70 AD) was a prominent writer on agriculture in the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0203.xml|title=Columella - Classics - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''De Re Rustica'' in twelve volumes has been completely preserved and forms an important source on [[Roman agriculture]], together with the works of [[Cato the Elder]] and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], both of which he occasionally cites. A smaller book on trees, ''De arboribus'', is usually attributed to him.

In 1794 the Spanish botanists [[Ruiz y Pavón|Jose Antonio Pavón y Jimenez and Hipólito Ruiz López]] named a genus of Peruvian [[asterids|asterid]] ''[[Columellia]]'' in his honour.&lt;ref name=mich /&gt;

==Personal life==
Little is known of Columella's life. He was probably born in [[Cádiz|Gades]], [[Hispania Baetica]] (modern [[Cádiz]]), possibly to Roman parents. After a career in the army (he was [[tribune]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] in 35), he turned to farming his estates at Ardea, Carseoli, and Alba in Latium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History|last=von Stackelberg|first=Katharine T.|publisher=American Cancer Society|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah06080|chapter = Columella|year = 2012|isbn = 9781444338386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''De Re Rustica''==
In ancient times, Columella's work "appears to have been but little read", cited only by [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Servius]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Isidore of Seville|Isidorus]], and having fallen "into almost complete neglect" after [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] published an abridgement of it.&lt;ref name=Peck1898p383&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Peck |editor-first=Harry Thurston |editor-link=Harry Thurston Peck |title=Columella, L. Iunius Moderātus |encyclopedia=[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]] |date=1963 |orig-year=1898 |pages=383–84 |location=New York |publisher=Cooper Square Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book is presented as advice to a certain Publius Silvinus. Previously known only in fragments, the complete book was among those discovered in monastery libraries in Switzerland and France by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] and his assistant [[Bartolomeo di Montepulciano]] during the [[Council of Constance]], between 1414 and 1418.&lt;ref name=shep /&gt;

Structure of ''De Re Rustica'' ("On Rural Affairs"):
*soils
*[[viticulture]]
*fruits
*olive trees
*big animals: cattle, horses and mules
*small animals: asses, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs
*fish and fowl: chickens, doves, thrushes, peacocks, Numidian chicken and guinea fowl, geese, ducks, fish ponds
*wild animals: enclosures for wild animals, bee-keeping, production of honey and wax
*gardens
*personnel management
*calendars
*household management

Book 10 is written entirely in [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] [[hexameter]] verse, in imitation of or homage to, [[Virgil]]. It may initially have been intended to be the concluding volume, books 11 and 12 being perhaps an addition to the original scheme.&lt;ref name=Kenney /&gt;

A complete but anonymous translation into English was published by Millar in 1745.&lt;ref name=Millar /&gt; Excerpts had previously been translated by Bradley.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

==''De arboribus''==
[[File:De re rustica.tif|thumb|''De re rustica'', 1564]]
The short work ''De arboribus'', "On Trees", is in manuscripts and early editions of Columella considered as book 3 of ''De Re Rustica''.&lt;ref name=penny /&gt; However it is clear from the opening sentences that it is part of a separate and possibly earlier work. As the anonymous translator of the Millar edition notes (p.&amp;nbsp;571), there is in ''De arboribus'' no mention of the Publius Silvinus to whom the ''De Re Rustica'' is addressed.&lt;ref name=Millar /&gt; A recent critical edition of the Latin text of the ''De Re Rustica'' of Columella includes it, but as ''incerti auctoris'', by an unknown hand.&lt;ref name=rodgers /&gt; [[Cassiodorus]] mentions sixteen books of Columella, which has led to the suggestion that ''De arboribus'' formed part of a work in four volumes.&lt;ref name=penny /&gt;

==Sources==
In addition to Cato the Elder and Varro, Columella used many sources that are no longer extant and for which he is one of the few references. These include works by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] writer [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]], [[Tremellius Scrofa]], and many [[ancient Greece|Greek]] sources. His uncle Marcus Columella, "a clever man and an exceptional farmer" (VII.2.30), had conducted experiments in sheep breeding, crossing colourful wild rams, introduced from Africa for gladiatorial games, with domestic sheep,&lt;ref name=enc /&gt; and may have influenced his nephew's interests. Columella owned farms in [[Italia (Roman province)|Italy]]; he refers specifically to estates at [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], [[Carsoli|Carseoli]], and [[Alba Longa|Alba]],&lt;ref name=lacus /&gt; and speaks repeatedly of his own practical experience in agriculture.

==Principal early editions==
The earliest editions of Columella group his works with those on agriculture of [[Cato the Elder]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro Reatinus]] and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]]. Some modern library catalogues follow Brunet in listing these under "Rei rusticae scriptores" or "Scriptores rei rusticae".&lt;ref name=brunet /&gt;

'''Devan (R. Mahadevan)''' (8 September 1913 – 5 May 1957) was a 20th-century [[Tamil people|Tamil]] writer, known for his witty and humorous stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2013/sep/09/Remembering-a-literary-genius-514879.html "Remembering a literary genius"]&lt;/ref&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/he-was-a-man-of-next-generation/article18483453.ece " Human traits — Devan’s forte"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Devan was a competent and accomplished writer, who used several interesting and varied techniques in fiction writing. From travelogues to recipes, from detective stories to social dramas, he has written them all.

==Early life==
Devan was born in 1913 at Thiruvidaimarudur in Thanjavur district, [[Tamil Nadu]], India, where he did his schooling. He came to Kumbakonam Government College to complete his B.A. degree. He worked as a school teacher for a year, before joining the popular [[Tamil language|Tamil]] weekly magazine, [[Ananda Vikatan]] in 1933. Devan's first foray into the world of writing was through the humorous short story "Mister Rajamani", written when he was in his twenties.

==Life as an editor==
Devan started as a Sub-Editor at [[Ananda Vikatan]] in 1933. After [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]] left Vikatan, worked as Managing Editor from 1942 to 1957.

During this time, he wrote about 20 serials, more than 500 stories, articles and travelogues. A common feature in all his works was his gentle sense of humour. He was a very popular writer and stories abound of how, when a new issue of [[Ananda Vikatan]] came out, everyone in the family would fight to get hold of the copy first.

Devan worked under famous writers like Kalki Krishnamurthy and [[S. S. Vasan]]. It was his wish that his stories get published as books, but sadly this did not happen in his lifetime, due to the nature of his contract with Vikatan.

During this time, he also served as Chairman of the Tamil Writers' Guild twice, and helped to promote [[Tamil literature]].

Devan was the editor of Ananda Vikatan until his death in 1957. In his short life, he experimented with different types of writing – travelogues, detective novels, articles, short stories, travelogues, current affairs. Devan's books are a joy to read even today, when social values and techniques in fiction writing are so different.

About ten of Devan's writings were also dramatised by several Tamil drama troupes, even during his lifetime. He himself wrote most of the dialogues for the plays. More recently, some of his works like Thuppariyum Sambu, Sriman Sudharsanam and Mister Vedhantham were made into television serials also. Only one of his novels, gOmathiyin kAdhalan, was made into a movie, starring T. R. Ramachandran and Savithri.

==Notable works==
All of Devan's stories and travelogues were serialised in [[Ananda Vikatan]] (with, perhaps, one exception, 'Mythili' which was serialised in 'Naradar'). His writiings are copyright of the Devan Endowments. Recently, many of Devan's works have been published by Alliance Publishers, [[Chennai]], India. 'Kizakkup padhippagam' has also recently started publishing Devan's writings.
One of his novels, Justice Jagannathan, has been translated into English.

His writings include :

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">'''Diction''' ({{lang-la|dictionem}} (nom. {{lang|la|dictio}}), "a saying, expression, word"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Diction&amp;searchmode=none Diction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915232638/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Diction&amp;searchmode=none |date=2011-09-15 }}, Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; in its original, primary meaning, is a writer's or speaker's distinctive [[vocabulary]] choices and style of expression in a poem or story.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/diction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crannell97p406"&gt;Crannell (1997) ''Glossary'', p.406&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary, common meaning of "diction" means the distinctiveness of [[speech]],&lt;ref name="Crannell97p406"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Littré - Diction''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Le Roy, ''Traité pratique de la diction française'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; the art of speaking so that each word is clearly heard and understood to its fullest complexity and extremity, and concerns [[pronunciation]] and tone, rather than word choice and style. This secondary sense is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term [[enunciation]], or with its synonym [[Manner of articulation|articulation]].&lt;ref name="Crannell97p84"&gt;Crannell (1997) Part II, Speech, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Diction has multiple concerns, of which [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is foremost—another way of saying this is whether words are either [[formality|formal]] or [[colloquialism|informal]] in the social context. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes [[setting tone|tone]] and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.

[[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]] (20) states that "Diction comprises eight elements: [[Phoneme]], [[Syllable]], [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]], [[Logical connective|Connective]], [[Noun]], [[Verb]], [[Inflection]], and [[Utterance]]. However, Epps states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title       = The Poetics of Aristotle: A translation and Commentary
 |author      = Preston H. Epps.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in this passage "the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means."

==In literature==
Diction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer.

;Example : Certain writers in the modern day and age use archaic terms such as "thy", "thee", and "wherefore" to imbue a Shakespearean mood to their work.

Forms of diction include: Archaic Diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), High Diction (lofty sounding language), and Low Diction (everyday language). Each of these forms are to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author's work.

The English [[idiom]] "'''don't judge a book by its cover'''" is a [[metaphor]]ical phrase which means "you shouldn't prejudge the worth or value of something by its outward appearance alone". For example "That man may look very small and insignificant, but don't judge a book by its cover – he's a very powerful man in his circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=don't judge a book by its cover|publisher=TheIdioms.com|url=http://www.theidioms.com/cant-judge-a-book-by-its-cover/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entryism''' (also referred to as '''entrism''' or '''enterism''', or as '''infiltration''') is a [[political strategy]] in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. In situations where the organization being "entered" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and [[subversion]] to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right.

==Definitions==
Horton (2014) gives the "example of entryism – the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries".&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Richard (2014) Offline: the Kim Doctrine ''[[The Lancet]]'', Sep 6, 2014, Vol.384(9946), p.840&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: "alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries)".&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, A. (1999). Missionaries and Mandarins. ''[[United Nations Chronicle]]'', 36(2), 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialist entrism==

===Trotsky's "French Turn"===
"[[French Turn]]" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] in his essays on "the French Turn". In June 1934, he proposed that the French Trotskyists dissolve their Communist League to join the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and that it also dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition. The turn successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.

Proponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them, and steer those currents toward Leninism. However, entry lasted only for a brief period: the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the [[Workers Party of the United States]] also successfully used their entry into the [[Socialist Party of America]] to recruit their youth group and other members.  Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Poland. Entrism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.

Since the turn in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last.
* A "split perspective" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with.
* The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms,  over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the [[Militant tendency]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] whose members worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1950s on and managed to get a controlling influence in the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council|Liverpool Council]] before being expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats but few have gained the influence ''Militant'' attained (See Militant's [http://www.marxist.net/openturn/historic/index.html Problems of Entrism] pamphlet).

===Deep entrism/entryism ''sui generis''{{anchor|Deep entrism|Deep entryism|Entrism sui generis|Entryism sui generis}}===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
In these types of entrism, entrists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in hopes of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.

In entryism ''[[sui generis]]'' ("of a special type"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. "Deep entryism" refers to the long duration.

The tactic is closely identified with [[Michel Pablo]] and [[Gerry Healy]], who were leaders of the [[Fourth International]] in the late 1940s and 1950s. The "deep entry" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the [[Cold War]]. In countries where there were mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.

In Europe, this was the approach used, for example, by [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] and later [[Socialist Action (UK)|Socialist Action]] in the Labour Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn's top team encouraged street riots |last=Gilligan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Gilligan |date=26 September 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=2 April 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121300/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |archivedate=4 April 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In [[France]], Trotskyist organizations, most notably the ''[[Workers' Party (France)|Parti des Travailleurs]]'' and its predecessors, have successfully entered [[trade union]]s and mainstream [[left-wing]] parties.

===Open entrism===
{{See also|Multi-tendency|Platform (European politics)}}
Some political parties, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party in Brazil]] or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], allow political tendencies to openly organise within them. In these cases the term entryism is not usually used. Political groups which work within a larger organisation but also maintain a "public face" often reject the term "entrism" but are nevertheless sometimes considered to be entryists by the larger organisation.

==Examples by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the practice was widespread during the 1950s, where [[Communist Party of Australia|Communists]] battled against right-wing '[[Industrial Groups|Groupers]]', for control of Australian [[trade union]]s. The Groupers subsequently formed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Today the practice in Australia is often known as a type of [[branch stacking]].

In recent times [[RSPCA Australia]] has been described as being the victims of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|title=A Blind Eye", ABC Four Corners|date=21 June 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215129/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|archivedate=10 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Farmers' Federation]] and [[Animals Australia]] have each been accused of infiltrating branches of [[RSPCA Australia]] in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning [[battery hens]], [[intensive pig farming]], and the [[live export]] of sheep.

Since the 2000s the religious right has been practicing entryism into a number of state branches of the Liberal Party of Australia, notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/whos-behind-the-safe-school-videos-the-concerned-mums-political-connections-20170811-gxukuu.html|title=Who's behind the Safe School videos? The concerned mums' political connections|journal=The Age|date=12 Aug 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815171054/http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/whos-behind-the-safe-school-videos-the-concerned-mums-political-connections-20170811-gxukuu.html|archivedate=2017-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Although the term entryism was used little if at all, opponents accused [[David Orchard]] and his supporters of attempting to win the leadership of the former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) with the intention of dramatically changing its policies.

Orchard had made his name as a leading opponent of [[free trade]], which was perhaps ''the'' singular signature policy of the Progressive Conservative government of [[Brian Mulroney]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. While opponents pointed to this remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented "traditional" [[Tory]] values and economic nationalism that the ''older'' [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]], and the Progressive Conservative party before Mulroney, had espoused, namely that of [[John Diefenbaker]].

Opponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parties also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the PC Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members. They would likely have voted in favour of the merger.

[[Liberals for Life]], a [[pro-life]] group allied with the [[Campaign Life Coalition]], was accused of infiltrating the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Members of [[Socialist Action (Canada)|Socialist Action]], a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus|Socialist Caucus]], a small faction on the left wing of that [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. This however does not fit with most definitions of entryism due to their continued existence apart and separate from the NDP in addition to their work there. [[Fightback (Canada)|Fightback]], a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, modelling itself after the British [[Militant tendency]] which practiced entryism in the Labour Party and which at its peak was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.

After the fall of Social Credit in British Columbia, the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] saw the shift of former Social Credit members into the BC Liberal party.  As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right on fiscal policy.  In this way, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. This however isn't formal entryism as former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.

===China===
During the [[Warlord Era]] in China, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] joined the party of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalists]] for a time (1923–1927), creating the [[First United Front]] against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was that they might eventually gain a majority in that party and shape its policies. Eventually the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the [[Chinese Civil War]] began. The latter war was paused for a time (1936–1945) to allow for a [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule]]. However, the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950.

===Netherlands===

The [[Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands]] was a fake pro-[[China]] communist party in the [[Netherlands]] set up by the Dutch secret service [[General Intelligence and Security Service|BVD]] to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

=== New Zealand===
The country's four small Communist parties the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] (CPNZ), [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), [[Workers Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers Communist League]] (WCL), and the [[Communist League|Socialist Action League]] (SAL) have tried to influence the [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour Party]], the trade unions, and various popular issues like the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|anti-Springbok tour protests]], the [[Māori protest movement|Māori biculturalism]], and the [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|anti-nuclear movement]]. During the [[ANZUS]] diplomatic crisis 1984-85 which resulted from NZ's nuclear ship ban, the pro-[[Moscow]] SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loudon |first1=Trevor |last2=Moran |first2=Bernard |date=March 22, 2007 |title=The untold story behind New Zealand's ANZUS breakdown |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046 |deadurl=yes|journal= |location= |publisher=[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204091431/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046|archivedate=2013-02-04|accessdate=26 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gustafson |first=Barry|editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-last=Trapeznik |editor2-first=Aaron |editor2-last=Fox |title=Lenin's Legacy Down Under |publisher=Otago University Press|year=2004|pages=29–30 |chapter=Chapter 2: New Zealand in the Cold War World |isbn=1-877276-90-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's [[Christian politics in New Zealand|Christian Right]] also attempted to obtain electoral influence. During the [[New Zealand general election, 1987|1987 general election]], several conservative Christian groups including the [[Voice for Life|Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]] (SPUC), Women for Life and the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]] tried to infiltrate the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. These groups also attacked the Labour government's policies towards [[peace education]], sex education, abortion, Maori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates including Rob Wheeler ([[Mount Albert (New Zealand)|Mount Albert]]), Andrew Stanley ([[Onehunga (New Zealand electorate)|Onehunga]]), and Howard Martin ([[Papatoetoe (New Zealand electorate)|Papatoetoe]]). However, these efforts met little electoral success and the Lange government was re-elected for a second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jesson|first1=Bruce |authorlink1= |first2=Allanah |last2=Ryan |first3=Paul |last3=Spoonley |title=Revival of the Right: New Zealand Politics in the 1980s |edition=1st |publisher=Heinemann Reed |year=1988 |pages=82–84 |chapter=Chapter 4: Remoralising Politics |isbn=0-7900-0003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, another conservative tendency emerged within the National Party through the establishment of the informal Christian Voice group in 1998. However, it had faded by the mid-2000s when several minor Christian political parties including former National MP [[Graeme Lee (politician)|Graeme Lee]]'s [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrat Party]], [[Peter Dunne]]'s [[United Future]], and [[Brian Tamaki]]'s [[Destiny New Zealand]] emerged to court the evangelical Christian vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Colin |editor-first=Raymond |editor-last=Miller |title=New Zealand Government &amp; Politics, Fifth Edition |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |pages=491 |chapter=Chapter 7.3: National|isbn=9780195585094}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these attempts at taking over the party, National quietly centralised its candidate selection procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/4 |title=Party Principles - National Party |last1=James |first1=Colin |last2= |first2= |date=21 May 2012 |work= |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=5 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117072744/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/4 |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/5 |title=Party composition and organisation - National Party |last1=James |first1=Colin |last2= |first2= |date=21 May 2012 |work= |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=5 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117072749/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/5 |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these tensions with moral conservatives, National Party leader [[Don Brash]] still accepted covert assistance from the [[Exclusive Brethren#New Zealand|Exclusive Brethren]] during the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 general election]]s. This assistance included organizing a separate electoral canvassing and advertising campaign which attacked the incumbent Labour and [[Green Party of New Zealand|Green]] [[Fifth Labour Government|coalition government]]. This strategy backfired and contributed to [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]]'s second re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=A.

=== United Kingdom===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Militant "Keep Corbyn" leaflet.jpg|thumb|right|#KeepCorbyn]] --&gt;
A long-lasting entry tactic was used by the [[Militant tendency]] (a [[Trotskyist]] group), whose initially very small number of supporters worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1960s. By the early-1980s, though still only numbered in the low thousands, they had managed to gain a controlling influence of the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council]], but almost simultaneously Militant activists began to be expelled after an internal Labour ruling that their organisation breached the party's constitution. A remnant of the group now operates within the Labour Party as [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] but the (then) majority left to form the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)]].

''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist [[George Monbiot]] claims that a group influenced by the defunct [[Marxist]] ''[[Living Marxism]]'' magazine have pursued entryist tactics amongst scientific and media organisations in the UK, since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|2015 Labour leadership election]] in the United Kingdom was the target of a campaign by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' for Conservative sympathisers to join the Labour party as £3 supporters in order to vote for the left wing candidate [[Jeremy Corbyn]], with the view this would render the party un-electable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11741861/How-you-can-help-Jeremy-Corbyn-win-and-destroy-the-Labour-Party.html|title=How you can help Jeremy Corbyn win - and destroy the Labour Party|first=Telegraph Comment|last=Desk|date=15 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116171526/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11741861/How-you-can-help-Jeremy-Corbyn-win-and-destroy-the-Labour-Party.html|archivedate=16 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was labelled 'entryism' by observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/15/daily-telegraph-labour-party-jeremy-corbyn|title=Daily Telegraph urges readers to 'doom' Labour by backing Jeremy Corbyn|first=Jamie|last=Grierson|date=15 July 2015|website=the Guardian|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504144401/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/15/daily-telegraph-labour-party-jeremy-corbyn|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Focus pad.jpg|alt=|thumb|Focus mitts front and reverse sides.]]
[[Image:20140528 - Engin Karakaplan 10.jpg|thumb]]
A '''focus mitt''' is a padded target attached to a glove and usually used in training [[boxing|boxers]] and other [[combat sport|combat athletes]].

The use of focus mitts is said to have came about as Muay Thai and Far Eastern martial arts made its way toward the United States in the late 1700’s. The concept first began with  using foot tongs or slippers on hands to absorb the impact from kicks and strikes. Modern day punch mitts came into more widespread use in the mid-1960’s when Bruce Lee was seen using them in his training routines. Although they have been around for decades, they were never a central part of coaching until the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. Now they’ve become an almost irreplaceable part of a fighter’s routine.

The person holding the focus mitts will typically call out combinations and "feed" the puncher good counter-force while maneuvering and working specific skills. Focus mitts are often used as an augment to sparring, with more explicit focus on the puncher than the feeder, especially to develop good [[Punch (strike)|punch]] combinations and defensive maneuvers such as "slipping," "bobbing" and "weaving."

When wearing focus mitts it is important not merely to hold them but to actively "feed" them into the punches, to balance their force and prevent injury to both parties.

Similar to a focus mitt but designed for different purposes are heavier '''Thai pads''' used in [[muay Thai]] boxing and MMA, '''kicking shields''', '''body shields''' and '''uppercut shields''' used in a variety of [[martial arts]] to help gauge distance and practice techniques with kicks, knees, elbows and uppercuts.

==Working with focus mitts==
It is often said that holding focus mitts can be as taxing as striking them. Typically, the person wearing the focus mitts will yell a number that represents a combination. For example, yelling "three!" might signify that the striker should throw a jab, followed by a cross, followed by a hook in rapid succession. Defensive maneuvers are often incorporated into the combinations as well.

Improving punching technique relies upon the person wearing the focus mitts knowing where to set his/her hands, as well as knowing how to time the movement of the focus mitts. Typically the holder will comment on how the striker can improve his/her technique between combinations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Gaius Cassius Parmensis''' (born c. 74 BC; died 31 or 30 BC in [[Athens]]) was a Roman politician and a Latin writer of the late [[Roman Republic]], who belonged to the circle of conspirators against [[Gaius Julius Caesar]].

Cassius Parmensis came from that branch of the Roman ''gens'' [[Cassia (gens)|Cassia]], that played an important role in the founding of the city of Parma on the Via Aemilia in the second century BC. The ancient commentaries of [[Horace]] note that he was a follower of the teachings of [[Epicurus]].

In the spring of 44 BC Cassius Parmensis participated in the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassination of Caesar]] by members of the Senate. In 43 BC, following the murder, he became a ''quaestor'' and built a fleet which supported [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] off the coast of the province of Asia. At the same time he wrote a report to [[Cicero]] from Cyprus on the situation, which has been handed down in the latter's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' 12.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In November of 43 Cassius Parmensis, like many other enemies of Caesar, was declared an outlaw (proscribed) by the triumvirate of [[Mark Antony]], [[Octavian]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]]. After the defeat of the party of the murderers of Caesar in the [[Battle of Philippi]] (autumn of 42 BC), he gathered the remaining military units and was able to bring himself and the undamaged fleet to safety for a while with [[Sextus Pompeius]] in Sicily. After the latter's defeat in the year 36 BC, he accompanied the fallen "naval king" to Asia Minor, in order to join Anthony during the final battles in Bithynia.

Anthony and Octavian waged a propaganda attack with in part low blows and slanders which preceded the decisive military confrontation for autocratic rule in the Roman Empire. Cassius also took part with intense violent attacks against Caesar's heirs. He asserted that Octavian was of low descent,&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and was only named his heir due to a homosexual relationship with Caesar. Furthermore, he said that Octavian had wanted to make his only daughter Julia the consort of the rich but "barbarous" nobleman Koson of Dacia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], ''Cleopatra'', 1998, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

In 31 BC, Cassius Parmensis fought under Anthony's command at the [[Battle of Actium]]. His flight from Octavian's revenge lasted a total of twelve years (which was longer than that of all the other conspirators) but after the fall of Anthony he finally lost every possibility of fleeing, since the adopted son of Caesar now ruled the entire Roman Empire. After the defeat at Actium, he fled to Athens, where, in 30 B.C. at the very latest, he was recognized as the last murderer of Caesar still living and was killed by Lucius Varus under Octavian's orders.

As an author, Cassius Parmensis wrote tragedies, satires, elegies and epigrams, which, in Horace's opinion, were not insignificant. Unfortunately, none of his work has survived. We only know the titles of two tragedies, ''Thyestes'' and ''Brutus,'' the first of which was allegedly stolen by his murderer Varus. ''Thyestes'' was subsequently published as Varus's own work. The style of his letter to Cicero seems above all complicated and pedantic in its flatteries, but also demonstrates a good talent for military observation. As for the common assertion often referring to another location in Horace, that Cassius had been burned to death together with his works, it is probably a mix-up.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] quotes a verse of Cassius;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'' 7.72.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the same verse is also attributed in another place to the poet [[Lucius Accius]]:&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'' 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang-eo|Gerda malaperis!|label=none}}''''' ({{lang-en|Gerda Disappeared!|italics=yes}}) is a novel by [[Claude Piron]], one of the most famous novels in [[Esperanto literature]].

In the novel, dialogue begins simply and progresses in difficulty using everyday vocabulary (with word-lists available in various languages). It is suitable for beginners trying to improve their grasp of the [[Esperanto language]], and includes rehearsal of basic grammar and an entertaining story.

The mystery begins when three college students witness the strange disappearance of Gerda, a woman who is an expert in 'cryptic languages'.

Published as a book, ''Gerda malaperis!'' has since been incorporated into electronic courseware. A movie is available on DVD.

'''Griko''', sometimes spelled '''Grico''' in Salento is the dialect of [[Italiot Greek (disambiguation)|Italiot Greek]] spoken by [[Griko people]] in [[Salento]] and (sometimes spelled '''Grecanic'''&lt;ref&gt;F. Violi, ''Lessico Grecanico-Italiano-Grecanico'', Apodiafàzzi, [[Reggio Calabria]], [[1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Martino, ''L'isola grecanica dell'Aspromonte.

[[Bova (Italia)|Bova]] ([[provincia di Reggio Calabria|RC]]), [[1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Condemi, ''Grammatica Grecanica'', Coop. Contezza, [[Reggio Calabria]], [[1987]];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Romano.html In Salento e Calabria le voci della minoranza linguistica greca | Treccani, il portale del sapere&lt;!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; )in [[Calabria]]. Some Greek linguists consider it to be a [[Modern Greek]] dialect and often call it ''Katoitaliótika'' ({{lang-el|Κατωιταλιώτικα}}, "Southern Italian") or ''Grekanika'' ({{lang|el|Γρεκάνικα}}), whereas its own speakers call it ''Greko'' ({{lang|el|Γκραίκο}}, in Calabria) or ''Griko'' ({{lang|el|Γκρίκο}}, in Salento). Griko and [[Standard Modern Greek]] are partially mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The most popular hypothesis on the origin of Griko is the one by [[Gerhard Rohlfs]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Rohlfs, Griechen und Romanen in Unteritalien, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georgios Hatzidakis]], that Griko's roots go as far back in history as the time of the [[colonies in antiquity|ancient Greek colonies]] in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] in the eighth century BC. The Southern Italian dialect is thus considered to be the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed [[Magna Graecia]].

There are, however, competing hypotheses according to which Griko may have preserved some [[Doric Greek|Doric]] elements, but its structure is otherwise mostly based on [[Koine Greek]], like almost all other Modern Greek dialects.&lt;ref&gt;G. Horrocks, ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers'', London: Longman. 1997. Ch. 4.4.3 and 14.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Griko should rather be described as a Doric-influenced descendant of [[Medieval Greek]]. The idea of Southern Italy's Greek dialects being historically derived from Medieval Greek was proposed for the first time in the 19th century by Giuseppe Morosi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Morosi, Studi sui dialetti greci della terra d'Otranto, [[Lecce]], 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Two small Italiot-speaking communities survive today in the Italian regions of [[Calabria]] ([[Province of Reggio Calabria]]) and [[Apulia]] (peninsula of [[Salento]]). The Italiot-speaking area of Salento comprises nine small towns in the [[Grecìa Salentina]] region ([[Calimera]], [[Martano]], [[Castrignano de' Greci]], [[Corigliano d'Otranto]], [[Melpignano]], [[Soleto]], [[Sternatia]], [[Zollino]], [[Martignano]]), with a total of 40,000 inhabitants. The [[Calabrian Greek]] region also consists of nine villages in [[Bovesia]], (including Bova Superiore, [[Roghudi]], [[Gallicianò]], Chorìo di Roghudi and [[Bova Marina]]) and four districts in the city of [[Reggio Calabria]], but its population is significantly smaller, with around only 2000 inhabitants.

==Official status==
By Law 482 of 1999, the [[Italian parliament]] recognised the Griko communities of Reggio Calabria and Salento as a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[ethnic groups|ethnic]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[minority language|minority]]. It states that the Republic protects the language and culture of its [[Albanians|Albanian]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croats|Croat]] populations and of those who speak [[French language|French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm Law no. 482 of 1999]: "La Repubblica tutela la lingua e la cultura delle '''popolazioni''' albanesi, catalane, germaniche, '''greche''', slovene e croate e di quelle parlanti il francese, il franco-provenzale, il friulano, il ladino, l'occitano e il sardo."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
There is rich oral tradition and Griko [[folklore]]. Griko songs, [[music]] and [[poetry]] are particularly popular in Italy and [[Greece]]. Famous music groups from Salento include [[Ghetonia]] and [[Aramirè]]. Also, influential Greek artists such as [[Dionysis Savvopoulos]] and [[Maria Farantouri]] have performed in Griko. The Greek musical ensemble [[Encardia]] focuses on Griko songs as well as on the musical tradition of Southern Italy at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Website of Encardia | accessdate=2016-02-17 |url=http://www.encardia.gr/home/index.php/biography }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreekReporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsatsou|first1=Marianna|title=Charity Concert Collects Medicine and Milk Instead of Selling Tickets|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/04/22/charity-concert-collects-medicine-and-milk-instead-of-selling-tickets/|accessdate=31 December 2016|publisher=Greek Reporter|date=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karma]] is a concept in Puranic time/era which explains [[causality]] through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'s) [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] lives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | authors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to be applicable not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions and actions that others do under our instructions.&lt;ref name=Mahesh23&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] , ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 23., {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance-inline}}

==Origins==
The earliest appearance of the word ''karman'' is found in the Rigveda. The term ''karman'' also appears significantly in the Veda. According to Brahmana, "as his wife man is born to the world he has made" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western. P. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, which is the earliest of the Upanisads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, Herman W. The Vedic Origins of Karma: Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. P. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref name="michaels156"&gt;Michaels, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the Brahmanas, where words like ''punar-mrtyu''(re-death), ''punar-asu'' (coming to life again) and ''punarajati'' (rebirth) are used to denote it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. [https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfWesternAndEasternPhilosophyByRadhaKrishnan/Radhakrishnan-history.of.philosophy-Eastern.and.western-volume#page/n49/mode/2up History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western], P. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain ''punar-mrtyu'' verses of Rigveda to be discussing "repeated deaths"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in "come home once again".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

The concept of karma first appears strongly in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;''[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda,Chapter 3, Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} The topic of karma is mentioned in the [[Purana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions], By Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, page 14, University of California Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The word ‘karma’ has originated from the Sanskrit root ‘kri’ which means ‘to do’ or ‘to ‘act and react’&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 26: The Science of Kriya Yoga, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangala Bhasar Abhidhaan ( Dictioanary of the Bengali Language) Shishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt Ltd. 32A, APC Road, Kolakata – 700009, Volume 1, p.151. (ed. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Karma" literally means "action" or "reincarnation", and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness.&lt;ref name="Subra1"&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], lexicon section of his book, ''Dancing with Siva''&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is not [[destiny|fate]], for we act with what can be described as a conditioned [[free will]] creating our own destinies. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other lifetimes. Human beings are said to produce karma in four ways:&lt;ref name=Mahesh22&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] , ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 22., {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}
* through thoughts
* through right attitude words
* through actions that we perform ourselves
* through actions others perform under our instructions

Everything  that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment.&lt;ref name="Mahesh23"/&gt; Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds:&lt;ref name="Mahesh23"/&gt;

* ''[[Sanchita karma|Sanchita]]'' is the accumulated karma. It would be impossible to experience and endure all karmas in one lifetime. From this stock of ''sanchita karma'', a handful is taken out to serve one lifetime and this handful of actions, which have begun to bear fruit and which will be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as ''prarabdha karma''.
* ''[[Prarabdha karma|Prarabdha]]'' Fruit-bearing karma is the portion of accumulated karma that has "ripened" and appears as a particular problem in the present life.
* ''[[kriyamana karma|Kriyamana]]'' is everything that we produce in the current life. All ''kriyamana karmas'' flow in to ''sanchita karma'' and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body.

Some believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (kriyamana) karma.&lt;ref name="Mahesh22"/&gt; Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.&lt;ref name="chandrasekhara1"&gt;Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal, ''Dialogues with the Guru''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tulsidas]], a Hindu saint, said: "Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being." As long as the stock of ''sanchita karma'' lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as ''prarabdha karma'' for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A [[Jiva]] cannot attain [[moksha]] (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated ''sanchita karmas'' are completely exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Goyandaka J, ''The Secret of Karmayoga'', Gita Press, Gorakhpur&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}

Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called ''paap'', and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]''. As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.&lt;ref name="Subra"&gt;Subramuniyaswami, Satguru Sivaya. ''Dancing with Siva''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of divine forces==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Several different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof.

===Vedanta view===
In the theistic side of [[Vedanta]],the creator [[Ishvara]] rules over the world through the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Vedantic Meditation, pg. 4, by David Frawley at https://books.google.com/books?id=f8oWsWOKDC4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=vedanta+supreme+Being+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=50#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20supreme%20Being%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sankara (Advaita)====
In non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator is not the ultimate reality, "I am God" is the supreme truth, the pursuit of self-knowledge is spirituality, and it shares the general concepts of karma-rebirth-samsara ideas found in Buddhism with some important differences.&lt;ref&gt;Vedantic Meditation, pg. 5-6, by David Frawley at https://books.google.com/books?id=f8oWsWOKDC4C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=vedanta+supreme+Being+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=50#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20supreme%20Being%20karma&amp;f=false Quote - "&lt;/ref&gt;

In a commentary to [[Brahma Sutras]] (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, [[Adi Sankara]], an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities  like  [[adrsta]]—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered  through  the action  of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being ([[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce R.  | title =Karma, causation, and divine intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages = 135–149 [145]  | publisher =University of Hawaii Press  | location =Hawaii  | date = April 1989  | url =http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm  | accessdate = 2009-12-29 | doi=10.2307/1399374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human's karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the ax moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law  of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons  have earned  by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [a "judge and police-force" working for "the law"] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits.&lt;ref&gt;see,Theistic Explanations of Karma, pg. 146 of Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm citing Sankara's commentary on Brahma Sutras,III, 2, 38, and 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences.&lt;ref&gt;See, Theistic Explanations of Karma, Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm citing Sankara's commentary on Brahma Sutras,III, 2, 38, and 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different "just" consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., Vishnu (King of Kings).

;Advaita according to Sivananda
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]]. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] (4:6) illustrating this concept:

:''Two birds of beautiful plumage — inseparable friends — live on the same tree. Of these two one eats the sweet fruit while the other looks on without eating.''

In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents [[Brahman]] or [[God]]. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten.

Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of [[social inequality]], fate, and universal [[suffering]] in the world. According to the [[Brahma Sutras]], individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.

In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Adhikarana XII'', Sutras 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Ramanuja]] of the [[Vishishtadvaita]] school, another sub-school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of [[jiva]]s (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is "amala," or without any stain of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Sri Bhasya]], Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a [[Vaishnavite]] theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as [[Vishnu]], arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/brahma_sutra/sribhashya_ramanuja/vedanta_sutra_commentary_ramanuja204.php |title=SriBhashya - Ramanujas Commentary On Brahma Sutra (Vedanta Sutra) - Brahma Sutra Sribhashya Ramanuja Vedanta Sutra Commentary Ramanuja204 |publisher=Bharatadesam.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}

Ramanuja, reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., [[Abrahamic religions]], which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"/&gt; Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of [[Jiva]]s (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"/&gt;

Although souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta).&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' p 57.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ramanuja, all [[jiva]]s are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only  to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"/&gt; According to the foregoing concept, God is "compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures," but the merits or demerit "devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the light."&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"/&gt;

Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that [[Vishnu]] wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath, ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Volume III, ''Philosophy of the Ramanuja School of Thought'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

====Madhva (Dvaita)====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], the founder of the [[Dvaita]] school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pgs. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the [[jiva]]s (souls) are not God's [[Creation myth|creation]] as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with [[Vishnu]], although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"/&gt;

According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda1781"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta''pgs. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]] as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda1781"/&gt;

Swami [[Tapasyananda]] further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (''jivas'') move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"/&gt;

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of [[eternity|eternal]] [[damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ([[Mukti-yogyas]]), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration ([[Nitya-samsarins]]), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimamsa view===

Earlier historical traditions of Hinduism such as [[Mimamsa]]kas, reject any such notions of divinity being responsible and see karma as acting independently, considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, The Hindu Religious Tradition 54-80 (Allied Pub. 1976) {{ISBN|0-7100-8668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. II, at 217-225 (18th reprint 1995) {{ISBN|81-85301-75-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Michaels, Hinduism: Past and Present 154-56 (Princeton 1998) {{ISBN|0-691-08953-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mimamsakas it is useless to set up a God for that purpose, since Karma itself can give the result at a future time.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Brahma Sutras III.2.38. Vireswarananda, {{ISBN|978-8185301952}}, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof of existence of God from Karma===

In the later writings in the [[Nyaya]], school of philosophy, [[Udayana]]'s ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'' used Karma for the last of his nine proofs of the existence of a creative God:&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp.209-10&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Nyaya#Nyaya on God and salvation|Nyaya on God and Salvation]].

Swami [[Sivananda Saraswati]] puts it like this:

:: {{quote|"Some people die when they are eighty years old; some die when they are in the womb; some die at twenty; some at forty. What is the cause for the variation? Who has fixed the span of life for all? This clearly proves that there is the theory of Karma, that there is one Omniscient Lord, who is the dispenser of the fruits of the actions of the Jivas, who fixes the span of life of the Jivas in accordance with their nature of Karma or actions, who knows the exact relation between Karmas and their fruits. As Karma is Jada or insentient, it certainly cannot dispense with the fruits of their actions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/download/god_exists.htm God Exists] SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA, A DIVINE LIFE SOCIETY PUBLICATION, First Edition: 1958, World Wide Web (WWW) Edition : 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}}}

==Views of the theistic Hindu traditions believing in a supreme God==
{{Tone|section|date=December 2014}}
Sivananda concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Shaivism===

====Thirugnana Sambandar====
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action philosophy]] and [[value theory]]: if we sow goodness, we will reap goodness.]]
[[Sambandar]] of the [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] school, in the 7th century C.E., writes about karma in his outline of [[Shaivism]]. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"&gt;Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy, pg. 34, by Vraj Kumar Pandey, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt; Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent [[Supreme Being]] with perfect wisdom and power ([[Shiva]], for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt; In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt;

====Appayya Dikshita====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Appayya Dikshita]], a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath, ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Volume V, ''The Southern Schools of Saivism'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.

====Srikantha====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
Srikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds.&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath. ''A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume V: The Southern Schools of Saivism'', pp. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one's karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man's free will, or as determined in later stages by man's own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"/&gt; In this way, God is ultimately responsible on one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans' moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds.&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"/&gt; A good summary of his view is that "man is responsible, free to act as he wills to, for Siva only fulfills needs according to the soul's karma." &lt;ref&gt;Hinduism Today, March 1994 issue at http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaishnavism===

====Sacred Texts====

=====Bhagavata Purana=====
In Chapter 1 of 10th book of the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Vasudeva]], the father of [[Krishna]], exhorts [[Kamsa]] to refrain from killing his wife, [[Devaki]], the mother of [[Krishna]], by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], IV:4:3.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Krishna, the Beautiful Legend of God, pgs 11-12, and commentary pgs. 423-424, by Edwin Bryant&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as [[Bhagavad Gita]], VIII, verse 6 &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], [[Associate Professor]] of [[religion]] at [[Rutgers University]], [[New Jersey]] provided the foregoing commentaries on the discussion of Vasudeva in the Bhagavata Purana.

=====Vishnu Sahasranama=====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
Many names in the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], the thousand names of [[Vishnu]] allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]]'s interpretation means, "One who directly sees the merits ([[Dharma]]) and demerits ([[Adharma]]), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them." &lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 62''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name.&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pgs. 48, 49, 87, 96 and 123. ''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bhavanah, according to Sankara's interpretation, means "One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all [[Jiva]]s (souls) for them to enjoy."&lt;ref name="tapasyananda"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 48.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Brahma Sutra]] (3.2.28) "Phalmatah upapatteh" speaks of the Lord's function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the [[jiva]]s.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda"/&gt;

====Vaishnavite Vedanta schools of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Madhva's Dvaita====

See above discussion of karma under the Vedanta sections of Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita) and Madhva (Dvaita) for treatment of karma under the two Vaishnavite teachers.

====Gaudiya Vaishnavism view====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
"''According to their '''karma''''', all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. ''Out of '''many millions''' of wandering living entities'', one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of [[Krishna]]. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service."&lt;ref&gt;C.C.Madhya 19-151-164&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Vaishnavite thoughts====
[[Kulashekhara]] Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his "[[Mukundamala]] Stotra": 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam'. And purva-karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen [[adrsta]] by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa.&lt;ref&gt;"Mukundamala Stotra". Author: Kulashekhara Alwar. Verse: 5. Publisher: Lakshmi Venkateshwara Press, Kalyan, Mumbai. Year: Samvat 1980&lt;/ref&gt; God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked.

===Nyaya===
The [[Nyaya]] school, one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, states that one of the proofs of the existence of God is karma;&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"&gt;See Theistic Explanations of Karma, pg. 146 of Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach, citing Uddyotakara, Nyaayavaarttika, IV, 1, 21, at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God.&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"/&gt; This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is the same as that of [[Vedanta]] and [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1996)p.11&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the Nyaya school provides the moral argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1996)p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharmaśāstras==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
In Hinduism, more particularly the [[Dharmaśāstra]]s, Karma is a principle in which "cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds".&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions.  The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] states, "According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. An as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap".&lt;ref&gt;IV. 4. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, [[Chandogya Upanishad]], [[Markandeya Purana]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[shastra]]s written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different object when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka-grhya-sutra states, "some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;5.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

More extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. "Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., [[jāti (Buddhism)|jati]] (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation of bad karma==

According to a theistic view, the effects of one's bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include following, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others;  yoga, or worshiping God in order to receive grace; and  conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as  or to get grace of God. Editors of Hinduism Today Magazine, What is Hinduism?   &lt;ref&gt;http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/wih/&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, [[Ganesha]] can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him.&lt;ref&gt;Loving Ganesa, Chapter 1, at http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/lg/lg_ch-01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of getting God's grace are further illustrated below.

===Upanishads===
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creator, i.e., [[Isvara]] and the doctrine of grace.&lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj 1997, pg. 25"&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 25, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara's pleasure.&lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj pg. 25"&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 25, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma.
As [[Adi Sankara]] stated in his commentary on [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI:4, "If we dedicate all our works to [[Ishvara]], we will not be subject to the law of karma." &lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj 1997, pg. 25"/&gt;

==Relation between birth in a particular body to karma==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
{{See also|Reincarnation}}
Theistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a [[worm]], [[insect]], [[fish]], [[bird]], [[lion]], [[boar]], [[snake]] or a [[human]], is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 21, at  https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]] 5.10.7 distinguishes between good birth such as birth in a spiritual family, i.e., ([[brahmin]] caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a [[dog]] or [[Domestic pig|hog]].) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from [[plant]]s to various types of [[animal]]s, and to even differences between members of the same species, such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 22, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.&lt;ref&gt;''[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda,Chapter 4,9, 18,Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between astrology and karma==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
Charles Keyes, professor emeritus at the [[University of Washington]] and [[E. Valentine Daniel]], professor of anthropology at [[Columbia University]] state that many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the "fruit of karma." &lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"&gt;Karma, an anthropological inquiry, pg. 134, at https://books.google.com/books?id=49GVZGD8d4oC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=shani+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=shani%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Navagraha]], planetary deities, including [[Shani]] (Saturn), are considered subordinate to [[Ishvara]] (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"/&gt; Thus, these planets can influence earthly life.&lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"/&gt;

Such planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including [[Jyotiṣa]], the Hindu system of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Karma, an anthropological inquiry, pgs. 133-134, at https://books.google.com/books?id=49GVZGD8d4oC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=shani+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=shani%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses in Hinduism==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Besides narrow meaning of karma as the reaction or suffering being due to karma of their past lives and that one would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction.

Thus, karma in Hinduism may mean an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the specific combination it takes specific meanings, such as ''karma-yoga'' or ''karma-kanda'' means "yoga or actions" and "path of materialistic activity" respectively. Yet another example is [[Nitya karma]], which describes rituals which have to be performed daily by Hindus, such as the [[Sandhyavandanam]] which involves chanting of the [[Gayatri Mantra]].

Other uses include such expressions such as "ugra-karma", meaning bitter, unwholesome labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Satsvarupa | last   =Dasa Goswami | authorlink = Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| title =Prabhupada Lila  |publisher=| year = 1983 | chapter = SPL A Summer in Montreal, 1968 |isbn =   0-911233-36-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that Karma has a role in Hindu society as a whole. When one abides by their caste duty good Karma is earned and vice versa; and the Karma one collects is reflected in the next life as movement within the Caste system. The promise of upward mobility appealed to people, and was made plausible through Karma. This effectively "tamed" the lower castes into passive acceptance of the status quo. Thus, the Karma doctrine discouraged actual social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Eliza. "What's Written on the Forehead Will Never Fail": Karma, Fate, and Headwriting in Indian Folktales." Asian Ethnology. 68.1 (2009): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Zamenhof-1879.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Zamenhof, around 1879]]

Zamenhof was born on 15 December (3 December [[Old Style date|OS]]) 1859, the son of Markus Zamenhof (27 January 1837 - 29 November 1907) and Rozalia Zamenhof (1839 - 1 September 1892), in the multi-ethnic city of [[Białystok]], now in Poland, at that time in [[Grodno Governorate]] in the [[Russian Empire]] as a result of the 1807 [[Treaties of Tilsit]]. His parents were of [[Litvaks|Litvak]] [[Jewish]] descent that inhabited the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. He appears to have been natively bilingual in [[Yiddish]] and Russian.&lt;ref name="Kiselman"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/pau2008.pdf | title=Esperanto: Its Origins and Early History | publisher=[[Polish Academy of Learning]] | work=Prace Komisji Spraw Europejskich PAU. Tom II, pp. 39–56 | year=2008 | accessdate=15 December 2014 | author=Christer Kiselman | page=2 | quote=What was his first language? He wrote in a letter in 1901 that his "parental language" (mother tongue) was Russian, but that at the time he was speaking more in Polish (Zamenhof 1929:523). However, all other evidence points to Yiddish as his mother tongue and first language. }}&lt;/ref&gt; From his father, a teacher of German and French, he learned those languages and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well. Despite this he spoke [[Polish language|Polish]], one of the major languages of Białystok alongside Yiddish, [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and German, and it was Polish that was to become the native language of his children after settling in [[Warsaw]]. In school he studied the classical languages: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. He later learned some English, though in his own words not very well, had an interest in Lithuanian and Italian, and learned [[Volapük]] when it came out in 1880, though by that point his international language project was already well developed.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Kiselman, [http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/pau2008.pdf "Esperanto: Its origins and early history"], in Andrzej Pelczar, ed., 2008, ''Prace Komisji Spraw Europejskich PAU'', vol. II, pp. 39–56, Krakaw.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Claude Piron |title=Kontribuaĵo al la studo pri la influoj de la jida sur Esperanton |journal=Jewish Language Review |volume=4 |year=1984 |url=http://user.in-berlin.de/~maxnet/esperanto/piron/jida.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Yiddish-speaking [[Jewish]] majority, the population of Białystok was made up of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Poles]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Russians]] (mainly government officials), with smaller groups of [[Belarusians]],
[[Germans]] and other ethnic groups. Zamenhof was saddened and frustrated by the many quarrels among these groups. He supposed that the main reason for the hate and prejudice lay in the mutual misunderstanding caused by the lack of one common language. If such a language existed, Zamenhof postulated, it could play the role of a neutral communication tool between people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/birth-ludwig-zamenhof-creator-esperanto|title=Birth of Ludwig Zamenhof, creator of Esperanto {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=History}}

As a student at secondary school in [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]], Zamenhof made attempts to create some kind of international language with a grammar that was very rich, but also very complex. When he later studied English, he decided that the international language must have a simpler grammar. Apart from his parents' native languages Russian and [[Yiddish]] and his adopted language [[Polish language|Polish]], his linguistics attempts were also aided by his mastering of German, a good passive understanding of [[Latin language|Latin]], Hebrew and French, and a basic knowledge of Greek, English and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Holzhaus, Adolf: ''Doktoro kaj lingvo Esperanto''. Helsinki: Fondumo Esperanto. 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1878, his project ''Lingwe uniwersala''{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} was almost finished. However, Zamenhof was too young then to publish his work. Soon after graduation from school he began to study medicine, first in Moscow, and later in Warsaw. In 1885, Zamenhof graduated from a university and began his practice as a doctor in [[Veisiejai]] and after 1886 as an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] in [[Płock]] and Vienna. While healing people there he continued to work on his project of an international language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Unua libro per russi - 1887 - 1a edizione - copertina fronte.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Unua libro'' published in Russian, 1887]]

For two years he tried to raise funds to publish a booklet describing the language until he received the financial help from his future wife's father. In 1887, the book titled ''Международный язык. Предисловие и полный учебник'' (International language: Introduction and complete textbook) was published in Russian&lt;ref&gt;Keith Brown and Sarah Ogilvie, ''Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World'' (Elsevier, 2009: {{ISBN|0-08-087774-5}}), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; under the pseudonym "Doktoro Esperanto" (Doctor Hopeful). Zamenhof initially called his language "Lingvo internacia" (international language), but those who learned it began to call it ''Esperanto'' after his pseudonym, and this soon became the official name for the language. For Zamenhof this language, far from being merely a communication tool, was a way of promoting the peaceful coexistence of different people and cultures.&lt;ref name="Jason Zasky"&gt;{{citation |title=Discouraging Words |magazine=Failure Magazine |date=20 July 2009 |first=Jason |last=Zasky |quote=But in terms of invented languages, it's the most outlandishly successful invented language ever.

===Work on Yiddish language and Jewish issues===
[[File:1910-Universo-p322-llzdet.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Zamenhof at his desk in [[Warsaw]] apartment, 1910]]
In 1879 Zamenhof wrote the first grammar of the [[Yiddish language]], which he published in part years later in the Yiddish magazine ''Lebn un visnshaft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vilnius]], 1909; see Esperanto translation as ''Pri jida gramatiko kaj reformo en la jida'' (On Yiddish grammar and reform in Yiddish) in ''Hebreo el la geto: De cionismo al hilelismo'' (A Hebrew from the ghetto: From Zionism to Hillelism), ''Eldonejo Ludovikito'', vol. 5, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The complete original Russian text of this manuscript was only published in 1982, with parallel Esperanto translation by [[Adolf Holzhaus]], in ''L. Zamenhof, provo de gramatiko de novjuda lingvo'' [An attempt at a grammar of neo-Jewish language], Helsinki, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–36. In this work, not only does he provide a review of Yiddish grammar, but also proposes its transition to the Latin script and other orthographic innovations. In the same period Zamenhof wrote some other works in Yiddish, including perhaps the first survey of Yiddish poetics (see p.&amp;nbsp;50 in the above-cited book).

In 1882 a wave of [[pogrom]]s within the [[Russian Empire]], including [[Congress Poland]], motivated Zamenhof to take part in the early Zionist movement, the [[Hovevei Zion|Hibbat Zion]].&lt;ref name="maimon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=N. Z. Maimon |journal=Nica Literatura Revuo |issue=3/5 |date=May–June 1958 |title=La cionista periodo en la vivo de Zamenhof |pages=165–177 |url=http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr35/cionistau.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719082100/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr35/cionistau.html |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the movement in 1887, and in 1901 published a statement in Russian with the title ''Hillelism'', in which he argued that the [[Zionism|Zionist project]] could not solve the problems of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="maimon"/&gt;

In 1914 he declined an invitation to join a new organization of Jewish Esperantists, the TEHA. In his letter to the organizers, he said, "I am profoundly convinced that every nationalism offers humanity only the greatest unhappiness&amp;nbsp;... It is true that the nationalism of oppressed peoples – as a natural self-defensive reaction – is much more excusable than the nationalism of peoples who oppress; but, if the nationalism of the strong is ignoble, the nationalism of the weak is imprudent; both give birth to and support each other&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="maimon"/&gt; Among the many works of Zamenhof translated into Esperanto is the [[Hebrew Bible]] or the Old Testament.

Zamenhof died in Warsaw on 14 April 1917, possibly of heart failure,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/collections/esperanto/Planned_languages_Ludwig_Lazar_Zamenhof.htm "Ludwig Lazar Zamenhof – Founder of Esperanto"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060531/http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/collections/esperanto/Planned_languages_Ludwig_Lazar_Zamenhof.htm |date=24 September 2015 }}, Department of Planned Languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]]. The farewell speech was delivered by the chief rabbi and preacher of the [[Great Synagogue, Warsaw|Great Synagogue in Warsaw]], [[Samuel Abraham Poznański]], who said: "There will be a time where the Polish soil and nation will understand what fame gave this great son of God to his homeland."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070630123854/http://www.szukamypolski.pl/rzeznia.php?id=22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ludwik Zamenhof speaking.ogg|thumb|right|Zamenhof speaking at the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in Barcelona (Spain) in 1909.]]

===Religious philosophy===
{{main|Homaranismo}}
Besides his linguistic work, Zamenhof published a religious philosophy he called ''Homaranismo'' (the term in Esperanto, usually rendered as "humanitism" in English,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/9810/1/J-McElvenny2013.pdf Meaning in the Age of Modernism: C. K. Ogden and his contemporaries, Thesis of James McElvenny, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes rendered loosely as humanitarianism or humanism), based on the principles and teachings of [[Hillel the Elder]]. He said of Homaranismo: "It is indeed the object of my whole life. I would give up everything for it."&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Privat, "The Life of Zamenhof" p 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name discrepancy==
[[File:1905-uk-z-m.jpg|thumb|Families Zamenhof and {{Ill|Alfred Michaux|fr}} at the first Esperanto Congress, Boulogne 1905]]
Zamenhof came from and lived a very-much multilingual life. His name is/was variously translitterated, depending on the language:
* English: Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof – {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɑː|m|ɪ|n|h|ɒ|f|,_|-|n|ɒ|v|,_|-|n|ɒ|f}}
* [[Esperanto (language)|Esperanto]]: {{lang|eo|Ludoviko Lazaro Zamenhofo}} – {{IPA-eo|ludoˈviko laˈzaro zamenˈhofo}}
* German: {{lang|de|Ludwig "Levi" Lazarus Samenhof}}
* [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אליעזר לודוויג זמנהוף}} – ''Eliezer Ludwig Zamenhof''
* [[Polish (language)|Polish]]: {{lang|pl|Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof}}
* Russian: {{lang|ru|Лю́двик Ла́зарь "Лейзер" Ма́ркович Заменго́в}} – ''Lyudvik Lazar' "Leizer" Markovich Zamengov''
* [[Yiddish (language)|Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|לײזער לֵוִי זאַמענהאָף}} – ''Leyzer "Levi" Zamenhof''

At his birth Zamenhof was given the Hebrew name ''Eliezer'' by his parents, the equivalent of the Latinized ''Lazarus''. However Zamenhof was born under Russian domination, and so his birth certificate records his name as {{lang|ru|Лейзер Заменго́в}} ''Leyzer Zamengov'', using the Yiddish form of the forename and a russified version of his surname;&lt;ref name="bialystok"&gt;[http://www.bialystok.ap.gov.pl/bit/50lat/boznicze_zamenhof1.jpg Birth Certificate N 47: "Leyzer Zamengov, son of Mordkha Fayvelovich Zamengov and Liba Sholemovna Sofer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722014023/http://www.bialystok.ap.gov.pl/bit/50lat/boznicze_zamenhof1.jpg |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many later Russian language documents also include the [[patronymic]] ''Markovich'', as is the custom in the language. His family name is of German origin and was originally written ''Samenhof''; the spelling Zamenhof reflects the romanization of the Yiddish spelling {{lang|yi|זאַמענהאָף}}, as well as the Esperanto and Polish spellings.

In his adolescence he used both the Yiddish ''Leyzer'' and the Russian ''Lazar''.

While at university, Zamenhof began using the Russian name ''Lyudovik'' (also transcribed ''Ludovic'' or translated as ''Ludwig'') in place of ''Lazar'', possibly in honor of [[Francis Lodwick]], who in 1652 had published an early [[conlang]] proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Umberto Eco &amp; James Fentress | title=The Search for the Perfect Language | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | page=324 | date=9 September 1995 | isbn=978-0-631-17465-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When his brother Leon became a doctor and started signing his name "Dr L. Zamenhof",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wincewicz|first1=Andrzej|authorlink=|last2=Sulkowska |first2=Mariola|last3=Musiatowicz |first3=Marcin|last4=Sulkowski|first4=Stanislaw|date=June 2009|title=Laryngologist Leon Zamenhof—brother of Dr. Esperanto|journal=[[American Journal of Audiology]]|volume=18|issue=1|pages=3–6| issn = 1059-0889| pmid = 18978199|doi = 10.1044/1059-0889(2008/08-0002)| bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zamenhof reclaimed his birth name ''Lazar'' and from 1901 signed his name "Dr L. L. Zamenhof" to avoid confusion with his brother. The two L's do not seem to have specifically represented either name, and the order ''Ludwik Lazar'' is a modern convention.

==Honours and namesakes==
[[File:L.Zamenhof.jpg|thumb|upright|L. L. Zamenhof Statue in [[Prilep]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]]]
In 1905 Zamenhof received [[Legion of Honour|the Légion d'honneur]] for creating Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 россиянина, награждённые орденом Почётного легиона за необычные заслуги (3 Russians Awarded Légion d'honneur for Unusual Merits)|url=http://sobesednik.ru/incident/20130816-3-samykh-neobychnykh-nagrazhdeniya-rossiyan-ordenom-pochetnogo-legiona|publisher=Russian Daily "Sobesednik"|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Zamenhof was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], by four British members of parliament (including [[James O'Grady]], [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]]) and Professor Stanley Lane Poole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=7918 Nobel Prize nomnination database]&lt;/ref&gt; (The Prize was instead awarded to the [[International Peace Bureau]].) On the occasion of the 5th [[Universala Kongreso de Esperanto]] in Barcelona, Zamenhof was made a Commander of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] by King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webislam.com/?idt=19050 Olaizola, Borja. "Chatear en Esperanto, vigésimo idioma del mundo más usado en la red." ''El Correo''. 30/03/2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minor planet]] [[1462 Zamenhof]] is named in his honor. It was discovered on 6 February 1938, by [[Yrjö Väisälä]]. Also, hundreds of city streets, parks, and bridges worldwide have been named after Zamenhof.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[:eo:Listo de ZEO-j|list of Zamenhof/Esperanto Objects]] on the Wikipedia in Esperanto&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lithuania]], the best-known Zamenhof Street is in [[Kaunas]], where he lived and owned a house for some time. There are others in Poland, the United Kingdom, France, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], Spain (mostly in [[Catalonia]]), Italy, [[Israel]], Belgium and [[Brazil]]. There are Zamenhof Hills in Hungary and Brazil, and a Zamenhof Island in the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esperanto-sat.info/article187.html Hommages au Dr Zamenhof, à l'espéranto et à ses pionniers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Israeli cities, street signs identify Esperanto's creator and give his birth and death dates, but refer to him solely by his Jewish name Eliezer (a variant of which, El'azar, is the origin of Lazarus). Zamenhof is honored as a deity by the Japanese religion [[Oomoto]], which encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers. Also, a genus of [[lichen]] has been named ''Zamenhofia'' in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkive.org/species/ARK/fungi/Zamenhofia_rosei/more_info.html Zamenhofia rosei: Francis' lichen. Range, habitat, biology].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Unesco honoured Zamenhof in the occasion of his centenary.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Telegraphic Agency: [http://www.jta.org/1959/12/16/archive/unesco-to-honor-memory-of-zamenhof-jewish-creator-of-esperanto UNESCO to Honor Memory of Zamenhof, Jewish Creator of Esperanto], 16 December 1959&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Unesco decided to support the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Ludwik Zamenhof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235205e.pdf Unesco]; [http://uea.org/aktuale/komunikoj/2015/Gxenerala-Konferenco-de-Unesko-finigxis-%E2%80%93-Zamenhof-omagxota UEA: Zamenhof omaĝota]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zamenhof was 12 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franceinter.fr/societe/esperanto-cent-ans-mort-createur-zamenhof|title=Espéranto, la langue qui se voulait "universala"|last=|first=|date=2017-04-14|website=France Inter|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His birthday, 15 December, is celebrated annually as [[Zamenhof Day]] by users of Esperanto. On 15 December 2009, Esperanto's [[Esperanto symbols|green-starred flag]] flew on the [[Google search]] web page, in a commemorative [[Google logo|Google Doodle]] to mark Zamenhof's 150th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/doodles/150th-birthday-of-ll-zamenhof Google Doodles Archive: 150th Birthday of LL Zamenhof] Retrieved 1 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house of the Zamenhof family, dedicated to Ludwik Zamenhof, and the Białystok Esperanto Centre, are sites of the [[Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok]], which was opened in June 2008 by volunteers at [[The University of Białystok Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://szlak.uwb.edu.pl/sites.html Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok] accessed 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LaoText}}
'''Lao''', sometimes referred to as '''Laotian''' ({{lang|lo|ລາວ}} 'Lao' or ພາສາລາວ 'Lao language') is a [[tonal language]] of the [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] language family. It is the official language of [[Laos]], and it is also spoken in northeast [[Thailand]], where it is usually referred to as the [[Isan language]]. A language of the ethnic [[Lao people]], Lao serves as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among all citizens of Laos. Approximately 90 different languages are spoken within its borders, many of which are unrelated to Lao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/lao|title=Lao {{!}} About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Lao (language) is heavily influenced by the [[Thai language]]. A vast number of technical terms as well as common usage are adopted directly from Thai.  

Like other [[Tai languages]], Lao has a complex [[orthography]] and system of [[marker (linguistics)|relational marker]]s. Spoken Lao is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Isan language|Isan]], fellow [[Southwestern Tai languages]], to a significantly high degree where its speakers are able to effectively communicate each speaking their  respective language. These languages are written with slightly different scripts but are linguistically similar and effectively form a [[dialect continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/node3.html |title=Ausbau and Abstand languages |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date=1995-01-20 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lao is written with the [[Lao script]], a traditional [[abugida]]. Although there is no official standard, the [[Vientiane]] dialect has become the [[de facto]] standard in the second half of 20th century.

==History==
{{further information|Baiyue#Language|Chu (state)#Language|Tai languages|Tai peoples}}
The Lao language is descended from [[Tai languages]] spoken in what is now southern [[China]] and northern [[Vietnam]] in areas believed to be the homeland of the language family and where several related languages are still spoken by scattered minority groups. 

Due to Han Chinese expansion, Mongol invasion pressures, and a search for lands more suitable for [[paddy field|wet rice]] cultivation, the [[Tai peoples]] moved south towards India, down the Mekong River valley, and as far south as the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The oral history of the migrations is preserved in the legends of [[Khun Borom]]. Tai speakers in what is now Laos pushed out or absorbed earlier groups of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages.

In addition to the dialects of Lao, numerous closely related languages (or dialects, depending on the classification) are spoken throughout the Lao-speaking areas of Laos and Thailand, such as the [[Nyaw people]], [[Phu Thai language|Phu Thai]], [[Saek language|Saek]], [[Lao Wiang]], [[Tai Dam language|Tai Dam]], and [[Tai Daeng language|Tai Daeng]]. These Tai peoples are classified by the Lao government as Lao Loum ({{lang|lo|ລາວລຸ່ມ}}, láo lūm) or ''lowland Lao''. Lao and Thai are also very similar and share most of their basic vocabulary, but differences in many basic words limit [[Mutual intelligibility|inter-comprehension]].

==Vocabulary==
{{see also| Indosphere | Greater India | Sanskrit#usage | label 3 = Sanskrit global usage}}
The Lao language consists primarily of native Lao words. Because of [[Buddhism]], however, [[Pali]] has contributed numerous terms, especially relating to religion and in conversation with members of the [[sangha]]. Due to their proximity, Lao has influenced the Khmer and Thai languages and vice versa.

Formal writing has a larger number of [[loanword]]s, especially [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]], much as Latin and Greek have influenced European languages. For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, plus ending statements with {{lang|lo|ແດ່}} (dǣ {{IPA|[dɛː]}}) or {{lang|lo|ເດີ້}} (dœ̄ {{IPA|[dɤ̂ː]}}). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with {{lang|lo|ດອກ}} (dǭk {{IPA|[dɔ᷆ːk]}}). The following are formal register examples.
* {{lang|lo|ຂອບໃຈຫຼາຍໆເດີ້}} (khǭp chai lāi lāi dœ̄, {{IPA|[kʰɔ᷆ːp t͡ɕàj lǎːj lǎːj dɤ̂ː]}}) ''Thank you very much''.
* {{lang|lo|ຂ້ານ້ອຍເຮັດບໍ່ໄດ້ດອກ}} (khānǭi het bǭ dai dǭk, {{IPA|[kʰa᷆ːnɔ̂ːj hēt bɔ̄ː dâj dɔ᷆ːk]}}) ''I cannot''.
* {{lang|lo|ໄຂປະຕູໃຫ້ແດ່}} (khai pa tū hai dǣ, {{IPA|[kʰǎj pa.tùː ha᷆j dɛ̄ː ]}}) ''Open the door, please''.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Many consonants in Lao make a [[phonemic]] contrast between [[labialized]]{{Dubious |Consonant Clusters |reason=More likely a cluster, and apparently archaic as well |date=February 2016}} and plain versions. The complete inventory of Lao consonants is as shown in the table below:&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Blaine Erickson, 2001. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/erickson2001origins.pdf "On the Origins of Labialized Consonants in Lao"]. Analysis based on L.&amp;nbsp;N. Morev, A.&amp;nbsp;A. Moskalyov and Y.&amp;nbsp;Y. Plam, (1979). ''The Lao Language''. Moscow: USSR Academy of Sciences, Institute of Oriental Studies. Accessed 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tones===
Lao has six lexical tones.&lt;ref&gt;Blaine Erickson, 2001. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/erickson2001origins.pdf "On the Origins of Labialized Consonants in Lao"]. Analysis based on T. Hoshino and R. Marcus (1981). ''Lao for Beginners: An Introduction to the Spoken and Written Language of Laos''. Rutland/Tokyo: Tuttle. Accessed 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unchecked syllables====
There are six phonemic tones in unchecked syllables, that is, in syllables ending in a vowel or other [[Sonorant|sonorant sound]] ({{IPA|[m], [n], [ŋ], [w],}} and {{IPA|[j]}}).

The number of contrastive tones is reduced to four in checked syllables, that is, in syllables ending in an [[Obstruent|obstruent sound]] ({{IPA|[p], [t], [k],}} or the 
[[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}).

|-
| falling || {{IPA|/hâːk/}}&lt;br&gt;ຮາກ || vomit, root
|}

===Syllables===
Lao syllables are of the form (C)V(C), i.e., they consist of a vowel in the [[syllable nucleus]], optionally preceded by a single consonant in the [[syllable onset]] and optionally followed by single consonant in the [[syllable coda]]. The only consonant clusters allowed are syllable initial clusters {{IPA|/kw/ or /kʰw/}}. Any consonant may appear in the onset, but the labialized consonants do not occur before [[rounded vowel]]s.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt;

One difference between Thai and Lao is that in Lao initial clusters are simplified. For example, the official name of Laos is Romanized as ''Sathalanalat Paxathipatai Paxaxon Lao'', with the Thai analogue being ''Satharanarat Prachathipatai Prachachon Lao'' (สาธารณรัฐประชาธิปไตยประชาชนลาว), indicating the simplification of Thai ''pr'' to Lao ''p''.

Only {{IPA|/p t k ʔ m n ŋ w j/}} may appear in the coda. If the vowel in the nucleus is short, it must be followed by a consonant in the coda; {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in the coda can be preceded only by a short vowel. Open syllables (i.e., those with no coda consonant) and syllables ending in one of the [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/m n ŋ w j/}} take one of the six tones, syllables ending in {{IPA|/p t k/}} take one of four tones, and syllables ending in {{IPA|/ʔ/}} take one of only two tones.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt;

==Morphology==
{{main|Lao grammar}}
The majority of Lao words are [[syllable|monosyllabic]], and are not inflected to reflect declension or verbal tense, making Lao an [[analytic language]]. Special particle words serve the purpose of prepositions and verb tenses in lieu of conjugations and declensions. Lao is a [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) language, although the subject is often dropped. In contrast to Thai, Lao uses pronouns more frequently.

==Script==
{{main|Lao alphabet}}

The Lao religious script is written in the [[Tai Tham script]] and based on the [[Old Mon script]]&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;UCLA International Institute, (n.d.). [http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=77 "Lao"]. Accessed 2010-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and still used in temples in Laos and Isan. The Lao alphabet, derived locally around the 14th century from the [[Khmer alphabet]] of the [[Khmer Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Paul K. "Languages and literatures of Indochina." ''The Far Eastern Quarterly'' (1947): 379-389.&lt;/ref&gt; is ultimately rooted in the [[Pallava script]] of [[South India]], one of the [[Brahmi script]]s.&lt;ref name="UCLA"/&gt; Although similar to one another, the Lao alphabet is more phonetic than the Thai alphabet due to various Lao royal decrees concerning [[orthography|orthographic]] reforms, resulting in the Lao script having fewer duplicate sounds thus making the Lao script more phonetic, efficient and easy to learn.

Words are spelt according to phonetic principles as opposed to etymological principles. In addition to consonants having tone classes, tone marks facilitate marking tones where they are needed. [[Romanization of Lao]] is inconsistent, but is based on [[French language|French]] transcriptive methods.

Numerals may be written out as words (1 vs. ''one''), but numerical symbols are more common. Although [[Arabic numerals]] are most common, Lao numerals (of Brahmi origin) are also taught and employed.

===Punctuation===
Lao is traditionally not written with spaces between words, although signs of change are multiplying. Spaces are reserved for ends of clauses or sentences. Periods are not used, and questions can be determined by question words in a sentence. Traditional punctuation marks include ໌, an obsolete mark indicating silenced consonants; ໆ, used to indicate repetition of the preceding word; ຯ, the Lao ellipsis that is also used to indicate omission of words; ฯ, a more or less obsolete symbol indicating shortened form of a phrase (such as royal names); and ฯລฯ, used to indicate ''et cetera''.

In more contemporary writing, punctuation marks are borrowed from French, such as exclamation point !, question mark ?, parentheses (), and «» for quotation marks, although "" is also common. Hyphens (-) and the ellipsis (...) are also commonly found in modern writing.

===Indication of tones===
Experts disagree on the number and nature of tones in the various dialects of Lao. According to some, most dialects of Lao and Isan have six tones, those of [[Luang Prabang]] have five. Tones are determined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Tones
! Long vowel, or vowel plus voiced consonant
! Long vowel plus unvoiced consonant
! Short vowel, or short vowel plus unvoiced consonant
! Mai ek ({{lang|lo|ອ່}})
! Mai tho ({{lang|lo|ອ້}})
|-
! High consonants
| rising
| low falling
| high
| mid
| low falling
|-
! Mid consonants
| low rising
| low falling
| high
| mid
| high falling
|-
! Low consonants
| high
| high falling
| mid
| mid
| high falling
|}

A silent {{lang|lo|ຫ}} ({{IPA|/h/}}) placed before certain consonants will produce place the other proceeding consonant in the high class. This can occur before the letters {{lang|lo|ງ}} {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{lang|lo|ຍ}} {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, {{lang|lo|ຣ}} {{IPA|/r/}}, and {{lang|lo|ວ}} {{IPA|/w/}} and combined in special ligatures (considered separate letters) such as {{lang|lo|ຫຼ}} {{IPA|/l/}}, {{lang|lo|ໜ}} {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{lang|lo|ໝ}} {{IPA|/m/}}. In addition to {{lang|lo|ອ່}} (low tone) and {{lang|lo|ອ້}} (falling tone), there also exists the rare {{lang|lo|ອ໊}} (high) {{lang|lo|ອ໋}} (rising) tone marks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5468">In [[academic publishing]], the '''least publishable unit''' ('''LPU'''), also '''smallest publishable unit''' ('''SPU'''), '''minimum publishable unit (MPU)''', '''loot''', or '''publon''', is the smallest measurable quantum of publication, the minimum amount of information that can be used to generate a publication in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] venue, such as a journal or a conference. ('''Maximum publishable unit''' and '''optimum publishable unit''' are also used.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_qRxkAgYQYC&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Winning The Games Scientists Play''], Carl J. Sindermann.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used as a joking, ironic, or derogatory reference to the strategy of artificially inflating quantity of publications.

Publication of the results of [[research]] is an essential part of [[science]]. The number of publications is often [[publish or perish|used to assess the work of a scientist]] and as a basis for distributing research funds. In order to achieve a high rank in such an assessment, there is a trend to split up research results into smaller parts that are published separately, thus inflating the number of publications. This process has been described as splitting the results into the smallest publishable units.&lt;ref name=Broad1981&gt;{{citation|date=13 March 1981|author=Broad, William J|authorlink=William Broad|title=The Publishing Game: Getting More for Less|pages=1137–1139|journal=Science|volume=211|doi=10.1126/science.7008199|pmid=7008199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broad&amp;Wade1983&gt;{{citation|year=1983|author1=Broad, William|author2=Wade, Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Wade|title=[[Betrayers of the Truth: Fraud and Deceit in the Halls of Science]]|pages=53–55|place=London|publisher=Century Publishing|isbn=0-7126-0243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"'''Salami publication'''", sometimes also referred to as '''"[[salami slicing]]"''', is a variant of the smallest-publishable-unit strategy.  In salami publishing, data gathered by one research project is separately reported (wholly or in part) in multiple end publications.  Salami publishing, apparently named by analogy with the thin slices made from a larger [[salami]] sausage, is generally considered questionable when not explicitly labeled, as it may lead to the same data being counted multiple times as apparently independent results in aggregate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ori.hhs.gov/avoiding-plagiarism-self-plagiarism-and-other-questionable-writing-practices-guide-ethical-writing Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2000;volume=46;issue=2;spage=67;epage=9;aulast=Abraham Duplicate and salami publications. Abraham P, - J Postgrad Med&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/solution-scientific-fraud-replication "Replication is the only solution to scientific fraud"], ''The Guardian'', Chris Chambers and Petroc Sumner.&lt;/ref&gt;

When data gathered in one research project are partially reported as if a single study, a problem of [[statistical significance]] can arise. Scientists typically use a 5% threshold (0.95 probability) to determine whether a hypothesis is supported by the results of a research project. If multiple hypotheses are being tested on a single research project, 1 in 20 hypotheses will by chance be supported by the research. Partially reported research projects must use a more stringent threshold when testing for statistical significance but often do not do this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8733754 "Signs of the times"], ''The Economist'', February 24th 2007. This article is based on a presentation by Peter Austin to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no consensus among academics about whether people should seek to make their publications least publishable units, and it has long been resisted by some journal editors.&lt;ref name=Broad&amp;Wade1983/&gt;  Particularly for people just getting started in academic publication, writing a few small papers provides a way of getting used to how the system of peer review and professional publication works, and it does indeed help to boost publication count.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/In-Defense-of-the-Least/44761 "In Defense of the Least Publishable Unit"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', Whitney J. Owen.&lt;/ref&gt;  But publishing too many LPUs is thought not to impress peers when it comes time to seek promotion beyond the assistant professor (or equivalent) level.  Also, LPUs may not always be the most efficient way to pass on knowledge, because they break up ideas into small pieces, sometimes forcing people to look up many cross-references. Multiple salami slices also occupy more journal pages than a single synthetic paper that contains the same information. On the other hand, a small piece of information is easily digestible, and the reader may not need more information than what is in the LPU.

'''Leti''' is a Bantu language of [[Cameroon]], spoken by the [[Mengisa people]].  Most Mengisa have switched to the [[Eton language]], though a number of them continue to use Leti as a secret [[ritual language]].  A smaller number speak Leti as their mother tongue.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; 

Leti is quite close to [[Ki language|Tuki]] and may be a dialect.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

{{Dynamic list}}

Many '''slang''' terms, often derogatory, exist for police officers. These terms are rarely used by the police themselves.

Police services also have their own internal slang and jargon; some of it is relatively widespread geographically and some very localized.

== A ==
; Ayna: A [[Turkey|Turkish]] phrase derived from ''aynasız'', referring to &lt;nowiki&gt;'those without a mirror'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, a pejorative description of police lacking honor and having too much shame to look at themselves in the mirror. Often used by Turkish and Middle Eastern immigrants, particularly to describe police who will beat or assault them when no witnesses are present.

== B ==
; Babylon: [[Jamaica]]n, establishment systems, often applied to the police. Also used in [[Black English]] outside of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/babylon#Babylon-2 |title=Babylon definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=14 Nov 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011938/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/babylon#Babylon-2 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the [[Rastafari movement]] which, in turn, relies upon a [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] interpretation symbolising debauchery, corruption and evil-doing in general. The term was used as the title of the 2014 British police drama ''[[Babylon (TV series)|Babylon]]''.
; Bacon: See ''[[List of police-related slang terms#P|Pig]]''. Utilized interchangeably with the term "Pig/Pigs" and is often derogatory. Can refer to a single officer or any number of officers.
; Barney: Slang term for a town policeman, usually derogatory, named after [[Barney Fife]].
; Battenburg: Referring to yellow and blue, large, squared, reflective checker pattern on UK police cars; reference is to a type of cake. (Update from "Jam Sandwich" of earlier cars.) 
; Bears: A slang term for the police ([[citizen's band radio]] slang, "Smokey the Bear" in reference to the Highway Patrol [[campaign hat]]s. Seldom derogatory and very common with truckers in the US.
; The Beast: US term used in this singular form to refer to any number of police officers as well as when referring to an entire police force or to police in general. This linguistic pattern results in an implied sense that individual police are all representative parts of one whole, monstrous creature with a united objective and attitude. Referenced most widely on [[Fugees|The Fugees]]' album [[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]].
; Beat cop: inoffensive slang for patrolling officers 
; Bill: Also ''[[List of police-related slang terms#O|Old Bill]]''. ''[[The Bill]]'' was the title of a television police series in the UK, based in a fictional London borough.
; Bird: US, slang for a police helicopter. See also "Ghetto Bird". Not to be confused with the UK parallel to "chicks", a more modern and now more common use of "birds."
; Bizzies: UK, said to have been coined in [[Merseyside]], as the police were always too "busy" to help citizens who reported low-level crimes such as house burglaries. An alternative origin is that the police are seen as "busybodies", i.e., they ask too many questions and meddle in the affairs of others.
; [[Police van#Black Maria|Black Maria]] (pronounced "Mariah"): Slang term used in the UK and elsewhere meaning police van used to transport prisoners, also used in the 19th century in the US and France with various suggested etymologies including racehorses or an infamous black, large and fierce [[Liverpool]] guesthouse owner, Maria Lea. 
; Blues and Twos: UK, from the flashing blue lights and the two frequency siren on a police car
; Blueband: UK, from the blue cap band worn by PCSOs.
; Bluebottle: Antique name for the police referring to the old-style uniform
; Blue Canary: Canadian, a term used by firefighters to rib police officers. Miners historically used canaries to monitor the air quality of a mine; when the canary died the air quality was considered too poor to work in. Police officers have been known to put themselves at risk when rendering aid, usually running into a fire or other toxic atmosphere without proper training or personal protective equipment. Antonym: Hose Monkey
; Blue Force: US slang term for the police, mainly used in Florida.
; Blue Heeler: Rhyming slang for Peeler
; Blue Light Special: Slang term for someone being pulled over 
; Blue Meanies: 1960s and 1970s hippy slang for the police in Britain, referring to the blue uniforms. 
; Bobby: UK, derived from the Conservative British Home Secretary, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] ("Bobby" being a nickname for "Robert"), the founder of the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'bobby'&amp;nbsp;– Oxford Dictionaries | date = April 2010 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bobby | accessdate = 25 January 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120704233752/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bobby | archivedate = 4 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occurs in fixed phrases e.g. "bobby on the beat", "village bobby". Also still used on UK Railways to describe signalmen and women - this dates back to the earliest days of railway operations where a train driver was required to stop only at the behest of a policeman.
; Bœuf: [[Quebec]], ('ox'). Probably in opposition to the French term ''vache'' ('[[cow]]'), or for the usual featureless gaze of police officers colloquially called ''face de bœuf'' ('ox face'). Allows to call a police car an 'ox cart' (''char à bœufs'').
; Booked: UK, usually after being arrested, to be taken to custody suite and held there in a cell. "They took me to the [[List of police-related slang terms#N|nick]] and they booked me." (Dizzie Rascal)
; Bofia: a derogatory slang in Portugal used for police officers and law enforcement in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.thefreedictionary.com/bofia|title=bofia|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Brady Cops: Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as "[[Brady disclosure|Brady cops]]".
; Bronze: Police slang term used in Mad Max 1 originated in Australia but used in the UK.
; BTP:  specialized use (mainly on UK railways) - abbreviation of "British Transport Police", the oldest and only fully UK national police force. Sometimes derogatorily known as "Sleepers" (US railroad "ties") but not due to their position in the track.

;  Bull: Railroad police in the US, most prevalent in the first half of the 20th century.

(Ambulances are yellow and green, fire service yellow and red and transport (motorway) yellow and black.  except for the black all are reflective.

; [[The Thin Blue Line (emblem)|The Thin Blue Line]]: The role of the police in being the barrier between civilized society and chaos, inspiring [[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|a UK sitcom]] and [[The Thin Blue Line (disambiguation)|two documentaries]] of the same name.  This has led to police involved in entrapment of gays being described as "the thin blue jeans".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
; Thulla: ठुल्ला. A [[North India|North Indian]] slang for policemen. One theory is that it is derived from "thulla", a name used in [[East India|Eastern India]] for the [[jute]] [[gunny sack]], which resembles the [[khaki]] uniforms worn by many police forces in the country.
; Tombo: A Peruvian, Colombian and other South American countries' slang term, comes from switching the syllabes of  "Botón" , which means button, an allusion to the ribbons or medals that police officers use to wear on their uniforms.

==#==
; 12: A term to refer to multiple police officers or any other law enforcement agencies. The origin of the slang comes from the TV series ''[[Adam-12]]'', which ran from 1968 to 1975. It is idiomatic to say "fuck 12", meaning "fuck the police", especially in [[hip hop music]]. Residents from Fulton and Dekalb County in Georgia popularize the term "12", when referring to police, because that is how many letters were in Dekalb County, and Fulton County, which was on the side of the police vehicles.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">'''Logographic cues''' are visual images embedded with specific, widely understood meaning; they are pictures that represent certain words or concepts. These pictures are "designed to offer readers a high-utility message in a minimum amount of space." (Beers, 129) Some languages, for example, many East Asian languages, such as [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] (e.g. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Cantonese]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]), and partially [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], are written in  [[logographic script]]s; single [[glyph]]s represent whole [[morpheme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/chinese.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of logographic cues include traffic signs, restroom signs, and pictorial flashcards. Unsurprisingly, logographic cues tend to be processed in the right brain hemisphere, the side more actively engaged with [[visuospatial|visuospatial input]]. Due to advances in technology and the media where logographic cues such as [[brand]] [[logo]]s abound, the ability and tendency to draw meaning from pictures has become more widespread and intuitive.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Utility to education==
Logographic cues have also become increasingly useful in the domain of [[education]], specifically in the [[learning to read|development of reading skills]]. Many sources of educational advice suggest the use of logographic cues to tap into [[visual learning]] and intelligence, which usually takes a subordinate role to verbal education in schools; such sources include literacy expert Kylene Beers and a nationwide reading program, [[All America Reads]].

Specific activities that utilize logographic cues include: students making symbols within the margins of print text and worksheets that provide a pictorial summary of the information given and picture flash cards that foster [[vocabulary development]]. (Kajder, 43) Teaching methods employing logographic cues can help to encourage and increase word recognition, text reformulation and information organization. The method also helps to tap into the sensory stimulation that encodes information into [[long-term memory]].

==Criticisms==
The use of this method has also received some criticism. In reference to the use of logographic cues to develop word recognition the ''International Journal of Disability, Development and Education'' writes that “the results of controlled studies show it to be ineffective and potentially detrimental to student learning.”{{how?|date=May 2014}} (Sheehy, 47) The particular study documented in this journal suggested similar but modified alternatives such as Integrated Picture Cueing or the Handle Technique. The Integrated Picture Cueing (IPC) technique makes pictures out of the desired words, themselves, rather than symbolic pictorial depictions. The Handle Technique depicts the word with an extra [[serif]] (handle) that helps students encode the word and its meaning. Despite these findings and alternatives, logographic cues are widely used and encouraged in education.

The '''Macro-Jibaro''' proposal, also known as ''(Macro-)Andean'', is a language proposal of [[Morris Swadesh]] and other historical linguists. The two families, [[Jivaroan languages|Jivaroan]] and [[Cahuapanan languages|Cahuapanan]] are most frequently linked, the isolates less often. Documentation of [[Urarina language|Urarina]] is underway as of 2006, but Puelche and Huarpe are extinct. Kaufman (1994) linked Huarpe instead to the [[Muran languages]] and [[Matanawi language|Matanawi]] (see [[Macro-Warpean]]), but as of 1990 found the Jibaro–Cahuapanan connection plausible. It forms one part of his expanded 2007 suggestion for [[Macro-Andean]].

David Payne (1981) proposes that [[Candoshi-Shapra language|Candoshi]] is related to [[Jivaroan languages|Jivaroan]], which Payne calls Shuar. Together, Shuar and Candoshi make up a putative Shuar-Candoshi family, for which Payne (1981) provides a tentative reconstruction of Proto-Shuar-Candoshi.

'''Modern Hebrew grammar''' is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[declension|morphological cases]].

On the other hand, Modern Hebrew grammar is also fusional synthetic:&lt;ref name = ccti&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/complement_clause.pdf Complement Clause Types in Israeli], ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'' (RMW Dixon &amp; AY Aikhenvald, eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp.&amp;nbsp;72–92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[inflection]] plays a role in the formation of verbs and nouns (using [[Nonconcatenative morphology|non-concatenative]] discontinuous morphemes realised by vowel [[infix]]ation) and the declension of prepositions (i.e. with pronominal suffixes).  For example, whereas the ancient Hebrew phrase for "my grandfather" was ''sav-í'' "grandfather-1stPerson.Singular.Possessive", in Israeli Hebrew it is ''sába shelí'' "grandfather of-me".&lt;ref name = ccti/&gt;

==Note on the representation of Hebrew examples==
Examples of Hebrew are represented using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) as well as native script. Although most speakers collapse the phonemes {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}}  into {{IPA|/χ, ʔ/}},&lt;ref name = map&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad (2005), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/abba.pdf “Abba, why was Professor Higgins trying to teach Eliza to speak like our cleaning lady?”: Mizrahim, Ashkenazim, Prescriptivism and the Real Sounds of the Israeli Language], ''Australian Journal of Jewish Studies'' 19, pp.&amp;nbsp;210-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laufer96-98"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Laufer|1999|pp=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distinction is maintained by a limited number of speakers and will therefore be indicated here for maximum coverage. In the transcriptions, {{IPA|/r/}} is used for the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]], which is more commonly a [[Voiced uvular fricative|lax voiced uvular approximant]]&lt;ref name = map /&gt; {{IPAblink|ʁ}}.

==Syntax==
Every Hebrew sentence must contain at least one subject, at least one [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], usually but not always a verb, and possibly other [[argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and [[complement (linguistics)|complements]].

[[Word order]] in Modern Hebrew is somewhat similar to that in English: as opposed to Biblical Hebrew, where the word order is Verb-Subject-Object, the usual word order in Modern Hebrew is Subject-Verb-Object. Thus, if there is no case marking, one can resort to the word order. Modern Hebrew is characterized by an asymmetry between definite Objects and indefinite Objects. There is an accusative marker, ''et'', only before a definite Object (mostly a definite noun or personal name). ''Et-ha'' is currently undergoing fusion and reduction to become ''ta''.&lt;ref name = ccti /&gt; Consider ''ten li et ha-séfer'' "give:2ndPerson.Masculine.Singular.Imperative to-me ACCUSATIVE the-book" (i.e. "Give me the book"), where ''et'', albeit syntactically a case-marker, is a preposition and ''ha'' is a definite article. This sentence is realised phonetically as ''ten li ta-séfer''.&lt;ref name = ccti /&gt;

===Sentences with finite verbs===
In sentences where the predicate is a verb, the word order is usually [[subject–verb–object|subject–verb–object (SVO)]], as in English. However, word order can change in the following instances:

*An object can typically be [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]]alized by moving it to the front of the sentence. When the object is a question word, this topicalization is almost mandatory. Example : '''?לְמִי''' אָמַר {{IPA|/'''leˈmi''' ʔaˈmar?/}}, literally "'''To-whom''' he-told?", means "'''Whom''' did he tell?" In other cases, this topicalization can be used for emphasis. (''See'' [[dislocation (syntax)]].)
*Hebrew is a [[pro-drop language]].  This means that subject pronouns are sometimes omitted when verb conjugations reflect [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical person|person]].
*Indefinite subjects (like English's ''a boy'', ''a book'', and so on) are often postponed, giving the sentence some of the sense of "there exists [subject]" in addition to the verb's normal meaning.  For example, פָּנָה אֵלַי '''אֵיזֶשֶׁהוּ אָדָם''' שִׁבִּקֵּשׁ שֶׁאֶעֱזֹר לוֹ עִם מַשֶּׁהוּ {{IPA|/paˈna ʔeˈlaj '''ˈʔezeʃehu ʔaˈdam''', ʃe-biˈkeʃ ʃe-ʔe.ʕeˈzor lo ʕim ˈmaʃehu/}}, literally "Turned to-me '''some man''' that-asked that-[I]-will-help to-him with something", means "'''A man''' came to me wanting me to help him with something." This serves a purpose somewhat analogous to English's narrative use of ''this'' with a semantically indefinite subject: "So, I'm at work, and this man comes up to me and asks me to help him."  Indeed, outside of the present tense, mere existence is expressed using the verb ''to be'' with a postponed indefinite subject. Example: הָיְתָה '''סִבָּה''' שֶׁבִּקַּשְׁתִּי {{IPA|/hajˈta '''siˈba''' ʃe-biˈkaʃti/}}, literally "Was '''reason''' that-[I]-asked", means "There was a reason I asked."
*Definite subjects can be postponed for a number of reasons.
**In some cases, a postponed subject can be used to sound [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]] or [[archaism|archaic]]. This is because historically, Hebrew was typically [[verb–subject–object|verb–subject–object (VSO)]]. The [[Tanakh|Bible]] and other religious texts are predominantly written in VSO word order.
**Sometimes, postponing a subject can give it emphasis. One response to הַתְחֵל {{IPA|/hatˈħel!/}} ("Start") might be הַתְחֵל '''אַתָּה''' {{IPA|/hatˈħel '''aˈta'''!/}} ("'''You''' start!").
**A subject might initially be omitted and then added later as an afterthought, such as נַעֲשֶׂה אֶת זֶה בְּיַחַד '''אַתָּה וַאֲנִי''' {{IPA|/naʕaˈse ʔet ˈze beˈjaħad, '''aˈta vaʔanˈi'''/}}, literally "[We]'ll-do it together, '''you and-I'''", means "You and I will do it together" or "We'll do it together, you and I".

Generally, Hebrew marks every noun in a sentence with some sort of preposition, with the exception of subjects and semantically indefinite direct objects.  Unlike English, indirect objects require prepositions (Hebrew "הוּא נָתַן '''לִי''' אֶת הַכַּדּוּר" /hu naˈtan '''li''' ʔet ha-kaˈdur/ (literally "he gave '''to-me''' direct-object-marker the ball) in contrast to English "He gave '''me''' the ball") and semantically definite direct objects are introduced by the preposition את {{IPA|/et/}} (Hebrew "הוּא נָתַן לִי '''אֶת הַכַּדּוּר'''" /hu naˈtan li '''ʔet ha-kaˈdur'''/ (literally "he gave to-me '''direct-object-marker the ball''') in contrast to English "He gave me '''the ball'''").

===Nominal sentences===
Hebrew also produces sentences where the predicate is not a finite verb. A sentence of this type is called משפט שמני {{IPA|/miʃˈpat ʃemaˈni/}}, a [[nominal sentence]]. These sentences contain a subject, a non-verbal predicate, and an optional [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]. Types of copulae include:

#'''The verb הָיָה {{IPA|/haˈja/}} (''to be'')''':
::While the verb ''to be'' does have present-tense forms, they are used only in exceptional circumstances. The following structures are used instead:
::#While the past and future tenses follow the structure [sometimes-optional subject]-[form of ''to be'']-[noun complement] (analogous to English, except that in English the subject is always mandatory), the present tense follows [optional subject]-[subject pronoun]-[noun complement].
::##אַבָּא שֶׁלִּי '''הָיָה''' שׁוֹטֵר בִּצְעִירוּתוֹ. {{IPA|/ˈʔaba ʃeˈli '''haˈja''' ʃoˈter bi-t͡sʕiruˈto/}} (''my father '''was''' a policeman when he was young.'') 
::##הַבֵּן שֶׁלּוֹ '''הוּא''' אַבָּא שֶׁלָּהּ. {{IPA|/ha-ˈben ʃeˈlo '''hu''' ˈʔaba ʃeˈlah/}} (literally "the-son of-his '''he''' the-father of-hers", ''his son '''is''' her father.'') 
::##יוֹסִי יִהְיֶה כִימָאִי. {{IPA|/ˈjosi '''jihˈje''' χimaˈʔi/}} (''Yossi '''will be''' a chemist'')
While לֹא {{IPA|/lo/}} ("not") precedes the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the past and future tenses, it follows the copula (a subject pronoun) in the present tense.
::#Where the past and future tenses are structured as [optional subject]-[form of ''to be'']-[adjective complement] (analogous to English, except that in English the subject is mandatory), the present tense is simply [subject]-[adjective complement].  For example, הַדֶּלֶת סְגוּרָה {{IPA|/ha-ˈdelet sɡuˈra/}}, literally "the-door closed", means "the door is closed." That said, additional subject pronouns are sometimes used, as with noun complements, especially with complicated subjects. Example: זֶה מוּזָר שֶׁהוּא אָמַר כָּךְ {{IPA|/'''ze''' muˈzar ʃe-hu ʔaˈmar kaχ/}}, literally " '''it''' strange that-he said thus", means "that he said that '''is''' strange," i.e. "it's strange that he said that."

#'''The verbs הָפַךְ {{IPA|/haˈfaχ/}}, נֶהֱפַךְ {{IPA|/neheˈfaχ/}} and נִהְיָה {{IPA|/nihˈja/}} (''to become'')''': 
::When the sentence implies progression or change, the said verbs are used and considered copulae between the nominal subject and the non-verbal predicate. For instance:
::#הַכֶּלֶב '''נִהְיָה''' עַצְבָּנִי יוֹתֵר מֵרֶגַע לְרֶגַע {{IPA|haˈkelev '''nihˈja''' ʕat͡sbaˈni joˈter me-ˈregaʕ le-ˈregaʕ/}} (''The dog '''became''' more angry with every passing moment'')
::#הֶחָבֵר שֶׁלִּי '''נֶהֱפַךְ''' לְמִפְלֶצֶת! {{IPA|/he-ħaˈver ʃeˈli '''neheˈfaχ''' le-mifˈlet͡set!/}} (''My friend '''has become''' a monster!'')

#'''Possession / existence: יש/אין {{IPA|/jeʃ/en/}}''':
::Possession in Hebrew is constructed indefinitely.  There is no Hebrew translation to the English verb "to have," common in many Indo-European languages to express possession as well as to serve as a helping verb.  To express the English sentence "I have a dog" in Hebrew is "יֵשׁ לִי כֶּלֶב", literally meaning "there exists to me a dog."  The word יֵשׁ {{IPA|/jeʃ/}} expresses existence in the present tense, and is unique in the Hebrew language as a verb-like form with no inflected qualities at all.  Dispossession in the present tense in Hebrew is expressed with the antithesis to יש, which is אֵין {{IPA|/en/}} -- "אֵין לִי כֶּלֶב" {{IPA|/en li ˈkelev/}} means "I do not have a dog."  Possession in the past and the future in Hebrew is also expressed impersonally, but uses conjugated forms of the Hebrew copula, לִהְיוֹת [lihyot].  For example, the same sentence "I do not have a dog" would in the past tense become "לֹא הָיָה לִי כֶּלֶב" {{IPA|/lo haja li kelev/}}, literally meaning "there was not to me a dog."

===Sentence types===
Sentences are generally divided into three types:

====Simple sentence====
A simple sentence is a sentence that contains one subject, one verb, and optional objects. As the name implies, it is the simplest type of sentence.

====Compound sentences====
Two or more sentences that do not share common parts and can be separated by comma are called מִשְפָּט מְחֻבָּר /miʃˈpat meħuˈbar/, a compound sentence. In many cases, the second sentence uses a pronoun that stands for the other's subject; they are generally interconnected. The two sentences are linked with a [[Conjunction (grammar)#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating conjunction]] (מִלַּת חִבּוּר {{IPA|/miˈlat ħiˈbur/}}). The conjunction is a stand-alone word that serves as a connection between both parts of the sentence, belonging to neither part.

*לֹא אָכַלְתִּי כָּל הַיּוֹם''', וְלָכֵן''' בְּסוֹף הַיּוֹם הָיִיתִי מוּתָשׁ. {{IPA|/lo ʔaˈχalti kol ha-ˈjom''', ve-laˈχen''' be-ˈsof ha-ˈjom haˈjiti muˈtaʃ/}} (''I haven't eaten all day''', therefore''' at the end of the day I was exhausted.)
:Both parts of the sentence can be separated by a period and stand alone as grammatically correct sentences, which makes the sentence a compound sentence (and not a complex sentence):
:לֹא אָכַלְתִּי כָּל הַיּוֹם. בְּסוֹף הַיּוֹם הָיִיתִי מוּתָשׁ. {{IPA|/lo ʔaˈχalti kol ha-ˈjom. be-ˈsof ha-ˈjom haˈjiti muˈtaʃ./}} (''I haven't eaten all day. By the end of the day I was exhausted.'')

====Complex sentences====
Like English, Hebrew allows [[clause]]s, פְּסוּקִיּוֹת {{IPA|/psukiˈjot/}} (sing. פְּסוּקִית {{IPA|/psuˈkit/}}), to serve as parts of a sentence. A sentence containing a subordinate clause is called משפט מרכב {{IPA|/miʃˈpat murˈkav/}}, or a complex sentence. Subordinate clauses almost always begin with the [[Conjunction (grammar)#Subordinating conjunctions|subordinating conjunction]] -ש {{IPA|/ʃe-/}} (usually ''that''), which attaches as a prefix to the word that follows it. For example, in the sentence יוֹסִי אוֹמֵר שֶׁהוּא אוֹכֵל {{IPA|/ˈjosi ʔoˈmer ʃe-ˈhu ʔoˈχel/}} (''Yossi says that he is eating''), the subordinate clause שֶׁהוּא אוֹכֵל {{IPA|/ʃe-ˈhu ʔoˈχel/}} (''that he is eating'') serves as the direct object of the verb אוֹמֵר {{IPA|/ʔoˈmer/}} (''says''). Unlike English, Hebrew does not have a large number of subordinating conjunctions; rather, subordinate clauses almost always act as nouns and can be introduced by prepositions in order to serve as adverbs. For example, the English '''''As''' I said, there's nothing we can do'' in Hebrew is כְּפִי שֶׁאָמַרְתִּי, אֵין מָה לַעֲשׂוֹת {{IPA|/'''kfi ʃe'''-ʔaˈmarti, ʔen ma laʕaˈsot/}} (literally '''''As that'''-I-said, there-isn't what to-do'').

That said, [[relative clause]]s, which act as adjectives, are also formed using -ֶׁש {{IPA|/ʃe-/}}. For example, English ''Yosi sees the man '''who''' is eating apples'' is in Hebrew יוֹסִי רוֹאֶה אֶת הָאִישׁ שֶׁאוֹכֵל תַּפּוּחִים {{IPA|/ˈjosi roˈʔe ʔet ha-ˈʔiʃ '''ʃe'''-ʔoˈχel tapuˈħim/}} (literally ''Yosi sees [et] the-man '''that'''-eats apples''). In this use ש {{IPA|/ʃe-/}} sometimes acts as a [[relativizer]] rather than as a [[relative pronoun]]; that is, sometimes the pronoun remains behind in the clause: הִיא מַכִּירָה אֶת הָאִישׁ שֶׁדִּבַּרְתִּי עָלָיו {{IPA|/hi makiˈra ʔet ha-ˈʔiʃ '''ʃe'''-diˈbarti '''ʕaˈlav'''/}}, which translates to ''She knows the man I talked about'', literally means ''She knows [et] the-man '''that'''-I-talked '''about him'''''. This is because in Hebrew, a preposition (in this case  על {{IPA|/ʕal/}}) cannot appear without its object, so the ''him'' יו- ({{IPA|/-av/}}) could not be dropped. However, some sentences, such as the above example, can be written both with relativizers and with relative pronouns. The sentence can also be rearranged into הִיא מַכִּירָה אֶת הָאִישׁ עָלָיו דִבַּרְתִּי {{IPA|/hi makiˈra ʔet ha-ˈʔiʃ '''ʕaˈlav''' diˈbarti/}}, literally ''She knows [et] the-man '''about him''' I-talked.'', and translates into the same meaning. In that example, the preposition and its object עָלָיו {{IPA|/ʕaˈlav/}} also act as a relative pronoun, without use of -ֶׁש {{IPA|/ʃe-/}}.

====Impersonal sentences====
A sentence may lack a determinate subject, then it is called מִשְפָּט סְתָמִי {{IPA|/miʃˈpat staˈmi/}}, an indefinite or impersonal sentence. These are used in order to put emphasis on the action, and not on the agent of the action. Usually the verb is of the 3rd person plural form.

*עָשׂוּ שִׁפּוּץ בַּבִּנְיָן שֶׁלִּי {{IPA|/ʕaˈsu ʃipˈut͡s ba-binˈjan ʃeˈli/}} (literally: they-made a renovation in-the building of-mine; ''my building was renovated'')

====Collective sentences====
When a sentence contains multiple parts of the same grammatical function and relate to the same part of the sentence, they are called collective parts. They are usually separated with the preposition וְ- {{IPA|/ve-/}} (''and''), and if there are more than two, they are separated with commas while the last pair with the preposition, as in English. Collective parts can have any grammatical function in the sentence, for instance:

#Subject: אָדָם, אַיָּה '''וַ'''אֲנִי אָכַלְנוּ יַחַד בְּמִסְעָדָה. {{IPA|/ʔaˈdam, ʔaˈja '''va-'''ʔani ʔaˈχalnu ˈjaħad be-misʕaˈda./}} (''Adam, Aya '''and''' I ate at a restaurant together.'')
#Predicate: מִיכַל אָכְלָה '''וְ'''שָׁתְתָה הַרְבֵּה אֶתְמוֹל. {{IPA|/miˈχal ʔaχˈla '''ve-'''ʃateˈta harˈbe ʔetˈmol/}} (''Michal ate '''and''' drank a lot yesterday.'')
#Direct object: בִּשַּׁלְתִּי אֶת הַגֶּזֶר, אֶת הַבָּטָטָה '''וְ'''אֶת תַּפּוּחַ הָאֲדָמָה שֶׁקְּנִיתֶם שָׁבוּעַ שֶׁעָבַר לַאֲרוּחַת הָעֶרֶב הַיּוֹם. {{IPA|/biˈʃalti ʔet ha-ˈgezer, ʔet ha-baˈtata '''ve-'''ʔet taˈpu.aħ ha-ʔadaˈma ʃe-kniˈtem ʃaˈvu.aʕ ʃe-ʕaˈvar la-ʔaruˈħat ha-ˈʕerev ha'jom./}} (''I cooked the carrots, the sweet potatoes '''and''' the potatoes you bought last week for dinner today.'')
#Indirect object: הַמּוֹרָה תִּתֵּן לְתֹמֶר וְלִי אִשּׁוּר. {{IPA|/ha-moˈra tiˈten le-toˈmer ve-li ʔiˈʃur/}} (''The teacher will give Tomer and me permission.'')

When a collective part is preceded by a preposition, the preposition must be copied onto all parts of the collective.

==Verbs==
The Hebrew [[verb]] (פועל {{IPA|/ˈpoʕal/}}) serves essentially the same functions as the English verb, but is constructed very differently. Hebrew verbs have much more internal structure. Every Hebrew verb is formed by casting a three- or four-consonant root (שֹׁרֶשׁ {{IPA|/ˈʃoreʃ/}}) into one of seven [[derived stem]]s called {{IPA|/binjaˈnim/}} (בִּנְיָנִים, meaning ''buildings'' or ''constructions''; the singular is בִּנְיָן {{IPA|/binˈjan/}}, written henceforth as ''[[binyan]]''). Most roots can be cast into more than one binyan, meaning more than one verb can be formed from a typical root. When this is the case, the different verbs are usually related in meaning, typically differing in [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], [[semantics|semantic]] intensity, [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], or a combination of these features.  The "concept" of the Hebrew verb's meaning is defined by the identity of the [[triliteral root]].  The "concept" of the Hebrew verb assumes verbal meaning by taking on vowel-structure as dictated by the binyan's rules.

===Conjugation===

{{Main article|Modern Hebrew verb conjugation}}

Each binyan has a certain pattern of conjugation and verbs in the same binyan are conjugated similarly. Conjugation patterns within a binyan alter somewhat depending on certain phonological qualities of the verb's root; the alterations (called גִּזְרָה {{IPA-he|ɡizra|}}, meaning "form") are defined by the presence of certain letters composing the root. For example, three-letter roots (''triliterals'') whose second letter is ו {{IPA|/vav/}} or י {{IPA|/jud/}} are so-called ''hollow'' or ''weak'' roots, losing their second letter in binyan {{IPA|/hifˈʕil/}}, in {{IPA|/hufˈʕal/}}, and in much of {{IPA|/paʕal/}}. The feature of being conjugated differently because the second root-letter is ו or י is an example of a gizra. It is important to note that these verbs are not strictly irregular verbs, because all Hebrew verbs that possess the same feature of the gizra are conjugated in accordance with the gizra's particular set of rules.

Every verb has a past tense, a present tense, and a future tense, with the present tense doubling as a [[present participle]]. Other forms also exist for certain verbs: verbs in five of the binyanim have an [[imperative mood]] and an [[infinitive]], verbs in four of the binyanim have [[gerund]]s, and verbs in one of the binyanim have a [[past participle]]. Finally, a very small number of fixed expressions include verbs in the [[subjunctive mood|jussive mood]], which is essentially an extension of the imperative into the third person. Except for the infinitive and gerund, these forms are conjugated to reflect the number (singular or plural), person (first, second, or third) and gender (masculine or feminine) of its subject, depending on the form. Modern Hebrew also has an [[Modern Hebrew verb conjugation#Conditional|analytic conditional~past-habitual mood]] expressed with the auxiliary haya.

In listings such as dictionaries, Hebrew verbs are sorted by their third-person masculine singular past tense form. This differs from English verbs, which are identified by their infinitives. (Nonetheless, the Hebrew term for ''infinitive'' is ''shem poʕal'', which means ''verb name''.) Further, each of the seven binyanim is identified by the third-person masculine singular past tense form of the root פ-ע-ל (''P-ʕ-L'', meaning ''doing'', ''action'', etc.) cast into that binyan: {{IPA|/ˈpaʕal/}}, {{IPA|/nifˈʕal/}}, {{IPA|/piˈʕel/}}, {{IPA|/puˈʕal/}}, {{IPA|/hifˈʕil/}}, {{IPA|/hufˈʕal/}}, and {{IPA|/hitpaˈʕel/}}.

===Binyan ''paʕal''===
Binyan ''paʕal'', also called binyan קַל or qal {{IPA|/qal/}} (''light''), is the most common binyan. ''Paʕal'' verbs are in the active voice, and can be either transitive or intransitive.  This means that they may or may not take [[direct object]]s. ''Paʕal'' verbs are never formed from four-letter roots.

Binyan ''paʕal'' is the only binyan in which a given root can have both an active and a passive participle.  For example, רָצוּי {{IPA|/raˈt͡suj/}} (''desirable'') is the passive participle of רָצָה {{IPA|/raˈt͡sa/}} (''want'').

Binyan ''paʕal'' has the most diverse number of gzarot (pl. of gizra), and the small number of Hebrew verbs that are strictly irregular (about six to ten) are generally considered to be part of the pa'al binyan, as they have some conjugation features similar to paʕal.

===Binyan ''nifal''===
Verbs in binyan ''nifal'' are always intransitive, but beyond that there is little restriction on their range of meanings.

The ''nifal'' is the passive-voice counterpart of ''paal''. In principle, any transitive ''paal'' verb can be rendered passive by taking its root and casting it into ''nifal''. Nonetheless, this is not ''nifʕal''&amp;#39;s main use, as the passive voice is fairly rare in ordinary Modern Hebrew.

More commonly, it is ''paal''&amp;#39;s middle- or reflexive-voice counterpart. [[Ergative verb]]s in English often translate into Hebrew as a ''paal''–''nifal'' pair. For example, English ''he '''broke''' the plate'' corresponds to Hebrew הוּא שָׁבַר אֶת הַצַּלַּחַת {{IPA|/hu '''ʃaˈvar''' et ha-t͡saˈlaħat/}}, using ''paa'al''; but English ''the plate '''broke''''' corresponds to Hebrew הַצַּלַּחַת נִשְׁבְּרָה {{IPA|/ha-t͡saˈlaħat '''niʃˈbera'''/}}, using ''nifal''. The difference is that in the first case, there is an agent doing the breaking (active), while in the second case, the agent is ignored (although the object is acted upon; passive). (Nonetheless, as in English, it can still be made clear that there was an ultimate agent: הוּא הִפִּיל אֶת הַצַּלַּחַת וְהִיא נִשְׁבְּרָה {{IPA|/hu hiˈpil ʔet ha-t͡saˈlaħat ve-hi '''niʃˈbera'''/}}, ''he dropped the plate and it '''broke''''', uses ''nif'al''.) Other examples of this kind include פָּתַח {{IPA|/paˈtaħ/}}/נִפְתַּח {{IPA|/nifˈtaħ/}} (''to open'', transitive/intransitive) and גָּמַר {{IPA|/ɡaˈmar/}}/נִגְמַר {{IPA|/niɡˈmar/}} (''to end'', transitive/intransitive).

Other relationships between a ''paa'al'' verb and its ''nifa'al'' counterpart can exist as well. One example is זָכַר {{IPA|/zaˈχar/}} and נִזְכַּר {{IPA|/nizˈkar/}}: both mean ''to remember'', but the latter implies that one had previously forgotten, rather like English ''to suddenly remember''. Another is פָּגַשׁ {{IPA|/paˈɡaʃ/}} and נִפְגַּשׁ {{IPA|/nifˈɡaʃ/}}: both mean ''to meet'', but the latter implies an intentional meeting, while the former often means an accidental meeting.

Finally, sometimes a ''nifal'' verb has no ''pa'al'' counterpart, or at least is much more common than its ''paʕal'' counterpart; נִדְבַּק {{IPA|/nidˈbaq/}} (''to stick'', intransitive) is a fairly common verb, but דָּבַק {{IPA|/daˈvak/}} (''to cling'') is all but non-existent by comparison. (Indeed, נִדְבַּק {{IPA|/nidˈbak/}}'s transitive counterpart is הִדְבִּיק {{IPA|/hidˈbik/}}, of binyan ''hifʕil''; see below.)

Like ''pa'al'' verbs, ''nifal'' verbs are never formed from four-letter roots.

''Nifal'' verbs, unlike verbs in the other passive binyanim (''pua'al'' and ''hufa'al'', described below), do have gerunds, infinitives and imperatives.

===Binyan ''pi'el''===
Binyan ''pi'el'', like binyan ''pa'al'', consists of transitive and intransitive verbs in the active voice, though there is perhaps a greater tendency for ''piʕel'' verbs to be transitive.

Most roots with a ''pa'al'' verb do not have a ''piʕel'' verb, and vice versa, but even so, there are many roots that do have both. Sometimes the ''pi'el'' verb is a more intense version of the ''paʕal'' verb; for example, קִפֵּץ {{IPA|/kiˈpet͡s/}} (''to spring'') is a more intense version of קָפַץ {{IPA|/kaˈfat͡s/}} (''to jump''), and שִׁבֵּר {{IPA|/ʃiˈber/}} (''to smash'', ''to shatter'', transitive) is a more intense version of שָׁבַר {{IPA|/ʃaˈvar/}} (''to break'', transitive). In other cases, a ''piʕel'' verb acts as a causative counterpart to the ''pa'al'' verb with the same root; for example, לִמֵּד {{IPA|/liˈmed/}} (''to teach'') is essentially the causative of לָמַד {{IPA|/laˈmad/}} (''to learn''). And in yet other cases, the nature of the relationship is less obvious; for example, סִפֵּר {{IPA|/siˈper/}} means ''to tell'' / ''to narrate'' or ''to cut hair'', while סָפַר {{IPA|/saˈfar/}} means ''to count'', and פִּתֵּחַ {{IPA|/piˈte.aħ/}} means ''to develop'' (transitive verb), while פָּתַח {{IPA|/paˈtaħ/}} means ''to open'' (transitive verb).

===Binyan ''puʕal''===

Binyan ''puʕal'' is the passive-voice counterpart of binyan ''piʕel''. Unlike binyan ''nifʕal'', it is used ''only'' for the passive voice. It is therefore not very commonly used in ordinary speech, except that the present participles of a number of ''puʕal'' verbs are used as ordinary adjectives: מְבֻלְבָּל {{IPA|/mevulˈbal/}} means ''mixed-up'' (from בֻּלְבַּל {{IPA|/bulˈbal/}}, the passive of בִּלְבֵּל {{IPA|/bilˈbel/}}, ''to confuse''), מְעֻנְיָן {{IPA|/meunˈjan/}} means ''interested'', מְפֻרְסָם {{IPA|/mefurˈsam/}} means ''famous'' (from פֻּרְסַם {{IPA|/purˈsam/}}, the passive of פִּרְסֵם {{IPA|/pirˈsem/}}, ''to publicize''), and so on. Indeed, the same is true of many ''piʕel'' verbs, including the ''piʕel'' counterparts of two of the above examples: מְבַלְבֵּל {{IPA|/mevalˈbel/}}, ''confusing'', and מְעַנְיֵן {{IPA|/meʕanˈjen/}}, ''interesting''. The difference is that ''piʕel'' verbs are also frequently used as verbs, whereas ''puʕal'' is much less common.

''Puʕal'' verbs do not have gerunds, imperatives, or infinitives.

===Binyan ''hifʕil''===

Binyan ''hifʕil'' is another active binyan. ''Hifʕil'' verbs are often causative counterparts of verbs in other binyanim; examples include הִכְתִּיב  {{IPA|/hiχˈtiv/}} (''to dictate''; the causative of כָּתַב  {{IPA|/kaˈtav/}}, ''to write''), הִדְלִיק {{IPA|/hidˈlik/}} (''to turn on (a light)'', transitive; the causative of נִדְלַק {{IPA|/nidˈlak/}}, ''(for a light) to turn on'', intransitive), and הִרְשִׁים {{IPA|/hirˈʃim/}} (''to impress''; the causative of התרשם {{IPA|/hitraˈʃem/}}, ''to be impressed''). Nonetheless, not all are causatives of other verbs; for example, הִבְטִיחַ {{IPA|/hivˈtiaħ/}} (''to promise''). &lt;!-- Further, some are even [[ergative verb|ergative]]; for example,  הִתְחִיל {{IPA|/hitˈħil/}} (''to start'') can be transitive, as in הִתְחִיל אֶת הַרְצָאָתוֹ {{IPA|/hu '''hitˈħil''' et hart͡saˈato/}} (''he '''has started''' his lecture''). --&gt;

===Binyan ''huf'al''===

Binyan ''huf'al'' is much like binyan ''pu'al'', except that it corresponds to ''hif'il'' instead of to ''pi'el''. Like ''pu'al'', it is not commonly used in ordinary speech, except in present participles that have become adjectives, such as מֻכָּר {{IPA|/muˈkar/}} (''familiar'', from הֻכַּר {{IPA|/huˈkar/}}, the passive of הִכִּיר {{IPA|/hiˈkir/}}, ''to know (a person)'') and מֻגְזָם {{IPA|/muɡˈzam/}} (''excessive'', from {{IPA|/huɡˈzam/}}, the passive of הִגְזִים {{IPA|/hiɡˈzim/}}, ''to exaggerate''). Like ''puʕal'' verbs, ''hufʕal'' verbs do not have gerunds, imperatives, or infinitives.

===Binyan ''hitpa'el''===

Binyan ''hitpa'el'' is rather like binyan ''nif'al'', in that all ''hitpa'el'' verbs are intransitive, and most have a reflexive sense. Indeed, many ''hitpa'el'' verbs are reflexive counterparts to other verbs with the same root; for example, הִתְרַחֵץ {{IPA|/hitraˈħet͡s/}} (''to wash oneself'') is the reflexive of רָחַץ {{IPA|/raˈħat͡s/}} (''to wash'', transitive), and הִתְגַּלֵּחַ {{IPA|/hitɡaˈleaħ/}} (''to shave oneself'', i.e. ''to shave'', intransitive) is the reflexive of  גִּלֵּחַ {{IPA|/ɡiˈleaħ/}} (''to shave'', transitive). Some ''hitpaʕel'' verbs are a combination of causative and reflexive; for example,הִסְתַּפֵּר {{IPA|/histaˈper/}} (''to get one's hair cut'') is the causative reflexive of סִפֵּר {{IPA|/siˈper/}} (''to cut (hair)''), and הִצְטַלֵּם {{IPA|/hit͡staˈlem/}} (''to get one's picture taken'') is the causative reflexive of צִלֵּם {{IPA|/t͡siˈlem/}} (''to take a picture (of someone or something)'').

''Hitpa'el'' verbs can also be reciprocal; for example, הִתְכַּתֵּב {{IPA|/hitkaˈtev/}} (''to write to each other'', i.e. ''to correspond'') is the reciprocal of כָּתַב {{IPA|/kaˈtav/}} (''to write'').

In all of the above uses, the ''hitpa'el'' verb contrasts with a ''pu'al'' or ''huf'al'' verb in two ways: firstly, the subject of the ''hitpa'el'' verb is generally either performing the action, or at least complicit in it, whereas the subject of the ''pu'al'' or ''huf'al'' verb is generally not; and secondly, ''pu'al'' and ''huf'al'' verbs often convey a sense of completeness, which ''hitpa'el'' verbs generally do not. So whereas the sentence אֲנִי מְצֻלָּם {{IPA|/aˈni '''met͡suˈlam'''/}} (''I am photographed'', using ''pu'al'') means something like ''there exists a photo of me'', implying that the photo already exists, and not specifying whether the speaker caused the photo to be taken, the sentence אֲנִי מִצְטַלֵּם {{IPA|/aˈni '''mit͡staˈlem'''/}} (''I am photographed'', using ''hitpa'el'') means something like ''I'm having my picture taken'', implying that the picture does not exist yet, and that the speaker is causing the picture to be taken.

In other cases, ''hitpa'el'' verbs are ordinary intransitive verbs; for example, התנהג {{IPA|/hitnaˈheɡ/}} (''to behave''), structurally is the reciprocal of נהג {{IPA|/naˈhaɡ/}} (''to act''), as in נְהַג''' בְּחָכְמָה''' {{IPA|/'''neˈhag''' be-ħoχˈma/}} (''act wisely''). However, it is used sparsely, only in sayings as such, and the more common meaning of ''nahaɡ'' is ''to drive''; for that meaning, הִתְנַהֵג {{IPA|/hitnaˈheɡ/}} is not a reciprocal form, but a separate verb in effect. For example: in talking about a car that drives itself, one would say מְכוֹנִית שֶׁנּוֹהֶגֶת אֶת עַצְמָהּ {{IPA|/meχoˈnit ʃe-'''noˈheɡet''' ʔet ʕat͡sˈmah/}} (''a car that '''drives''' itself'', using ''nahag''), not מְכוֹנִית שֶׁמִּתְנַהֶגֶת {{IPA|/meχoˈnit ʃe-'''mitnaˈheɡet'''/}} (''a car that '''behaves''''', using ''hitnaheg'').

==Nouns==
The Hebrew [[noun]] (שֵׁם עֶצֶם {{IPA|/ʃem ʕet͡sem/}}) is inflected for number and state, but not for [[grammatical case|case]] and therefore Hebrew nominal structure is normally not considered to be strictly [[declension]]al. Nouns are generally related to verbs (by shared roots), but their formation is not as systematic, often due to [[loanword]]s from foreign languages.  Hebrew nouns are also inflected for definiteness by application of the prefix ַה (ha) before the given noun. Semantically, the prefix "ha" corresponds roughly to the English word "the".

===Gender: masculine and feminine===
Every noun in Hebrew has a [[grammatical gender|gender]], either masculine or feminine (or both); for example, סֵפֶר {{IPA|/ˈsefer/}} (''book'') is masculine, while דֶּלֶת {{IPA|/ˈdelet/}} (''door'') is feminine. There is no strict system of [[morphology (linguistics)|formal]] gender, but there is a tendency for nouns ending in ת ({{IPA|/-t/}}) or ה (usually {{IPA|/-a/}}) to be feminine and for nouns ending in other letters to be masculine. There is a very strong tendency toward [[natural gender]] for nouns referring to people and some animals. Such nouns generally come in pairs, one masculine and one feminine; for example, אִישׁ {{IPA|/iʃ/}} means ''man'' and אִשָּׁה {{IPA|/iˈʃa/}} means ''woman''. (When discussing mixed-sex groups, the plural of the masculine noun is used.)

===Number: singular, plural, and dual===
Hebrew nouns are inflected for [[grammatical number]]; as in English, [[count noun]]s have a singular form for referring to one object and a plural form for referring to more than one. Unlike in English, some count nouns also have separate ''dual'' forms, for referring to two objects; see below.

Masculine nouns generally form their plural by adding the suffix ים {{IPA|/-im/}}:
*מַחְשֵׁב {{IPA|/maħˈshev/}} (''computer'') → מַחְשְׁבִים {{IPA|/maħʃeˈvim/}} (''computers'')

The addition of the extra syllable usually causes the vowel in the first syllable to shorten if it is [[Kamatz]]:
*דָּבָר {{IPA|/davar/}} (''thing'') → דְּבָרִים {{IPA|/dvaˈrim/}} (''things'')

Many common two-syllable masculine nouns accented on the penultimate syllable (often called ''[[segolate]]s'', because many (but not all) of them have the vowel {{IPA|/seˈɡol/}} ({{IPA|/-e-/}}) in the last syllable), undergo more drastic characteristic vowel changes in the plural:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GHG|84|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*יֶלֶד {{IPA|/ˈyeled/}} (''boy'') → יְלָדִים {{IPA|/jelaˈdim/}} (''boys'', ''children'')
*בֹּקֶר {{IPA|/ˈboker/}} (''morning'') → בְּקָרִים {{IPA|/bkaˈrim/}} (''mornings'')
*חֶדֶר {{IPA|/ˈħeder/}} (''room'') → חֲדָרִים {{IPA|/ħadaˈrim/}} (''rooms'')

Feminine nouns ending in {{IPA|/-a/}} or {{IPA|/-at/}} generally drop this ending and add {{IPA|/-ot/}}, usually without any vowel changes:
*מִטָּה {{IPA|/mita/}} (''bed'') → מִטּוֹת {{IPA|/miˈtːot/}} (''beds'')
*מִסְעָדָה {{IPA|/mis'ada/}} (''restaurant'') → מִסְעָדוֹת {{IPA|/misʕaˈdot/}} (''restaurants'')
*צַּלַּחַת {{IPA|/Tsalahat/}} (''plate'') → צַלָּחוֹת {{IPA|/t͡salaˈħot/}} (''plates'')

Nouns ending in {{IPA|/-e-et/}} also replace this ending with {{IPA|/-ot/}}, with an {{IPA|/-e-/}} in the preceding syllable usually changing to {{IPA|/-a-/}}:
*מַחְבֶּרֶת {{IPA|/maħˈberet/}} (''notebook'') → מַחְבָּרוֹת {{IPA|/maħbaˈrot/}} (''notebooks'')

Nouns ending in {{IPA|/-ut/}} and {{IPA|/-it/}} replace these endings with {{IPA|/-ujot/}} and {{IPA|/-ijot/}}, respectively:
*חֲנוּת {{IPA|/ħaˈnut/}} (''store'') → חֲנוּיוֹת {{IPA|/ħanuˈjot/}} (''stores'')
*אֶשְׁכּוֹלִית {{IPA|/eshkoˈlit/}} (''grapefruit'') → אֶשְׁכּוֹלִיּוֹת {{IPA|/eʃkoliˈjot/}} (''grapefruits'')

====Plural exceptions====
A large number of masculine nouns take the usually feminine ending {{IPA|/-ot/}} in the plural:
*מָקוֹם {{IPA|/maˈkom/}} (''place'') → מְקוֹמוֹת {{IPA|/mekoˈmot/}} (''places'')
*חַלּוֹן {{IPA|/ħalon/}} (''window'') → חַלּוֹנוֹת {{IPA|/ħaloˈnot/}} (''windows'')

A small number of feminine nouns take the usually masculine ending {{IPA|/-im/}}:
*מִלָּה {{IPA|/mila/}} (''word'') → מִלִּים {{IPA|/miˈlim/}} (''words'')
*שָׁנָה {{IPA|/Shana/}} (''year'') → שָׁנִים {{IPA|/ʃaˈnim/}} (''years'')

Many plurals are completely irregular:
*עִיר {{IPA|/Ir/}} (''city'') → עָרִים {{IPA|/ʕaˈrim/}} (''cities'')
*עִפָּרוֹן {{IPA|/Iparon/}} (''pencil'') → עֶפְרוֹנוֹת {{IPA|/ʕefroˈnot/}} (''pencils'')
*אִישׁ {{IPA|/Ish/}} (''man''; root ʔ-I-ʃ) → אֲנָשִׁים {{IPA|/ʔanaˈʃim/}} (''men'', ''people''; root ʔ-N-ʃ)

Some forms, like אָחוֹת ← אֲחָיוֹת (sister) or חָמוֹת ← חֲמָיוֹת (mother-in-law) reflect the historical [[broken plural]]s of [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]], which have been preserved in other Semitic languages (most notably [[Arabic language|Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Ge'ez (Axum)" by Gene Gragg in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' edited by Roger D. Woodard (2004) {{ISBN|0-521-56256-2}}, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hebrew" by P. Kyle McCarter Jr. in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' edited by Roger D. Woodard (2004) {{ISBN|0-521-56256-2}}, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dual====
Hebrew also has a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]], expressed in the ending {{IPA|/-ajim/}}, but even in ancient times its use was very restricted. In modern times, it is usually used in expressions of time and number, or items that are inherently dual. These nouns have plurals as well, which are used for numbers higher than two, for example:

{| class="wikitable"
! Singular || Double || Triple
|-
| פַּעַם אַחַת {{IPA|/'''ˈpa'am''' aˈħat/}} (''once'')
| פַּעֲמַיִם {{IPA|/'''pa'amayim'''/}} (''twice'')
| שָׁלוֹשׁ פְּעָמִים {{IPA|/Shalosh '''pe'amim'''/}} (''thrice'')
|-
| שָׁבוּעַ אֶחָד {{IPA|/'''Shavua''' eˈħad/}} (''one week'')
| שְׁבוּעַיִם {{IPA|/'''Shvuaim'''/}} (''two weeks)
| שְׁלוֹשָׁה שָׁבוּעוֹת {{IPA|/Shlosha '''Shavuot'''/}} (''three weeks'')
|-
| מֵאָה {{IPA|/'''ˈme'a'''/}} (''one hundred'')
| מָאתַיִם {{IPA|/'''maˈtayim'''/}} (''two hundred'')
| שְׁלוֹשׁ מֵאוֹת {{IPA|/ˈShlosh '''me'ot'''/}} (''three hundred'')
|}

The dual is also used for some body parts, for instance:

*רֶגֶל {{IPA|/ˈreɡel/}} (''foot'') → רַגְלַיִם {{IPA|/raɡˈlajim/}} (''feet'')
*אֹזֶן {{IPA|/ˈozen/}} (''ear'') → אָזְנַיִם {{IPA|/ʔozˈnajim/}} (''ears'')
*עַיִן {{IPA|/ˈAyin/}} (''eye'') → עֵינַיִם {{IPA|/ʕe(j)ˈnajim/}} (''eyes'')
*יָד {{IPA|/Yad/}} (''hand'') → יָדַיִם {{IPA|/jaˈdajim/}} (''hands'')

In this case, even if there are more than two, the dual is still used, for instance {{IPA|/leˈχelev jeʃ ˈarbaʕ '''raɡˈlajim'''/}} ("a dog has four '''legs'''").

The dual is also used for certain objects that are "inherently" dual. These words have no singular, for instance משקפים {{IPA|/miʃkaˈfajim/}} (''eyeglasses'') and מספרים {{IPA|/mispaˈrajim/}} (''scissors''). As in the English "two pairs of pants", the plural of these words uses the word זוּג {{IPA|/zuɡ/}} (''pair''), e.g. {{IPA|/ʃne '''zuˈɡot''' mispaˈrajim/}} ("two '''pairs-of''' scissors-&lt;small&gt;DUAL&lt;/small&gt;"). Similarly, the dual can be found in some place names, such as the city גִּבְעָתַיִם ''[[Givatayim|{{IPA|/Givʕaˈtajim/}}]]'' (''Twin Peaks'', referring to the two hills of the landscape on which the city is built).

===Noun construct===
In Hebrew, as in English, a noun can modify another noun. This is achieved by placing the modifier immediately after what it modifies, in a construction called סְמִיכוּת {{IPA|/smiˈχut/}}. The noun being modified appears in its ''construct form'', or ''[[status constructus]]''. For most nouns, the construct form is derived fairly easily from the normal (indefinite) form:
*The singular of a masculine noun typically does not change form.
*The plural of a masculine noun typically replaces the suffix ים- {{IPA|/-im/}} with the suffix י- {{IPA|/-e/}}.
*The singular of a feminine noun ending in ה- {{IPA|/-a/}} typically replaces that ה with a ת {{IPA|/-at/}}.
*The plural of a feminine noun typically does not change form.

There are many words (usually ancient ones) that have changes in vocalization in the construct form. For example, the construct form of {{IPA|/ˈbajit/}} (house) is {{IPA|/bet/}}.

In addition, the definite article is never placed on the first noun (the one in the construct form).

*בֵּית סֵפֶר {{IPA|/'''bet''' ˈsefer/}} (literally, '''''house-of''' book'' or ''book'''house''''', i.e. ''school'')
*בֵּית הַסֵּפֶר {{IPA|/bet '''ha'''-ˈsefer/}} (literally, ''house-of '''the'''-book'', i.e. '''''the''' school'')
*בָּתֵּי חוֹלִים {{IPA|/baˈte ħoˈlim/}} (literally, ''houses-of sick-people'', i.e. ''hospitals'')
*עוּגַת הַשּׁוֹקוֹלָד {{IPA|/ʕuɡat ha-ʃokolad/}} (''the chocolate cake'')
*דֹּאַר אֲוִיר {{IPA|/ˈdoʔar ʔaˈvir/}} (''air mail'')
*כֶּלֶב רְחוֹב {{IPA|/ˈkelev reˈħov/}} (''street dog'')
*בַּקְבּוּק הֶחָלָב {{IPA|/bakˈbuk he-ħaˈlav/}} (''the bottle of milk'')

However, this rule is not always adhered to in informal or colloquial speech; one finds, for example, הָעוֹרֵךְ דִּין {{IPA|/ha-ˈoʁeχ din/}} (literally ''the law organiser'', i.e. ''lawyer'').

===Possession===
Possession is generally indicated using the preposition של {{IPA|/ʃel/}}, ''of'' or ''belonging to'':

*הַסֵּפֶר שֶׁלִּי {{IPA|/ha-ˈsefer '''ʃeˈli'''/}} (literally ''the-book '''of-me''''', i.e. '''''my''' book'')
*הַדִּירָה שֶׁלְּךָ {{IPA|/ha-diˈra '''ʃelˈχa'''/}} (literally ''the-apartment '''of-you''''', i.e. '''''your''' apartment'', single masculine form)
*הַמִּשְׂחָק שֶׁל אֶנְדֶּר {{IPA|/ha-misˈħaq '''ʃel ˈender'''/}} (literally ''the-game '''of-Ender''''', i.e. [[Ender's Game|'''Ender's''' Game]]'')

In literary style, nouns are inflected to show possession through noun declension; a personal suffix is added to the construct form of the noun (discussed above). So, סִפְרֵי {{IPA|/sifˈre/}} (''books of'') can be inflected to form סְפָרַי {{IPA|/sfaˈraj/}} (''my books''),סְפָרֶיךָ {{IPA|/sfaˈre)χa/}} (''your books'', singular masculine form), סְפָרֵינוּ {{IPA|/sfaˈrenu/}} (''our books''), and so forth, while דִּירַת {{IPA|/diˈrat/}} (''apartment of'') gives דִּירָתִי {{IPA|/diraˈti/}} (my apartment), דִּירַתְךָ {{IPA|/diratˈχa/}} (''your apartment''; singular masculine form),דִּירָתֵנוּ {{IPA|/diraˈtenu/}} (''our apartment''), etc.

While the use of these forms is mostly restricted to formal and literary speech, they are in regular use in some colloquial phrases, such as ?מָה שְׁלוֹמְךָ {{IPA|/ma ʃlomˈχa?/}} (literally "what peace-of-you?", i.e. "what is your peace?", i.e. "how are you?", singular masculine form) or לְדַעֲתִי {{IPA|/ledaʕaˈti/}} (''in my opinion''/''according to my knowledge'').

In addition, the inflected possessive is commonly used for terms of kinship; for instance, בְּנִי {{IPA|/bni/}} (''my son''), בִּתָּם {{IPA|/biˈtam/}} (''their daughter''), and אִשְׁתּוֹ {{IPA|/iʃˈto/}} (''his wife'') are preferred to הַבֵּן שֶׁלִּי {{IPA|/ha-ˈben ʃe'li/}}, הַבַּת שֶׁלָּהֶם {{IPA|/ha-ˈbat ʃelahem/}}, and הָאִשָּׁה שֶׁלּוֹ {{IPA|/ha-ʔiˈʃa ʃe'lo/}}. However, usage differs for different [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] and [[sociolect]]s: In general, the colloquial will use more analytic constructs in place of noun declensions.

===Noun derivation===
In the same way that Hebrew verbs are conjugated by applying various prefixes, suffixes and internal vowel combinations, Hebrew nouns can be formed by applying various "meters" (Hebrew {{IPA|/miʃkaˈlim/}})  and suffixes to the same roots. Gerunds are one example (see above).

Many abstract nouns are derived from another noun, or from a verb (usually one in binyan ''hitpaʕel'') using the suffix {{IPA|/-ut/}}:
*סֵפֶר {{IPA|/ˈsefer/}} (''book'') → סִפְרוּת {{IPA|/sifˈrut/}} (''literature'')
*הִתְיַעֵץ {{IPA|/hitjaˈʕet͡s/}} (''to consult'') → הִתְיַעֲצוּת {{IPA|/hitjaʕaˈt͡sut/}} (''consultation'')
*הִתְרַגֵּשׁ {{IPA|/hitraˈɡeʃ/}} (''to get excited'') → הִתְרַגְּשׁוּת {{IPA|/hitraɡˈʃut/}} (''excitement'')

The קַטְלָן ''{{IPA|/katˈlan/}}'' meter applied to a root, and the {{IPA|/-an/}} suffix applied to a noun, indicate an agent or job:
*שֶׁקֶר {{IPA|/ˈʃeker/}} (''lie'') (root: ש-ק-ר ʃ-q-r) → שַׁקְרָן {{IPA|/ʃak'ran/}} (''liar'')
*פַּחַד {{IPA|/ˈpaħad/}} (''fear'') (root: פ-ח-ד p-ħ-d) → פַּחְדָן {{IPA|/paħˈdan/}} (''coward'')
*חָלָב {{IPA|/ħaˈlav/}} (''milk'') → חַלְבָן {{IPA|/ħalˈvan/}} (''milkman'')
*סֵדֶר {{IPA|/ˈseder/}} (''order'') → סַדְרָן {{IPA|/sadˈran/}} (''usher'')
 
The suffix {{IPA|/-on/}} usually denotes a diminutive:
*מִטְבָּח {{IPA|/mitˈbaħ/}} (''kitchen'') → מִטְבָּחוֹן {{IPA|/mitbaˈħon/}} (''kitchenette'')
*סֵפֶר {{IPA|/ˈsefer/}} (''book'') → סִפְרוֹן {{IPA|/sifˈron/}} (''booklet'')
*מַחְשֵׁב {{IPA|/maħˈʃev/}} (''computer'') → מַחְשְׁבוֹן {{IPA|/maħʃeˈvon/}} (''calculator'')

Though occasionally this same suffix can denote an augmentative:
*חֲנָיָה {{IPA|/ħanaˈja/}} (''parking space'') → חַנְיוֹן {{IPA|/ħanˈjon/}} (''parking lot'')
*קֶרַח {{IPA|/ˈkeraħ/}} (''ice'') → קַרְחוֹן {{IPA|/karˈħon/}} (''glacier'')

Repeating the last two letters of a noun or adjective can also denote a diminutive:
*כֶּלֶב {{IPA|/ˈkelev/}} (''dog'') → כְּלַבְלַב {{IPA|/klavˈlav/}} (''puppy'')
*קָצָר {{IPA|/kaˈt͡sar/}} (''short'') → קְצַרְצַר {{IPA|/kt͡sarˈt͡sar/}} (''very short'')

The קָטֶּלֶת''{{IPA|/kaˈtelet/}}'' meter commonly used to name diseases:
*אָדֹם {{IPA|/ʔaˈdom/}} (''red'') → אַדֶּמֶת {{IPA|/ʔaˈdemet/}} (''measles'')
*כֶּלֶב {{IPA|/ˈkelev/}} (''dog'') → כַּלֶּבֶת {{IPA|/kaˈlevet/}} (''rabies'')
*צָהֹב {{IPA|/t͡saˈhov/}} (''yellow'') → צַהֶבֶת {{IPA|/t͡saˈhevet/}} (''jaundice'', more colloquially ''hepatitis'')

However, it can have various different meanings as well:
*נְיָר {{IPA|/neˈjar/}} (''paper'') → נַיֶּרֶת {{IPA|/naˈjeret/}} (''paperwork'')
*כֶּסֶף {{IPA|/ˈkesef/}} (''money'') → כַּסֶּפֶת {{IPA|/kaˈsefet/}} (''a safe'')

New nouns are also often formed by the combination of two existing stems:
*קוֹל {{IPA|/kol/}} (''sound'') + נוֹעַ {{IPA|/ˈno.aʕ/}} (''motion'') → קוֹלְנוֹע {{IPA|/kolˈno.aʕ/}} (''cinema'')
*רֶמֶז {{IPA|/ˈremez/}} (''hint'') + אוֹר {{IPA|/ʔor/}} (''light'') → רַמְזוֹר {{IPA|/ramˈzor/}} (''traffic light'')
*קְנִיָּה {{IPA|/kniˈja/}} (''purchase'') + חַנְיוֹן {{IPA|/ħanˈjon/}} (''parking lot'') → קַנְיוֹן {{IPA|/kanˈjon/}} (''shopping mall'')
רַמְזוֹר {{IPA|/ramˈzor/}} uses more strictly recent compound conventions, as the א aleph (today usually silent but historically very specifically a [[glottal stop]]) is dropped entirely from spelling and pronunciation of the compound.

Some nouns use a combination of methods of derivation:
*תּוֹעֶלֶת {{IPA|/toˈʕelet/}} (''benefit'') → תוֹעַלְתָּנוּת {{IPA|/toʕaltaˈnut/}} (''Utilitarianism'') (suffix {{IPA|/-an/}} followed by suffix {{IPA|/-ut/}})
*קֹמֶץ {{IPA|/ˈkomet͡s/}} (''handful'') → קַמְצָן {{IPA|/kamˈt͡san/}} (''miser'', ''miserly'') → קַמְצָנוּת {{IPA|/qamt͡sanˈut/}} (''miserliness'') (suffix {{IPA|/-an/}} followed by suffix {{IPA|/-ut/}})

==Adjectives==
In Hebrew, an [[adjective]] (שֵׁם תֹּאַר {{IPA|/ʃem toar/}}) comes after the noun and agrees in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun which it modifies:
*סֵפֶר '''קָטָן''' {{IPA|/ˈsefer '''kaˈtan'''/}}  (''a '''small''' book'')
*סְפָרִים '''קְטַנִּים''' {{IPA|/sfaˈrim '''ktaˈnim'''/}} ( '''small''' books'')
*בֻּבָּה '''קְטַנָּה''' {{IPA|/buˈba '''ktaˈna'''/}} (''a '''small''' doll'')
*בֻּבּוֹת '''קְטַנּוֹת''' {{IPA|/buˈbot '''ktaˈnot'''/}} ('''''small''' dolls'')

Adjectives ending in ''-i'' have slightly different forms:
*אִישׁ '''מְקוֹמִי''' {{IPA|/ʔiʃ '''mekoˈmi'''/}} (''a '''local''' man'')
*אִשָּׁה '''מְקוֹמִית''' {{IPA|/ʔiˈʃa '''mekoˈmit'''/}} (''a '''local''' woman'')
*אֲנָשִׁים '''מְקוֹמִיִּים''' {{IPA|/ʔanaˈʃim '''mekomiˈjim'''/}} ('''''local''' people'')
*נָשִׁים '''מְקוֹמִיּוֹת''' {{IPA|/naˈʃim '''mekomiˈjot'''/}} ('''''local''' women'')

Masculine nouns that take the feminine plural ending {{IPA|/-ot/}} still take masculine plural adjectives, e.g. מְקוֹמוֹת '''יָפִים''' {{IPA|/mekoˈmot '''jaˈfim'''/}} ('''''beautiful''' places''). The reverse goes for feminine plural nouns ending in {{IPA|/-im/}}, e.g. מִלִּים '''אֲרֻכּוֹת''' {{IPA|/miˈlim ʔaruˈkot/}} ('''''long''' words'').

Note also that many adjectives, like segolate nouns, change their vowel structure in the feminine and plural.

===Use of the definite article with adjectives===
In Hebrew, unlike in English, each [[attributive]] adjective follows the noun and takes the definite article if it modifies a definite noun (either a proper noun, or a definite common noun):

*הַמְּכוֹנִית הַחֲדָשָׁה הָאֲדֻמָּה הַמְּהִירָה {{IPA|/ha-mχonit ha-ħadaʃa ha-ʔaduma ha-mhira/}} (The new, red, fast car, ''lit.'' The car the new the red the fast'' (f.sing.)'')

The case of a proper noun highlights the fact that all Hebrew adjectives can be interpreted as [[appositive]] nouns. For example, contrast the following:

*דָּוִד הַגָּדוֹל {{IPA|/daˈvid ha-ɡaˈdol/}} (David the Great, ''lit.'' David the-great ''(m.sing.)'')
*דָּוִד הַמֶּלֶךְ {{IPA|/daˈvid ha-ˈmeleχ/}} (David the King, ''lit.'' David the-king)

===Adjectives derived from verbs===
Many adjectives in Hebrew are derived from the present tense of verbs. These adjectives are inflected the same way as the verbs they are derived from:
*סוֹעֵר {{IPA|/soˈʕer/}} (stormy, paʕal) → סוֹעֶרֶת {{IPA|/soˈʕeret/}}, סוֹעֲרִים {{IPA|/soʕaˈrim/}}, סוֹעֲרוֹת {{IPA|/soʕaˈrot/}}
*מְנֻתָּק {{IPA|/menuˈtak/}} (alienated, puʕal) → מְנֻתֶּקֶת {{IPA|/menuˈteket/}}, מְנֻתָּקִים {{IPA|/menutaˈkim/}}, מְנֻתָּקוֹת {{IPA|/menutaˈkot/}}
*מַרְשִׁים {{IPA|/marˈʃim/}} (impressive, hifʕil) → מַרְשִׁימָה {{IPA|/marʃiˈma/}}, מַרְשִׁימִים {{IPA|/marʃiˈmim/}}, מַרְשִׁימוֹת {{IPA|/marʃiˈmot/}}

==Adverbs==
The Hebrew term for adverb is תֹּאַר הַפֹּעַל {{IPA|/ˈtoʔar ha-ˈpoʕal/}}.

Hebrew forms adverbs in several different ways.

Some adjectives have corresponding one-word adverbs. In many cases, the adverb is simply the adjective's masculine singular form:
* חָזָק {{IPA|/ħaˈzak/}} (''strong'' or ''strongly'')
* בָּרוּר {{IPA|/baˈrur/}} (''clear'' or ''clearly'')
In other cases, the adverb has a distinct form:
*מַהֵר {{IPA|/maˈher/}} (''quickly''; from the adjective מָהִיר {{IPA|/maˈhir/}}, ''quick'')
*לְאַט {{IPA|/leʔat/}} (''slowly''; from the adjective אִטִּי {{IPA|/iˈti/}}, ''slow'')
*הֵיטֵב  {{IPA|/heˈtev/}} (''well''; from the adjective טוֹב {{IPA|/tov/}},  ''good'')

In some cases, an adverb is derived from an adjective using its singular feminine form or (mostly in poetic or archaic usage) its plural feminine form:
*אוֹטוֹמָטִית {{IPA|/otoˈmatit/}} (''automatically'')
*קַלּוֹת {{IPA|/kaˈlot/}} (''lightly'')

Most adjectives, however, do not have corresponding one-word adverbs; rather, they have corresponding adverb ''phrases'', formed using one of the following approaches:
*using the prepositional prefix ב {{IPA|/be-/}} (''in'') with the adjective's corresponding abstract noun:
**בִּזְהִירוּת {{IPA|/bi-zhiˈrut/}} ("in carefulness": ''carefully'')
**בַּעֲדִינוּת {{IPA|/ba-ʕadiˈnut/}} ("in fineness": ''finely'')
*using the same prefix, but with the noun אֹפֶן {{IPA|/ˈʔofen/}} (''means/fashion''), and modifying the noun with the adjective's masculine singular form:
**בְּאֹפֶן אִטִּי {{IPA|/beˈʔofen ʔiˈti/}} ("in slow fashion": ''slowly'').
*similarly, but with the noun צוּרָה {{IPA|/t͡suˈra/}} (''like/shape''), and using the adjective's ''feminine'' singular form:
** בְּצוּרָה אָפְיָנִית {{IPA|/be-t͡suˈra ʔofjaˈnit/}} ("in characteristic form": ''characteristically'').

The use of one of these methods does not necessarily preclude the use of the others; for example, ''slowly'' may be either לְאַט {{IPA|/leˈʔat/}} (a one-word adverb), בְּאִטִּיּוּת {{IPA|/be-ʔitiˈjut/}} (literally "in slowness", a somewhat more elegant way of expressing the same thing) or בְּאֹפֶן אִטִּי {{IPA|/beˈʔofen ʔiˈti/}} ("in slow fashion"), as mentioned above.

Finally, as in English, there are various adverbs that do not have corresponding adjectives at all:
*לָכֵן {{IPA|/laˈχen/}} (''therefore'')
*כָּכָה {{IPA|/ˈkaχa/}} (''thus'')

==Prepositions==
Like English, Hebrew is primarily a [[preposition]]al language, with a large number of prepositions. Several of Hebrew's most common prepositions, however, unlike any in English, are prefixes rather than separate words; for example, English '''''in''' the room'' is Hebrew בַּחֶדֶר {{IPA|/'''b'''a-ˈħeder/}}.

===Direct objects===

The preposition אֶת {{IPA|/ʔet/}} plays an important role in Hebrew grammar. Its most common use is to introduce a direct object; for example, English ''I see the book'' is in Hebrew אֲנִי רוֹאֶה אֶת הַסֵּפֶר {{IPA|/ʔaˈni roˈʔe ʔet ha-ˈsefer/}} (literally ''I see ''{{IPA|/ʔet/}}'' the-book''). However, אֶת /ʔet/ is used only with semantically ''definite'' direct objects, such as nouns with ''the'', proper nouns, and personal pronouns; with semantically ''indefinite'' direct objects, it is simply omitted: אֲנִי רוֹאֶה סֵפֶר ''ʔani roʔe sefer'' (''I see a book'') does not use את /ʔet/. This has no direct translation into English, and is best described as an object particle — that is, it denotes that the word it precedes is the direct object of the verb.

Finally, אֶת /ʔet/ has a number of special uses; for example, when the adjective צָרִיךְ {{IPA|/t͡saˈriχ/}} (''in need (of)'') takes a definite noun complement, it uses the preposition אֶת /ʔet/: הָיִיתִי צָרִיךְ אֶת זֶה {{IPA|/haˈjiti t͡saˈriχ ʔet ze/}} (literally ''I-was in-need-of {{IPA|/ʔet/}} this'', i.e. ''I needed this''). Here as elsewhere, the אֶת {{IPA|/ʔet/}} is dropped with an indefinite complement: הָיוּ צְרִיכִים יוֹתֵר {{IPA|/haˈju t͡sriˈχim joˈter/}} (literally ''they-were in-need-of more'', i.e. ''they needed more''). This is perhaps related to the verb-like fashion in which the adjective is used.

In Biblical Hebrew, there is possibly another use of /ʔet/.  Waltke and O'Connor (pp.&amp;nbsp;177–178) make the point: "...(1) ...sign of the accusative ... (2) More recent grammarians regard it as a marker of emphasis used most often with definite nouns in the accusative role. The apparent occurrences with the nominative are most problematic ... AM Wilson late in the nineteenth century concluded from his exhaustive study of all the occurrences of the debated particle that it had an intensive or reflexive force in some of its occurrences. Many grammarians have followed his lead. (reference lists studies of 1955, 1964, 1964, 1973, 1965, 1909, 1976.) On such a view, /ʔet/ is a weakened emphatic particle corresponding to the English pronoun 'self' ... It resembles Greek 'autos' and Latin 'ipse' both sometimes used for emphasis, and like them it can be omitted from the text, without obscuring the grammar. This explanation of the particle's meaning harmonizes well with the facts that the particle is used in Mishnaic Hebrew as a demonstrative and is found almost exclusively with determinate nouns."

====Pronominal suffix====
There is a form called the verbal pronominal suffix, in which a direct object can be rendered as an additional suffix onto the verb. This form allows for a high degree of word economy, as the single fully conjugated verb expresses the verb, its voice, its subject, its object, and its tense.

*שְׁמַרְנוּהוּ {{IPA|/ʃmarˈnuhu/}} (''we protected him'')

In modern usage, the verbal pronominal suffixes are rarely used, in favor of expression of direct objects as the inflected form of the separate word ''ʔet''.  It is used more commonly in biblical and poetic Hebrew (for instance, in prayers).

===Indirect objects===
Indirect objects are objects requiring a preposition other than אֶת {{IPA|/ʔet/}}. The preposition used depends on the verb, and these can be very different from the one used in English. A good dictionary is required to look these up. In the case of definite indirect objects, the preposition will replace את {{IPA|/ʔet/}}.

* שָׁכַחְתִּי מֵהַבְּחִירוֹת {{IPA|/ʃaˈχaħti me-'''ha-bħiˈrot'''/}} (''I forgot about '''the election''''')

The Hebrew grammar distinguishes between various kinds of indirect objects, according to what they specify. Thus, there is a division between objects for time תֵּאוּר זְמַן ({{IPA|/teˈʔur zman/}}), objects for place תֵּאוּר מָקוֹם ({{IPA|/teʔur maˈkom/}}), objects for reason תֵּאוּר סִבָּה ({{IPA|/teˈʔur siˈba/}}) and many others.

In Hebrew, there are no distinct [[prepositional pronoun]]s; if the object of a preposition is a pronoun, but the preposition contracts with the object, and the [[inflected preposition]] thus formed can be considered the indirect object of the sentence.

*דִּבַּרְנוּ עִם דָּוִד {{IPA|/diˈbarnu ʕim 'david/}} (''we spoke with David'')
*דִּבַּרְנוּ אִתּוֹ {{IPA|/diˈbarnu iˈto/}} (''we spoke with him'')
:The preposition עִם {{IPA|/ʕim/}} (''with'') in everyday speech is not inflected, rather a different, more archaic pronoun אֶת {{IPA|/ʔet/}} with the same meaning, unrelated to the direct object marker, is used instead.

As mentioned above, the direct object is often rendered with the word את /ʔet/. /ʔet/ is excluded only when the direct object is a non-definite noun.

*שָׁמַרְנוּ אֶת דָּוִד {{IPA|/ʃaˈmarnu ʔet daˈvid/}} (''we protected David'')
*שָׁמַרְנוּ מָקוֹם {{IPA|/ʃaˈmarnu maˈkom/}} (''we saved a place'')
&lt;!-- Additionally, Hebrew distinguishes between various kinds of verbless fragments, acting as [[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parentheses]], according to their use, such as [[apposition]]s תְּמוּרָה {{IPA|/tmuˈra/}} for elaboration, [[interjection]]s קְרִיאָה {{IPA|/kriˈʔa/}} for exclamation, [[Vocative case|addresses]] פְּנִיָּה {{IPA|/pniˈja/}} for approach and &lt;!-- how does one say an opinionated statement? --&gt; הֶסְגֵּר {{IPA|/hesˈɡer/}} for disclosing the opinion of another party using direct speech (e.g. לְדַעַת הָרוֹפֵא, הָעִשּׁוּן מַזִּיק לַבְּרִיאוּת {{IPA|/leˈdaʕat ha-roˈfeʔ, ha-ʕiˈʃun maˈzik la-briˈʔut/}} (''in the doctor's opinion, smoking is harmful to health'').--&gt;

'''Nengone''' is a language of the [[Loyalty Islands]], [[New Caledonia]].

==Phonology==
The phonological inventory of consonants is untypically large for an oceanic language. Many sounds which are alophones in other sub-families are distinct sounds in the Nengone language:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tryon, Darrell T. 1967. Nengone Grammar&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4917">A '''Parsifal bell''' (German: ''Parsifal Klavier Instrument'') is a [[String instrument|stringed musical instrument]] designed as a substitute for the church [[bell (instrument)|bells]] that are called for in the score of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Parsifal]]''. {{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=867}}

The instrument was designed by [[Felix Mottl]], a conductor of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s works, and constructed by Schweisgut, of [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]].{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=867}}

==Construction==
It is constructed on the principle of the [[grand piano]]. A massive frame is shaped like a [[snooker table]]. The instrument has five notes; each note has six strings (three are tuned to the fundamental pitch, and three an octave higher). The strings are struck by large hammers, covered with cotton-wool, which the performer sets in motion by a strong elastic blow from his or her fist,{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|pp=867–868}} similar to the motion of playing a [[carillon]].

The hammers are attached to arms {{convert|22|in|cm}} long, which are screwed to a strong wooden span bridge placed horizontally above the strings at about two-fifths of the length from the front. On the point of the arm is the name of the note, and behind this the felt ledge struck by the fist. Two belly bridges and two wrest-plank bridges, one set for each octave, determine the vibrating length of the strings, and the belly bridge, as in other stringed instruments, is the medium through which the vibrations of the strings are communicated to the [[Sounding board|soundboard]]. The arrangement of pegs and wrest-pins is much the same as on the piano.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=868}}

==Need==
Difficulties arise whenever a composer writes a piece for orchestra in which he calls for reproducing the effect of [[church bell]]s. Well-known examples include ''[[1812 Overture]]'', ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'', ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', ''[[Pagliacci]]'', ''[[Rienzi]]'', and ''[[Parsifal]]''. The most serious difficulty of all arose in ''Parsifal'', where the bells are called for in an extremely solemn scene with deep religious significance. If real church bells were used for the notes Wagner wrote, they would overpower the orchestra and ruin the solemn atmosphere on the stage.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=868}}

==Earlier Wagnerian church bell substitutes==
Various substitutes for bells were tried in vain, but no other instrument gave a tone similar to that of church bells. This is because a bell sound consists of rich harmonics composing the clang, plus two distinct simultaneous notes, first the tap tone, which gives the pitch, and the [[strike tone|hum tone]] or lower accompanying note. The dignity and beauty of the bell tone depend on the interval separating the hum from the tap tone.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=868}}

A stringed instrument, similar to the Parsifal bell but having only four notes, was used at [[Bayreuth]] for the first performance of ''Parsifal'' in 1882, where it was combined with [[tam-tam]]s or [[gong]]s in an attempt to replicate the sound of a [[church bell]]. The instrument was built by the Bayreuth-based pianoforte manufacturer [[Steingraeber &amp; Söhne]]. After many trials the following combination was adopted as the best makeshift:{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=868}}
# the stringed instrument with four keys;
# four [[tam-tam]]s or [[gong]]s tuned to the pitch of the four notes composing the chime;
# a [[tuba]], which plays the notes staccato in quavers to help make them more distinct;
# a fifth tam-tam, on which a roll is executed with a drumstick.

==Modern church bell substitutes==
In most orchestral music, [[tubular bell]]s are used when a bell sound is called for.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In another special case, a special peal of hemispherical bells was constructed for use in performances of Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[cantata]], ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]''. Struck with mallets, they produced both tap and hum tone.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1911|p=868}} But ''Parsifal'' presented a particular problem because the lowest of the ''Golden Legend'' bells was a minor tenth higher than the lowest note required for Parsifal, and the aggregate weight of the four bells was thousands of pounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Modern productions of ''Parsifal'' typically use a synthesized, or electronically recorded, [[church bell]] sound.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Peadar Toner Mac Fhionnlaoich''' (5 October 1857 – 1 July 1942; {{lang-en|P.T. MacGinley}}), known as '''Cú Uladh''' (''The Hound of Ulster''), was an [[Irish language]] writer during the [[Gaelic Revival]]. He wrote stories based on [[Irish folklore]], some of the first Irish language plays, and regularly  wrote articles in most of the Irish language newspapers such as ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]''

In 1895 he married Elizabeth Woods ({{lang-ga|Sibhéal Ní Uadhaigh}}) and they had twelve children. He spoke Irish from an early age and kept an interest in the language throughout his life, first publishing and Irish language short story and poem in ''The Donegal Christmas Annual 1883''. It was not until 1895 while living in Belfast that he became involved in the Gaelic Movement.

==Conradh na Gaeilge==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">'''Pietro Zorutti''' (Pieri Çorut) (December 27, 1792 - February 23, 1867) was an Italian poet. His fame is mainly due to the publication each year from 1821 to 1867 of [[Friulian language]] poetry. Much of his Friulian poetry was based around the middle class dialect of [[Udine]], where he spent much of his life.&lt;ref name="Haller1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haller|first=Hermann W.|title=The Other Italy: The Literary Canon in Dialect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F4C4AXtLFIC&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=6 June 2012|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-4424-2|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most famous poem is ''[[Plovisine]]''.&lt;ref name="filosofialettere1945"&gt;{{cite book|author=Università cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

'''Siegfried Salomo Lipiner''' (24 October 1856 &amp;ndash; 30 December 1911) was an [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] [[writer]] and [[poet]] whose works made an impression on [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} but who published nothing after 1880 and lived out his life as Librarian of Parliament in [[Vienna]]. A poet and dramatist of highly individual character, he is today remembered in German-speaking literary circles mainly for his translations of the Polish poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]]; he is also known to [[music history]] as having been a close friend of [[Gustav Mahler]].

==Life==
Lipiner was born in [[Jarosław]]. A prodigious talent, he produced a well-regarded treatment of 'Prometheus Unbound' at the age of seventeen, He attended the [[University of Leipzig]] as a student of [[philosophy]], [[literature]] and natural science; one of his teachers was [[Gustav Fechner]]. By his early twenties, he had produced an important work on the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and become a personal acquaintance of Nietzsche &amp;mdash; who had called him 'a veritable genius'.

Lipiner was 24 when he met the 20-year-old Mahler, and his views on various subjects (including the 'redemptive' qualities of artistic creation) came to influence the young composer to a considerable extent. Lipiner features in the 'Recollections of Gustav Mahler' assembled by [[Natalie Bauer-Lechner]] &amp;mdash; who seems also to have kept a similar record of his actions and conversations, though this is now lost.

As his creativity waned, Lipiner's reputation seems to have depended more and more upon his personal fascination as a 'bon viveur' and skilled improviser of the philosophical rhapsodies with which he would entertain his circle of illustrious acquaintances in Vienna. Mahler's marriage to [[Alma Schindler]] in 1902 was followed by the composer's breaking with Lipiner for several years: the man whom [[Friedrich Eckstein]] described as 'that shy, melancholy, sensitive poet' and whom Mahler usually addressed as 'dearest Siegfried' was for Alma the object of a venomous dislike: "a bogus Goethe in his writing and a haggling [[Jew]] in his talk". By the end of Mahler's life, however, the two men had resumed their friendship. Lipiner died in [[Vienna]] a few months after Mahler's death.

'''''Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences'''''  ({{lang-fr|La structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines}}) was a lecture presented at [[Johns Hopkins University]] on 21 October 1966 by philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. The lecture was then published in 1967 as chapter ten of ''[[Writing and Difference]]'' ({{lang-fr|L'écriture et la différence}}). 

"Structure, Sign, and Play" identifies a tendency for philosophers to denounce each other for relying on problematic discourse, and argues that this reliance is to some degree inevitable because we can only write in the language we inherit. Discussing the anthropology of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], Derrida argues that we are all ''[[Bricolage|bricoleurs]]'', creative tinkerers who must use the tools we find around us.

Although presented at a conference intended to popularize structuralism, the lecture is widely cited as the starting point for [[post-structuralism]] in the United States. Along with Derrida's longer text ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', it is also programmatic for the process of [[deconstruction]].

==Colloquium==
Derrida wrote "Structure, Sign, and Play" to present at a conference titled "The Language of Criticism and the Sciences of Man" held at Johns Hopkins University in [[Baltimore]] from 18–21 October 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference, organized by [[Richard A. Macksey]] for the newly founded Humanities Center, and sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]], brought together a collection of notable French thinkers, including [[Paul de Man]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean Hyppolite]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. ([[Michel Foucault]] was, in the words of Jean-Michel Rabaté, "notoriously absent".)&lt;ref name="Rabaté 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabaté|first=Jean-Michel|title=The future of theory|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780470779880|url=http://slought.org/content/11065/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Derrida reportedly wrote his essay rather quickly in the ten&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; or fifteen days preceding the conference.&lt;ref name="Parui 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parui|first=Avishek|title=An Introduction to Deconstruction|url=http://www.thebubble.org.uk/literature/an-introduction-to-deconstruction|publisher=The Bubble|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (According to one report, Derrida was a last-minute replacement for anthropologist [[Luc de Heusch]].)&lt;ref name="McCabe 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Bret|title=Structuralism's Samson|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2012/fall/structuralisms-samson|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=Johns Hopkins Magazine|date=Fall 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many attendees came from France, and spoke French during the event; French lectures were translated into English and distributed in print.&lt;ref&gt;Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), p. xxiii "The dominance of French as the natural language of the meetings was not unexpected, given the differing life-styles of American and European scholars, but it placed a considerable burden on those who generously supplied consecutive summary translations of the interventions, Bernard Vannier of Hopkins and Gerald Kamber of Bowdoin. Any review of the transcriptions reminds one of the wit and economy with which they courageously negotiated the bridge between the two languages."&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida's lecture was listed in the program and delivered in French, as "La structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines". (Lacan was one of the few French attendees to lecture in English; Lacan makes a point of this gesture at the beginning of the lecture, titled "Of Structure as the Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever".)&lt;ref&gt;Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), pp. 186–200. Available online at [http://www.lacan.com/hotel.htm lacan.com]. "Somebody spent some time this afternoon trying to convince me that it would surely not be a pleasure for an English-speaking audience to listen to my bad accent and that for me to speak in English would constitute a risk for what one might call the transmission of my message. Truly, for me it is a great case of conscience, because to do otherwise would be absolutely contrary to my own concept of the message: of the message as I will explain it to you, of the linguistic message. "&lt;/ref&gt;

"Structure, Sign, and Play" was first published in English in 1970, within a volume dedicated to the Johns Hopkins colloquium titled ''The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté argued in 2002 that the change in title reflected a desire to sensationalize the colloquium as a turning point in structuralism and academic "theory"; Macksey retorted in his 2007 introduction to the 40th anniversary volume that he changed the title due to a request from JHU press that the title be "shorter, zippier" and that it downplay the gendered term "Man". See: Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Macksey and Donato write in the preface to this volume that the goal of the conference was to clarify the field of structuralism and define some of its common problems across disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), p. xxii. "As this was the first time in the United States that structuralist thought had been considered as a cross-disciplinary phenomenon, the organizers of the program sought to identify certain basic problems and concerns common to every field of study[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
"Structure, sign, and play" discusses how philosophy and social science understand 'structures' abstractly. Derrida is dealing with structural''ism'', a type of analysis which understands individual elements of language and culture as embedded in larger structures. The archetypal examples of structuralism come from [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who showed how [[phonemes]] and words gain meaning only through relations with each other. (Derrida dealt directly with Saussure in a related book titled ''Of Grammatology''). The main object of this text is [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], whose [[structuralist anthropology]] analyzed the relationships between elements of cultural systems such as [[mythology]].

Derrida admires the reflexivity and abstract analyses of structuralism, but argues that these discourses have still not gone far enough in treating structures as free-floating (or 'playing') sets of relationships. In particular, he accuses structuralist discourses of holding on to a "center": a privileged term that anchors the structure and does not play. Whether this center is "God", "being", "presence", or "man" (as it was at the colloquium), its function is the same, and the history of structures is a history of substitutions, one center after another, for this constant position. Derrida suggests that this model of structure will end—is ending—and that a newer and freer (though still unknown) thinking about structures will emerge.

===An 'event' has perhaps occurred===
[[File:Capture mst.PNG|thumb|Where's the center?]]
The essay begins by speculating, "Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an 'event,' if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structural—structuralist—thought to reduce or suspect."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'event' involves changes in structuralism, structure, and in particular "the structurality of structure", which has hitherto been limited, writes Derrida, through the process of being assigned a stabilizing "center". The "center" is that element of a structure which appears given or fixed, thereby anchoring the rest of the structure and allowing it to play. In the history of metaphysics specifically, this function is fulfilled by different terms (which Derrida says are always associated with presence): "''eidos, archè, telos, energia, ousia'' (essence, existence, substance, subject) ''aletheia'', transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 249. "…the whole history of the concept of structure, before the rupture I spoke of, must be thought of as a series of substitutions of center for center, as a linked chain of determinations of the center. Successively, and in a regulated fashion, the center receives different forms or names. The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of these metaphors and metonymies."&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever term is at the center of the structure, argues Derrida, the overall pattern remains similar. This central term ironically escapes ''structurality'', the key feature of structuralism according to which all meaning is defined relationally, through other terms in the structure. From this perspective, the center is the most alien or estranged element in a structure: it comes from somewhere outside and remains absolute until a new center is substituted in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. "The center", therefore, "is not the center."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 'event' under discussion is the opening of the structure, which became inevitable "when the structurality of structure had to begin to be thought" and the contradictory role of the center exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Whereas previously the center functioned precisely by remaining unthought, as a sort of blind spot in the middle of the structure's field of vision. Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the event, according to Derrida, must be the full version of structural "[[Free Play (Derrida)|freeplay]]", a mode in which all terms are truly subject to the openness and mutability promised by structuralism. Derrida locates the beginning of this process in the writings of earlier philosophers, who continued to use the pattern of metaphysics even as they denounced it in others.

=== Reciprocal destroyers ===
Derrida depicts [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], three of his greatest influences, as ultimately trapped within a destructive spiral of denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, ''Jacques Derrida'' (2006), p. 58. "Although he had been studying and teaching Husserl for more than a decade, his real masters were only these three, a trio whose positive doctrine is largely negative and destructive."&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche questioned the power of representation and concepts to really&lt;!--authentically?--&gt; convey truth; Freud challenged the idea that mind was limited to consciousness; and Heidegger criticized the idea of "being as presence". Derrida argues that these theoretical moves share a common form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But all these destructive discourses and all their analogues are trapped in a sort of circle. This circle is unique. It describes the form of the relationship between the history of metaphysics and the destruction of the history of metaphysics. [...] there are many ways of being caught in this circle. They are all more or less naïve, more or less empirical, more or less systematic, more or less close to the formulation or even to the formalization of this circle. It is these differences which explain the multiplicity of destructive discourses and the disagreement between those who make them. It was within concepts inherited from metaphysics that Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger worked, for example. Since these concepts are not elements or atoms and since they are taken from a syntax and a system, every particular borrowing drags along with it the whole of metaphysics. This is what allows these destroyers to destroy each other reciprocally—for example, Heidegger, considering Nietzsche, with as much lucidity and rigor as bad faith and misconstruction, as the last metaphysician, the last "Platonist." One could do the same for Heidegger himself, for Freud, or for a number of others. And today no exercise is more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derrida does not assert the possibility of thinking outside such terms; any attempt to undo a particular concept is likely to become caught up in the terms which the concept depends on. For instance: if we try to undo the centering concept of ‘consciousness’ by asserting the disruptive counterforce of the ‘unconscious’, we are in danger of introducing a new center. All we can do is refuse to allow either pole in a system to become the center and guarantor of presence.

=== Lévi-Strauss ===
[[File:Culinary Triangle.svg|thumb|Culinary Triangle, a prototypical diagram of Lévi-Straussian [[structuralist anthropology]]]]
Having described a pattern—denouncing metaphysics while relying on it—in discourses about metaphysics, Derrida suggests consideration of the same pattern within the "human sciences",&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 251. "What is the relevance of this formal schéma when we turn to what are called the 'human sciences'? One of them perhaps occupies a privileged place—ethnology. One can in fact assume that ethnology could have been borne as a science only at the moment when a de-centering had come about: at the moment when European culture—and in consequence, the history of metaphysics and of its concepts—had been dislocated, driven from its locus, and forced to stop considering itself as the culture of reference."&lt;/ref&gt; whose subjection to the "critique of ethnocentrism" parallels the "destruction of the history of metaphysics" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Derrida 1966 p. 252"&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida argues that, just as philosophers use metaphysical terms and concepts to critique metaphysics (and criticize the use of these concepts by others), the ethnologist "accepts into his discourse the premises of ethnocentrism at the very moment when he is employed in denouncing them".&lt;ref name="Derrida 1966 p. 252"/&gt; He examines the work of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], particularly as it concerns "the opposition between nature and culture", as his case study and primary focus for the essay.&lt;ref name="Derrida 1966 p. 252"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, ''Jacques Derrida'' (2006), p. 58. "The actual subject of the deconstruction in 'Structure, Sign and Play' is Lévi-Strauss, the ethnographer who described various cultural phenomena according to formal principles which applied universally."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bricolage''===
Derrida highlights Lévi-Strauss's use of the term ''[[bricolage]]'', the activity of a ''bricoleur''. "The ''bricoleur'', says Lévi-Strauss, is someone who uses 'the means at hand,' that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary."&lt;ref name="Derrida 1966 p. 255"&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bricolage'' becomes a metaphor for philosophical and literary critiques, exemplifying Derrida's previous argument about the necessity of using the language available.&lt;ref name="Derrida 1966 p. 255"/&gt; The ''bricoleur'''s foil is the engineer, who creates out of whole cloth without the need for ''bricolage''—however, the engineer is merely a myth since all physical and intellectual production is really ''bricolage''.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). pp. 255–256. "The engineer, whom Lévi-Strauss opposes to the ''bricoleur'', should be the one to construct the totality of his language, syntax, and lexicon. In this sense the engineer is a myth. A subject who would supposedly be the absolute origin of his own discourse and would supposedly construct it 'out of nothing,' 'out of whole cloth,' would be the center of the ''verbe'', the ''verbe'' itself. The notion of the engineer who had supposedly broken with all forms of ''bricolage'' is therefore a theological idea; and since Lévi-Strauss tells us elsewhere that ''bricolage'' is mythopoetic, the odds are that the engineer is a myth produced by the ''bricoleur''."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure and myth===
Derrida praises Lévi-Strauss for his insights into the complexities, limitations, and circularities of examining 'a culture' from the outside in order to classify its mythological system. In particular he praises Lévi-Strauss's recognition that a mythological system cannot be studied as though it was some finite portion of physical reality to be scientifically divided and conquered. Derrida quotes Lévi-Strauss's ''[[The Raw and the Cooked]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, ''The Raw and the Cooked'' (1964/1969), pp. 5–6. Quoted in: Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970), pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In effect the study of myths poses a mythological problem by the fact that it cannot conform to the Cartesian principle of dividing the difficulty into as many parts as are necessary to resolve it. There exists no veritable end or term to mythical analysis, no secret unity which could be grasped at the end of the work in decomposition. The themes duplicate themselves to infinity. When we think we have disentangled them from each other and can hold them separate, it is only to realize that they are joining together again, in response to the attraction of unforeseen affinities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Derrida's words, "structural discourse on myths—mythological discourse—must itself be ''mythopomorphic''".&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). pp. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Lévi-Strauss explicitly describes a limit to totalization (and at the same time the endlessness of 'supplementarity'). Thus Lévi-Strauss, for Derrida, recognizes the structurality of mythical structure and gestures towards its freeplay.

But Derrida criticizes Lévi-Strauss for an inability to explain historical changes—for describing structural transformation as the consequence of mysterious outside forces (paralleling the substitute "centers" that make up the history of metaphysics).&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). pp. 262–263. "...by reducing history, Lévi-Strauss has treated as it deserves a concept which has always been in complicity with a telological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words, paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history could be opposed. [...] ... he must 'brush aside all the facts' at the moment when he wishes to recapture the specificity of a structure. Like Rousseau, he must always conceive of the origin of a new structure on the model of catastrophe—an overturning of nature in nature, a natural interruption of the natural sequence, a brushing aside ''of'' nature.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultimately, Derrida perceives in Lévi-Strauss "a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self-presence in speech", arguing that "this structuralist thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad, ''negative'', nostalgic, guilty, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauist]] facet of the thinking of freeplay of which the Nietzschean ''affirmation''—the joyous affirmation of the freeplay of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation—would be the other side."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; True freeplay, argues Derrida, actually undoes this certainty about presence: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derrida concludes by reaffirming the existence of a transformation within structuralism, suggesting that it espouses this affirmative view of unlimited freeplay and presenting it as unpredictable yet inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970). p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The 1966 colloquium, although intended to organize and strengthen the still-murky field of [[structuralism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 29. "In 1966, the translation of Lévi-Strauss's ''La Pensee sauvage'' (''The Savage Mind'') and an issue of Yale French Studies devoted to structuralism were met with the most complete indifference. The editor of the latter, Jackques Ehrman, who taught French literature at Yale, was in fact the only American professor at the time to propose an introductory course on structuralism. It was precisely in order to make up for this lag that two professors at Johns Hopkins, Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato, had the idea of organizing a conference that would bring together some of the major French figures working at the time."&lt;/ref&gt; became known through Derrida's lecture as a turning point and the beginning of the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist movement]].&lt;ref name="Parui 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|url=http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=poststructuralism_and_philosophy_of_education|editor=Michael A. Peters |editor2=Paulo Ghiraldelli |editor3=Berislav Žarnić |editor4=Andrew Gibbons|accessdate=28 September 2012|chapter=Poststructuralism and Education|date=7 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Contest of Faculties (1985), p. 137. "The conference was planned as a meeting-ground of French and American scholarship, designed to put 'structuralism' firmly on the map and to emphasize its manifold interdisciplinary interests. In the event, it was Derrida's ''critique'' of structuralism—more specifically, of latent problems and contradictions in the structural anthropology of Lévi-Strauss—which left the deepest mark on subsequent American thought. The structuralist 'movement' was no sooner granted an import license than it was pushed aside in the scramble for other, more exotic goods."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 31. "The point is clear: this lofty structuralism with its rarefied stakes, which the American university knew only in its narratological version (Genette and Todorov), was something that should be left behind in order to move toward a more playful poststructuralism. The word will not make its appearance until the beginning of the 1970s, but all the Americans present at Johns Hopkins in 1966 realized that they had just attended the live performance of its public birth."&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida acknowledged the influence of the Hopkins colloquium, writing in 1989:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is more and more often said that the Johns Hopkins colloquium ("The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man") was in 1966, more than twenty years ago, an event in which many things changed (it is on purpose that I leave these formulations somewhat vague) on the American scene—which is always more than the American scene. What is now called "theory" in this country may even have an essential link with what is said to have happened there in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "Some statements and truisms about neologisms, newisms, postisms, parasitisms, and other small seismisms", translated by Anne Tomiche. In ''The States of 'theory': History, Art, and Critical Discourse'', David Carroll, ed. [[Columbia University Press]], 1990. {{ISBN|9780231070867}}. p. 80. Referenced by Macksey (2007), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars attempting to explain the success of Derrida's presentation have argued that it fit well with the current of radicalism developing in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Contest of Faculties (1985), p. 137. "And the closing paragraphs of 'Structure, Sign and Play' were adapted to catch the current mood of critics chafing under the rigid dispensation of 'old' New Critical precept. Derrida's writing took on its mostly apocalyptic tone as he proclaimed the imminent demise of a structuralism turned back nostalgically towards metaphors of origin, truth, and authority."&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay sowed the seeds of popularity for French post-structuralism at eastern universities in the United States, particularly Johns Hopkins, Cornell, and Yale.&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 32. "On the institutional level it usefully strengthened ties between French and American universities, thanks to programs encouraging exchange students and visiting professors, which were established that fall not only with Johns Hopkins but also with Cornell and Yale, the future "golden triangle" of American deconstruction."&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida also returned several times to the Hopkins Humanities Center, the faculty of which still credits his influence.&lt;ref name="McCabe 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nichols|first=Stephen G.|title=Derrida Symposum|url=https://johnshopkins.academia.edu/StephenGNichols/Papers/928457/On_Jacques_Derrida|publisher=johnshopkins.academia.edu|accessdate=29 September 2012|date=30 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colloquium also created a demand for the French intellectuals on American campuses, which led notably to Derrida's 1986 recruitment by [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 77.""&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The colloquium came under scrutiny from the new journal ''Telos'' when, in 1970, Richard Moss published an article criticizing its sponsors and denouncing it as an agent of multinational capitalism.&lt;ref name="Moss 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Richard|title=The Language Criticism and the Sciences of Man: The Structuralist Controversy|journal=telos|date=Fall 1970|volume=1970|issue=6|pages=354–359|doi=10.3817/0970006354|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1970/6/354.abstract|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macksey &amp; Donato, ''The Structuralist Controversy'' (2007), p. ix. "The narrative that emerged was quite simple: the symposium and the subsequent seminars had been founded by the Ford Foundation ($30,000, to supply some historical perspective); this agency was, in turn, and armature of multinational capitalism using its wealth in the interests of thought control and the promotion of American imperialism in Vietnam and elsewhere. End of tale."&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida, in particular, drew  criticism from Marxists such as Fredric Jameson who called deconstruction overly intellectual and distant from [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, ''French Theory'' (2008), p. 32. "On the ideological level, it earned the wrath of the far Left, which deplored the absence of Marxist speakers […] and stigmatized the 'anti-human ideology' and the 'idealistic bourgeois linguistics' behind such a 'clique of French intellectuals [playing] spectacular language games for an American audience.' For it was precisely Marxism, still firmly ensconced in the American university, that provided the only other introduction to French structuralism at the time, particularly through Frederick Jameson; but this was in fact a highly critical introduction denouncing the 'textualism' of a 'purely verbal' class struggle."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Derrida graf.JPG|thumb|Derrida's grave]]

''The New York Times'' argued in its obituary for Derrida that "Structure, Sign, and Play" offered professors of literature a philosophical movement they could legitimately consider their own.&lt;ref name="NYT obit 2004"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kandell|first=Jonathan|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 October 2004|quote=Mr. Derrida shocked his American audience by announcing that structuralism was already passé in France, and that Mr. Lévi-Strauss's ideas were too rigid. Instead, Mr. Derrida offered deconstruction as the new, triumphant philosophy. His presentation fired up young professors who were in search of a new intellectual movement to call their own. In a Los Angeles Times Magazine article in 1991, Mr. Stephens, the journalism professor, wrote: 'He gave literature professors a special gift: a chance to confront - not as mere second-rate philosophers, not as mere interpreters of novelists, but as full-fledged explorers in their own right - the most profound paradoxes of Western thought.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Targeted killing''' is defined as a form of [[assassination]] based on the presumption of criminal guilt.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some analysts believe it to be a modern [[euphemism]] for the assassination (prominent premeditated killing) of an individual by a state organization or institution [[Extrajudicial killing|outside a judicial procedure]] or a [[battlefield]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Since the late 20th century, the legal status of targeted killing has become a subject of contention within and between various nations. Historically, at least since the mid-eighteenth century, Western thinking has generally considered the use of assassination as a tool of statecraft to be illegal.&lt;ref name="CSS" /&gt; Some academics, military personnel and officials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/counterterrorism/targeted-killings/p9627|title=Targeted Killings|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210043228/http://www.cfr.org/counterterrorism/targeted-killings/p9627|archive-date=10 February 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe targeted killing as legitimate within the context of self-defense, when employed against terrorists or combatants engaged in asymmetrical warfare.

Targeted killings have also been used in [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]] and [[American intervention in Libya (2015–present)|in Libya]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Somalia and Rwanda, 1990s ===
During fighting in the [[Somali Civil War]], [[Sean Devereux]] described torture and killing by warlords in [[Kismayo]] as "targeted killings, a kind of ethnic cleansing", shortly before his assassination.&lt;ref name=devereux&gt;{{cite news |title= The Making of a Saint |work=The Times |author= Rosie Millard |date= 12 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==
During the 1980s and 1990s, targeted killings were employed extensively by [[death squads in El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]],  and [[Haiti]] within the context of civil unrest and war.

During the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]],&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;David Johnston and David E.

Under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], use of targeted killings  expanded, most frequently through use of [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|combat drones]] operating in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] or [[Yemen]].

=== American and Russian drug cartels, 1980s ===
Referring to killings by drug cartels in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1989, mayor [[Marion Barry]] infamously stated, "Washington should not be called the murder capital of the world.

{{Cleanup|reason=History of U.S. use is mixed in with coverage of controversy over legality, which could apply to many countries|date=June 2018}}

An early example of American targeted killing is [[Operation Vengeance]] during World War II. This counterattack shot down the plane of [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], the senior planner of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Phoenix Program]] targeted political leadership of the [[Viet Cong]] for assassination.

While article 2(4) of the [[United Nations Charter]] prohibits the threat or use of force by one state against another, two exceptions are relevant to the question of whether targeted killings are lawful: (1) when the use of force is carried out with the consent of the host state; and (2) when the use of force is in self-defense in response to an armed attack or an imminent threat, and where the host state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate action.&lt;ref name="Stanford NYU Law"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Living Under Drones: Death, Injury, and Trauma to Civilians from US Drone Practices In Pakistan |journal= International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic at Stanford Law School and Global Justice Clinic at NYU School of Law |date= September 2012 |pages= 1–165, 105 |url= http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf |accessdate= 7 February 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120171338/http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf |archivedate= 20 January 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of a targeted drone strike must be evaluated in accordance with [[international humanitarian law]] (IHL), including the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity.&lt;ref name="Stanford NYU Law 112"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Living Under Drones: Death, Injury, and Trauma to Civilians from US Drone Practices In Pakistan |journal= International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic at Stanford Law School and Global Justice Clinic at NYU School of Law |date= September 2012 |pages= 1–165, 112 |url= http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf |accessdate= 7 February 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120171338/http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf |archivedate= 20 January 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of The Charter of the United Nations that regulates "action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression" is Chapter VII (articles 39-50), which requires that it is the Security Council that determines any threat to peace and decides on measures to be taken to maintain or restore peace. Article 51 mentions the only exception, as being members of the United Nations have "the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security".&lt;ref name="United Nations Charter, Chapter VII"&gt;"[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml CHAPTER VII: ACTION with RESPECT to THREATS to the PEACE, BREACHES of the PEACE, and ACTS of AGGRESSION"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825052140/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml |date=25 August 2014 }}".

Countries such as the U.S. (in Pakistan and Yemen) and Israel (in the West Bank and Gaza) have used targeted killing to kill members of groups such as [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Targeted killing operations, according to [[Harvard Law School]] Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann, amplify the tension between addressing terrorism as a crime versus addressing terrorism as an act of war. Governments pursuing a law enforcement strategy punish persons for their individual guilt, which must be proven in a court of law, where the accused enjoys the protections of due process guarantees.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 145–170, 146"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Gabriella and Philip Heymann|title=Law and Policy of Targeted Killing|journal=National Security Journal|date=June 2010|pages=145–170, 146|url=http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907054210/http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|archive-date=7 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments in the midst of war, on the other hand, may claim a legal obligation to take advantage of the relaxation of peacetime constraints on the use of deadly force. Enemy combatants may be targeted and killed not because they are guilty, but because they are potentially lethal agents of a hostile party.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 145–170, 146"/&gt; No advance warning is necessary, no attempt to arrest or capture is required, and no effort to minimize casualties among enemy forces is demanded by law.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 145–170, 146"/&gt; Despite this inherent tension, the United States has made targeted killing—the deliberate assassination of a known terrorist outside the country’s territory, usually by airstrike—an essential part of its counter-terrorism strategy.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 145–170, 146"/&gt; Hence, the United States has justified the killing of terrorists under a war paradigm. "Using the war paradigm for counter-terrorism enabled government lawyers to distinguish lethal attacks on terrorists from prohibited assassinations and justify them as lawful battlefield operations against enemy combatants, much like the uncontroversial targeted killing of Japanese Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was traveling by a military airplane during World War II."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Gabriella and Philip Heymann|title=Law and Policy of Targeted Killing|journal=National Security Journal|date=June 2010|pages=145–170, 150|url=http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907054210/http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|archive-date=7 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further support for the U.S. government’s use of drone strike tactics is found in a report found in the Journal of Strategic Security concerning the surgical nature of drone strikes for use in a populated area. The author concedes, "Indeed the tactic of using drones promises the ability of eliminating enemies in complex environments, while minimizing the political implications of resorting to war."&lt;ref name="Peron 2014 81–93"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Surgical" Legitimacy of Drone Strikes?

The domestic legislative basis offered to justify drone strikes is the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), a joint resolution of both houses of Congress passed exactly one week after 11 September 2001.&lt;ref name="Stanford NYU Law 118"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Living Under Drones: Death, Injury, and Trauma to Civilians from US Drone Practices In Pakistan|journal=International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic at Stanford Law School and Global Justice Clinic at NYU School of Law|date=September 2012|pages=118–119|url=http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120171338/http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stanford-NYU-LIVING-UNDER-DRONES.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AUMF permits the President to use "all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons".&lt;ref name="Stanford NYU Law"/&gt;

A report published in the Journal of Strategic Security focusing on the future of drones in geopolitics finds the U.S. government's use of drones in targeted killing operations and "indiscriminant and disproportionate use of force that violates the sovereignty of Pakistan".&lt;ref name="Peron 2014 81–93"/&gt;

Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He justified the use of drones both from domestic law and international law point of view. With respect to domestic law Brennan stated, "as a matter of domestic law, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers the President to protect the nation from any imminent threat of attack. The [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] (AUMF) passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks authorizes the president "to use all necessary and appropriate force" against those nations, organizations and individuals responsible for 9/11. There is nothing in the AUMF that restricts the use of military force against al-Qa'ida to [[Afghanistan]]."&lt;ref name="Wilson Center" /&gt; And he further said: "As a matter of international law, the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, in response to the 9/11 attacks, and we may also use force consistent with our inherent right of national self-defense. There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat."&lt;ref name="Wilson Center" /&gt;

The speech came a few days after Obama authorized the CIA and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to fire on targets based solely on their intelligence "signatures" — patterns of behavior that are detected through signals intercepts, human sources and aerial surveillance, and that indicate the presence of an important operative or a plot against U.S. interests. Under the previous rules the CIA and the US military were only allowed to use drone strikes against known terrorist leaders whose location could be confirmed and who appeared on secret CIA and JSOC target lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=White House approves broader Yemen drone campaign|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-approves-broader-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/25/gIQA82U6hT_story.html?wpisrc=nl_headlines|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006164604/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-approves-broader-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/25/gIQA82U6hT_story.html?wpisrc=nl_headlines|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obama 2012 78.jpg|thumb|right|[[John O. Brennan]], former director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and chief counter-terrorism advisor to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].]]
In 2011/2012, the process for selecting targets outside of warzones was altered so that power was concentrated in the hands of a group of people in the [[White House]] centered around White House counterterror chief John Brennan. Under the new plan, Brennan's staff compiles the potential target list and runs the names past agencies such as the State Department at a weekly White House meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dozier|first=Kimberly|title=Who will drones target?

U.S. Congressional oversight over the targeted killing operations increased as the drone program intensified under the Obama Administration. Once a month, a group of staff members from the House and Senate intelligence committees would watch videos of the latest drone strikes, review intelligence that was used to justify each drone strike, and sometimes examine telephone intercepts and after-the-fact evidence, such as the CIA's assessment of who was hit. The procedure used by House and Senate intelligence committees to monitor CIA drone strikes was set up largely at the request of Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] who became determined to ensure that it was as precise as the CIA had been claiming. "That's been a concern of mine from the beginning," Feinstein said in little-noticed comments after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011]]. "I asked that this effort be established. It has been. The way in which this is being done is very careful."&lt;ref name="LATimes20120625" /&gt; Feinstein explained how the oversight works in general. "We receive notification with key details shortly after every strike, and we hold regular briefings and hearings on these operations," Feinstein wrote in May in a letter sent in response to a column that ran in the ''Los Angeles Times'' questioning the oversight of drone strikes. "Committee staff has held 28 monthly in-depth oversight meetings to review strike records and question every aspect of the program including legality, effectiveness, precision, foreign policy implications and the care taken to minimize noncombatant casualties." If the congressional committees objected to something, the lawmakers could call CIA leaders to testify in closed investigative hearings. If unsatisfied, they could pass legislation limiting the CIA's actions.&lt;ref name="LATimes20120625" /&gt;

Congressional criticism of drone strikes has been rare. However, in June 2012, 26 lawmakers, all but two of them Democrats, signed a letter to Obama questioning so-called signature strikes, in which the U.S. attacks armed men who fit a pattern of behavior that suggests they are involved in terrorist activities. Signature strikes have been curbed in Pakistan, where they once were common, but in 2012 Obama gave the CIA permission to conduct them in Yemen, where an Al Qaeda affiliate that has targeted the United States has established a safe haven in the south. The lawmakers expressed concern that signature strikes could kill civilians. They added: "Our drone campaigns already have virtually no transparency, accountability or oversight."&lt;ref name="LATimes20120625"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|title=Congress keeps closer watch on CIA drone strikes|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-drone-oversight-20120625,0,7967691,full.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=25 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707103251/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-drone-oversight-20120625,0,7967691,full.story|archive-date=7 July 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, the use of combat drones underwent a quiet and unheralded shift during the Obama Administration to focus increasingly on killing militant foot soldiers rather than high-value targets according to CNN National Security Analyst [[Peter Bergen]].&lt;ref name="CNN20120906"&gt;{{cite news|title=Drone is Obama's weapon of choice|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/05/opinion/bergen-obama-drone/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=9 September 2012|author1=Peter Bergen|author2=Megan Braun|lastauthoramp=yes|date=6 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908183849/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/05/opinion/bergen-obama-drone/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|archive-date=8 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen noted: "To the extent that the targets of drone attacks can be ascertained, under Bush, al Qaeda members accounted for 25% of all drone targets compared to 40% for Taliban targets. Under Obama, only 8% of targets were al Qaeda compared to just over 50% for Taliban targets."&lt;ref name="CNN20120906" /&gt;

Facing the possibility of defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], the Obama administration accelerated work in the weeks before the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures.&lt;ref name="NYT20121124"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=Election Spurred a Move to Codify U.S. Drone Policy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=25 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126165814/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|archive-date=26 November 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. "There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands," said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an "amorphous" program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had [[Mitt Romney]] won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said.&lt;ref name="NYT20121124" /&gt; "One of the things we've got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making," Obama said and added "creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, is going to be a challenge for me and my successors for some time to come."&lt;ref name="NYT20121124" /&gt; U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. "There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems," he said.&lt;ref name="NYT20121124" /&gt;

In response lawsuits brought by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] seeking to use the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] to make public more details about the legal basis for the drone programs U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon ruled at the end of December 2012 that the U.S. Government has no legal duty to disclose legal opinions justifying the use of drones to kill suspected terrorist operatives abroad. While noting that a more detailed disclosure of the administration's legal rationale "would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated", McMahon came to the conclusion that the Freedom of Information Act did not permit her to require such transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|title=Court: Feds can keep drone legal opinions secret|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/01/court-feds-can-keep-drone-legal-opinions-secret-153169.html?ml=bp|publisher=Politico|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109071826/http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/01/court-feds-can-keep-drone-legal-opinions-secret-153169.html?ml=bp|archive-date=9 January 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahon|first=Colleen|title=United States District Court Southern District of New York Case 1:12-cv-00794-CM Document 55-1 Filed 01/02/13|url=http://images.politico.com/global/2013/01/02/nytacludronesopn2.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=1 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110080023/http://images.politico.com/global/2013/01/02/nytacludronesopn2.html|archive-date=10 January 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter dated 22 May 2013 to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee, [[Patrick J.

* Second, the United States will use lethal force only against a target that poses a continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons. 
* Third, the following criteria must be met before lethal action may be taken:

:# Near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed;

NBC News released in February 2014 an undated Department of Justice White paper entitled "Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa'ida or An Associated Force" in which the Obama Administration concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be "senior operational leaders" of al-Qaida or "an associated force" – even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.&lt;ref name="NBCIsikoff20140204"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isikoff|first1=Michael|title=Justice Department memo reveals legal case for drone strikes on Americans|accessdate=15 August 2014|publisher=NBC News|date=4 February 2013|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans?lite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819060747/http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans?lite|archive-date=19 August 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJMemoLawfulnessLethalOperatation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Undated memo entitled "Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa'ida or An Associated Force" by the U.S. Department of Justice|url=http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=15 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826075931/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However any such targeted killing operation by the United States would have to comply with the four fundamental law-of-war principles governing the use of force which are necessity, distinction, proportionality and humanity – i.e., the avoidance of unnecessary suffering.

The memo also discusses why targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate [[Executive Order 12333|a U.S. executive order banning assassinations]]:

"A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination. In the Department's view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban."&lt;ref name="NBCIsikoff20140204" /&gt;

In 2013, a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty proposed that U.S. government drone policy in Pakistan potentially violated human rights according to the U.N. [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The rights in direct question were the right to life; right to a fair trial; the freedom of association; right to protection of the family; and, less directly, right to highest attainable health standards; right to education; and right of freedom from hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Drones and the Chicago Convention: An Examination of the Concepts of Aerial Sovereignty, The War on Terror and the Notion of Self Defense in Relation to the Chicago Convention |publisher=University of Pretoria |year=2013 |last=Bradley |first=Martha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, when he was President-elect, Duterte offered medals and cash rewards for citizens that shot dealers dead. “Do your duty, and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you,” he told police officers on July 1, the day after his inauguration. He was speaking at a ceremony installing dela Rosa, his loyal henchman, as the nation’s top cop. “If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful,” he was quoted as saying to another crowd that day.’&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
=== Legal justifications for targeted killing ===
The [[U.S. Army]]'s ''Law of Land Warfare'' (Field Manual 27-10) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

31. Assassination and Outlawry

It is especially forbidden * * * to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army. [Article 23(b) of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Regulations]]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule65_sectionb |title=United States of America Practice Relating to Rule 65.

This article is construed as prohibiting assassination, proscription, or outlawry of an enemy, or putting a price upon an enemy's head, as well as offering a reward for an enemy "dead or alive". It does not, however, preclude attacks on individual soldiers or officers of the enemy whether in the zone of hostilities, occupied territory, or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/27-10/Ch2.htm|title=FM 27-10 Chptr 2 Hostilities|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205001151/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/27-10/Ch2.htm|archive-date=5 February 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later it is in the center of the bounds of legitimacy."&lt;ref name="HaaretzReisner"/&gt; This view is disputed by George Bisharat of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, who contends that assassination is not widely regarded as legal.&lt;ref name="BisharatNYT"&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/opinion/why-palestine-should-take-israel-to-court-in-the-hague.html Why Palestine Should Take Israel to Court in The Hague] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322024134/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/opinion/why-palestine-should-take-israel-to-court-in-the-hague.html |date=22 March 2017 }}'', George Bisharat, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor and former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]], [[Gary D.

[[Abraham David Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], a former legal advisor to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and fellow at the conservative [[Hoover Institution]] think tank, has written that targeted killing is "sometimes necessary, because leaders are obliged to defend their citizens". After the killing of [[Hamas]] founder and [[quadriplegic]] [[Ahmed Yassin]] by Israeli helicopter gunships, Sofaer argued that targeted killing is not prohibited by American [[Executive Order 11905]] banning assassination: "killings in self-defense are no more 'assassinations' in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers."&lt;ref name="HOV"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Responses-to-Terrorism-Targeted-killing-is-a-2775845.php "Targeted killing is a necessary option"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618095718/http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Responses-to-Terrorism-Targeted-killing-is-a-2775845.php |date=18 June 2013 }}, Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], 26 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Sofaer had previously argued during the [[First Gulf War]] that targeted killing was ethical but impractical: "Targeted killing will also invite revenge against the leaders who order it as well as their citizens and property. Given the legal, political and moral constraints that limit such activities in democratic regimes, the United States has a substantial interest in discouraging acceptance of the killing of political leaders as a routine measure, even in self-defense."&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR&gt;{{cite news |title=Thinking past the moment|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|author=Abarham D.

American defense department analyst and professor Thomas Hunter has defined targeted killing as the "premeditated, preemptive, and intentional killing of an individual or individuals known or believed to represent a present or future threat to the safety and security of a state through the affiliation with terrorist groups or individuals.&lt;ref name="target_killing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Targeted Killing: Self-Defense, Preemption and the War on Terrorism|author= Thomas B. Hunter|year=2009|isbn= 1-4392-5205-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter writes that the target is a person who is allegedly taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has allegedly lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Hunter distinguishes between "targeted killing" and "targeted violence" as used by specialists who study [[violence]].

In response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] (AUMF) stated on 14 September 2001, "That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, harbored, committed, or aided in the planning or commission of the attacks against the United States that occurred on 11 September 2001, and to deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States".&lt;ref name="law.umaryland.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grimmett|first=R.|title=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/RS22357_01042006.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=law.umaryland.edu|access-date=14 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103190049/http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/RS22357_01042006.pdf|archive-date=3 November 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This authorization is still in effect today.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hill'': [http://blogs.rollcall.com/white-house/obama-has-authority-to-bomb-iraq-without-congress-because-aumf-never-expired/?dcz= "Obama Could Bomb Iraq Without Congress Because War Authorization Never Expired"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608090244/http://blogs.rollcall.com/white-house/obama-has-authority-to-bomb-iraq-without-congress-because-aumf-never-expired/?dcz= |date=8 June 2015 }} 12 June 2014.

=== Legal opposition ===
During the [[1998 bombing of Iraq]], ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported, "US law prohibits the targeted killing of foreign leaders... Administration officials have been careful to say they will not expressly aim to kill Saddam."&lt;ref name=Scotsman98&gt;{{cite news |last=Branson |first=Louise |date=14 November 1998 |title=Campaign to eliminate Saddam gains speed |newspaper=The Scotsman |accessdate=20 September 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18675087.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202235638/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18675087.html |archive-date=2 February 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Sauer and Niklas Schoernig have described targeted killing as a violation of international law and a contravention of domestic laws,&lt;ref name="SauerSchoernigKillerDrones"&gt;Sauer, Frank/Schoernig Niklas, 2012: [http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/43/4/363.abstract "Killer drones: The 'silver bullet' of democratic warfare?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817232308/http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/43/4/363.abstract |date=17 August 2012 }}, in: ''Security Dialogue'' 43 (4): 363-380, accessed 1 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and maintain that the term itself is merely a legitimized euphemism for [[assassination]].

The American Civil Liberties Union states in its website, "A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811144919/http://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |archive-date=11 August 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www%2Ecarnegiecouncil%2Eorg/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Additional concerns ===
For drone strikes to be effective, the United States must obtain consent from the host country they are operating in. The growing chorus of objections from host countries, most notably emanating from Pakistan, seriously inhibits drones’ effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Micah|first=Zenko|title=Reforming U.S. Drone Strike Policies|date=January 2013|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|location=New York|page=3|url=http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206074451/http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736|archive-date=6 February 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Host states have grown frustrated with U.S. drone policy, while opposition by non-host partners could impose additional restrictions on the use of drones. Reforming U.S. drone strike policies can do much to allay concerns internationally by ensuring that targeted killings are defensible under international legal regimes that the United States itself helped establish and by allowing U.S. officials to openly address concerns and counter misinformation."&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 3"/&gt; [[Micah Zenko]] at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] believes the United States should "end so-called signature strikes, which target unidentified militants based on their behavior patterns and personal networks, and limit targeted killings to a small number of specific terrorists with transnational ambitions.&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 vii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Micah|first=Zenko|title=Reforming U.S. Drone Strike Policies|date=January 2013|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|location=New York, New York|pages=vii|url=http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206074451/http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736|archive-date=6 February 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wants more congressional oversight of drone strikes and stricter regulation on armed drone sales. Finally, he recommends the United States work with international partners to establish rules and norms governing the use of drones.&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 vii"/&gt; Zenko believes the U.S. government has not been transparent regarding how non-battlefield drone strikes are reconciled with broader foreign policy objectives, the scope of legitimate targets, and their legal framework.&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 3"/&gt; While drones may be a critical counterterrorism tool that advances U.S. interests, their "lack of transparency threatens to limit U.S. freedom of action and risks proliferation of armed drone technology without the requisite normative framework."&lt;ref name="Micah January 2013 3" /&gt; Zenko thinks current drone policy might share the same fate of the Bush-era [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] and [[warrantless wiretapping]], both of which were unpopular, illegal and ultimately ended.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2014}}

[[Harvard Law School]] Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann cite six potential hazards of targeted killings: First, the so-called [[Hydra effect]], or the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace those who were recently "decapitated."&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 p. 165"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Gabriella and Philip Heymann|title=Law and Policy of Targeted Killing|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=June 2010|volume=1|page=165|url=http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907054210/http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|archive-date=7 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, drones can drive terrorist leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their movements, and subsequent intelligence gathering, extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 p. 165" /&gt; Third, "the political message flowing from the use of targeted killings may be harmful to the attacking country’s interest, as it emphasizes the disparity in power between the parties and reinforces popular support for the terrorists, who are seen as a David fighting Goliath."&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 p. 165" /&gt; Fourth, when conducted in a foreign country, drone strikes run the risk of heightening tensions between the targeting government and the government in whose territory the operation is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Gabriella and Philip Heymann|title=Law and Policy of Targeted Killing|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=June 2010|volume=1|page=166|url=http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907054210/http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol-1_Blum-Heymann_Final.pdf|archive-date=7 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth, targeted killings threaten criticism from local domestic constituencies against the government allowing strikes within their country.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 p. 165" /&gt; Finally, there is a danger of over-using targeted killings, both within and outside the war of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Blum 2010 p. 165"/&gt;

Daniel Byman, security studies professor at [[Georgetown University]], argues that [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent in [[international law]] is set.&lt;ref name=Byman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byman|first=Daniel|title=Why Drones Work: The Case for Washington's Weapon of Choice|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=July–August 2013|volume=92|issue=4|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman|accessdate=8 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619152211/http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman|archive-date=19 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must "remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid."&lt;ref name=Byman /&gt; Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes that they are very effective. "U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 [[al Qaeda]], [[Taliban]], and other jihadist operatives in [[Pakistan]] and [[Yemen]]. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban--top figures who are not easily replaced."&lt;ref name=Byman /&gt; Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its target audiences, ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices.&lt;ref name=Byman /&gt; Byman argues that al Qaeda leaders "cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders."&lt;ref name=Byman /&gt;

Audrey Kurth Cronin of [[George Mason University]] argues that while drones are tactically savvy, they have failed to advance the strategic goals of U.S. counter-terrorism policy.&lt;ref name="Cronin FA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cronin|first=Audrey Kurth|title=Why Drones Fail: When Tactics Drive Strategy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=July–August 2013|volume=92|issue=4|pages=44–54|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139454/audrey-kurth-cronin/why-drones-fail|accessdate=10 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713065224/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139454/audrey-kurth-cronin/why-drones-fail|archive-date=13 July 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism itself is a tactic, Cronin notes, but it succeeds on a strategic plane when a shocking event is successfully leveraged for political gain.&lt;ref name="Cronin FA" /&gt; "To be effective, counter-terrorism must itself respond with a coherent strategy. The problem for [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] today is that its drone program has taken on a life of its own, to the point where tactics are driving strategy rather than the other way around."&lt;ref name="Cronin FA" /&gt; Cronin agrees with Daniel Byman of Georgetown University insofar that drones have inflicted real damage upon [[al Qaeda]]. However, "Washington now finds itself in a permanent battle with amorphous and geographically dispersed foe, one with an increasingly marginal connection to the original 9/11 plotters. In this endless contest, the United States risks multiplying its enemies and heightening their incentives to attack the country."&lt;ref name="Cronin FA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3456">As of 2015, there were at least two translations of the [[Tirukkural]] available in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

==History of translations==
Despite having a rich body of literature, all notable ones being the result of the advent of [[Islam]] in the 7th century CE, there is hardly any literature in Arabic that can be compared to the Tirukkural in content and style.&lt;ref name="GeoCities_Arabic"/&gt;

The first translation of the Kural text was made by Muhammad Yousuf Kokan, the then professor and head of the Department of Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] of Jamalia Arabic College, [[Chennai]]. He apparently made the prose translation from an English translation of the original work and published it around 1976 and 1980 under the title "Sacred Verses" (الابيات المقدسة), which is almost a literal translation of the word ''Tirukkural''. The word ''Kural'' actually meaning "couplet" and not "verse", there is apparently no word equivalent in Arabic for a couplet but can be roughly written as ‏(الاسم) أبيات شعر ثنائيه‏.&lt;ref name="GeoCities_Arabic"&gt;{{cite web

The second Arabic translation, and the first by a native speaker, was completed by Amar Hasan from [[Syria]] in 2015. The work is not a literal translation and maintains the original verse form completed in full for all the 1330 couplets of the Kural text.&lt;ref name="AmarHasan_Arabic_2015"&gt;{{cite web

The word '''Type''' followed by a number is a common way to name a weapon or product in a production series, similar in meaning to "[[Mark (designation)|Mark]]". "Type" was used extensively by the Japanese and Chinese militaries beginning in the 1920s, and is still in current use by the militaries of both nations. The United Kingdom uses a '''type number system''' for much of their military equipment. Many other nations use the word "Type" to designate products in a series.

==Japan==
The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) began using the Type-Number System in 1921 to designate aircraft accepted for production. The numbers used after the word "Type" were based on the number of years that the [[Emperor Taishō]] had reigned. Since his reign began in 1912, an aircraft ordered into production in 1921 would have been called "Type 10", the tenth year of the emperor's reign. At the end of 1926, the emperor died, leaving his son [[Hirohito]] as the Emperor Shōwa, and the numbering system was reset to mark the new emperor's reign.&lt;ref name=Peattie&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zero Akagi Dec1941.jpg|thumb|The Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter.]]
In 1929, the government of Japan adopted a new system based on the [[Japanese_era_name#Imperial_year|imperial year]].&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt; Aircraft ordered for production from 1929 onward were assigned the last two digits of the year marking the continuity of Japanese emperors. 1929 was the 2589th imperial year, so aircraft ordered that year were designated "Type 89". 1940 was the 2600th year, and the IJN numbering system was reset to single digits. New aircraft were designated [[0 (number)|0 (zero)]]. The well-known Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the IJN "Type 0 Carrier Fighter" (''Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki'', 零式艦上戦闘機), and was popularly called the "Zero" because of its type.&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt;

In 1943, the designation system was abandoned by the IJN as it was considered too revealing about the nature of the aircraft. In its place, the aircraft were named with popular terms such as ''Kyōfū'' (強風 "Strong Wind") for the [[Kawanishi N1K]] introduced in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred T. Jane|Jane, Frederick Thomas]]. ''Jane's all the world's aircraft, Volume 34'', p. 155c, Jane's Information Group, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) began using the Type designation system in 1927, for all weapons, vehicles, military equipment, subassemblies and subsystems such as engines and gunmounts. In 1940, instead of resetting to zero, the IJA assigned "Type 100" to equipment put into production that year. In 1941, the IJA reset to "Type 1". Unlike the IJN, the IJA continued to use the system through 1945 with the production of the [[Kawasaki Ki-100]] Army Type 5 Fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, J. (2008) History of War. [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_japanese_army_aircraft_designations.html ''Japanese Army Air Force Designations of the Second World War''.] Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, Japan's military changed to a numbering system based on the Japanese fiscal year which begins on April 1 in the same manner as the British fiscal year. As an example, "Type 63" was the designation for equipment such as the [[Type 63 AT mine]] accepted in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xl, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kanji]] character ''shiki'' (式) is what the Japanese use to designate products in a series. The [[English language]] translation of ''shiki'' has been variously given as "model" or "type".&lt;ref name=Easterly&gt;Easterly, William M. P. (June 2009) [http://www.dragonsoffire.com/ARTICLE:--MODEL---TYPE.php ''Dragons of Fire'', "Model/Type"]. Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some manuals and texts have translated ''shiki'' as both "model" and "type" within the same publication, confusing the matter. [[World War II]]-era military dictionaries do not give ''shiki'' as the Japanese word for "model"—instead, the kanji character ''kata'' is given. In turn, ''kata'' (型 or 形) is translated as "form", "type", "pattern", "mark", or "model". The only [[Japanese language]] translation given for the English word "type" is ''shiki''.&lt;ref name=Easterly/&gt;

==China==
Chinese weapons and military vehicles are often, but not always, designated according to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the one used by most nations. Two digits are used to designate the year. The two digits appear first, followed by the character ''shi'', meaning "type".&lt;ref&gt;Blasko, Dennis J. ''The Chinese Army today: tradition and transformation for the 21st century'', p. 122. Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|0-415-77003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, in 1956, the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] was put into production, and the [[Type 64 pistol]] was designed and approved in 1964.

==United Kingdom==
The [[Royal Navy]] uses a type number system where blocks of numbers are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, the block 900–999 was given to naval radar sets beginning in 1945 and continuing for roughly 20 years. Numbers are not always sequential, as the Type 992 target indication radar was developed long before the Type 967 target designation radar. When a reserved block has been fully utilized, another is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xli, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Underwoodfive.jpg|thumb|Mechanical desktop typewriters, such as this [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Touchmaster Five]], were long-time standards of government agencies, newsrooms, and offices]]

A '''typewriter''' is a [[Machine (mechanical)|mechanical]] or [[electromechanical]] machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's [[movable type]]. Typically, a typewriter has an array of [[Button (control)|keys]], and pressing one causes a different single character to be produced on the paper, by causing a ribbon with dried ink to be struck against the paper by a type element similar to the [[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]] used in [[movable type]] [[letterpress printing]]. Commonly a separate type element (called a typebar) corresponds to each key, but the mechanism may also use a single type element (such as a typeball) with a different portion of it used for each possible character. At the end of the nineteenth century, the term ''typewriter'' was also applied to a person who used a [[typing]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|typewriter (2)|volume=Vol 18|page=789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Typewriter Wiki.webm|thumb|Video on the history of typewriters and how they operate]]
The first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James W.

It was widely used by professional writers, in offices, and for business correspondence in private homes.

==History==
[[File:1864 Schreibmaschine Peter Mitterhofer.jpg|thumb|Peter Mitterhofer's typewriter prototype (1864)]]
Although many modern typewriters have one of several similar designs, their invention was incremental, developed by numerous inventors working independently or in competition with each other over a series of decades. As with the [[automobile]], [[telephone]], and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], a number of people contributed insights and inventions that eventually resulted in ever more commercially successful instruments.  Historians have estimated that some form of typewriter was invented 52 times as thinkers tried to come up with a workable design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Acocella, Joan |title=The Typing Life: How writers used to write |series=[[The New Yorker]] |date=April 9, 2007 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/09/070409crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011413/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/09/070409crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=1 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1575 an [[Italy|Italian]] printmaker, Francesco Rampazetto, invented the ''scrittura tattile'', a machine to impress letters in papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museocasertaolivetti.altervista.org/scrittura/|title=Scrittura {{!}} Museo dinamico della tecnologia Adriano Olivetti|last=|first=|date=|website=museocasertaolivetti.altervista.org|language=it-IT|others=https://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://museocasertaolivetti.altervista.org/scrittura/&amp;prev=search|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621081930/http://museocasertaolivetti.altervista.org/scrittura/|archive-date=2017-06-21|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
*In 1714, [[Henry Mill]] obtained a patent in Britain for a machine that, from the patent, appears to have been similar to a typewriter.  The patent shows that this machine was actually created:  "[he] hath by his great study and paines &amp; expence invented and brought to perfection an artificial machine or method for impressing or transcribing of letters, one after another, as in writing, whereby all writing whatsoever may be engrossed in paper or parchment so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from print; that the said machine or method may be of great use in settlements and public records, the impression being deeper and more lasting than any other writing, and not to be erased or counterfeited without  manifest discovery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayinsci.com/M/Mill_Henry/MillHenryPatents.htm |title=Henry Mill Patents |publisher=Todayinsci.com |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128013806/http://www.todayinsci.com/M/Mill_Henry/MillHenryPatents.htm |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1802 Italian Agostino Fantoni developed a particular typewriter to enable his [[blindness|blind]] sister to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/keyboard.html|title=History of Computers and Computing, Birth of the modern computer, The bases of digital computers, typewriter and computer keyboard|website=history-computer.com|access-date=2016-09-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905195941/http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/keyboard.html|archivedate=2016-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1808 Italian [[Pellegrino Turri]] invented a typewriter. He also invented [[carbon paper]] to provide the ink for his machine.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
*In 1823 Italian Pietro Conti di Cilavegna invented a new model of typewriter, the ''tachigrafo'', also known as ''tachitipo''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Pterotype.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John J. Pratt]]'s "pterotype" (1865)]]
*In 1829, American [[William Austin Burt]] patented a machine called the "[[Typographer (typewriter)|Typographer]]" which, in common with many other early machines, is listed as the "first typewriter". The [[Science Museum (London)]] describes it merely as "the first writing mechanism whose invention was documented," but even that claim may be excessive, since Turri's invention pre-dates it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Austin Burt's Typographer |year=1829 |publisher=Science Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the hands of its inventor, this machine was slower than handwriting. Burt and his promoter John D. Sheldon never found a buyer for the patent, so the invention was never commercially produced. Because the typographer used a dial, rather than keys, to select each character, it was called an "index typewriter" rather than a "keyboard typewriter." Index typewriters of that era resemble the squeeze-style [[embossing tape|embosser]] from the 1960s more than they resemble the modern keyboard typewriter.
By the mid-19th century, the increasing pace of business communication had created a need for mechanization of the writing process. [[Stenographer]]s and [[telegraph]]ers could take down information at rates up to 130 words per minute, whereas a writer with a pen was limited to a maximum of 30 words per minute (the 1853 speed record).&lt;ref name="Utterback"&gt;{{cite book

From 1829 to 1870, many printing or typing machines were patented by inventors in Europe and America, but none went into commercial production. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

*In 1855, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Giuseppe Ravizza]] created a prototype typewriter called ''Cembalo scrivano o macchina da scrivere a tasti'' ("Scribe [[harpsichord]], or machine for writing with keys"). It was an advanced machine that let the user see the writing as it was typed.
*In 1861, Father Francisco João de Azevedo, a Brazilian priest, made his own typewriter with basic materials and tools, such as wood and knives. In that same year the Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|D. Pedro II]], presented a gold medal to Father Azevedo for this invention. Many Brazilian people as well as the Brazilian federal government recognize Fr. Azevedo as the inventor of the typewriter, a claim that has been the subject of some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====Hansen Writing Ball====
{{main|Hansen Writing Ball}}
[[File:Writing ball keyboard 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hansen Writing Ball]] was the first typewriter manufactured commercially (1870)]]

In 1865, Rev. [[Rasmus Malling-Hansen]] of [[Denmark]] invented the [[Hansen Writing Ball]], which went into commercial production in 1870 and was the first commercially sold typewriter. It was a success in Europe and was reported as being used in offices in London as late as 1909.&lt;ref name=Mares&gt;{{cite book|last=Mares|first=G. C.|title=The History of the Typewriter|year=1909|location=London|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Office Museum|url=http://www.officemuseum.com/typewriters.htm|accessdate=1 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102201621/http://www.officemuseum.com/typewriters.htm|archivedate=2 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malling-Hansen used a [[solenoid]] escapement to return the carriage on some of his models which makes him a candidate for the title of inventor of the first "electric" typewriter.

According to the book ''Hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder?'' (English: ''Who is the inventor of the Writing Ball?''), written by Malling-Hansen's daughter, Johanne Agerskov, in 1865, Malling-Hansen made a porcelain model of the keyboard of his writing ball and experimented with different placements of the letters to achieve the fastest writing speed. Malling-Hansen placed the letters on short pistons that went directly through the ball and down to the paper. This, together with the placement of the letters so that the fastest writing fingers struck the most frequently used letters, made the Hansen Writing Ball the first typewriter to produce text substantially faster than a person could write by hand.

The Hansen Writing Ball was produced with only upper-case characters. The Writing Ball was used as a template for inventor [[Frank Haven Hall]] to create a derivative that would produce letter prints cheaper and faster.&lt;ref name="Devil"&gt;{{cite book|first=Erik|last=Larson|title=The Devil in the White City: A Saga of Magic and Murder at the Fair that Changed America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJp22rZDOZQC|year=2004|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4000-7631-4|page=291|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626060339/https://books.google.com/books?id=kJp22rZDOZQC|archivedate=2018-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3lives"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1956 |title=The Three Lives of Frank H.

Malling-Hansen developed his typewriter further through the 1870s and 1880s and made many improvements, but the writing head remained the same. On the first model of the writing ball from 1870, the paper was attached to a cylinder inside a wooden box. In 1874, the cylinder was replaced by a carriage, moving beneath the writing head. Then, in 1875, the well-known "tall model" was patented, which was the first of the writing balls that worked without electricity. Malling-Hansen attended the world exhibitions in [[Vienna]] in 1873 and Paris in 1878 and he received the first-prize for his invention at both exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book | title=Die Schreibmaschine.

{{main|Sholes and Glidden typewriter}}
[[File:Sholes typewriter.jpg|thumb|upright|Prototype of the Sholes and Glidden typewriter, the first commercially successful typewriter, and the first with a QWERTY keyboard (1873)]]

The first typewriter to be commercially successful was invented in 1878 by Americans [[Christopher Latham Sholes]], [[Frank Haven Hall]], [[Carlos Glidden]] and [[Samuel W. Soule]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], although Sholes soon disowned the machine and refused to use, or even to recommend it.  It looked "like something like a cross between a piano and a kitchen table."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2573562|last1 = Jocher|first1 = Katharine|title = Reviewed work: The Typewriter and the Men Who Made It., Richard N.

Remington and Sons]] (then famous as a manufacturer of [[sewing machine]]s) to commercialize the machine as the ''[[Sholes and Glidden typewriter|Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer]]''.

This was the origin of the term ''typewriter''. Remington began production of its first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in [[Ilion, New York]]. It had a [[QWERTY]] keyboard layout, which because of the machine's success, was slowly adopted by other typewriter manufacturers.  As with most other early typewriters, because the typebars strike upwards, the typist could not see the characters as they were typed.

====Index typewriter====
[[File:Mignon Mod.4,Bj.1924.jpg|thumb|right|A Mignon Model 4 index typewriter from 1924]]
Coming into the market in the early 1880s,&lt;ref name="EOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officemuseum.com/typewriters_index.htm|title=Antique Index Typewriters|last=|first=|date=|website=Early Office Museum|publisher=|access-date=13 March 2017|quote=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702212611/http://www.officemuseum.com/typewriters_index.htm|archivedate=2 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the index typewriter uses a pointer or stylus to choose a letter from an index. The pointer is mechanically linked so that the letter chosen could then be printed, most often by the activation of a lever.

The index typewriter was briefly popular in niche markets. Although they were slower than keyboard type machines they were mechanically simpler and lighter,&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; they were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers,&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; and because they could be produced more cheaply than keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence.&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; The index typewriter's niche appeal however soon disappeared, as on the one hand new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable and on the other refurbished second hand machines began to become available.&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; The last widely available western index machine was the Mignon typewriter produced by [[AEG]] which was produced until 1934. Considered one of the very best of the index typewriters, part of the Mignon's popularity was that it featured both interchangeable indexes and [[Sort (typesetting)|type]],&lt;ref name="Mignon2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/brands/index.php3?machine=indexmignon2&amp;cat=is|title=The Mignon 2|last=|first=|date=|website=The Virtual Typewriter Museum|publisher=|access-date=13 March 2017|quote=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003035122/http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/brands/index.php3?machine=indexmignon2&amp;cat=is|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the use of different [[font]]s and [[character set]]s,&lt;ref name="Mignon2" /&gt; something very few keyboard machines allowed and only at considerable added cost.&lt;ref name="Mignon2" /&gt;

Although pushed out of the market in most of the world by keyboard machines, successful [[Japanese typewriter|Japanese]] and [[Chinese typewriter]]s are of the index type albeit with a very much larger index and number of type elements.

===Standardization===
By about 1910, the "manual" or "mechanical" typewriter had reached a somewhat [[standardization|standardized]] design. There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.  When a key was struck briskly and firmly, the typebar hit a ribbon (usually made of [[ink]]ed [[Cloth|fabric]]), making a printed mark on the paper wrapped around a cylindrical [[platen]].

The platen was mounted on a carriage that moved left or right, automatically advancing the typing position horizontally after each character was typed.  The paper, rolled around the typewriter's platen, was then advanced vertically by the carriage-return lever (at the far left, or on the far right for left handed typewriters) into position for each new line of text. A small bell was struck a few characters before the right hand margin was reached to warn the operator to complete the word and then use the carriage-return lever to shift the paper back to the beginning of the next line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v14/n342/pdf/014043a0.pdf|title=The Remington Type-Writing Machine|volume=14|work=Nature|issue=14.342|year=1876|pages=43–44|subscription=yes|bibcode=1876Natur..14...43.|doi=10.1038/014043a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frontstriking====
In most of the early typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper, pressed against the bottom of the [[platen]], so the typist could not see the text as it was typed.  What was typed was not visible until a carriage return caused it to scroll into view.   The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called "visible typewriters" which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward against the front side of the platen, became standard.

One of the first was the Daugherty Visible, introduced in 1893, which also introduced the four-bank keyboard that became standard, although the Underwood which came out two years later was the first major typewriter with these features.&lt;ref name="Robert1"&gt;{{cite web

====Shift key====
[[File:Comparison of Full-Keyboard, Single-Shift, and Double-Shift Typerwriters in 1911.png|thumb|Comparison of full-keyboard, single-shift, and double-shift typewriters in 1911]]
A significant innovation was the [[shift key]], introduced with the [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington]] No. 2 in 1878. This key physically "shifted" either the basket of typebars, in which case the typewriter is described as "basket shift", or the paper-holding carriage, in which case the typewriter is described as "carriage shift".  Either mechanism caused a different portion of the typebar to come in contact with the ribbon/platen.  The result is that each typebar could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half (and simplifying the internal mechanisms considerably). The obvious use for this was to allow letter keys to type both upper and lower case, but normally the number keys were also duplexed, allowing access to special symbols such as percent (%) and ampersand (&amp;).

Before the shift key, typewriters had to have a separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.

However, because the shift key required more force to push (its mechanism was moving a much larger mass than other keys), and was operated by the little finger (normally the weakest finger on the hand), it was difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes. The "shift lock" key (the precursor to the modern [[caps lock]]) allowed the shift operation to be maintained indefinitely.

====Tab key====
To facilitate typewriter use in business settings, a tab (tabulator) key was added in the late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical "tab stops", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one tab stop and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the tab stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.)

====Character sizes====
In English-speaking countries, ordinary typewriters printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines per vertical inch, and had either of two variants of character ''width'', called "pica" for ten characters per horizontal inch and "elite" for twelve. This differed from the use of these terms in printing, where "[[Pica (typography)|pica]]" is a linear unit (approximately 1⁄6 of an inch) used for any measurement, the most common one being the height of a type face.

Some typewriters were designed to print extra-large type (commonly double height, double width) for labelling purposes. Classification numbers on books in libraries could be done this way.

====Color====
Some ribbons were inked in black and red stripes, each being half the width and running the entire length of the ribbon. A lever on most machines allowed switching between colors, which was useful for bookkeeping entries where negative amounts were highlighted in red. The red color was also used on some selected characters in running text, for emphasis.  When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink.  Some typewriters also had a third position which stopped the ribbon being struck at all.  This enabled the keys to hit the paper unobstructed, and was used for cutting stencils for [[Mimeograph|stencil duplicators]] (aka mimeograph machines).&lt;ref name=MimeoTypewriter&gt;{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a typewriter|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121016144524/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|archivedate=2012-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Noiseless" designs====
In the early part of the 20th century, a typewriter was marketed under the name "Noiseless" and advertised as "silent." It was developed by Wellington Parker Kidder and the first model was marketed by the Noiseless Typewriter Company in 1917. An agreement with Remington in 1924 saw production transferred to Remington, and a further agreement in 1929 allowed Underwood to produce it as well.&lt;ref name=noiseless&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028054256/http://www.geocities.com/wbd641/UndNoiselessAd.html OOcities.com] Reproduction of advertisement for Noiseless typewriters, with list of models and diagram of typebar mechanism&lt;/ref&gt; Noiseless portables sold well in the 1930s and 1940s, and noiseless standards continued to be manufactured until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="ja"/&gt;

In a conventional typewriter the typebar reaches the end of its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. A "noiseless" typewriter has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the typebar mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper&lt;ref name=noiseless /&gt; in an attempt to dampen the noise. It certainly reduced the high-frequency content of the sound, rendering it more of a "clunk" than a "clack" and arguably less intrusive, but such advertising claims as "A machine that can be operated a few feet away from your desk — And not be heard" were not true.

===Electric designs===
Although electric typewriters would not achieve widespread popularity until nearly a century later, the basic groundwork for the electric typewriter was laid by the [[Universal Stock Ticker]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1870. This device remotely printed letters and numbers on a stream of paper tape from input generated by a specially designed typewriter at the other end of a telegraph line.

====Early electric models====
Some electric typewriters were patented in the 19th century, but the first machine known to be produced in series is the Cahill of 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://etconline.org/backissues/ETC100.pdf | title=Bert Kerschbaumer, "The Cahill Electrical Typewriters," ETCetera No. 100 (December 2012) | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730133043/http://etconline.org/backissues/ETC100.pdf | archivedate=2016-07-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another electric typewriter was produced by the [[Blickensderfer typewriter|Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company]], of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. The machine was produced in several variants but apparently it was not a commercial success, for reasons that are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://etconline.org/backissues/ETC033.pdf | title=P. Robert Aubert, "The Last Service Call," ETCetera No. 33(December 1995) | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730133642/http://etconline.org/backissues/ETC033.pdf | archivedate=2016-07-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step in the development of the electric typewriter came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical [[teleprinter|teletypewriter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01286351&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D1286351.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F1286351%2526RS%3DPN%2F1286351&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page| title=U.S. Patent 1,286,351 filed in May, 1910, and issued in December, 1918| accessdate=2011-09-16| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225235913/http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01286351&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D1286351.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F1286351%2526RS%3DPN%2F1286351&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page| archivedate=2016-12-25| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Krums' machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars.  This machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Colin Hempstead, William E. Worthington |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&amp;pg=PA605 |title= Encyclopedia of 20th Century Technology |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=605|isbn=978-1-57958-464-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Fields Smathers]] of Kansas City invented what is considered the first practical power-operated typewriter in 1914. In 1920, after returning from Army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 turned it over to the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester for development. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers's design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.

After some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, Northeast asked Remington for a firm contract for the next batch. However, Remington was engaged in merger talks which would eventually result in the creation of [[Remington Rand]] and no executives were willing to commit to a firm order. Northeast instead decided to enter the typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first Electromatic Typewriter.

In 1928, [[Delco Electronics|Delco]], a division of [[General Motors]], purchased Northeast Electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as Electromatic Typewriters, Inc. In 1933, Electromatic was acquired by [[IBM]], which then spent {{nowrap|1 million USD}} on a redesign of the Electromatic Typewriter, launching the IBM Electric Typewriter Model 01&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV2240.html |title=IBM Electric Typewriter Model 01 |publisher=03.ibm.com |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526135454/http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV2240.html |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1935. By 1958 IBM was deriving 8% of its revenue from the sale of electric typewriters.

In 1931, an electric typewriter was introduced by Varityper Corporation. It was called the ''Varityper'', because a narrow cylinder-like wheel could be replaced to change the [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA83|title=Changing the Type of Typewriter Made Easy|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=July 1931|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=83|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626060339/https://books.google.com/books?id=4OIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA83|archivedate=2018-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical typewriter designs removed the ''direct'' mechanical connection between the keys and the element that struck the paper. Not to be confused with later ''electronic'' typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component: the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar.

In 1941, IBM announced the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated the appearance of a printed page, an effect that was further enhanced by including the 1937 innovation of carbon-film ribbons that produced clearer, sharper words on the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_milestone.html |title=IBM Typewriter Milestones |publisher=IBM Archives |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627172904/http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_milestone.html |archivedate=2017-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the [[IBM Executive series typewriter]]s.

====IBM Selectric====
{{main|IBM Selectric typewriter}}
[[Image:Selectric II.jpg|thumb|IBM Selectric II (dual Latin/Hebrew typeball and keyboard)]]

[[Image:IBM Selectric Globe Wiki.jpg|thumb|Replaceable IBM typeballs with clip, [[2 euro coin|€2 coin]] for scale]]

IBM and Remington Rand electric typewriters were the leading models until IBM introduced the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly smaller than a golf ball, with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate the ball into the correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.

Due to the physical similarity, the typeball was sometimes referred to as a "golfball". The typeball design had many advantages, especially the elimination of "jams" (when more than one key was struck at once and the typebars became entangled) and in the ability to change the typeball, allowing multiple fonts to be used in a single document.

The IBM Selectric became a commercial success, dominating the office typewriter market for at least two decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  IBM also gained an advantage by marketing more heavily to schools than did Remington, with the idea that students who learned to type on a Selectric would later choose IBM typewriters over the competition in the workplace as businesses replaced their old manual models.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  By the 1970s, IBM had succeeded in establishing the Selectric as the de facto standard typewriter in mid- to high-end office environments, replacing the raucous "clack" of older typebar machines with the quieter sound of gyrating typeballs.

Later models of IBM Executives and Selectrics replaced inked fabric ribbons with "carbon film" ribbons that had a dry black or colored powder on a clear plastic tape. These could be used only once, but later models used a cartridge that was simple to replace. A side effect of this technology was that the text typed on the machine could be easily read from the used ribbon, raising issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents (ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists did not carry them from the facility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellen | first = David | authorlink = | title = Scientific Examination of Documents | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2005 | location = | pages = 106–107 | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-8493-3925-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sample of IBM Magnetic Card Composer Output.png|thumb|Composer output showing [[Roman type|Roman]], [[Emphasis (typography)|Bold]] and [[Italic font]]s available by changing the type ball]]
A variation known as "Correcting Selectrics" introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape in front of the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable "pitch" so that the typewriter could be switched between [[Pica (typography)|pica]] type (10 characters per inch) and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were [[Proportional fonts|monospaced]]—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital "W" to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the [[IBM Executive series typewriter|IBM Executive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History of Typewriting|last= Wershler-Henry|first= Darren|year= 2005|publisher= Cornell University Press|location= Ithica and London|isbn= 978-0-8014-4586-6|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; proportional spacing was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.

The only fully electromechanical Selectric Typewriter with fully proportional spacing and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive [[IBM Selectric Composer|Selectric Composer]], which was capable of right-margin justification and was considered a [[typesetter|typesetting machine]] rather than a typewriter.

In addition to its electronic successors, the [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Selectric-based machines with data storage|Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer]] (MT/SC), the Mag Card Selectric Composer, and the Electronic Selectric Composer, IBM also made electronic typewriters with proportional spacing using the Selectric element that were considered typewriters or word processors instead of typesetting machines.

The first of these was the relatively obscure Mag Card Executive, which used 88-character elements. Later, some of the same typestyles used for it were used on the 96-character elements used on the IBM Electronic Typewriter 50 and the later models 65 and 85.

By 1970, as [[offset printing]] began to replace [[Letterpress printing#The decline of letterpress use|letterpress printing]], the Composer would be adapted as the output unit for a typesetting system. The system included a computer-driven input station to capture the key strokes on magnetic tape and insert the operator's format commands, and a Composer unit to read the tape and produce the formatted text for photo reproduction.

Advantages:

* reasonably fast, jam-free, and reliable
* relatively quiet, and more importantly, free of major vibrations
* could produce high quality lower- and upper-case output, compared to competitors such as [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] machines
* could be activated by a short, low-force mechanical action, allowing easier interfacing to electronic controls
* did not require the movement of a heavy "type basket" to shift between lower- and upper-case, allowing  higher speed without heavy impacts
* did not require the platen roller assembly to move from side to side (a problem with continuous-feed paper used for automated printing)

The [[IBM 2741]] terminal was a popular example of a Selectric-based computer terminal, and similar mechanisms were employed as the console devices for many [[IBM System/360]] computers. These mechanisms used "ruggedized" designs compared to those in standard office typewriters.

====Later electric models====
{{Listen

| description = A recording of the sound of typing on a Smith-Corona electric typewriter.}}
Some of IBM's advances were later adopted in less expensive machines from competitors.  For example, [[Smith Corona|Smith-Corona]] electric typewriters introduced in 1973 switched to interchangeable Coronamatic (SCM-patented) ribbon cartridges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithcorona.com/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322134218/http://www.smithcorona.com/history.html |archivedate=2017-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including fabric, film, erasing, and two-color versions. At about the same time, the advent of [[photocopying]] meant that carbon copies and erasers were less and less necessary; only the original need be typed, and photocopies made from it.

===Typewriter/printer hybrids===
Towards the end of the commercial popularity of typewriters in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were introduced.  These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and printing mechanisms of [[dot-matrix printer]]s. The generation of [[teleprinter]]s with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative [[thermal transfer]] technologies used in thermal [[label printer]]s had become technically feasible for typewriters.

[[IBM]] produced a series of typewriters called Thermotronic with letter-quality output and correcting tape along with printers tagged [[Quietwriter]]. [[Brother Industries|Brother]] extended the life of their typewriter product line with similar products. The development of these proprietary printing engines provided the vendors with exclusive markets in consumable ribbons and the ability to use standardized printing engines with varying degrees of electronic and software sophistication to develop product lines.  Although these changes reduced prices—and greatly increased the convenience—of typewriters, the [[disruptive technology|technological disruption]] posed by [[word processor]]s left these improvements with only a short-term low-end market. To extend the life of these products, many examples were provided with communication ports to connect them to computers as printers.

====Electronic typewriters====
The final major development of the typewriter was the electronic typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a plastic or metal [[daisy wheel]] mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the "petals"). The daisy wheel concept first emerged in printers developed by [[Diablo Systems]] in the 1970s.  In 1981, [[Xerox Corporation]], who by then had bought Diablo Systems, introduced a line of electronic typewriters incorporating this technology (the Memorywriter product line). For a time, these products were quite successful as their daisy-wheel mechanism was much simpler and cheaper than either typebar or Selectric mechanisms, and their electronic memory and display allowed the user to easily see errors and correct them before they were actually printed.  One problem with the plastic daisy wheel was that they were not always durable.  To solve this problem, more durable metal daisy wheels were made available (but at a slightly higher price).

These and similar electronic typewriters were in essence dedicated [[word processor]]s with either single-line [[LCD]] displays or multi-line [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, built-in [[line editor]]s in ROM, a [[spelling checker|spelling]] and [[grammar checker]], a few kilobytes of internal [[RAM]] and optional cartridge, magnetic card or diskette external memory-storage devices for storing text and even document formats. Text could be entered a line or paragraph at a time and edited using the display and built-in software tools before being committed to paper.

Unlike the Selectrics and earlier models, these really were "electronic" and relied on integrated circuits and multiple electromechanical components. These typewriters were sometimes called ''display typewriters'',&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number = 4620808| y = 1986| m = 11| d = 04| title = Display typewriter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''dedicated word processors'' or ''word-processing typewriters'', though the latter term was also frequently applied to less sophisticated machines that featured only a tiny, sometimes just single-row display. Sophisticated models were also called ''word processors'', though today that term almost always denotes a type of software program. Manufacturers of such machines included [[Brother Industries|Brother]] (Brother WP1 and WP500 etc., where WP stood for word processor), [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] ([[Canon Cat]]), [[Smith-Corona]] (PWP, i.e. Personal Word Processor line)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mindmachine.co.uk/products/04_Manuf_Smith-Corona_01.html#PWP-series |title=Smith-Corona |publisher=Mindmachine.co.uk |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528120612/http://mindmachine.co.uk/products/04_Manuf_Smith-Corona_01.html#PWP-series |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philips]]/[[Magnavox]] ([[VideoWriter]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===End of an era===
The 1970s and early 1980s were a time of transition for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely "old-style", while large corporations and government departments would already be "new-style"; other offices would have a mixture.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff to have to learn several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Due to falling sales, IBM sold its typewriter division in 1991 to [[Lexmark]], completely exiting from a market it once dominated.

The increasing dominance of [[personal computer]]s, [[desktop publishing]], the introduction of low-cost, truly high-quality [[laser printer|laser]] and [[inkjet printer]] technologies, and the pervasive use of [[web publishing]], [[e-mail]] and other electronic communication techniques have largely replaced typewriters in the United States. Still, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, typewriters continued to be used by a number of government agencies and other institutions in the US, where they are primarily used to fill preprinted forms. According to a Boston typewriter repairman quoted by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "Every maternity ward has a typewriter, as well as funeral homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/articles/2009/02/01/typewriters_ring_on_in_the_fringes/|title=Typewriters ring on in the fringes|work=The Boston Globe|first=Cindy Atoji|last=Keene|date=2009-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826014156/http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/articles/2009/02/01/typewriters_ring_on_in_the_fringes/|archivedate=2013-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A fairly major typewriter user is the City of New York, which in 2008 purchased several thousand typewriters, mostly for use by the [[New York Police Department]], at the total cost of $982,269. Another $99,570 was spent in 2009 for the maintenance of the existing typewriters. New York police officers would use the machines to type property and evidence vouchers on [[carbon paper]] forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/07132009/news/regionalnews/typewrite__wrong_178919.htm Typewrite &amp; Wrong: NYPD 'Wastes' $1M on Relics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905051538/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07132009/news/regionalnews/typewrite__wrong_178919.htm |date=2009-09-05 }}, By Jeremy Olshan, [[New York Post]], July 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather specialized market for typewriters exists due to the regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own typewriters. The Swintec corporation (headquartered in [[Moonachie, New Jersey]]), which, as of 2011, still produced typewriters at its overseas factories (in [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]], and/or [[Malaysia]]), manufactures a variety of typewriters for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to make it harder for prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/death-typewriter-dont-write-it-yet |title=The death of the typewriter?

In November 2012, Brother's UK factory manufactured what it claimed to be the last typewriter ever made in the UK; the typewriter was donated to the [[London Science Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20391538 |title=UK's 'last typewriter' produced |publisher=BBC |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219184806/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20391538 |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian typewriters use [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], which has made the ongoing [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] [[Azerbaijani alphabet|reconversion]] from [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] to [[Latin alphabet]] more difficult. In 1997, the government of [[Turkey]] offered to donate western typewriters to the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] in exchange for more zealous and exclusive promotion of the Latin alphabet for the Azerbaijani language; this offer, however, was declined.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In Latin America and Africa, mechanical typewriters are still common because they can be used without electrical power. In Latin America, the typewriters used are most often Brazilian models – Brazil continues to produce mechanical (Facit) and electronic (Olivetti) typewriters to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/ainda-se-fabricam-maquinas-de-escrever |title=Ainda se fabricam máquinas de escrever?

==Correction technologies==
[[Image:TypewriterMiningMuseumPachuca.JPG|thumb|left|An Elliott-Fisher book typewriter on display at the [[Historic Archive and Museum of Mining]] in [[Pachuca]], [[Mexico]]]]

According to the standards taught in secretarial schools in the mid-20th century, a [[business letter]] was supposed to have no mistakes and no visible corrections.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Accuracy was prized as much as speed. Indeed, typing speeds, as scored in proficiency tests and [[speed typing contest|typewriting speed competitions]], included a deduction of ten words for every mistake. Corrections were, of course, necessary, and many methods were developed.

In practice, several methods would often be combined. For example, if six extra copies of a letter were needed, the fluid-corrected original would be photocopied, but only for the two recipients getting "c.c."s; the other four copies, the less-important file copies that stayed in various departments at the office, would be cheaper, hand-erased, less-distinct bond paper copies or even "flimsies" of different colors (tissue papers interleaved with black carbon paper) that were all typed as a "carbon pack" at the same time as the original.

In informal applications such as personal letters where low priority was placed on the appearance of the document, or conversely in highly formal applications in which it was important that any corrections be obvious, the backspace key could be used to back up over the error and then overstrike it with hyphens, slashes, Xs, or the like.

===Typewriter erasers===
[[File:Triumph - Typewriter Eraser 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|Triumph typewriter eraser (1960)]]
The traditional erasing method involved the use of a special ''typewriter [[eraser]]'' made of [[hard rubber]] that contained an [[abrasive]] material. Some were thin, flat disks, pink or gray, approximately {{convert|2|in}} in diameter by ⅛ inch (3.2&amp;nbsp;mm) thick, with a brush attached from the center, while others looked like pink pencils, with a sharpenable eraser at the "lead" end and a stiff [[nylon]] brush at the other end. Either way, these tools made possible erasure of individual typed letters. Business letters were typed on heavyweight, high-rag-content bond paper, not merely to provide a luxurious appearance, but also to stand up to erasure.

Typewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.

===Eraser shield===
Erasing a set of [[carbon copies]] was particularly difficult, and called for the use of a device called an ''eraser shield'' (a thin stainless-steel rectangle about {{convert|2|by|3|in}} with several tiny holes in it) to prevent the pressure of erasing on the upper copies from producing carbon smudges on the lower copies. To correct copies, typists had to go from carbon copy to carbon copy, trying not to get their fingers dirty as they leafed through the carbon papers, and moving and repositioning the eraser shield and eraser for each copy.

===Erasable bond===
Paper companies produced a special form of typewriter paper called ''erasable bond'' (for example, [[Eaton's Corrasable Bond]]). This incorporated a thin layer of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.

===Correction fluid===
{{main|Correction fluid}}
In the 1950s and 1960s, [[correction fluid]] made its appearance, under brand names such as [[Liquid Paper]], [[Wite-Out]] and [[Tipp-Ex]]; it was invented by [[Bette Nesmith Graham]]. Correction fluid was a kind of opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry correction fluid (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was [[photocopying]] the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.

A different fluid was available for correcting stencils.  It sealed up the stencil ready for retyping but did not attempt to color match.&lt;ref name=MimeoCorrect&gt;{{cite web|title=How to correct a mimeograph stencil|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtocorrectamimeographstencil.htm|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121016144730/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtocorrectamimeographstencil.htm|archivedate=2012-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry correction===
Dry correction products (such as [[correction paper]]) under brand names such as "Ko-Rec-Type" were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red inked ribbon common on manual typewriters, a black and white correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters. But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.

The pinnacle of this kind of technology was the [[IBM]] Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric ink ribbons,  or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons.  This latter technology actually lifted the carbon film forming a typed letter, leaving nothing more than a flattened depression in the surface of the paper, with the advantage that no color matching of the paper was needed.

===Keyboard layouts===
[[Image:UnderwoodKeyboard.jpg|thumb|The "[[QWERTY]]" layout of typewriter keys became a ''de facto'' standard and continues to be used long after the reasons for its adoption (including reduction of key/lever entanglements) have ceased to apply.]]

====QWERTY====
The 1874 Sholes &amp; Glidden typewriters established the "[[QWERTY]]" layout for the letter keys. During the period in which Sholes and his colleagues were experimenting with this invention, other keyboard arrangements were apparently tried, but these are poorly documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liebowitz | first = S.

Other languages written in the [[Latin alphabet]] sometimes use variants of the QWERTY layouts, such as the French [[AZERTY]], the Italian [[QZERTY]] and the German [[QWERTZ]] layouts.

The QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout possible for the English language, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. Although the QWERTY keyboard was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Keyboards and keying an annotated bibliography of the literature from 1878 to 1999|journal=Universal Access in the Information Society|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–160|year=2014|last1=Kroemer|first1=Karl H.E|doi=10.1007/s102090100012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular but unverified&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/fact-of-fiction-the-legend-of-the-qwerty-keyboard-49863249/?no-ist Fact of Fiction? The Legend of the QWERTY Keyboard | Arts &amp; Culture | Smithsonian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.&lt;ref name="David, P.A. 1986"&gt;David, P.A. (1986): Understanding the Economics of QWERTY: the Necessity of History. In: Parker, William N.: Economic History and the Modern Economist. Basil Blackwell, New York and Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~dcrehr/whyqwert.html |title=Consider QWERTY |accessdate=2008-06-18 |last= |first= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote=QWERTY's effect, by reducing those annoying clashes, was to speed up typing rather than slow it down. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515013027/http://home.earthlink.net/~dcrehr/whyqwert.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another story is that the QWERTY layout allowed early typewriter salesmen to impress their customers by being able to easily type out the example word "typewriter" without having learned the full keyboard layout {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2015}}, because "typewriter" can be spelled purely on the top row of the keyboard. However, there is no evidence to support these claims.

====Other layouts====
A number of radically different layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] have been proposed to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of QWERTY, but none have been able to displace the QWERTY layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far none has been widely used. The [[Blickensderfer typewriter]] with its [[DHIATENSOR]] layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Instructions for Using the Blickensderfer Typewriter| work =| publisher =| url =http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa_A0562/| format =| accessdate =2014-01-03| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140221053745/http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa_A0562/| archivedate =2014-02-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Latin alphabets have keyboard layouts that have nothing to do with QWERTY. The Russian layout, for instance, puts the common trigrams ыва, про, and ить on adjacent keys so that they can be typed by rolling the fingers. The Greek layout, on the other hand, is a variant of QWERTY.

Typewriters were also made for [[East Asian languages]] with thousands of characters, such as [[Chinese typewriter|Chinese]] or [[Japanese typewriter|Japanese]]. They were not easy to operate, but professional typists used them for a long time until the development of electronic word processors and [[laser printer]]s in the 1980s.

On modern keyboards, the exclamation point is the shifted character on the 1 key, a direct result of the historical fact that these were the last characters to become "standard" on keyboards. Holding the spacebar pressed down usually suspended the carriage advance mechanism (a so-called "dead key" feature), allowing one to superimpose multiple keystrikes on a single location. The ¢ symbol (meaning cents) was located above the number 6 on electric typewriters, while ASCII computer keyboards have ^ instead.

===Typewriter conventions===
[[File:Typerwriter conventions text example.gif|thumb|This typed page uses a number of typographic conventions stemming from the mechanical limitations of the typewriter: two hyphens in place of an [[em dash]], double [[sentence spacing]], straight [[quotation mark]]s, [[Tab key|tab]] indents for paragraphs, and double [[carriage return]]s between paragraphs]]

A number of typographical conventions originate from the widespread use of the typewriter, based on the characteristics and limitations of the typewriter itself. For example, the QWERTY keyboard typewriter did not include keys for the [[en dash]] and the [[em dash]]. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/4111/TopTenTypeCrimes.htm|title= U&amp;lc Online Issue 41.1.1: Top Ten Type Crimes|author= Upper and Lower Case Magazine|accessdate= 23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of typewriter practices that are sometimes still used in desktop publishing systems include inserting a [[sentence spacing|double space]] at the end of a sentence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Mac is not a typewriter: A style manual for creating professional-level type on your Macintosh|edition= 2nd|last1= Williams|first1= Robin|year= 2003|publisher= Peachpit Press|location= Berkeley, CA|isbn= 0-201-78263-4|ref= Wil03}}

Strizver states that "When available, true primes should be used for measurements, but typewriter quotes (not smart quotes) have become the accepted practice in digital typography."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of underlining text in place of italics and the use of all capitals to provide emphasis are additional examples of typographical conventions that derived from the limitations of the typewriter keyboard that still carry on today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/copyprep.html#Anchor-Copy-47857 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |author=Regents of the University of Minnesota |date=18 July 2007 |work=University of Minnesota |publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota |accessdate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117122230/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/copyprep.html |archivedate=January 17, 2009 }} This topic is discussed under "Creating Professional-looking Text."; Williams 2003. pps. 31, 33. Another example of the limitation of the typewriter in regard to underlining, was the necessity to underline the titles of books and stand-alone works in Bibliographies—works that would otherwise have been italicized, if that capability existed on the typewriter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many older typewriters did not include a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero.  Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l ("ell") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (¢) was created by combining ([[Overstrike|over-striking]]) a lower case 'c' with a slash character (typing 'c', then backspace, then '/').

Similarly, the exclamation point was created by combining an apostrophe and a period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoot &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characters were omitted to simplify design and reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs; they were chosen specifically because they were "redundant" and could be recreated using other keys.

===Terminology===
Some terminology from the typewriter age has survived into the personal computer era.  Examples include:
* [[backspace]] (BS) – a keystroke that moved the cursor backwards one position (on a physical platen, this is the exact opposite of the space key), for the purpose of overtyping a character. This could be for combining characters (e.g. an apostrophe, backspace, and period make an exclamation point—a character missing on some early typewriters), or for correction such as with the correcting tape that developed later.
* [[carriage return]] (CR) – return to the first column of text and, in some systems, switch to the next line.
* [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] – a marker used to indicate where the next character will be printed. The cursor, however, was originally a term to describe the clear slider on a [[slide rule]].
* [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]] – taking text, a numerical table, or an image and pasting it into a document. The term originated when such compound documents were created using manual [[paste up]] techniques for typographic [[page layout]].  Actual brushes and paste were later replaced by hot-wax machines equipped with cylinders that applied melted adhesive wax to developed prints of "typeset" copy. This copy was then cut out with knives and rulers, and slid into position on layout sheets on slanting layout tables. After the "copy" had been correctly positioned and squared up using a T-square and set square, it was pressed down with a brayer, or roller. The whole point of the exercise was to create so-called "camera-ready copy" which existed only to be photographed and then printed, usually by [[offset lithography]].
* [[dead key]] – describes a key that when typed, does not advance the typing position, thus allowing another character to be overstruck on top of the original character.  This was typically used to combine [[diacritical mark]]s with letters they modified (e.g. ''è'' can be generated by first pressing &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;). The dead key feature was often implemented mechanically by having the typist press and hold the space bar while typing the characters to be superimposed.
* [[line feed]] (LF), also called "newline" –  moving the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] to the next on-screen line of text in a word processor document.
*[[shift key|shift]] – a [[modifier key]] used to type capital letters and other alternate "upper case" characters; when pressed and held down, would shift a typewriter's mechanism to allow a different typebar impression (such as 'D' instead of 'd') to press into the ribbon and print on a page. The concept of a shift key or modifier key was later extended to Ctrl, Alt, and Super ("Windows" or "Apple") keys on modern computer keyboards. The generalized concept of a shift key reached its apotheosis in the [[MIT]] [[space-cadet keyboard]].
* [[tabulator key|tab]] (HT), shortened from "horizontal tab" or "tabulator stop" – caused the print position to advance horizontally to the next pre-set "tab stop." This was used for typing lists and tables with vertical columns of numbers or words.  The related term "vertical tab" (VT) never came into widespread use.
* [[tty (Unix)|tty]], short for [[teletypewriter]] – used in [[Unix-like]] operating systems to designate a given "terminal".

In the above listing, the two-letter codes in parentheses are abbreviations for the [[ASCII]] characters derived from typewriter usage.

During World War I and II, increasing numbers of [[Women's roles in the World Wars|women]] were entering the workforce. In the United States, women often started in the professional workplace as typists. Questions about morals made a salacious businessman making sexual advances to a female typist into  a cliché of office life, appearing in [[vaudeville]] and movies. Being a typist was considered the right choice for a "good girl" meaning women who present themselves as being chaste and having good conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Kate, and Kim England.

*[[Jack Kerouac]], a fast typist at 100 words per minute, typed ''[[On the Road]]'' on a roll of paper so he would not be interrupted by having to change the paper. Within two weeks of starting to write ''On the Road'', Kerouac had one single-spaced paragraph, 120 feet long. Some scholars say the scroll was shelf paper; others contend it was a Thermo-fax roll; another theory is that the roll consisted of sheets of architect’s paper taped together.&lt;ref name=ja/&gt; His rapid work earned the famous rebuke from [[Truman Capote]], "That's not writing, it's typing."

*[[Tom Robbins]] waxed philosophical about the Remington SL3, a typewriter that he bought to write ''[[Still Life with Woodpecker]]''. He eventually did away with it because it is too complicated and inhuman for the writing of [[poetry]].

==Typewriters in popular culture==

===In music===

&lt;!-- Editors: Please try to keep this section sorted in roughly chronological order --&gt;
* The composer [[Pablo Sorozábal]] includes in a scene of his [[zarzuela]] ''La eterna canción'' (1945) a typewriter, accompanied by an orchestra and vocal soloists: the scene is in a police station, where a policeman is deposing witnesses, and is singing while he types the report.
* The composer [[Leroy Anderson]] wrote ''[[The Typewriter]]'' (1950) for orchestra and typewriter, and it has since been used as the theme for numerous radio programs. The solo instrument is a real typewriter played by a [[percussionist]]. The piece was later made famous by comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] as part of his regular routine both on screen and stage, most notably in the 1963 film ''[[Who's Minding the Store?]]''.
* [[Frank Loesser]]'s music for the stage (1961) and screen (1967) musical [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]] employed the typewriter as a percussion instrument in the song "A Secretary is Not a Toy".
* The clacking of typewriter keys can be heard at the beginning of [[Dolly Parton]]'s song [[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]. Parton has said in interviews that when writing the song, to mimic the typing keys sound, she would run her acrylic fingernails back and forth against each other.  
* The song "Embassy Lament" from the 1986 Musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' mimics the sound of typing in the bridge.
* A typewriter provides the percussive backing for [[Stereo Total]]'s "Dactylo Rock"{{snd}}the first song from their debut album (1995)
* A suite of songs entitled "Green Typewriters" is on The Olivia Tremor Control's album ''[[Dusk At Cubist Castle]]'' (1996), and the sounds of typewriters can be heard in a few of the sections.
* [[Guster]]'s 1999 song [[Barrel of a Gun (Guster song)|Barrel of a Gun]] features a typewriter as percussion.
* American singer-songwriter [[Marian Call]] accompanies herself on a typewriter on "Nerd Anthem" (c. 1998)

*In the film ''[[The History of the Typewriter recited by Michael Winslow]]'', voice sound effect performer [[Michael Winslow]] recreates the sounds of 32 typewriters from history.
* The word "typewriter" is often cited as the longest English word that can be typed using only one row of keys of a QWERTY keyboard.  This is untrue, since "[[rupturewort]]" (a kind of flowering plant) has 11 letters, while "typewriter" has only 10. ''[[Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary]]'' defines "[[uropyoureter]]" (12 letters).
* A sentence which uses every letter of the alphabet (a [[pangram]]), "[[A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]" can be used to check typewriters quickly.
* The early [[Resident Evil]] video games used a typewriter as the save feature, and used one ink ribbon per save.
* The opening [[title sequence]] of ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'' prominently features [[Jessica Fletcher]] touch-typing a manuscript with a 1940s [[Royal KMM Manual Typewriter]].

==Forensic examination==
Typewritten documents may be examined by [[questioned document examination|forensic document examiners]]. This is done primarily to determine 1) the make and/or model of the typewriter used to produce a document, or 2) whether or not a particular suspect typewriter might have been used to produce a document.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, an ink or correction ribbon may also be examined.

The determination of a make and/or model of typewriter is a 'classification' problem and several systems have been developed for this purpose.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; These include the original Haas Typewriter Atlases (Pica version)&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Josef. (1972), "ATLAS der Schreibmaschinenschrift, PICA".&lt;/ref&gt; and (Non-Pica version)&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Josef and Bernhard Haas. (1985), "ATLAS der Schreibmaschinenschrift, Non-PICA".&lt;/ref&gt; and the TYPE system developed by Dr. Philip Bouffard,&lt;ref&gt;
Bouffard, P.D. (1992), A PC-Based Typewriter Typestyle Classification System Standard, presented at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences meeting, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]'s Termatrex Typewriter classification system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Interpol]]'s Typewriter classification system,&lt;ref&gt;Interpol (1969) "System for Identification of Typewriter Makes Using the Card Index", ICPO-Interpol&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

Because of the tolerances of the mechanical parts, slight variation in the alignment of the letters and their uneven wear, each typewriter has an individual "signature" or "[[fingerprint]]", which may permit a typewritten document to be [[forensic identification|traced back]] to the typewriter on which it was produced. For devices utilizing replaceable components, such as a typeball element, any association may be restricted to a specific element, rather than to the typewriter as a whole.

The earliest reference in fictional literature to the potential identification of a typewriter as having produced a document was by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who wrote "A Case of Identity" in 1891.&lt;ref name=crown&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In non-fiction, the first [[forensic document examination|document examiner]]&lt;ref name=crown/&gt; to describe how a typewriter might be identified was William E. Hagan who wrote, in 1894, "All typewriter machines, even when using the same kind of type, become more or less peculiar by use as to the work done by them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  A modern description of the examination procedure is laid out in ASTM Standard E2494-08 (Standard Guide for Examination of Typewritten Items).&lt;ref name="astm_TW"&gt;[http://www.astm.org/ ASTM International] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EnTAwje1?url=http://www.astm.org/ |date=2006-03-31 }}, These guides are under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30.02 on Questioned Documents. Copies of ASTM Standards can be obtained directly from [[ASTM International]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Typewriter examination was used in the [[Leopold and Loeb]] and [[Alger Hiss]] cases. In the [[Eastern Bloc]], typewriters (together with [[printing press]]es, [[copy machine]]s, and later [[printer (computing)|computer printer]]s) were a controlled technology, with [[secret police]] in charge of maintaining files of the typewriters and their owners. In the [[Soviet Union]], the [[First Department]] of each organization sent data on organization's typewriters to the [[KGB]]. This posed a significant risk for [[dissident]]s and [[samizdat]] authors. In [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], according to State Council Decree No. 98 of March 28, 1983, owning a typewriter, both by businesses or by private persons, was subject to an approval given by the local police authorities.&lt;ref name="Betea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/la-militie-cu-masina-de-scris-319045.html|title=La Miliţie cu maşina de scris|publisher=jurnalul.ro|last=Betea|first=Lavinia|date=February 13, 2009|accessdate=August 24, 2014|language=Romanian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904043133/http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/la-militie-cu-masina-de-scris-319045.html|archivedate=September 4, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People previously convicted of any crime or those who because of their behaviour were considered to be "a danger to public order or to the security of the state" were refused approval.&lt;ref name="Betea"/&gt; In addition, once a year, typewriter owners had to take the typewriter to the local police station, where they would be asked to type down a sample of all the typewriter's characters.&lt;ref name="Betea"/&gt; It was also forbidden to borrow, lend, or repair typewriters other than at the places that had been authorized by the police.&lt;ref name="Betea"/&gt;

The ribbon can be read, although only if it has not been typed over more than once. This is not as easy as reading text from a page as the ribbon does not include spaces, but can be done, giving every typewriter a "memory".

UTF-7 is used by &lt;!--"less than 0.1%" in fact from the graph: --&gt; less than 0.003% of websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf7/all/all|title=Usage Statistics of UTF-7 for Websites, December 2018|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UTF-8]] has since 2009 been the dominant encoding (of any kind, not just of Unicode encodings) for the [[World Wide Web]] (and declared mandatory "for all things" by [[WHATWG]]&lt;ref name="mandatory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#security-background|title=Encoding Standard|website=encoding.spec.whatwg.org|quote=The problems outlined here go away when exclusively using UTF-8, which is one of the many reasons that is now the mandatory encoding for all things.|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Motivation==
[[MIME]], the modern standard of E-mail format, forbids encoding of [[header (computing)|headers]] using byte values above the ASCII range. Although MIME allows encoding the message body in various [[character set]]s (broader than ASCII), the underlying transmission infrastructure ([[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], the main E-mail transfer standard) is still not guaranteed to be [[8-bit clean]]. Therefore, a non-trivial content transfer encoding has to be applied in case of doubt. Unfortunately [[base64]] has a disadvantage of making even [[US-ASCII]] characters unreadable in non-MIME clients. On the other hand, UTF-8 combined with [[quoted-printable]] produces a very size-inefficient format requiring 6&amp;ndash;9 bytes for non-ASCII characters from the [[Basic Multilingual Plane|BMP]] and 12 bytes for characters outside the BMP.

Provided certain rules are followed during encoding, UTF-7 can be sent in e-mail without using an underlying MIME [[MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding|transfer encoding]], but still must be explicitly identified as the text character set.  In addition, if used within e-mail headers such as "Subject:", UTF-7 must be contained in MIME [[MIME#Encoded-Word|encoded word]]s identifying the character set. Since encoded words force use of either [[quoted-printable]] or [[base64]], UTF-7 was designed to avoid using the = sign as an escape character to avoid double escaping when it is combined with quoted-printable (or its variant, the RFC 2047/1522 ?Q?-encoding of headers).

UTF-7 is generally not used as a native representation within applications as it is very awkward to process.  Despite its size advantage over the combination of UTF-8 with either quoted-printable or base64, the now defunct [[Internet Mail Consortium]] recommended against its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imc.org/imcr-010.html|title=Using International Characters in Internet Mail |work=Internet Mail Consortium |date=1 August 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907234243/https://www.imc.org/imcr-010.html |archive-date=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[8BITMIME]] has also been introduced, which reduces the need to encode message bodies in a 7-bit format.

A modified form of UTF-7 (sometimes dubbed 'mUTF-7'{{CN|date=December 2015}}) is currently used in the [[IMAP]] e-mail retrieval protocol for mailbox names.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3501 section 5.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
UTF-7 was first proposed as an experimental protocol in RFC 1642, ''A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode''.  This [[Request for Comments|RFC]] has been made obsolete by RFC 2152, an informational RFC which never became a standard. As RFC 2152 clearly states, the RFC "does not specify an Internet standard of any kind". Despite this, RFC 2152 is quoted as the definition of UTF-7 in the IANA's list of charsets. Neither is UTF-7 a Unicode Standard.  ''The Unicode Standard 5.0'' only lists UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
There is also a modified version, specified in RFC 2060, which is sometimes identified as UTF-7.

Some characters can be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. The first group is known as "direct characters" and contains 62 alphanumeric characters and 9 symbols: &lt;code&gt;' ( ) , - . / : ?&lt;/code&gt;. The direct characters are safe to include literally. The other main group, known as "optional direct characters", contains all other printable characters in the range {{U+|0020}}&amp;ndash;U+007E except &lt;code&gt;~ \ +&lt;/code&gt; and space. Using the optional direct characters reduces size and enhances human readability but also increases the chance of breakage by things like badly designed mail gateways and may require extra escaping when used in encoded words for header fields.

Space, tab, carriage return and line feed may also be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. However, if the encoded text is to be used in e-mail, care is needed to ensure that these characters are used in ways that do not require further content transfer encoding to be suitable for e-mail. The plus sign (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;) ''may'' be encoded as &lt;code&gt;+-&lt;/code&gt;.

Other characters must be encoded in UTF-16 (hence U+10000 and higher would be encoded into surrogates), big-endian (hence higher-order bits appear first), and then in [[base64#UTF-7|modified Base64]]. The start of these blocks of modified Base64 encoded UTF-16 is indicated by a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; sign. The end is indicated by any character not in the modified Base64 set. If the character after the modified Base64 is a &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII [[hyphen-minus]]) then it is consumed by the decoder and decoding resumes with the next character. Otherwise decoding resumes with the character after the base64.

==Examples==
* "&lt;tt&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/tt&gt;" is encoded as "&lt;tt&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/tt&gt;"
* "&lt;tt&gt;1 + 1 = 2&lt;/tt&gt;" is encoded as "&lt;tt&gt;1 +- 1 +AD0 2&lt;/tt&gt;"
* "&lt;tt&gt;£1&lt;/tt&gt;" is encoded as "&lt;tt&gt;+AKM-1&lt;/tt&gt;". The Unicode code point for the [[pound sign]] is U+00A3 (which is &lt;tt&gt;00A3&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; in UTF-16), which converts into [[modified Base64]] as in the table below. There are two bits left over, which are padded to 0.

==Algorithm for encoding and decoding==

===Encoding===
First, an encoder must decide which characters to represent directly in ASCII form, which &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; has to be escaped as &lt;code&gt;+-&lt;/code&gt;, and which to place in blocks of Unicode characters. A simple encoder may encode all characters it considers safe for direct encoding directly. However the cost of ending a Unicode sequence, outputing a single character directly in ASCII and then starting another Unicode sequence is 3 to 3⅔ bytes.  This is more than the 2⅔ bytes needed to represent the character as a part of a Unicode sequence. Each Unicode sequence must be encoded using the following procedure, then surrounded by the appropriate delimiters.

Using the £† (U+00A3 U+2020) character sequence as an example:

{{ordered list
|1= Express the character’s Unicode numbers (UTF-16) in Binary:{{unbulleted list
|&lt;tt&gt;0x00A3 → 0000 0000 1010 0011&lt;/tt&gt;
|&lt;tt&gt;0x2020 → 0010 0000 0010 0000&lt;/tt&gt;}}
|2= Concatenate the binary sequences:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;0000 0000 1010 0011 and 0010 0000 0010 0000 → 0000 0000 1010 0011 0010 0000 0010 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|3= Regroup the binary into groups of six bits, starting from the left:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;0000 0000 1010 0011 0010 0000 0010 0000 → 000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 00&lt;/tt&gt;
|4= If the last group has fewer than six bits, add trailing zeros:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 00 → 000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000&lt;/tt&gt;
|5= Replace each group of six bits with a respective Base64 code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000 → AKMgIA&lt;/tt&gt;
}}

===Decoding===
First an encoded data must be separated into plain ASCII text chunks (including '''+'''es followed by a dash) and nonempty Unicode blocks as mentioned in the description section. Once this is done, each Unicode block must be decoded with the following procedure (using the result of the encoding example above as our example)

#Express each Base64 code as the bit sequence it represents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AKMgIA → 000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000&lt;/tt&gt;
#Regroup the binary into groups of sixteen bits, starting from the left:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tt&gt;000000 001010 001100 100000 001000 000000 → 0000000010100011 0010000000100000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
#If there is an incomplete group at the end containing only zeros, discard it (if the incomplete group contains any ones, the code is invalid):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tt&gt;0000000010100011 0010000000100000&lt;/tt&gt;
#Each group of 16 bits is a character's Unicode (UTF-16) number and can be expressed in other forms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;0000 0000 1010 0011 ≡ 0x00A3 ≡ 163&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

==Unicode signature==
A Unicode signature (often loosely called a "BOM") is an optional special byte sequence at the very start of a stream or file that, without being data itself, indicates the encoding used for the data that follows; a signature is used in the absence of metadata that denotes the encoding. For a given encoding scheme, the signature is that scheme's representation of Unicode code point &lt;code&gt;U+FEFF&lt;/code&gt;, the so-called ''BOM'' (byte-order mark) [character].

While a Unicode signature is typically a single, fixed byte sequence, the nature of UTF-7 necessitates 5 variations: The last 2 bits of the 4th byte of the UTF-7 encoding of &lt;code&gt;U+FEFF&lt;/code&gt; belong to the ''following'' character, resulting in 4 possible bit patterns and therefore 4 different possible bytes in the 4th position. The 5th variation is needed to disambiguate the case where no characters at all follow the signature. See the UTF-7 entry in the [[Byte_order_mark#Byte_order_marks_by_encoding|table of Unicode signatures]].

==Security==
UTF-7 allows multiple representations of the same source string. In particular, ASCII characters can be represented as part of Unicode blocks. As such, if standard ASCII-based escaping or validation processes are used on strings that may be later interpreted as UTF-7, then Unicode blocks may be used to slip malicious strings past them. To mitigate this problem, systems should perform decoding before validation and should avoid attempting to autodetect UTF-7.

Older versions of [[Internet Explorer]] can be tricked into interpreting the page as UTF-7. This can be used for a [[cross-site scripting]] attack as the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; marks can be encoded as &lt;code&gt;+ADw-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+AD4-&lt;/code&gt; in UTF-7, which most validators let through as simple text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7 |title=ArticleUtf7 - doctype-mirror - UTF-7: the case of the missing charset - Mirror of Google Doctype - Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chieftain|Chief]] '''Wale Ogunyemi''', [[Order of the Niger|OFR]] (12 August 1939&amp;ndash;December 2001) was a [[Nigeria]]n veteran seasoned dramatist, film actor, prolific [[playwright]] and [[Yoruba language]] scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rAUbyu1wRCsC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Wale+Ogunyemi,+script+writer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkzFLVY14G&amp;sig=ZyxxjKFasOKrFvpo0npZSJR4eos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZX-7VJz-FMf6PM2YgeAE&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAg|title=Black African Literature in English, 1997-1999|work=google.nl|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in August 1939 at Igbajo, a city in [[Osun State]], southwestern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=9PsbR01ZUTAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Wale+Ogunyemi,+a+writer+of+all+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7IagELpJfm&amp;sig=yg9LmdMiTlIAHqCemhWa6l6tup8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ENK7VPHQKsXgOMa_gYgB&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ọdún|work=google.com.ng|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[University of Ibadan]] in 1967 for a year course in [[drama]], the same year he was appointed as a research assistant at Ibadan Institute of African Studies where he later retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=D6PrqVKaZtgC&amp;pg=PA774&amp;lpg=PA774&amp;dq=Wale+Ogunyemi,+script+writer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JCZr5Atl3B&amp;sig=OaU3ILAvvZItUgqLABwTbmaIJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZX-7VJz-FMf6PM2YgeAE&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwBA|title=European-language Writing in Sub-Saharan Africa|work=google.nl|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=RTzibTsqLE4C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=Langbodo+by+Wale+Ogunyemi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LGSxVo-WSF&amp;sig=i9YjPPGBwJUb6Z3J67vs32m81xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AtW7VIOcJYfvOdGogfgJ&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwADgU|title=Relocating Agency|work=google.nl|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=VaZx0Q2O3l8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=Langbodo+by+Wale+Ogunyemi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k9MdiBPLed&amp;sig=g8ucXOyOEHd_eZz1w4o3eNCBA1I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AtW7VIOcJYfvOdGogfgJ&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBjgU|title=The Columbia Guide to West African Literature in English Since 1945|work=google.nl|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He began his acting career as a seasonal   actor with the new western Nigerian television service in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=n_wok2_QtaQC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Wale+Ogunyemi,+script+writer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=852U_SoUUX&amp;sig=uippaugpD1IozrXhLp2saMeN2j4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZX-7VJz-FMf6PM2YgeAE&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBw|title=The Nostalgic Drum|work=google.nl|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about||the subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|Vilayet|the Spanish movie|Wilaya (film)}}
{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}

A '''wilayah''' ({{lang-ar|{{lang|ar|ولاية}}}}; [[Urdu]] and {{lang-fa|{{nq|ولایت}}}}; {{lang-tr|vilayet}}) is an administrative division, usually translated as "[[Constituent state|state]]", "[[province]]", or occasionally as "[[governorate]]". The word comes from the Arabic "''w-l-y''", "to govern": a ''[[wāli]]''—"governor"—governs a ''wilayah'', "that which is governed". Under the [[Caliphate]], the term referred to any constituent near-sovereign state.

==Use in specific countries==
In Arabic, ''wilayah'' is used to refer to the [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]], and the United States of America as a whole is called ''al-Wilāyāt al-Muttaḥidah al-Amrīkīyah'', literally meaning "the American United States".

===North Africa and Middle East===
For [[Prefectures and provinces of Morocco|Morocco]], which is divided into provinces ''and'' wilāyas, the translation "province" would cause the distinction to cease. For [[Sudan]], the term ''state'', and for [[Mauritania]], the term ''region'' is used.
* [[Provinces of Algeria]]
* [[Provinces of Oman]]
* [[Regions of Mauritania]]
* [[States of Sudan]]
* [[Governorates of Tunisia]]

The [[governorates of Iraq]] ([[muhafazah]]) are sometimes translated as provinces, in contrast to official Iraqi documents and the general use for other Arab countries. This conflicts somehow with the general translation for ''muhafazah'' ([[governorate]]) and ''wilāyah'' (province).

===China===
In the ethnically-diverse [[Xinjiang]] region of northwest China, the seven undifferentiated [[List of prefectures in the People's Republic of China|prefectures]] proper ({{zh|s=地区|p=dìqū}}; that is, not prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, etc.) are translated into the minority [[Uygur language]] as ''Vilayiti'' ({{lang|ug|ۋىلايىتى}}). For the other, more numerous types of [[List of administrative divisions of Xinjiang|administrative divisions in Xinjiang]], however, Uygur uses Russian loanwords like ''oblasti'' or ''rayoni'', in common with other Xinjiang languages like [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]. 

===Islamic State===
The self-proclaimed [[Al-Dawlah al-Islāmīyah|Islamic State]] (formerly of Iraq and Syria; Daesh, ISIS, IS or ISIL) [[Administrative divisions of ISIL|organizes its territory]] under first-level administrative divisions called ''wilayat''. As of March 2015, it governs 20 vilayat: 10 in Iraq, 9 in Syria, and one, ''Al-Furat Wilayat'' ("[[Euphrates]] Province") that straddles both sides of the former border. Other than for internal governance, the Islamic State [[ISIL territorial claims|claims territory all over the world]] and cooperates with [[Islamic terror]] organizations while fashioning them wilayat of the ISIS center. For example, [[Boko Haram]] calls itself "''Wilāyat Gharb Ifrīqīyyah''", meaning "The Islamic State's West Africa Province".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redanalysis.org/2015/05/04/understanding-the-islamic-states-system-structure-and-wilayat/|title=Understanding the Islamic State's System - Structure and Wilayat|date=2015-05-04|first=Helene|last=Lavoix|publisher=Red Team Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya and Tanzania===
In Kenya, the term ''wilaya'' is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term which refers to the administrative districts into which provinces are divided.
* [[Districts of Kenya]]
* [[Districts of Tanzania]]

===Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines===
In [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''wilayah'' or ''wilāya'' is a general word meaning "territory", "area" or "region".

In [[Malaysia]], the term
* ''Wilayah Persekutuan'', often shortened to "Wilayah" in colloquial speech, refers to the three [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|federal territories]] under direct control of the federal government: [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]].
* ''Wilayah Ekonomi Pantai Timur'', is translated as [[East Coast Economic Region]]

In [[Philippines]], the term
* ''Wilāya sin Lupa' Sūg'' refers to the province of [[Sulu]], Philippines.

===Ottoman Empire===
{{main|Vilayets of the Ottoman Empire}}
Traditionally the provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were known as ''eyâlet''s, but beginning in 1864, they were gradually restructured as smaller ''vilâyet''s—the Turkish pronunciation of the Arabic word ''wilāyah''. Most were subdivided into [[sanjak]]s.

The current [[provinces of Turkey]] are called ''il'' in Turkish.

===Central Asia and Caucasus===
The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for ''province'' (''velâyat'') is still used in several similar forms in [[Central Asia]]n countries:
* [[Provinces of Afghanistan]] ({{lang-ps|ولايت}} ''wilāyat'', plural: ولايتونه ''wilāyatuna''), subdivided into [[Districts of Afghanistan|districts]] ({{lang-ps|ولسوالۍ}} ''wuləswāləi'' or {{lang-fa|ولسوالی}} ''wolaswālī'')
* [[Provinces of Tajikistan]] (singular: viloyat, plural: viloyatho), subdivided into districts ({{lang-tg|ноҳия}}, ''[[nohiya]]'' or {{lang-ru|район}}, ''raion'')
* [[Provinces of Turkmenistan]] (singular: welaýat, plural: welaýatlar), subdivided into districts ({{lang-tk|etrap}})
* [[Provinces of Uzbekistan]] (singular: viloyat, plural: viloyatlar), subdivided into districts ({{lang-uz|tuman|script=Latn}})

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]] the divisions of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were called ''[[oblast]]s'' and ''[[raion]]s'', using [[Russian language|Russian]] terminology.

In the [[Tsez language]], the districts of [[Dagestan]] are also referred to as "вилайат" (''wilayat''), plural "вилайатйоби" (''wilayatyobi''). But the term "район" (''[[raion|rayon]]''), plural "районйаби" (''rayonyabi'') is also used.

[[Caucasus Emirate]], a self-proclaimed successor state to the unrecognized [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], is divided into vilayats.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], the word is also used unofficially.

===South Asia===
In [[Urdu]], the term ''Vilayat'' is used to refer to any foreign country. As an adjective ''Vilayati'' is used to indicate an imported article or good. In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the term ''Vilayat'' and ''Vilayati'' further change to ''bilet'' and ''bileti'' (archaic ''bilaiti''), referring exclusively to Britain and British-made. The British slang term [[blighty]] derives from this word, via the fact that the foreign British were referred to using this word during the time of the British Raj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Other Indian words include blighty ('one's home country', from the Hindi word 'bilayati' meaning 'foreign', whence 'British')|title=The Empire Strikes Back?

The '''Öñge language''' (also spelled ''Ongee, Eng,'' or ''Ung'') is one of two known [[Ongan languages]] within the [[Andaman languages|Andaman]] family. It is spoken by the [[Onge]] people in [[Little Andaman Island]] in [[India]].

== History ==
[[File:Andamanese comparative distribution.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Andamanese tribes in early 1800s and 2004; the Onge areas are in blue.]]
In the 18th century the Onge were distributed across [[Little Andaman Island]] and the nearby islands, with some territory and camps established on [[Rutland Island]] and the southern tip of [[South Andaman Island]]. Originally restive, they were pacified by [[Maurice Vidal Portman|M. V. Portman]] in the 1890s.{{clarify|reason=In what way were they 'restive'?  What does it mean that they were 'pacified'?  These terms seem like obscure euphemisms for some kind of violent conflict.|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;George Weber, ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter8/text8.htm the Tribes]''. Chapter 8 in ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/text-group-BodyChapters.htm The andamanese]''. Accessed on 2012-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="portman"/&gt; By the end of the 19th century they sometimes visited the [[South Brother Island, India|South]] and [[North Brother Island, India|North Brother Island]]s to catch [[sea turtle]]s; at the time, those islands seemed to be the boundary between their territory and the range of the [[Great Andamanese people]] further north.&lt;ref name="portman"&gt;M. V. Portman (1899), ''[http://booksnow2.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/22/historyofourrela02portuoft/historyofourrela02portuoft_bw.pdf A history of our Relations with the Andamanese]'', Volume II. Office of the Government Printing, Calcutta, India.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the surviving members (less than 100) are confined to two reserve camps on Little Andaman, Dugong Creek in the northeast and South Bay.

The Onge were semi-nomadic and fully dependent on [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] for food.

The Onge are one of the aboriginal peoples ([[adivasi]]) of India. Together with the other Andamanese tribes and a few other isolated groups elsewhere in [[East Asia]], they comprise the [[Negrito]] peoples, believed to be remnants of a very early migration out of [[Africa]].

==Status==
Önge used to be spoken throughout Little Andaman as well as in smaller islands to the north - and possibly in the southern tip of [[South Andaman]] island. Since the middle of the 19th century, with the arrival of the British in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], and, after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]], the massive inflow of Indian settlers from the mainland, the number of Onge speakers has steadily declined, although a moderate increase has been observed in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.combatlaw.org/information.php?article_id=23&amp;issue_id=9|title=The Colonisation of Little Andaman Island|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are only 94 native speakers of Onge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=oon|title=''Önge language'' - The Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; confined to a single settlement in the northeast of Little Andaman island (see map below), making it an [[endangered language]].

=== Demographic troubles ===
The Onge are one of the least fertile people in the world. About 40% of the married couples are sterile. Onge women rarely become pregnant before the age of 28.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FPX6wiuZ3ikC&amp;pg=PA44&lt;/ref&gt; Infant and child mortality is in the range of 40%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/csq/article/ecocide-or-genocide-the-onge-andaman-islands&lt;/ref&gt; The Onge's [[net reproductive index]] is 0.91.&lt;ref name="gob"&gt;A. N. Sharma (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WEztW7c0CqQC&amp;pg=PA64 Tribal Development in the Andaman Islands]'', page 64. Sarup &amp; Sons, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; The net reproductive index among the Great Andamanese is 1.40.&lt;ref&gt;A. N.

/ʔ/? (c.f. Blevins (2007:161))

Blevins (2007:160-161) states that /c, ɟ/ are actually affricates, and that retroflexes may or may not be phonemic.

/kʷ/ delabializes to /k/ before /u, o/.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=161" /&gt;

Phonemic /d/ surfaces as [r] intervocalically, while arguably some words have phonemic /r/ which alternates with surface [r, l, j].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonotactics===
Words may be monosyllabic or longer, even in [[content word]]s (unlike in the closely related [[Jarawa language (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]]).&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=161" /&gt; Words may begin with consonants or vowels, and maximal syllables are of the form CVC.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=161" /&gt; All Onge words end in vowels, except for imperatives, e.g. ''kaʔ'' 'give'.

Consonant-final stems in Jarawa often have cognates with final ''e'' in Onge, e.g. Jarawa ''iŋ'', Onge ''iŋe'' 'water'; Jarawa ''inen'', Onge ''inene'' 'foreigner'; Jarawa ''dag'', Onge ''dage'' 'coconut'.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=161" /&gt; Historically these vowels must have been excrescent, as nonetymological word-final e doesn't surface when number markers are suffixed, and the definite article (-''gi'' after etymological consonants, -''i'' after etymological vowels, due to lenition) appears as -''i'' after etymological ''e'' but as -''gi'' after excrescent ''e'', e.g. ''daŋe'' → ''daŋe-gi'' 'tree; dugout'; ''kue'' → ''kue-i'' 'pig'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NC clusters sometimes optionally reduce to single C, e.g. {{IPA|iɲɟo-}}~{{IPA|iɟo-}} 'to drink' (c.f. Jarawa {{IPA|-iɲɟo}}).&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=163"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiced obstruents may optionally nasalize in syllable onset when the coda is nasal, e.g. ''bone''/''mone'' 'resin, resin torch' (c.f. Jarawa ''pone'' 'resin, resin torch').&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=163" /&gt;

===Morphophonemics===
Clusters across morpheme boundaries simplify to homorganic sequences, including [[geminate]]s, which may occur after word final -e drops, e.g. ''daŋe'' 'tree, dugout canoe' → ''dandena'' 'two canoes'; ''umuge'' 'pigeon' → ''umulle'' 'pigeons'.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2007|p=161" /&gt;
