      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">The '''1925 Indian riots''' refers to the sixteen communal riots which occurred throughout [[British India]]. Reported as being among the worst were in March in [[Delhi]], during September in [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]], at [[Arvi, Wardha|Arvi]] in the [[Wardha district]] and in [[Solapur]].{{sfn|Simon|1930|p=100}}

== Aligarh ==
The Aligarh riot occurred on 22 September in the [[United Provinces of British India]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Of the sixteen communal riots that occurred that year, it was counted as one of the most severe. The [[The Times|London Times]] wrote two stories on the riots.{{sfn|Brass|2005|p=70}} The riot, was confined to Aligarh{{sfn|Bapu|2012|p=173}} which is in the top five of most riot prone cities in India.{{sfn|Gayer|2012|p=136}} According to a report from the [[Singapore Free Press]], on 24 September 1925, it had been said the rioting was caused by [[Mohammedan]] throwing stones at some Hindus during the festival of [[Ramlila]], the Hindus retaliated and in the ensuing violence sixty Muslim men and women were injured and twelve Hindus were hospitalized.{{sfn|Free Press|1925}}

[[Sheikh Abdullah]] speaking at a [[Indian Union Muslim League|Muslim League]] conference at Aligarh likened the year-long violence to the [[Crusades]], arguing that the most serious danger that Muslims had ever had to deal with was the current Hindu resurgence.{{sfn|Cell|2002|p=135}} The official number of those killed in the riot was six, four Muslims and two Hindus.{{sfn|Gayer|2012|p=136}}{{sfn|Brass|2005|p=71}}

'''Adeline Palmier Wagoner''' (February 14, 1868 – April 21, 1929) was an American volunteer organizational leader and author. She served as president of the [[St. Louis]], Missouri, branch of the National Plant, Flower and Fruit Guild, a charity for the poor and afflicted, and as president of the Shakespeare Tercentenary Society.

==Early life==
Adeline Palmier Myers was born on February 1, 1868, in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33S7-95Q5-9S8C?cc=1923888|title=Family Search|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Frederick Myers and Louisa Palmier (b. 1837). Myers's mother wrote the words for ''Let Us Sing of Old Missouri'', music by Johanna Mohr, arranged by Esther M. Harkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions, Part 3, Volume 10, Issue 1|date=1915|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjXQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers had one sister who married Walter Dray, of [[Chicago]]. Wagoner's mother was the daughter of Michel Beaulier Palmier (1800–1851), granddaughter of Jean Beaulieu (dit Palmier), a captain of the [[War of 1812]], and great-granddaughter of Michel Joseph Beaulieu, captain of the first regularly organized militia of Illinois, and Angelique Chauvin, daughter of a French officer of [[Fort de Chartres]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Daughters of the American Revolution|journal=Lineage Book|date=1927|volume=97|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZEBAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2017|author1=Revolution|first1=Daughters of the American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers graduated from the Central High School and the Normal High School. She was elected class historian, representative, and wrote and delivered the class poem.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; As a young girl, she was a prominent member of the McCullagh Dramatic Club, of which Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] was president, and [[Wayman C. McCreery]], secretary. Myers played the principal parts with [[Augustus Thomas]], William Beaumont Smith, Guy Lindsley, and others who laters became professionals in the theater world. She took the leading part in one of Thomas' first plays, ''The Cattle King''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; She also assisted in raising money for the [[YWCA|Young Women's Christian Association]], as well as taken part in carnivals given for the benefit of hospitals, asylums, etc.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Career==
Adeline Wagoner was the vice-president and recording secretary of the Chapter 0 of the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]], founded on January 21, 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clapp|first=Stella|title=Out Of The Heart: A Century of P.E.O. 1869–1969|publisher=The P.E.O. Sisterhood|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a seven-member sorority at Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. It was the second sorority to be founded in the U.S.&lt;ref name="wolf-wendel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolf-Wendel |first=Lisa |author2=Sheila Pedigo |editor=Barbara K. Townsend |title=Two-Year Colleges for Women and Minorities  |year=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]]  |isbn=0-8153-3173-8  |pages=57 |chapter=Two-Year Women's Colleges }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In St. Louis, Wagoner was the president of The National Plant, Flower and Fruit Guild, whose motto was "When we can and what we can". The members of the guild headed by Wagoner asked for donation of fruit, flowers, magazines, delicacies for the table, clothing, etc. These articles were then distributed regularly, and particularly on anniversaries and holidays.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

In 1913 the guild distributed 21,000 bunches of flowers, 36 bushels of fruit, 16 gallons of strawberries, 500 glasses of jelly, hundreds of magazines, 200 potted plants, and different articles of clothing, such as shawls, stockings, and handkerchiefs, Christmas boxes and bags by the hundreds, and a great quantity of tobacco. In the summer of 1913 they distributed seeds to children to plant back-yard gardens, open-lot gardens, and window boxes. Eight prizes were awarded to the best arranged window boxes.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Florence Putnam was in charge of the Flowers department. Some of the other women who were most active in assisting Wagoner, and who hold the important offices in the local organization, were Mrs. Frederick Kreismann, Mrs. James McCourtney, Mrs. H.H. Wagoner ([[Sophronia Wilson Wagoner]]), Mrs. H.H. Evans, Mrs. U.L. Clark, Mrs. William Huppert, Mrs. Relle Forse, Mrs. Hugh Romanoski, Mrs. A.A. Flanders, Mrs. E.J. Kramer and Mrs. J. Rossman.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

The Guild did also volunteering work at the Poor House, later City Infirmary or [[St. Mary's Infirmary]] (currently a [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Downtown and Downtown West St. Louis|NRHP place]] in Downtown St. Louis): they brought tobacco, pencils, pads of paper, shoe strings, knives, etc., for the men; in the woman's department they put potted plants by each bed, and a little basket of sewing materials with a box of cake, candy and fruit, also quilt pieces and little ornaments for the hair and dress; for the consumptive ward, where the most critical patients were kept, they brough sunshine and angel cakes; vegetable plants for the gardens were donated by the City Workhouse gardens.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Wagoner was the president of the Shakespeare Tercentenary Society, based at the Planters Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Register of women's clubs|date=1924|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=634fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honorary president was Dr. Denton J. Snider, a Shakespeare scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missouri School Journal|journal=Missouri School Journal|date=1922|volume=39|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGQ0AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a study club, dedicated to a consideration of Snider's Hegelian interpretation of Shakespeare, it became, after Wagoner took over the management, more and more social in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pochmann|first1=Henry A.|title=German Culture in America|date=1957|page=289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQPVnrXDNbEC|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 Wagoner curated the exhibition ''Shakespeare Tercentenary Celebration'' at the Scruggs-Vandervoort-Barney auditorium, St. Louis, of which she also curated the catalogue: curious, instructive and beautiful objects pertaining to Shakespeare and the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jansohn|first1=Christa|last2=Mehl|first2=Dieter|title=Shakespeare Jubilees: 1769–2014|date=2015|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxq5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=5 August 2017|isbn=9783643905901}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also vice-president of the National Shakespeare Federation.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|journal=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=1929|page=44|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/142059334/|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1917, ''World News'' published ''Little Orphant Annie's Tale of the War'' by Wagoner, dedicated to the National Council of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Little Orphant Annie's Tale of the War|journal=World News|date=1917|volume=30|issue=135|url=http://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=TWN19171206.1.6|accessdate=5 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, Wagoner took part in the [[Liberty bond]] campaign and volunteered for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt; In 1916 Wagoner received a letter from Elisabeth Bass, secretary of the National Woman's Liberty Loan Committee, extending congratulations and thanks for her efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fur Trade Review|journal=Fur Trade Review|volume=45|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iqw6AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2017|date=February 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1921, Wagoner chaired the celebration commemorating Missouri's admission to the Union and was secretary of the Lafayette Celebration Committee.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

In 1921 Wagoner contributed the essay ''A man for all ages'' for the commemorative meeting of the early Saint Louis movement in philosophy, psychology, literature, art and education, in honor of Dr. Denton J.

Arcedio Alvarez Quintero (born in 1950) was a convicted child molester and sex offender from Mariquita, Colombia. Throughout his years in Mariquita he practiced farming with his family, becoming a farmer himself as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diarioya.es/content/arcedio-%C3%A1lvarez-padre-de-los-11-hijos-de-su-hija|title=Arcedio Alvarez, padre de los 11 hijos de su hija|last=|first=|date=|website=Diarioya.es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Alvarez Quintero was prosecuted for molesting and abusing his biological daughter for years, resulting in 14 children, 6 of whom died due to malnutrition and lack of proper care. Alvarez Quintero claimed that his crimes were part of “God’s plan”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/colombian-fritzl-tells-daughter-their-sex-is-gods-will-20090329-9fyv.html|title=Colombian 'Fritzl' tells daughter their sex is 'God's will'|last=|first=|date=|website=smh.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore denied any biological relationship to the victim, but this was later disproved after confirmation of his biological relationship to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-04-22/paternity-confirmed-in-colombia-incest-case/1658388|title=Paternity confirmed in Colombian incest case|last=|first=|date=|website=abc.net.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez Quintero became known as the Monster of Mariquita, and the Colombia Fritzl, after the infamous Austrian murderer, rapist, and child molester, [[Josef Fritzl]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/international/print-edition/articulo/the-daughter-of-the-colombian-monster/102572-3|title=The Daughter of the Colombian Monster|last=|first=|date=|website=semana.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
After the death of Alvarez Quintero’s wife, he began to abuse his 5-year-old daughter Nidia. The rapes are believed to have started when she was about 7 years old, and continued for roughly 26 years,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://colombiareports.com/monster-of-mariquita-found-guilty-of-incest-and-rape/|title='Monster of Mariquita' found guilty of incest and rape|last=Alsema|first=Adriaan|date=|website=Colombiareports.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 14 pregnancies, the first when Nidia was just 13 years old.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/03/30/colombia.incest.charges/index.html|title=Colombian father accused of decades long incest, rape|last=Muse|first=Toby|date=|website=cnn.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 14 children to come from this abuse, 6 of them died before the  prosecution due to denial of medical care by Alvarez Quintero, and of the 8 surviving children, the oldest was 19 years old at the time, and the youngest was only a few months old.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Alvarez Quintero also never let his daughter leave their home during the time of the abuse and would often tell her that their relationship was simply “God’s will”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7970414.stm|title=Incest accusations shock Colombia|last=|first=|date=|website=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children grew, Alvarez Quintero began to assault his young daughters and may have been grooming his sons to do the same.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Victims ==
Arcedio Alvarez’s victims included his daughter Alba Nidia, 35 at the time of the trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://colombiareports.com/the-story-of-alba-nidia-and-her-monstruous-dad/|title=The story of Alba Nidia and her monstrous dad|last=Alsema|first=Adriaan|date=|website=colombiareports.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her children by him, his grandchildren. Six of their children died due to lack of needed medical attention when Alvarez refused to take them to the hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alba Nidia herself was abused from age 5; although Alvarez reportedly taught her to read and write, he also convinced her that his abuse was acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alba Nidia grew up poor in a small home in central Colombian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-incest/colombia-rocked-by-father-daughter-incest-case-idUSTRE52R2BW20090329|title=Colombia rocked by father-daughter incest case|last=Bronstein|first=Hugh|date=|website=reuters.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little information exists about her education, but she did mention in one of the reports that her father taught her how to read and write &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/are-there-more-dungeon-dads|title=Are there more Dungeon Dads?|last=Latza Nadeau|first=Barbie|date=|website=thedailybeast.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died when she was young.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her father abused and had sexual relation lying to her and telling her what they were doing was right since she was 5 after her mother died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alba Nidia was the only daughter of Arcedio Alvarez (Monster of Mariquita).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her children were their father’s grandchildren as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
Arcedio Alvarez was caught and arrested in March 2009 and became a convicted child molester after being charged with the heinous crimes against his daughter, whose sexual abuse and mental scarring had gone on for over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/09/17/colombia/1316211657.html|title=Muere en prision el violador colombiano que procreo ocho hijos con su hija|last=|first=|date=|website=elmundo.es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Alba came forward in 2009 about what had been happening to her ever since she was young, investigation revealed that most of the town where they lived knew of the suspicious things occurring and never said anything about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagina7.cl/notas/sociedad/2017/02/04/arcedio-alvarez-el-monstruo-de-mariquita-violo-y-encerro-por-30-anos-a-su-propia-hija.shtml|title=Arcedio Alvarez, el "Monstruo de Mariquita": violo y encerro por 30 anos a su propia hija|last=Schmidlin|first=Cristopher|date=|website=pagina7.cl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation began when councilwoman Gilma Jimenez, brought to light the horrible conditions Alba and her children were living in with her father and how poor their health was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elespectador.com/articulo131959-asi-se-descubrio-arcedio-alvarez-agresor-sexual-de-su-propia-hija|title=Asi se descubrio a arcedio Alvarez, aggressor sexual de su propia hija|last=Garzon Roa|first=Olga Lucia|date=|website=elespectador.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this first came to light, Arcedio repeatedly claimed that Alba was only an adopted daughter and that they had agreed to their strange relationship. However, several lab tests proved that Alba Nidia was undoubtedly Arcedio’s daughter.

During the investigation, Alvarez needed police protection when attending his court dates due to the severity of his crimes and the hatred the community felt toward him. Alvarez continued to plead not guilty, claiming that Alba was adopted and that they held no biological connection at all. This case and his crimes led to changes in the Colombian law requiring those who have raped children to go to prison for life. Alvarez was found guilty of all his crimes against his daughter and her children, and was eventually sentenced to a minimum of fifteen years in prison.

'''Asian Indians''', also known as '''East Indians''', are citizens of [[Belize]] of [[Indian people|Indian]] ancestry. The community made up 3.9% of the population of Belize in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indian subcontinent|Asian Indians]] began arriving in Belize in the 1880s as part of the [[Indian indenture system]] set up by the [[British Raj|British Indian]] government after slavery was abolished. Initially coming in as indentured, many of them stayed on to work the sugar plantations and were joined by other Indian immigrants. [[Indian subcontinent|Indians]] are spread out over many villages and towns primarily in the Corozal and Toledo districts and live in reasonably compact rural communities. They are fairly well integrated into the Belizean population through intermarriage. However, they are still identifiable through their physiognomy and are known as 'Hindus'. These set of Indians were almost entirely composed of [[Bhojpuri people|Bhojpuris]], [[Awadhi people|Awadhis]], [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthanis]], and other [[Hindustani people|Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu)]]- speaking people of the [[Hindi Belt|Hindustani Belt]] in [[North India]]. A minority of indentured laborers were from [[South India]].

In 1907, the Canadian Government made an unsuccessful attempt to transfer Indian independence activists residing in the province of British Columbia to Belize (then known as [[British Honduras]]). A Canadian delegation led by the chief clerk of the Canadian Ministry of the Interior Harkin, and a small Indian delegation including Teja Singh traveled to British Honduras in November 1907 to determine if conditions were suitable for the move. Upon his return to Canada, Teja Singh stated that Indians were being sent to Honduras for slave-labour and claimed that Canadian officials had attempted to bribe the Indian delegation to secure a positive report. The Canadian government blamed Teja Singh's statements for the failure of the proposed transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Noakes|first2=Jeremy|title=Intelligence and International Relations, 1900-1945|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859892438|page=57|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=z5Q_WpiT9ocC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bomb The Suburbs''''' is a collection of essays by [[William Upski Wimsatt]], a former [[Graffiti#Tag|graffiti tagger]]. It is a mix of storytelling, journalism, photojournalism and [[original research]], on a broad range of topics, such as [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], [[hip hop culture]], [[youth activism]], graffiti, and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. It was photoedited by artist Margarita Certeza Garcia, and published in 1994 by Subway &amp; Elevated Press, a division of [[Soft Skull Press]], with {{ISBN|0-9643855-0-3}}, and republished in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/oclc/33311040&amp;tab=editions Worldcat entry]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition had 3,000 copies.

''Bomb The Suburbs'' led to subsequent books and [[political activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kristin V. Jones | publisher=[[The Nation]] | title=Who Let the Punks Out? | date=2004-05-20 | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040607/jones | accessdate=2006-09-22}}

{{expand language|topic=|langcode=pt|otherarticle=Casa-Grande &amp; Senzala|date=January 2014}}
Published in 1933, '''''Casa-Grande e Senzala''''' ({{lang-en|The Masters and the Slaves}}) is a book by [[Gilberto Freyre]], about the formation of [[Brazil]]ian society. The ''[[Casa grande (sugar plantation)|casa-grande]]'' ("big house") refers to the slave owner's residence on a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]], where whole towns were owned and managed by one man. The ''senzala'' ("[[slave quarters]]") refers to the dwellings of the black working class, where they originally worked as slaves, and later as servants.&lt;ref name=musejhu&gt;{{cite web|last=Barickman|first=B. J.|title=Revisiting the Casa-grande: Plantation and Cane-Farming Households in Early Nineteenth-Century Bahia|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hahr/summary/v084/84.4barickman.html|publisher=muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite web|title=The Masters and the Slaves [Casa-Grande &amp;amp; Senzala]: A Study ...|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2507653?uid=16951160&amp;uid=3738752&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=16821840&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=67&amp;uid=363776971&amp;uid=62&amp;sid=21103326778311|publisher=jstor.org|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h-net&gt;{{cite web|last=Veracini|first=Lorenzo|title=A.

The book deals with race/class separation and [[miscegenation]] and is generally considered a classic of modern cultural anthropology. In [[Gilberto Freyre|Freyre's]] opinion, the hierarchy imposed by those in the Casa-Grande was an expression of a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. In this book the author refutes the idea that Brazilians were an "inferior race" because of race-mixing. He points to the positive elements that permeated Brazilian culture because of miscegenation (especially among the Portuguese, Indians, and Africans). Portugal,  like Brazil, is described as being culturally and racially influenced by "an energetic infusion of Moorish and Negro blood, the effects of which persist to this day in the Portuguese people and the Portuguese character".&lt;ref&gt;Juan E.

'''Charles W. Bullard''' was an American criminal. Known as '''Piano Charley''', he became a notorious safecracker. His name derived from his skill as a musician.&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Richard|title=Great Robberies|year=2001|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of his criminal partnerships was with [[Adam Worth]]. In 1869, together with [[Fredericka Mandelbaum]] and others, Worth helped Bullard to escape from prison where he was serving a sentence for stealing $100,000 worth of goods from the [[Hudson River Railway Express]]. For the escape, Mandelbaum and her associates rented an office across the street from the prison and tunneled into Bullard's cell, bribing two guards to keep them quiet.&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=J. North|title=King of Heists: The Sensational Bank Robbery of 1878 That Shocked America|year=2009|publisher=Globe Pequot|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that year, on November 20, Bullard and Worth worked together to rob the vault of [[Boylston National Bank]] in Boston. They escaped with an estimated $200,000. However, aware of the intense police interest in the crime, they were forced to move to England and live under false names.&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Richard|title=Great Robberies|year=2001|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church attendance''' is a central religious practice for many [[Christians]]; some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Catholic Church]] require church attendance on the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday); the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches [[first-day Sabbatarianism]],&lt;ref name="Wigley1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigley|first=John|title=The Rise and Fall of the Victorian Sunday|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719007941|page=800|quote=Following the formulation of the Westminster Confession, fully fledged Sabbatarianism quickly took root too, being embodied in an Act of 1661, then spreading northwards and westwards as the Highlands were opened up after the '45, during which time the doctrine lost its original force and vigour in the Lowlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus proclaiming the duty of public worship in keeping with the [[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name="McKim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=More Presbyterian Questions, More Presbyterian Answers: Exploring Christian Faith|year=2011|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664503086|page=72|quote=The Westminster Confession urges a strict observance of the Lord's Day as a day of rest and worship, away from "works, words, and thoughts" about "worldly employments and recreations." The whole time is to be devoted to "public and private exercises of [God's) worship, and in duties of necessity and mercy" (''BC'' 6.119). In the United States, many "blue laws" relating to Sunday originated from this general prescription observed by American Puritans of the Reformed tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The General Rules of the Methodist Church also requires "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God".&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1791, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] required attendance at [[church service]]s of the [[Church of England]] (the mother Church of the [[Anglican Communion]] and a [[state Church]]) at least twice a year.&lt;ref name="Day2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Cathy|title=Wiltshire Marriage Patterns 1754-1914: Geographical Mobility, Cousin Marriage and Illegitimacy|date=26 September 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443867924|page=198|quote=Attendance at an Anglican church service at least twice a year was a legal requirement for all people until 1791 and some parishioners endured the minimum church attendance requirement in order to avoid a fine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, all major branches of [[Christianity]], however, encourage church attendance, with one Christian apostolate providing the following biblical imperatives: 
{{quote|The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth ({{Bibleverse|Acts|2:42|NRSV}}; {{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:25|NRSV}}). Church is the place where believers can love one another ({{Bibleverse|1 John|4:12|NRSV}}), encourage one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|3:13|NRSV}}), "spur" one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:24|NRSV}}), serve one another ({{Bibleverse|Galatians|5:13|NRSV}}), instruct one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|15:14|NRSV}}), honor one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|12:10|NRSV}}), and be kind and compassionate to one another ({{Bibleverse|Ephesians|4:32|NRSV}}).&lt;ref name="Editor2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Houdmann|first=S. |title=Got Questions?: Bible Questions Answered|date=24 April 2014|language=English|isbn=9781490832739|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[Lutheran]] Christian theologian [[:da:Balthasar Münter|Balthasar Münter]] stated that church attendance is the "foundation for the Christian life" as "the [[Christian Bible]] and the [[sacraments]] provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of [[backsliding]], as well as offers "the [[Communion (Christian)|company of other believers]]".&lt;ref name="Roos2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Merethe|title=Enlightened Preaching: Balthasar Münter’s Authorship 1772-1793|date=2013-03-08|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004249899|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from the European Social Survey in 2012 around a third of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christians]] say they attend services once a month or more.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21684679-march-christianity-future-worlds-most-popular-religion-african Christianity and church attendance]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely about two-thirds of [[Christianity in Latin America|Latin American Christians]] and according to the [[World Values Survey]] about 90% of [[Christianity in Africa|African Christians]] (in [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]]) said they attended church regularly.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; The [[Gallup poll|Gallup International]], a self-reporting survey conducted via telephone, indicates that 37% of Americans report that they attend religious services weekly or near-weekly in 2013.&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion: Gallup Historical Trends|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx|website=www.gallup.com|publisher=Gallup, Inc.|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Research Center]] stated, however, that there is a "sharp increase in church attendance around the two most significant Christian holidays, [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/18/when-easter-and-christmas-near-more-americans-search-online-for-church/|title=When Easter and Christmas near, more Americans search online for "church"|last=Kuriakose|first=Noble|date=18 April 2014|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|language=English|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, on Christmas (a [[Principal Feast]] in the [[Anglican Communion]], a [[holy day of obligation]] in the [[Catholic Church]] and a [[Liturgical_calendar_(Lutheran)#Festivals|Festival]] in the [[Lutheran Church]]es), LifeWay Research found that "six out of 10 Americans typically attend church".&lt;ref name="Stetzer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2015/december/what-is-church-attendance-like-during-christmastime-new-dat.html|title=What Is Church Attendance Like During Christmastime?

A survey commissioned by the ''Época Magazine'' in 2005 showed that 29% of [[Brazil]]ians attend church weekly, and indicated that it is lesser than in the United States but higher than in Western Europe and Japan, indeed showing that contrary to the local popular belief, Brazilians of the time could indeed be regarded as a religious people even in practice (though it is ponderable that the growth of the population declaring to be solely irreligious in nationwide censuses grew about 100% between 2000 and 2010, and 200% between 2000 and 2013, from 4% to 12%, and general secularization also grew among the portion of the population that remained religious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR70422-6014,00.html Época – O brasileiro em números {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210647/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEDR70422-6014%2C00.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006, ''Financial Times (FT)/Harris Poll'' conducted online surveyed 12,507 adults over 16 years old in the United States (2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed) and five European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain and Spain). The survey found that only 26% of those polled attended religious services "every week or more often", 9% went "once or twice a month", 21% went "a few times a year", 3% went "once a year", 22% went "less than once a year", and 18% never attend religious services. ''Harris Interactive'' stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to [[sampling error]]s and [[Non-response bias|non-response]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NEWS/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1130 |title=Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country, According to the Latest Financial Times/Harris Poll |publisher=Harrisinteractive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous nearly identical survey by Harris in 2003 found that only 26% of those surveyed attended religious services "every week or more often", 11% went "once or twice a month" 19% went "a few times a year", 4% went "once a year", 16% went "less than once a year", and 25% never attend religious services.

Calculating the church's average weekend attendance is important since it determines the size of a given church. For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes]. ''USA Churches.org''. Accessed on January 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternative definitions, such as house church, simple church, intentional community, were proposed by [[the Barna Group]], an American private consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barna.org/barna-update/congregations/45-new-statistics-on-church-attendance-and-avoidance New Statistics on Church Attendance and Avoidance]. ''Barna Group'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) A narrow definition of a regular church attendee can be viewed as a synonym for a Sunday service visitation, while a broad definition, names as a regular attendee a person who comes to church during three out of eight weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rebecca and Lindy Lowry.

===Attendance by country===
The frequency at which Christians attend church services varies greatly around the world. In some countries weekly attendance at religious services is common among Christians, while in others weekly attendance is rare. The following attendance statistics are mostly based on self-reporting surveys and may not accurately reflect real attendance figures.

==Demographics ==
[[File:Lucia procession.jpg|thumb|250px|A Swedish Christian girl leads a [[Christian procession|church procession]] on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]]]

The [[Pew Research Center]], which conducts the extensive research and information program ''Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life'', has linked regular church attendance with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/5-3/ How Income and Church Attendance Affects Happiness].

A 2005 European Union survey found that religious belief increased with age and was higher among women, those who were leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Iona Institute]] documented increasing church attendance in Ireland, despite sex-abuse scandals that plagued the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="The Iona Institute"&gt;[http://www.ionainstitute.eu/assets/files/Press_Release_by_The_Iona_Institute_2Nov2009-1.pdf ''Press Release by the Iona Institute'', 2 November 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest{{who|date=December 2016}} the rise is due to the effects of the economic recession.

Research shows that there is a correlation between church attendance and the level of education. For instance, in a Pew Research study from 1996, approximately 34% of high school dropouts went to church on a typical Sunday, while 44% of those with a college degree or higher did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/96KOHUT/96KOHUT_Var63_1.asp Religion and Politics Survey, 1996]. ''The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)''. Accessed on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of married individuals attended church on a typical Sunday, compared with 29% of divorced and 31% of never-married individuals. While it is likely that the well-educated and married might over-report their church attendance more often, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that they have maintained a stronger church-going identity than other Americans. A number of studies have been undertaken to examine the topic of [[religiosity and intelligence]] and religiosity and education. Studies also indicate that there is a higher rate of church attendance among married couples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Influence of parents ===

Several research studies in the USA and Europe found that church attendance practices of parents, especially fathers, can be highly influential in forming the future church attendance practices of their children.

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Fertility and Family Survey]] was commissioned by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)]] to enable Switzerland to take part in this international project launched by the [[UNECE Population Activities Unit]]. The survey was conducted between October 1994 and May 1995, with the results being published in 2000 by the [[Council of Europe]].  The results are representative of Switzerland's permanent resident population aged 20–49 and presented in the table below.&lt;ref name="HaugCourbage2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Haug|author2=Philippe Wanner|title=The Demographic Characteristics of National Minorities in Certain European States|url=https://book.coe.int/eur/en/population-studies-series/1949-the-demographic-characteristics-of-national-minorities-in-certain-european-states-volume-2-population-studies-no-31.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Population Studies No. 31|volume=Volume 2|date=January 2000|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Germany|isbn=978-92-871-4159-0|page=154|chapter=IV.

A non-practicing mother with a regular father will see a minimum of two-thirds of her children ending up at church. In contrast, a non-practicing father with a regular mother will see two-thirds of his children not attending church. If his wife is similarly irregular that figure rises to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Men &amp; Church | journal = Touchstone | date = June 2003 | first = Robbie | last = Low | volume = 16 | issue = 5| id=| url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-05-024-v |publisher= The Fellowship of St. James| accessdate = 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egan |first=Richard |url=http://www.ad2000.com.au/church_attendance_the_family_feminism_and_the_declining_role_of_fatherhood_september_2002 |title=Church Attendance: The family, feminism and the declining role of fatherhood |journal=AD2000 |volume=15 |issue=8 |date=September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American study found similar results on the impact of fathers:&lt;ref name="BruceBruce1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruce|first1=Robert|last2=Bruce|first2=Debra Fulghum|title=Becoming Spiritual Soulmates With Your Child|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y90JAAAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers |location=Nashville |isbn=978-0-8054-6269-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When both parents attend [[Sunday school]], 72% of the children attend Sunday school when grown.
*When only the father attends Sunday school, 55% of the children attend when grown.
*When only the mother attends Sunday school, 15% of the children attend when grown.
*When neither parent attends Sunday school, only 6% of the children attend when grown.

An unrelated survey in the USA also found fathers to be highly influential in church attendance.

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.&lt;ref name="Christian Research Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801010204/http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000242.cgi Why People Don't Go to Church... ]. Accessed through Internet Archives on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Research across 65 different nations showed that out of 20 advanced industrial countries - 16 demonstrated a declining rate of monthly church attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Baker | first2 = Wayne E. | year = 2000 | title = Modernization, Cultural Change, and the Persistence of Traditional Values | url = http://my.fit.edu/~gabrenya/cultural/readings/Inglehart-Baker-2000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 19–51 | doi=10.2307/2657288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the ''Christianity Today Magazine'' emphasized that at least in America church attendance since the 1990s has remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Baker. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/novemberweb-only/145-42.0.html Is Church Attendance Declining?], 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 50% of Americans replied that God is very important in their lives, comparing with 40% of Irish, 28% of Canadians, 26% of Spaniards, 21% of Australians, and 10% of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Michele. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BFWlhQRhQ6gC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Church+attendance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmXcUpOHKvK_sQTOj4H4Cg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Church%20attendance&amp;f=false Handbook of the Sociology of Religion]. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percent of Americans who regularly attend religious services has fluctuated over time, but presently is at a low point.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx Five Key Findings on Religion in the US], Gallup Poll (December 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gallup Poll]] surveys, the yearly aggregate of those who answer "yes" to the question "Did you, yourself, happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days, or not?" was 36% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx Religion], Gallup Poll (last accessed May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very long-running Gallup question: "In 1939, when Gallup first asked this question, 41% said 'yes.' That percentage dropped to 37% in 1940 and rose to 39% in 1950. It continued to climb, reaching as high as 49% at multiple points in the 1950s. Attendance then settled down to figures around 40% for decades, before dropping to 36%" beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name="Newport"/&gt;

The decline in church attendance is more pronounced in developed European countries, where it is suggested that the secular culture overrides interest in religion. In Poland Church attendance has declined from more than 50% in 1979 to 40% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Praktyki niedzielne Polaków (dominicantes)|url = http://iskk.pl/kosciolnaswiecie/211-praktyki-niedzielne-polakow-dominicantes.html|website = iskk.pl|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the early 1990s, American sociologists Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves found that weekly attendance at Protestant and Catholic churches in one rural county in [[Ohio]] was only about 20%, whereas self-reported church attendance was 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadaway |first1=C.

Kirk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings point to a bigger issue as many people in the world may be over-reporting church attendance because of their self-perception and identity as churchgoing people, indicating a certain psychological aspect to the over-reporting of church attendance. Although surveys of church attendance are aimed to study religious behavior, many respondents view them as questions about their identity. This is especially true among Americans who consider themselves "regular churchgoers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html The Church Attendance Gap: A look at two older studies whose findings should be taken more seriously] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130031340/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html |date=2013-11-30 }}.

The '''Church of Hakeem'''  is a [[new religious movement|new religion]] of [[Christian]] inspiration, based in [[California]], that was founded by the [[preacher]] [[Hakeem Abdul Rasheed]]. His [[doctrine]] states that the money earned comes from [[God]] as a result of a religious spiritual awakening. Its practice consists in delivering, within 70 to 90 days, donations increased up to 400% percent. In the congregations, the [[pastor]] Hakeem exhorted the faithful to stop having doubts and negative thoughts. The leaders of the church committed the [[crime]] of diverting the funds, and were judged by the american justice. Members and contributors recovered the funds. The founder was charged with fraud charges by mail to request more funds. He was also sentenced to five days in prison, for failing to comply with the order to give the information requested. This decision was paralyzed on the basis of the [[right to privacy]] and the [[freedom of association|right of association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/663/843/147187/|title=United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

Indeed, the mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States at the top of the incarceration lists. If lists were compiled based on annual admissions to prison per capita, several European countries would outpace the United States. But American prison stays are much longer, so the total incarceration rate is higher."

In the United States, [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women make up more than one tenth]] of the whole prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlen|first=Pat|title=Analysing Women's Imprisonment|year=2004|publisher=Willan Publishing|location=Portland|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, the proportion of female inmates to the larger population is closer to one in twenty. Australia is the exception where the rate of female imprisonment increased from 9.2 percent in 1991 to 15.3 percent in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlen |first=Pat |title=Analysing Women's Imprisonment |year=2004 |publisher=Willan Publishing |location=Portland |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the United States has significant [[Race and crime in the United States|racial disparities in rates of incarceration]].&lt;ref name=rehavi&gt;Rehavi and Starr (2012) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1985377 "Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Charging and Its Sentencing Consequences"] Working Paper Series, no. 12-002 (Univ. of Michigan Law &amp; Economics, Empirical Legal Studies Center)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michelle Alexander]], the United States "imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid".&lt;ref name=newjimcrow&gt;[[Alexander, Michelle]] (2010). [[The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness]]. The New Press, New York. See pages 7 and 86. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-643-8}}.

Notably, there’s something of an international theme in countries comparing themselves to apartheid South Africa. There were instances where Australian journalists were drawing the same contrast relative to rates of imprisonment in their country.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Jon.

[[Politifact]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Huffington Post piece "Mass Incarceration's Failure", attorney Antonio Moore states "The incarceration rate for young black men ages 20 to 39, is nearly 10,000 per 100,000. To give context, during the racial discrimination of apartheid in South Africa, the prison rate for black male South Africans, rose to 851 per 100,000."&lt;ref name=Moore2015&gt;Moore, Antonio (4 Aug 2015).

''[[Huffington Post]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contributor to the high incarceration rates is the length of the [[prison sentence]]s in the United States. One of the criticisms of the United States system is that it has much longer sentences than any other part of the world. The typical [[mandatory sentence]] for a first-time drug offense in federal court is five or ten years, compared to other developed countries around the world where a first time offense would warrant at most 6 months in jail. &lt;ref name=newjimcrow/&gt; Mandatory sentencing prohibits judges from using their discretion and forces them to place longer sentences on nonviolent offenses than they normally would do.

Even though there are other countries that have a higher rate of committing inmates to prison annually, the fact that the United States keeps their prisoners longer causes the total incarceration rate to become higher. To give an example, the average [[burglary]] sentence in the United States is 16 months, compared to 5 months in [[Canada]] and 7 months in [[England]].&lt;ref name=nyt2008apr23/&gt;

The US incarceration rate peaked in 2008 when about 1 in 100 US adults was behind bars.&lt;ref name=nytimes2008feb/&gt; This incarceration rate exceeded the average incarceration levels in the [[Soviet Union]] during the existence of the infamous [[Gulag]] system, when the [[Demography of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's population]] reached 168 million, and 1.2 to 1.5 million people were in the [[Gulag]] prison camps and colonies (i.e. about 0.8 imprisoned per 100 USSR residents, according to numbers from [[Anne Applebaum]] and [[Steven Rosefielde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4s1H9v2yOwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=gulag+population#v=onepage&amp;q=gulag%20population&amp;f=false|title=The Russian economy: from Lenin to Putin.

'''Corruption in Cameroon''' has been called  "[[Cameroon]]'s worst-kept secret" by [[Thomson Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomson Reuters]] [http://www.trust.org/item/?map=why-corruption-is-cameroons-worst-kept-secret/ Why corruption is Cameroon's worst-kept secret] 18 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Cameroon has had "persistent problems with corruption" according to [[BBC News]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13146029 Cameroon profile] [[BBC News]] 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (2014) by [[Transparency International]] ranked Cameroon 136 out of 175 countries and found that the police are seen by Cameroonians as the most corrupt institution in the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/country#CMR Corruption Perceptions Index: Cameroon]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[government of Cameroon]] has taken some steps addressing the problem of corruption in the country: in order to increase transparency in its oil sector, Cameroon joined the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Cameroon|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/cameroon/business-corruption-in-cameroon.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroon also witnessed the prosecution of corruption committed by a former prime minister, [[Ephraim Inoni]], who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2013 for embezzlement. Several high corruption risk sectors, such as customs and public procurement, pose obstacles for doing business in Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Cameroon|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/cameroon/business-corruption-in-cameroon.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Wallechinsky]] ranked [[President of Cameroon]] [[Paul Biya]] with three others ([[Robert Mugabe]] of [[Zimbabwe]], [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Mswati III|King Mswati]] of [[Swaziland]]) as the most corrupt dictators in the world. He describes Cameroon's electoral process in these terms: "Every few years, Biya stages an election to justify his continuing reign, but these elections have no credibility.&lt;ref&gt;David Wallechinsky, "Tyrants: the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators", Regan Press, 2006, pp. 286–290&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug disposal''' is the discarding of drugs. Individuals commonly dispose of [[unused drugs]] that remain after the end of medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/drugs/getting-rid-of-expired-medication/|title=Easy Steps for Getting Rid of Unused Medication|last1=Skinner|first1=Ginger|date=20 March 2017|website=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care organizations dispose of drugs on a larger scale for a range of reasons, including having leftover drugs after treating patients and discarding of expired drugs. Failure to properly dispose of drugs creates opportunities for others (of whom the drug is unintended) to take them inappropriately.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Inappropriate disposal of drugs can also cause [[drug pollution]].&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt;

People dispose of drugs in various ways; even organizations with expertise on drugs may give inconsistent information to consumers about drug disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuspis|first1=DA|last2=Krenzelok|first2=EP|title=What happens to expired medications? A survey of community medication disposal.|journal=Veterinary and human toxicology|date=February 1996|volume=38|issue=1|pages=48–9|pmid=8825752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of drugs==
Medication waste includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, controlled substances, and expired pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.nj.us/dep/enforcement/1%20RCRA%20Pharmaceutical%20Waste%20-%20Best%20Management%20Practices%20-Vona%205-17-12.pdf|title=Pharmaceutical Waste Compliance For Healthcare Facilities|last=|first=|date=17 May 2012|website=The Official Website for the State of New Jersey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medication waste can come from multiple levels in the drug's lifespan. First, it can come from production factories from where they were created. This includes unwanted pharmaceutical ingredients and materials that can no longer be used in the drug manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepharmajournal.com/archives/2017/vol6issue3/PartC/6-2-9-174.pdf|title=An Overview of Waste Management in Pharmaceutical Industry|last=Jaseem|first=Mohammed|date=2017|website=The Pharma Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, medication waste can be generated from healthcare facilities including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Medication waste from this source can be from over prescribing of drugs from healthcare providers, hospital labs, expired drugs, opened drug containers and partially used medications.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, these wastes can include materials, such as syringes, vials, IV bags, and tubing that contain excess drugs or contaminated in the process of handling hazardous pharmaceuticals, such as chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some states have regulations that require healthcare facilities to destroy unused medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/unused-pharms-health-care_interim-report_2008.pdf|title=Unused Pharmaceuticals in the Health Care Industry: Interim Report|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, pharmaceutical waste can come from excessive consumption of over-the-counter medications from patients.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fip.org/files/fip/publications/2015-12-Green-Pharmacy-Practice.pdf|title=Taking Responsibility for the Environmental Impact of Medicines|last=|first=|date=2015|website=FIP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes normal use of a drug can result in waste. For example, when someone uses a [[dermal patch]], after the patch is used, it will still retain significant potency, necessitating safe disposal.&lt;ref name="Commissioner April 2016"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Office of the Commissioner|title=Consumer Updates - How to Dispose of Unused Medicines|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm101653.htm|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for disposal of drugs==
Medical authorities advise that consumers not store any drug that they would not have a reason at present to possess.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Storing drugs creates a possibility that someone will use them inappropriately and suffer harm.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Accidental ingestion of medications prescribed for another individual is a leading source of poisonings in American households. According to Poison Control Centers in the United States, in 2007 approximately 23,783 of 255,732 cases involving inappropriate medication use were associated with inadvertent exposure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronstein|first=Alvin C.|last2=Spyker|first2=Daniel A.|last3=Jr|first3=Louis R.

==Methods for disposal==

===Disposal for individuals and communities===
The most obvious way for individuals to dispose of drugs is through the household [[waste management]] service.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Experts advise checking other options first, because simply discarding drugs with other trash creates the possibility that someone could use them and be harmed.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Medical authorities recommend against disposing of drugs by passing them on to other consumers.&lt;ref name="Commissioner April 2016"/&gt;

The best source of local advice will be the community pharmacy.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Pharmacies already handle drugs and will recommend what sort of disposal method is most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Many pharmacies will collect drugs and dispose of them as a community service.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Some regions have special government services that offer to take back and dispose of drugs.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Sometimes, either a pharmacy or government service will provide a way to mail drugs to a special drug disposal facility.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; If there are no other options and one must put drugs into the trash, a recommended safer way to do so is by mixing the drug with unattractive trash.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt; Putting pills into the toilet can cause drug pollution, but this might be justified as a way to quickly disposing of dangerous drugs.&lt;ref name="Ginger 2017"/&gt;

There have been many attempts in the United States to encourage consumers to bring their leftover drugs to disposal centers.&lt;ref name="Egan 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egan|first1=Kathleen L.|last2=Gregory|first2=Eric|last3=Sparks|first3=Michael|last4=Wolfson|first4=Mark|title=From dispensed to disposed: evaluating the effectiveness of disposal programs through a comparison with prescription drug monitoring program data|journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse|date=31 October 2016|volume=43|issue=1|pages=69–77|doi=10.1080/00952990.2016.1240801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of disposal programs include having a special event at a community center with prior advertisements for people to bring their drugs to the event, or otherwise educating individuals and concerned organizations about the correct way to dispose of drugs.&lt;ref name="Egan 2016"/&gt; One study reviewing the efficacy of these programs found that their impact was too low to have the desired result of decreasing community access to leftover drugs.&lt;ref name="Egan 2016"/&gt;

===Disposal for organizations and industry===
Disposal of large amounts of drugs can cause [[drug pollution]] and negatively impact the [[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products|environment]].&lt;ref name="WHO 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Health Organization|title=Guidelines for safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals in and after emergencies|date=1999|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-0119854985|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/whozip51e/whozip51e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations might choose to dispose of large amounts of drugs by returning them to the manufacturer, putting them in [[landfills]], using [[Incineration]], or dumping the drugs into sewers.&lt;ref name="WHO 1999"/&gt;

==Disposal of controversial drugs==
Drugs associated with [[substance abuse]] and [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibited drug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s receive special attention in their disposal.&lt;ref name="CBS May 2014"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Crimesider Staff|title=How are authorities destroying seized drugs?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-are-authorities-destroying-seized-drugs/|accessdate=5 May 2017|language=en|date=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police might seize such drugs as [[contraband]], and then have to destroy them.&lt;ref name="CBS May 2014"/&gt; In other cases, some legal drugs create risks for abuse and need more attention in disposal than drugs that are not attractive for abuse.&lt;ref name="Herring 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herring|first1=ME|last2=Shah|first2=SK|last3=Shah|first3=SK|last4=Gupta|first4=AK|title=Current regulations and modest proposals regarding disposal of unused opioids and other controlled substances.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|date=July 2008|volume=108|issue=7|pages=338–43|pmid=18648027}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is challenging for governments to discuss how to properly dispose of controversial drugs.&lt;ref name="Herring 2008"/&gt;

One small regional study in the United States reported the outcomes of a public health program to take back unused opioids.&lt;ref name="Welham 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welham|first1=Grace C.|last2=Mount|first2=Jeanine K.|last3=Gilson|first3=Aaron M.|title=Type and Frequency of Opioid Pain Medications Returned for Disposal|journal=Drugs - Real World Outcomes|date=4 March 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=129–135|doi=10.1007/s40801-015-0019-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study found that individuals who returned opioids tended to return more than half of what they were prescribed, which could be an indication that these people had twice as much medication as they wanted.&lt;ref name="Welham 2015"/&gt; The study was too limited to form a general conclusion, but it provided information to guide further discussion and research on whether people would participate in opioid take back programs, what sorts of drugs are more likely to be returned, and how much people would return.&lt;ref name="Welham 2015"/&gt;

There is a list of medications in which the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] recommends to be disposed of via flushing down the toilet if consumers are unable to take these drugs to a drug take-back program. These medications contain controlled substances that are dangerous to pets and other people in the home and should be disposed of immediately when no longer needed. Examples include [[Dilaudid]] (hydromorphone hydrochloride) tablets, fentanyl patches and [[morphine sulfate]] oral solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm576167.htm|title=Flushing of Certain Medicines|last=|first=|date=6 October 2017|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These products should immediately flush due to high potential for abuse and overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pharmacist.com/proper-disposal-fentanyl-patches-can-save-lives-0|title=Proper disposal of fentanyl patches can save lives|website=www.pharmacist.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worldwide Drug Disposal Practices ==

=== European Union ===
In 2001, the European Parliament released a [[Directive 2001/83/EC|Directive]] regarding the disposal practices of medicinal products.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 32001L0083 - EN|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Directive 2001/83/EC stated that the outer packaging of medications needed to include special disposal precautions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2004, the EU put out another directive that further clarified the 2001 directive and called for establishment of medication collection protocols and information regarding specific collection protocols for the state or country be placed on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2004_27/dir_2004_27_en.pdf|title=Public Health - European Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=Public Health|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====United Kingdom====
As outlined in National Health Service SI 2014/349: The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013, local pharmacies are obligated to take back unused and unwanted medications generated in the home.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/349/contents/made|title=The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Per these same regulations, pharmacies are responsible for sorting the medications and returning them to the NHS.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada has no specific nationwide drug take back or disposal policy, but most provinces have individual plans.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. Pharmaceutical disposal programs for the public: A Canadian perspective. Health Canada environmental impact initiative. 2009. http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.productstewardship.us/resource/resmgr/imported/Takeback%20(2).pdf. Accessed 2018-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;Most pharmacies in Canada can take back unused and expired medications any day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/safe-disposal-prescription-drugs.html|title=Safe disposal of prescription drugs - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Health|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Regulations in the United States ==
In the United States, used prescriptions are serious safety concerns because they can be accidentally ingested, overdosed or diverted for illegal use.

To address these concerns,  the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) created National Prescription Drug Take Back Days that occurs twice annually in April and October.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These Take Back Days are part of a mission to create safe medication disposal sites, prevent [[drug diversion]] or transfer of the prescribed drug for illicit use, and provide education for the public.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/|title=National Prescription Drug Take Back Day|website=www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the 13th National Drug Take Back Day included 5,498 collection sites across the country and 450 tons unused or expired prescription medicines were collected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, The National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (NADDI) sponsors a website to locate Rx Drug Drop Boxes for safe medication disposal outside of National Prescription Drug Take Back Days.

=== Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010  ===
The "Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010" was proposed to amend the "Controlled Substances Act" created in 1970 which prohibits the disposal of controlled substances unless a member of law enforcement has authorization from the DEA to directly receive and dispose of the controlled substance. This bars drug take back programs from being able to receive and dispose of controlled medications for members of the public, which in turn can lead to the potential misuse of these drugs. Misuse of prescription medications has been a growing epidemic, with deaths from opioids quadrupling since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CDC|title=Drug overdose deaths in the United States continue to increase in 2015|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown that in 2006, about 1/3 of new prescription drug abusers were 12-17 year olds.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|last1=One Hundred Eleventh Congress of the United States of America|title=An Act|url=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/non_registrant/s_3397.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these statistics, Congress decided to take an active role in trying to make drug take back programs more readily available. Therefore, the "Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010" was created to allow the Attorney General permission in creating new policies to provide citizens “convenient and safe” disposal of their unwanted medications to authorized people or facilities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Congress created this act with a goal of preventing drug diversion and environmental harm/pollution by these drugs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Other Take Back Programs ===
In addition to the drug disposal of 2012, other national agencies have also promoted the use of the drug take back programs. In 2011, White House announced the first national Prescription Abuse Prevention Plan. The Prescription Abuse Prevention Plan expanded support to the prescription drug disposal programs and decreased the supply of unused prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|work=The White House|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency also encouraged the use of prescription drug disposal programs with guidelines for household disposal of medication and recommendations on the incineration of the household pharmaceutical product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/collecting-and-disposing-unwanted-medicines|title=Collecting and Disposing of Unwanted Medicines {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Pharmacist Association and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to raise awareness for consumers to properly dispose medication. The campaign encouraged consumer to not flush unused medications or pour them down the sink. The campaign also recognized pharmacists' role to inform consumers of the different disposal techniques and which medications are appropriate for flushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pharmacist.com/letter-usfws-and-apha-collaboration|title=Letter of USFWS and APhA Collaboration|website=www.pharmacist.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of State Regulations==

=== Alameda County Safe Drug Disposal Ordinance ===
Alameda County was the first county in the United States to make the manufacturer pay for safe disposal of pharmaceutical waste. This ordinance required companies that manufacture drugs sold and distributed in Alameda County must operate and pay for a "Product Stewardship Program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.municode.com/ca/alameda_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?searchRequest=%7B%22searchText%22:%22Medication%20Disposal%22,%22pageNum%22:1,%22resultsPerPage%22:25,%22booleanSearch%22:false,%22stemming%22:true,%22fuzzy%22:false,%22synonym%22:false,%22contentTypes%22:%5B%22CODES%22%5D,%22productIds%22:%5B%5D%7D&amp;nodeId=TIT6HESA_CH6.53ALCOSADRDIOR|title=Municode Library|website=library.municode.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these programs include a drug kiosk or mail-back program and volunteer collectors, such as law enforcement and pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acgov.org/aceh/safedisposal/#ordinance|title=Safe Drug and Consumer-Generated Sharps Disposal - Alameda County Environmental Health - Alameda County|website=www.acgov.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this program 8 other counties in California adopted similar programs, including San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Marin, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Contra Costa, San Luis Obispo, and Tehama Counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://calpsc.org/products/pharmaceuticals/city-county-ordinances-safe-disposal-sharps-pharmaceuticals/|title=City and County Ordinances for Safe Disposal of Sharps and Pharmaceuticals - California Product Stewardship Council|work=California Product Stewardship Council|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===California State Board of Pharmacy===
In California, entities including pharmacies in retail and hospital settings may host drug take-back programs as long as they follow requirements under Article 9.1 of Division 17 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations.&lt;ref name="CASBOP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=California|first1=State Board of Pharmacy|title=California SBOP - Prescription Drug Take-Back Services|url=http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/laws_regs/1776_oa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pharmacies are required to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and notify the Board of Pharmacy and DEA within 30 days of starting or stopping a program.&lt;ref name="CASBOP"/&gt; These pharmacies must have collection receptacles located in authorized locations and have liners that are certified to meet American Society for Testing Materials standards.&lt;ref name="CASBOP" /&gt; The pharmacies must also follow protocols like accepting prescription drugs to be sent back to an authorized DEA destruction site and no employee can be part of the program if they have a history with controlled substance-related felonies.&lt;ref name="CASBOP"/&gt; The pharmacy may not sort, count, or review the unwanted prescription medications once collected and they are required to report tampering of any receptacles to the Board of Pharmacy within 14 days.&lt;ref name="CASBOP"/&gt; It is important to note that these pharmaceutical take-back programs only take prescription medications, not drug samples or medical waste.&lt;ref name="CASBOP"/&gt;

=== California Senate Bill 212 ===
On September 30, 2018, California passed SB 212: Solid waste: pharmaceutical and sharps waste stewardship.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB212|title=Bill Text  - SB-212 Solid waste: pharmaceutical and sharps waste stewardship.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Alameda County Ordinance, this is a statewide drug and needle program funded by manufacturers or distributors. The bill requires that these entities create their own stewardship program or be part of a stewardship program, which will be approved by CalRecycle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bill mandates a minimum of 5 collection sites per county or if the county is larger it requires 1 per 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  They also require retail pharmacies to serve as an "authorized collector." Authorized collectors serve their counties in one location or 15% of store locations in the county, depending which is greater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bill will begin January 2019, with approvals by CalRecyle completed and implementation of the programs started January 2021.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Human history|222}}

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

== Southeast Asia ==
At the start of the modern era, the [[Spice Route]] between India and China crossed [[Majapahit]],&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_19"&gt;M.C. Ricklefs, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

The beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted as in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this transitional phase from medieval to early modern Europe can be noted:
* 1415 – [[Battle of Ceuta|Conquest of Ceuta]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|-

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
'''Economic democracy''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Management|corporate managers]] and [[Shareholder|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for [[capitalism]]'s inherent [[effective demand]] gap.{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}}

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].{{sfn|George|1912}}{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] and [[economic liberalism|economic liberalization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[public banking]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].
{{toclimit|3}}

== Deficiency of effective demand ==
According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, [[geographer]] [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output".{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}} While balanced [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]] have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] and other critics claim that [[Planned economy|command economies]] are predominate, citing [[state capitalism]] and [[imperialism]] as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

In the [[Georgist]] view of any [[economics|economic system]], "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having [[exchange value]]. [[Land (economics)|Land]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to [[Henry George]]: "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion".{{sfn|George|1912|date=January 2012}} Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and [[Custom (law)|customs]] that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society.

Alternately, [[David Schweickart]] asserts in his book, ''After Capitalism'': "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components:

* "The bulk of the [[means of production]] are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals.
* "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices.
* "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are '[[wage labour]]ers'".{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=22–23}}

[[Supply and demand]] are generally accepted as market functions for establishing [[price]]s. Organisations typically endeavor to 1) minimize the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]; 2) increase sales; in order to 3) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of [[effective demand]] (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=36, 40–43, 95}} resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy.

In chapter 3 of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", [[Douglas Biklen|Douglas P. Biklen]] discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that according to this viewpoint:

{{Quote|[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marx's criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

=== Savings, investment and unemployment ===

In his 1879 book ''Progress and Poverty'', Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] through [[economic rent]]s, and that concentration of such [[Unearned income|unearned wealth]] was the root cause of poverty.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "Behind the abstraction known as 'the market' lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henwood | first = Doug | title = Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom | publisher = Verso | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-86091-495-2 | page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=17}}

In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash.

If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=42–43}} which characterize deficiency of effective demand.

In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the "[[invisible hand]]"—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} In this view, [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Richard G | title = The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | isbn = 978-1-60819-036-2 |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Jarvis | first = Brooke |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too | title = Equality and the Good Life: Interview with Richard Wilkinson, author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better | work = yesmagazine.org |date = March 4, 2010 |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly power versus purchasing power ===

Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states:

{{quote|The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The discipline of economics is largely a study of [[scarcity]] management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay On The Nature And Significance Of Economic Science|year=1932|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co, Ltd|location=St. Martin's Street, London|asin=B000XG8SV4|pages=15|url=https://mises.org/books/robbinsessay2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no [[economic problem]]". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by [[Corporate finance|corporate structures]] that confine [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited [[Resource (economics)|resources]] in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} American businessman Edward Kellogg (1790–1858) supports this perspective in his 1849 book, ''Labor and Other Capital'', where he states:

{{quote|Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kellogg |first=Edward |last2=Campbell |first2=Alexander |title=Labor and Other Capital |year=1971 |publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf |isbn=0-678-00803-5 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered [[Monopoly|monopoly power]], some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in [[artificial scarcity]]. For example, Henry George further suggested:

{{quote|There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, With Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor | year = 1998 | publisher = Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-911312-83-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

For example, many analysts consider [[invention]] a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a 'rare and scarce commodity', for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Edith Tilton |title=The International Patent System | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore |year=1951 | oclc = 181961 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadudere |first=Dan |title=The Political Economy of Imperialism |year=1977 |publisher=Zed Books |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. {{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} According to Jack Rasmus, author of ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', in June 2006, investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor's share of national income." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmus|first=Jack|title=The Trillion Dollar Income Shift, Part 1|journal=Z Magazine|date=February 2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=44–49|url=http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Wealth/JackRasmusZMag.txt|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enclosure of the commons ===
Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or [[enclosure|enclosure of the commons]]. Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In 1911, American journalist [[Ambrose Bierce]] defined "land" as:

{{quote|A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierce | first = Ambrose | authorlink = Ambrose Bierce | title = [[The Devil's Dictionary]] | year = 1911 | oclc = 49294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In ''The Servile State'' (1912), [[Hilaire Belloc]] referred to the [[Enclosure|Enclosures Movement]] when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy [[oligarchy]] before the series of great [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belloc|first=Hilaire|title=The Servile State|year=1912|publisher=T. N.

According to [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]], author of ''Capitalism 3.0'', when Adam Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776, the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate [[economies of scale]]. The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders' liability to the amounts they have invested.{{sfn|Barnes|2006}}

In ''A Preface To Economic Democracy'', [[Robert A. Dahl]] suggests that [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy and society in the early United States "underwent a [[Industrial Revolution|revolutionary]] transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] of wealth, income, [[Social status|status]], and [[Economic power|power]]." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the "[[liberty]] to accumulate unlimited [[Factors of production|economic resources]] and to organize economic activity into [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] governed enterprises."{{sfn|Dahl|1985|p=50}}

=== The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage ===
According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first [[monastery]], established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before 1900 developed in Great Britain, where they were established by [[royal charter]], with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say:

{{quote|A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacLeod | first = Greg | title = The Public Purpose Corporation | journal = Harvard International Review | date = 2009-04-04 | url = http://hir.harvard.edu/the-mondragon-experiment | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the same protections as living [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire [[Lobbying|lobbyists]], donate copiously to politicians, and sway [[public opinion]].

But, despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an "[[automaton]]", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the [[Fortune 500]] accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or [[Sole proprietorship|proprietorships]]. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of [[sovereignty]], including [[immortality]], [[Self-governance|self-government]], and [[limited liability]]. By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered [[tariff]]s but extended corporate [[Property|property rights]] and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p=}}

David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=96}} Jack Rasmus, author of ''The War At Home'' and ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', argues that the increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristic of economic [[recession]] and [[depression (economics)|depression]]. According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one percent of households rose while income shares declined for 80-percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid-1970s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the [[Great Depression]], estimating "well over $1 trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since 2001, [[real wages|real weekly earnings]] for 100 million workers are less in 2007 than in 1980 when [[Ronald Reagan]] took office".

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the 1970s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average [[real wage]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "...the combination of computerization, exported jobs, women surging into the labor market, and a new wave of immigration ended the period of rising real wages in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="Wolff 2012 46"&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "Across the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2007, US families worked and borrowed more and more, while real wages stagnated... When they began defaulting on their debts - the system crashed."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=David|title=The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0199836841|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperialism, as defined by ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Ronald John | year = 2000 |title = The Dictionary of Human Geography | edition = 4th | publisher =Wiley-Blackwell | page=375 | isbn = 0-631-20561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=David|title=Reading Marx’s Capital Vol 1 – Class 12, Chapters 26-33|url=http://davidharvey.org/2008/09/capital-class-12/|work=Video Lecture|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |year=1916 |place=London |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people."&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against Empire |last=Parenti |first=Michael |year=1995 |publisher=City Lights Publishers |isbn=978-0-87286-298-2 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued:

{{quote|Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''The Political Struggle for the 21st century'', [[J. W. Smith|J.W. Smith]] examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize [[colonialism]]. Rhetorically termed as "[[survival of the fittest]]", or "[[might makes right]]", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by [[corporate imperialism]]. Just as cities in the [[Middle Ages]] monopolized the [[means of production]] by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital:

{{Quote|Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=}}|sign=|source=}}

Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was [[Proletariat|proletarian]]", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than 500 individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth's population. The wealth of 1/2 of 1-percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower 90-percent. {{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the [[lend-lease]] program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the 1950s and 1960s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid-1970s, when the United States implemented a policy known as [[dollar hegemony]], intended to stabilize the economy.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}

== Alternative models ==

Advocating for an "alternative economic system free of capitalism's structural flaws",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economist Richard D. Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say:

{{quote|The [[New Deal]]–era taxes on business and the rich and [[regulation]]s of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives ([[profit maximization]]) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after [[World War II]], with ever-greater effect in the period since the 1970s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], the current assault on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D.|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing [[scientific modelling|model]]. Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that 'there is no alternative'—by proposing one."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=45}} Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure;{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} and b) while capitalism thrives under [[polyarchy]], it is not compatible with genuine democracy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=151}} Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment,{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=46}} many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one.

For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/political/martin_luther_king_talks/where_do_we_go_from_here/ |title=Where Do We Go From Here |first=Martin Luther Jr |last= King|work=writespirit.net | date = August 16, 1967 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained:

{{quote|The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.{{sfn|King|1968|p=163}}|sign=|source=}}

According to historian and political economist, [[Gar Alperovitz]]: "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About The Next American Revolution|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=978-160358-491-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated:

{{quote|When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders' entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy.{{sfn|Engler|2010|p=8}}|sign=|source=}}

Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between [[Planned economy|plan]] and [[Market economy|market]], but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework".&lt;ref name="Schweickart Essay"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Economic Democracy: A Worthy Socialism That Would Really Work |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=56| issue=1 | pages=9–38|date=Spring 1992 |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/economicdemocracy.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features:

* Worker self-management: each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers.
* Social control of investment: funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
* The market: enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand.

In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=47}}

Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well.

=== Worker self-management ===
{{Main|Worker self-management}}In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by [[stockholder]]s. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–48}}

According to veteran [[World Bank]] economic adviser [[David Ellerman|David P. Ellerman]] it's the [[employment contract]] that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain 'private' in the sense of not being government-owned."{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|p=56}} In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated:

{{quote|In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ([[private company|privately]] or [[public enterprise|publicly]]). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of [[private property]]. Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm.{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|pp=44–49}}|sign=|source=}}

Alternately, in Schweickart's model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their [[capital asset]]s, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the [[capital stock]] entrusted to them. This means that a [[depreciation]] fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes. {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–49}}

Italy's [[Legacoop]] and Spain's [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoyt|first1=Lorlene|last2=Luviene|first2=Nicholas|last3=Stitely|first3=Amy|title=Sustainable Economic Democracy: Worker Cooperatives for the 21st Century|url=http://web.mit.edu/colab/pdf/papers/Sustainable_Economic_Democracy.pdf|website=colab.mit.edu|publisher=MIT Community Innovators Lab  with support from the Barr Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say:

{{quote|In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of 256 industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms.}}

=== Social control of investment ===
While there is no single approach or 'blueprint' for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, [[Gar Alperovitz]] claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, [[credit union]]s and other cooperative forms, [[social enterprise]]s, municipally-owned utilities and [[public bank]]s as starting points for what he has termed a "[[Pluralist commonwealth|Pluralist Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk about the Next American Revolution|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=85 North Main Street, Suite 120, White River Junction, VT 05001|isbn=1603585044|pages=139–147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a [[Flat tax|flat-rate tax]] on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable [[project]] proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund.

Banks are public, not private, institutions that make [[Grant (money)|grants]], not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring [[interest]] payments but no repayment of [[Debt|principal]].{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=56}}

While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism - because banks are mandated to consistently prioritize investment projects that would increase employment - Schweickart notes that it does not guarantee [[full employment]]. Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the [[employer of last resort]]. The original formulation of the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act|U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978]] assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=135, 136}}

=== The market ===
Hungarian historian [[Karl Polanyi]] suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]] Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. Polanyi claimed that [[Land (economics)|land]], labor, and money are all [[commodities|commodified]] under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels "[[fictitious commodities]]." He says [[natural resources]] are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies.

Schweickart's economic democracy is a form of [[market economy]], at least insofar as the allocation of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] is concerned. [[business entity|Firm]]s buy [[raw materials]] and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely [[Regulation|unregulated]] except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Without a [[price mechanism]] sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and [[Innovation|innovative]]. [[Competition (economics)|Market competition]] resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a [[Authoritarianism|non-authoritarian]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] fashion.

Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=49}}

Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickart's model aims to facilitate [[fair trade]], not [[free trade]], between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. [[Financial capital|Finance capital]] stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesn't flow into the country, either, since there are no [[stock]]s nor [[Bond (finance)|corporate bonds]] nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=63}}

According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a [[market socialism]] has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Rose In The Fist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |title=Self-Management and the Crisis of Socialism: The Rose in the Fist of the Present |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-8476-8905-0 |year=2000 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed.

=== Economic democracy as part of an inclusive democracy ===
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an [[inclusive democracy]] in Takis Fotopoulos' ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice.

The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ([[macroeconomic]] decisions), and secure freedom of choice ([[microeconomic]] decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and (2) an artificial market using [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]], which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pepper | first = David | title = Modern environmentalism: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London; New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-415-05745-5 | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, [[participatory economics]] guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Albert  | first = Michael |title = Parecon: Life After Capitalism | publisher = Verso Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 37–38 | isbn = 978-1-85984-698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates of participatory economics and [[Participism]] have contested this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used and so on) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate.

== Reform agendas ==
While [[Reform movement|reform agendas]] tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market and wage labor.

=== Social credit ===
{{Main|Social credit}}
Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts{{who|date=January 2012}} consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a [[public utility]] rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} [[Social Credit]] is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major [[C. H. Douglas]]. His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled ''Economic Democracy''. In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |pages=4–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement":

{{quote|The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale.{{sfn|Cook, "C.H. Douglas"|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy".

==== Credit as a public utility ====
Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the [[American Monetary Institute]], veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook| first=Richard C.| year=07/02/2010 | title=Monetary Reform and How a National Monetary System Should Work| publisher=Global Research| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created 'out of thin air' by the banking system".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

[[File:GAP Chart from We Hold These Truths.jpg|thumb|320px|GAP Chart from [[We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform|''We Hold These Truths'']]]]

* A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today's economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

While Smith and others suggest an [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy,{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} {{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes":{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

{{quote|[[Monetary reform]] embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of 'market' economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks.{{sfn|Cook, "Credit as a Public Utility" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

Cook avoided [[Collectivism|collectivist]] solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cook's argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including [[Early American currency|colonial paper currencies]] which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the [[Greenback (money)|Greenbacks]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American civil war]], and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the [[Great Depression]]. While President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least 20 years.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=81–112}}

==== National dividend ====
Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a [[Basic income|Basic Income Guarantee]] or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including [[Thomas Paine]], [[Milton Friedman]], Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Friedman originally proposed a [[negative income tax]] to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIG's demise in the late 1960s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American".{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=121}} In 2006, Representative [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA) proposed a modest basic income guarantee via an inflation-adjusted refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5257 |title=H.R.5257 - Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act of 2006, 109th Congress (2005-2006)|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network:

{{quote|The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizen's income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 1, 2007|url=http://www.usbig.net/ |title=The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. 
Rather than [[Federal Reserve Note]]s, circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "it's important to realize that [[Social Credit]] is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".{{sfn|Cook, "US Economy on Life Support"|2007}} Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the 1920s, Cook explains:

{{quote|The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''Capitalism 3.0'', Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top 5 percent of the population owns more [[property]] than the remaining 95 percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$5-trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society.

One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of [[Alaska]], where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the state's oil revenues via the "[[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund".{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:

{{quote|Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.{{sfn|King|1968|p=164}}}}

Barnes deemed any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Monopoly power versus public utility ===
{{Main|J. W. Smith}}

Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} According to Smith [[entitlement|exclusive title]] to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=2}} Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in [[Western culture]]s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} He estimated that roughly 60 percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double [[economic efficiency]], maintain [[quality of life]], and reduce [[Working time|working hours]] by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}

Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and [[Telecommunication|communications]]. He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=14}} Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for [[market share]], thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In Smith's view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 187}} Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through [[License|licensing]] should be legislated as human rights.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 13, 22, 90, 102, 113, 124, 220}}

Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=3}} Federated regions collect [[resource rent]]s on land and technology to a [[social fund]] to operate governments and care for social needs.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=17, 54}} Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}} Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 84}} Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=16–17}}

According to Smith, all monetary systems, including [[money market]]s, should function within [[fractional-reserve banking]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=15}} Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=16}} Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=13}}

=== Cooperatives ===
{{Main|Cooperative}}
A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either [[consumer cooperative]]s or [[worker cooperative]]s, the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy.

According to the [[International Cooperative Alliance]]'s [[Statement on the Cooperative Identity]], "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner."

==== Worker cooperatives ====
{{Main|Worker cooperative}}
According to the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]]: "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are: 1) workers invest in and own the business and (2) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling 300 democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over 3,500 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between 1990 and 2010, technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|title=About Worker Cooperatives|url=http://usworker.coop/aboutworkercoops|publisher=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called [[workplace democracy]], which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellerman|first=David P.|title=The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm: A New Model for the East and West|publisher=Unwin Hyman Limited (HarperCollins Academic)|location=London|isbn=0-04-445743-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard|title=The Spirit Level|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60819-036-2|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble:

{{quote|Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control.{{sfn|Dahl|1985|pp=92–93 }}|sign=|source=}}

In worker cooperatives, [[net income]] is called [[Economic surplus|surplus]] instead of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt;

Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt; Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}} In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working.&lt;ref name="usworker"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usworker.coop/front |title=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives |work=usworker.coop |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianworker.coop/worker-co-op |title=What is a Worker Co-op? | publisher = Canadian Worker Co-op Federation |work=canadianworker.coop |year=2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]] have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in 1956, Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stikkers|first=Kenneth W.|title=Dewey and the Mondragon Cooperatives|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|year=2011|volume=3|series=2036-4091|issue=2|pages=195–197|url=http://lnx.journalofpragmatism.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/stikkers.pdf|accessdate=10/02/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (June 24, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon "Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way."] ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer cooperatives ====
{{Main|Consumer cooperative}}
A [[consumers' cooperative]] is owned by its customers for their [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual benefit]]. Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group.

In his book, ''From Mondragon To America'', Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain.

Consumer cooperatives vary in organization and operations, but typically follow the [[Rochdale Principles]]. Consumer cooperatives may also form [[Co-operative Federation]]s. These may take the form of [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|co-operative wholesale societies]], through which they collectively purchase goods at [[wholesale]] prices and, in some cases, cooperatively own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of [[Co-operative union]]s.

Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer"&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html What is a Consumer Cooperative? – Cooperative Grocer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055607/http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Food cooperatives =====
{{Main|Food cooperative}}Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer" /&gt; [[Food cooperatives]] were originally established to provide fresh, [[Organic food|organic produce]] as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and [[slow food]] production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

For example, associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

=== Regional trading currencies ===
According to [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]], author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in today's world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the Federal Reserve acted as the world's central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere.{{sfn|Cook, "US Immigration Crisis"|2007}}

According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth:

{{quote|By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization"{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others' resources.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Democratizing workplaces and distributing productive assets ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

==== The Workplace as a political entity to be democratized ====
Workplace democracy has been cited as a possible solution to the problems that arise from excluding employees from decision-making such as low-employee morale, employee alienation, and low employee engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122513|title=An Alternative Organizational Model: Workplace Democracy|last=van der Vliet|first=Merijn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Isabelle Ferreras argues that there exists “a great contradiction between the democratic nature of our times and the reality of the work experience.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms as Political Entities: Saving Democracy through Economic Bicameralism|last=Ferreras|first=Isabelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781108245043|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the modern corporation's two basic inputs, capital and labor, are treated in radically different ways. Capital owners of a firm wield power within a system of shareholder democracy that allocates voice democratically according to how much capital investment they place in the firm. Labor, on the other hand, rarely benefits from a system to voice their concerns within the firm. She argues that firms are more than just economic organizations especially given the power that they wield over people's livelihoods, environment, and rights. Rather, Ferreras holds that firms are best understood as political entities. And as political entities “it is crucial that firms be made compatible with the democratic commitments of our nations.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany and to a lesser extent the broader European Union have experimented with a way of workplace democracy known as Co-determination, a system that allows workers to elect representatives that sit on the board of directors of a company. Common criticisms of workplace democracy include that democratic workplaces are less efficient than hierarchical workplace, that managers are best equipped to make company decisions since they are better educated and aware of the broader business context.

==== Creating a widespread distribution of productive assets ====
One of the biggest criticisms against capitalism is that it concentrates economic and, as a result, political power in few hands. Theorists of economic democracy have argued that one solution to this unequal concentration of power is to create mechanism that distribute ownership of productive assets across the entire population. In ''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement'', John Rawls argues that only two systems could embody the main features of his principles of justice: liberal socialism or a property-owning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45388455|title=Justice as fairness : a restatement|last=1921-2002.|first=Rawls, John,|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kelly, Erin.|isbn=0674005104|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=45388455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within property-owning democracy Rawls envisions widespread use of worker-owned cooperatives, partial-employee ownership of firms, systems to redistribute one's asset after death to prevent the accumulation of wealth, as well as a strong system of asset-based redistribution that encourages workers to own productive assets.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. "'Rawls and Property-Owning Democracy'." In Unpacking Rawls, edited by Nicola Riva., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the idea that making ownership more widespread leads to more equitable outcomes various proposals of asset-based welfare and asset-redistribution have been conceived. Individualistic and liberal asset-based welfare strategies such as the United Kingdom's Child Trust Fund of the United States Individual Development Account aimed to help people save money so that it could be invested on education, home-ownership, or entrepreneurship. More expirmental and left-leaning proposals include worker owned cooperatives, ESOPS, or Roemers coupon socialism.

== Critiques ==
[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that ownership and control over the [[means of production]] belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace.{{sfn|Mises|1953|loc=preface; p. 443}} "The capitalistic social order", he claimed, therefore "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word".{{sfn|Mises|2006|p=158}} Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase—they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used.

'''El Psicópata''' ({{literal translation|"The Psychopath"}}) an unidentified [[Costa Rica]]n [[serial killer]] responsible for the murders of 19 people from 1986 to 1996 in the cities of [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]], [[Curridabat]] and [[Desamparados]].

He was named by the Civil Police of Costa Rica in 1996, who were investigating similar crimes that were not solved in the previous years. However, according to Costa Rican legislation, the crime statute limit has expired, and if a suspect (or suspects) were found, they can no longer be charged for any of the murders.

Other crimes have been attributed to him, such as those of [[El Descuartizador]], who was never captured either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diarioextra.com/2001/febrero/13/sucesos03.html From Jack the Ripper of London to the Ripper of San José] ''Diario Extra'', February 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
His victims were single women or heterosexual couples who were usually attacked in places with little traffic during the night, especially in the area between Cartago, Curridabat and Desamparados, which at that time was called "the triangle of death".

A [[facial composite]] of the murderer was drawn up, although nobody was arrested for the crimes. The analysis of the profile indicated that the subject in question was a man of Costa Rican origin who lived in [[Nicaragua]] (although this was just one possibility, among many others).

It was stated that the murderer could be a Costa Rican who in 1996 was 43 years old, and who was enrolled in the Nicaraguan [[guerilla]] (the Costa Rican authorities considered him dead as a result of this conflict, until the individual presented his [[vital records]] requesting a [[cédula de identidad]]). This was not confirmed either, and even this last suspect (a close relative of Ligia Camacho's family, whose name was not revealed) appeared before the authorities with his lawyer, in order to prove his [[innocence]].

A popular rumor but unconfirmed rumor was that the murderer could belong to one of the most powerful families in the country, more specifically to the family of former President [[José Figueres Ferrer]], and for that reason was never discovered.

Police officials declared that the murderer had probably undergone some [[psychological trauma]] in his youth, related to his mother or perhaps some sentimental companion, due to the cruelty he showed against the women.

The then director of the [[OIJ]] said in 1996 that there was not the slightest evidence, except [[modus operandi]] and the weapon's [[caliber]], and that these were just circumstantial evidence, never binding to a specific weapon.

The police managed to handle up to six different suspects.

== Authorities ==
On November 26, 1996, the OIJ issued a press release (the first since the beginning of the murders), in which they tried to outline who El Psícopata was.

In said statement, a telephone line and a postal address were offered to give confidential reports, although this did not have greater results. A change of direction of the investigation was also tried, because before that date, it was thought that El Psícopata was a murderer of a [[moralistic]] type, but then tried to orient his profile towards that of a lustful killer who killed to consummate his sexual fantasies, although the reason for this turn in the investigation was never clarified.

This redirection in the investigations was refuted even by professionals who had been involved in the investigation, such as the doctor Fernando Garzona Meseguer, who maintained that El Psícopata had no sexual purposes in his crimes, and that if sexual contact was made with his victims, it was the motivation for the murders.

== Crimes ==

=== The murder of Ligia Camacho Bermudez ===
It happened on June 14, 1987, in the victim's own home. Ligia was reading a book on her bed, when she was shot from outside her house, dying on the spot. This event contradicts the modus operandi of El Psícopata, since the latter used to attack in solitary places, and not in houses or neighborhoods. The only proof that it was the same criminal was a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] test.

[[Fingerprints]] were also found, but as no suspects were arrested, a positive comparison could not be made.

=== Last crime ===
The last suspected crime of El Psícopata occurred on October 26, 1996, in the Patarrá area of Desamprados, south of [[San José Province|San José]]. Mauricio Cordero and Ileana Álvarez were in a [[Nissan Sentra]], when they were surprised by a stranger who forced them to abandon their car and walk 500m. Then he proceeded to shoot both of them. While no one was ever caught for this or other crimes attributed to El Psícopata, the Judicial Police of Costa Rica identified a modus operandi identical to the murders of those two and 19 other people, between 1986 and 1996.

== Other curiosities ==

* The crimes attributed to El Psícopata were carried out with an [[M3 submachine gun]], which used [[.45 ACP]] ammunition. In July 2005, a very similar weapon was buried in the courtyard of a house located in the "death triangle", but ballistic analyzes determined that the weapon found did not coincide with the M3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aldia.co.cr/ad_ee/2005/julio/03/sucesos5.html Al Día - Weapon found is not that of the psychopath]&lt;/ref&gt;
* El Psícopata only attacked south of the Florencio del Castillo Highway (which connects San José and Cartago).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1725">The image of the '''Four Happiness Boys''' is believed to have begun during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) by a child prodigy by the name of Jie Jin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Five_Fold_Happiness.html?id=QNSJSA0GUFoC |title=Five-Fold Happiness: Chinese Concepts of Luck, Prosperity, Longevity, Happiness, and Wealth |publisher=Chronicle Books |first=Vivien |last=Sung |date=1 August 2002 |accessdate=23 September 2013 |isbn=9780811835268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the age of five, this remarkable child had studied and mastered the ancient Chinese ‘[[Four Books]]’ and the ‘[[Five Classics]]' and soon made his way into formal studies alongside other renowned Chinese scholars of the period. The "Four Happiness Boys" is the ancient [[China|Chinese]] image or drawing of two interconnected boys to create the [[illusion]] of four laughing boys lying in four directions. The picture symbolizes ‘four happiness joined together’, which basically were: (a) a wedding night, (b)passing the imperial exams, (c) running into a friend in a faraway place, and (d) rain after a long drought – instances all considered to be among life’s major fortunes in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. 

To this day, this image continues to be painted, drawn or cast in many materials including [[bronze]], [[brass]], and [[porcelain]] and is often given as a symbolic wedding gift for an abundant marriage, many generations of children, and good fortune and happiness.

'''Gibraltar National Day''', celebrated annually on 10 September, is the official [[national day]] of the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. The day commemorates [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 1967|Gibraltar's first sovereignty referendum of 1967]], in which [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under [[Spain|Spanish]] [[sovereignty]], or remain under [[United Kingdom|British]] sovereignty, with institutions of [[self-governance|self-government]].&lt;ref name=MoD&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Templates/NewsArticle.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID={57722B8A-113C-4A18-B7D3-350DD2B8A2CD}&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2FDefenceInternet%2FDefenceNews%2FHistoryAndHonour%2FGibraltarSoldiersCelebrateTheirNationalDayInIraq.htm&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest Ministry of Defence – Gibraltar soldiers celebrate their National Day in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1992, the [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]] [[Joe Bossano]], travelled to the [[United Nations]] to argue for the right to [[self-determination]] inspiring the formation of the [[Self Determination for Gibraltar Group]] (SDGG) which was at the time headed by [[Dennis Matthews (politician)|Dennis Matthews]], a one-time active member of the [[Integration with Britain Party]] (IWBP). In order to generate popular support for self-determination they held the first National Day at [[John Mackintosh Square]] (the ''Piazza'') on 10 September 1992 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the day the [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 1967|1967 sovereignty referendum]] was held on. Coincidentally, the 10 September was also the day the [[Gibraltar Legislative Council]] became representative and responsible for internal affairs in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The first National Day was so successful that the avalanche of people that spontaneously turned up could not fit into John Mackintosh Square. The [[Government of Gibraltar|Government]] then took the responsibility of providing some help organising the event, since it fostered the right to self-determination that the Gibraltarians had been demanding at the United Nations since 1963. Therefore, the Government declared the 10 September a [[public holiday]] and gave the SDGG a [[Grant (money)|grant]] for them to administer. In 1993 the venue was changed to the larger [[Grand Casemates Square]], until it was again changed in 1998 to the even larger [[Naval Ground]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

=== National identity ===
[[File:GIBRALTAR NATIONAL DAY (9716922401) (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] dress in their national colours of red and white on National Day.]]
The [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|active opposition]] of the [[Spanish Government]] to self-determination combined with the negative posture of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], strengthened the resolution of the vast majority of the Gibraltarians to press ahead for their [[decolonisation]] by the year 2000 in accordance with the high principles of the Charter and the target date set by the United Nations to eradicate [[colonialism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Instead, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], proposed joint sovereignty with Spain, which further intensified the sense of [[national identity]] reinforced by the National Day.

The 10th National Day, held in 2001 included a speech by [[William Serfaty]], the then leader of the SDGG, which stressed the themes of national identity, unity, resisting Spanish pressure and decolonisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.self-determination.gi/speeches.htm SDGG Speech 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912080130/http://www.self-determination.gi/speeches.htm |date=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to format ===
Subsequent National Days have comparatively been quieter affairs with fewer invited guests and shorter political speeches. In 2007 the running of the [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] was taken over by the Government from the SDGG. In July 2008 the Government announced they would change the format of National Day to take effect the same year. The main change was their decision to no longer organise a political rally. The reason given was to emphasise civic celebration of Gibraltar rather than political revindication. Other changes included relocating the main event to the smaller John Mackintosh Square from Grand Casemates Square, appointing the [[Mayor of Gibraltar]] to conduct the main event rather than any political leader, the presentation of the [[Gibraltar Medallion of Honour]] and the reading of the Gibraltar National Day Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2008/181-2008.pdf Government of Gibraltar Press Release – Format changes to National Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113171242/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2008/181-2008.pdf |date=2009-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Gibraltar National Day events begin with a children’s [[costume party|fancy dress]] competition held at the lobby of the Parliament building in [[Main Street, Gibraltar|Main Street]] followed by a [[street party]] at John Mackintosh Square where food and drink stalls are set up providing [[Gibraltarian cuisine|Gibraltarian food]] such as [[calentita]]. Later a selected school choir sings songs with a Gibraltar theme, namely ''[[Llévame Donde Nací]]'' and ''[[Virgencita de Europa]]''. This is followed by the main event, the Mayor's recitation of the names of the recipients of the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour and the reading of the Gibraltar National Day Declaration from atop the City Hall's balcony. This was previously followed by the [[balloon release|traditional release]] from atop the Parliament building of 30,000 red and white [[balloon]]s, representing [[Demographics of Gibraltar|Gibraltar's population]], which had featured on this day since 1992.&lt;ref name=MoD /&gt; The balloon release tradition has been ended this year due to the threat that it poses to wildlife, marine wildlife in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gibraltar ends annual balloon release on environmental grounds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/07/gibraltar-ends-annual-balloon-release-on-environmental-grounds|accessdate=7 July 2016|agency=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the school choir leads the general public in the singing of the [[Gibraltar Anthem]].&lt;ref name=events09&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/images/stories/PDF/pressoffice/pressreleases/2009/175-2009.pdf Government of Gibraltar – Gibraltar National Day events 2009]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[funday]] for children featuring [[bouncy castle]]s and [[fairground ride]]s is then held at Grand Casemates Square. There is live music is played all afternoon at [[Governor’s Parade]] (the ''Piazzella'') and the [[Rock on the Rock Club]], all free of charge, as opposed to the [[Gibraltar Music Festival]] a paid event leading up to national day.

Since 2007, there has been a [[verbena (fair)|verbena]] for the older members of the community.

The day culminates with a half-hour-long synchronised [[fireworks]] display released from the [[Detached Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|Detached Mole]] in the [[Gibraltar Harbour]] at night followed by a [[rock concert]].&lt;ref name=events09 /&gt;

== Political rally ==
[[File:GIBRALTAR NATIONAL DAY 2013 - 238 (9716882215).jpg|thumb|[[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] [[Fabian Picardo]] delivering his speech during the 2013 National Day political rally]]
In 2008, the Government announced that it would change the format of ''Gibraltar National Day'' celebrations with effect from this year. This followed the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006|new Constitution]] in which Britain recognised Gibraltar's right to self-determination. The changes to the format were intended to emphasise Gibraltar's civic celebration rather than political revindication. There would be a gathering of the community at John Mackintosh Square for a collective celebratory event.

The SDGG returned from its state of inactivity and organised a political rally at Grand Casemates Square featuring the leader of the SDGG, and those of the Opposition political parties: [[Gibraltar Liberal Party]] and the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Gibraltar)|Progressive Democratic Party]]. The event was scheduled to last a maximum of 30–45 minutes, allowing those participating to attend the main event of civic functions held at John Mackintosh Square. Speeches were short (around 5 minutes) kept to the leader of the SDGG and those of the other three parties. The event was well attended and seen as a success.

The [[Gibraltar Social Democrats|GSD]] Government did not send a representative as they considered the main rally held at John Mackintosh Square to be the only ''official'' one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2008/198-2008.pdf Government of Gibraltar Press Release – Government does not support the National Day political rally] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113171853/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2008/198-2008.pdf |date=2009-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gibraltar Medallion of Honour ==
{{Main|Gibraltar Medallion of Honour}}
In July 2008, the [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]], [[Peter Caruana]] announced that the Government would establish a civic award scheme, to be known as the [[Gibraltar Medallion of Honour]], which would be awarded by [[Gibraltar Parliament|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gi/locals/news.php?action=view_article&amp;type=todays&amp;article=3470 Gibraltar Medallion of Honour]&lt;/ref&gt; The award is formally presented annually by the [[Mayor of Gibraltar]] prior to the release of the balloons on ''Gibraltar National Day''.&lt;ref name=weare&gt;[http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=17178 Gibraltar Chronicle – 'We Are Gibraltar'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927140859/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=17178 |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small community of '''Greeks in Denmark'''. {{asof|2009|10}}, [[Statistics Denmark]] recorded 1,180 people of Greek origin living in [[Denmark]], with 954 in [[Zealand]], 177 in [[Jutland]], 48 in [[Funen]], and 1 in [[Bornholm]].&lt;ref name="Statistikbanken"/&gt;

==History==
Unskilled migrants began coming from [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]] and [[Kastoria (regional unit)|Kastoria]] to Denmark in the 1960s; they worked primarily in the fur trade. Most of those initial migrants have returned to Greece as this sector became economically depressed. Political refugees fleeing the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] were numerically minor, but evoked a great deal of sympathy from the politically liberal Danish population.&lt;ref name="Christou"&gt;{{harvnb|Christou|2008|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Greek [[international student]]s choosing Denmark as their destination showed an uptick after 1981, when Greece became a member of the [[European Economic Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christou|2008|p=196}}. She actually refers to the "[[European Union]]", which is chronologically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender issues==
Many migrants consist of Greek men in [[international marriage]]s with Danish women. The number of Greek women married to Danish men is smaller. Either way, such relationships have an unusually high rate of divorce. Spouses typically return to Greece if they separate from their Danish partner.&lt;ref name="Christou" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">'''Insular Danish''' (Danish: ''Ømål'') are the traditional [[Danish dialects]] spoken on the [[Danish Islands|islands]] of [[Zealand]], [[Langeland]], [[Funen]], Falstria, [[Lolland]] and [[Møn]]. They are recorded in the Dictionary of Danish Insular Danish (''Ømålsordbogen'')&lt;ref&gt;Ømålsordbogen. En sproglig-saglig ordbog over dialekterne på Sjælland, Møn, Lolland-Falster, Fyn og omliggende øer, 1992 ff. København.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been collected since the 1920s, and published in biannual volumes since 1992. There are significant differences between the different insular varieties, but they also share a number of features. A major difference is between Modern Danish and the traditional insular dialects are that some of them lack the [[stød]] but kept the tonal accent. Also, they kept three noun genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/oemaal/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=Ømål}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genders ==
Insular Danish kept three [[grammatical gender]]s, but most other Danish varieties reduced the gender system to two. By 1900, [[Zealand]] insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under the influence from the standard language, but other varieties like [[Funen]] dialect had not.

==Personal pronouns==
The old Insular or Funen dialect could also use personal pronouns in certain cases, particularly to refer to animals.&lt;ref&gt;Arboe, T. (2008). Pronominal repræsentation i danske dialekter. 12. Møde om Udforskningen af Dansk Sprog, 29-38. {{cite web |url=http://muds.dk/rapporter/MUDS_12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072643/http://muds.dk/rapporter/MUDS_12.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence "Katti, han får unger" (literally, ''The cat, he is having kittens''). The cat is masculine in gender and so referred to as ''han'' ("he") even if it is a female cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/navneordenes_koen/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=Naveneordernes køn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Inuit]] dolls''' are made out of [[soapstone]] and [[bone]], materials common to the people of northern [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]] and [[Northern Canada]]. Many are clothed with animal [[fur]] or skin. Their clothing articulates the traditional style of dress necessary to survive cold winters, wind, and snow. Dolls could have been gifts to young Inuit girls, to be used as teaching devices and passing down of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these dolls, young girls learn various skills necessary for their survival such as skin preparation, cutting &amp; sewing, proper use of materials, designs and significance of symbols in their cultures. Inuit dolls were enjoyed by both young and old Inuit individuals and give an excellent insight into Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|last=Strickler|first=Eva|publisher=Canadian Stage &amp; Arts Publications Ltd.|year=1988|isbn=0919952380|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest found [[dolls]] were made by Inuit living in [[Brooman Point Village]], [[Bathurst Island (Nunavut)|Bathurst Island]] over two thousand years ago. Since the migration of humans over the [[Beringia|land bridge]] in the [[Bering Strait]], these dolls were common in [[Inuit culture]]. While the history of creating these dolls are unknown, the tradition may have started over 1,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/dolls/doinu01e.shtml|title=Civilization.ca - Timeless Treasures - Inuit Dolls from Prehistory to Today|website=www.historymuseum.ca|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least two different types of Inuit dolls from the [[Canadians|Canadian]] region, Play dolls and Collector's Dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Play Dolls===

At the young age of ten, Inuit girls are taught by their mothers how the clothe a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly taught by learning to sew making their own dolls with removable clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Inuit Packing Dolls exhibit shares culture|last=Miller|first=Heather Andrews|date=November 1, 2010|work=|newspaper=Alberta Sweetgrass|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn about the roles of wives and mothers by playing with these dolls. Once Inuit people moved to camps and settlements, young girls started going to school and started learning different kinds of lessons and schools. This change in education for young Inuit girls, the play dolls began disappearing. The last [[generation]] to grow up with the play dolls were girls from the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|last=Strickler|first=Eva|publisher=Canadian Stage &amp; Arts Publications Ltd.|year=1988|isbn=0919952380|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collector's Dolls ===

These dolls were typically made by Inuit people for people in the south. Some are owned by museums and others are owned by private collectors and institutions. The collector’s dolls were divided into four categories: dolls dressed in traditional fur garments, wearing fabric garments, made by elders from [[Taloyoak|Spence Bay]], and lastly made by the best dollmakers in [[Taloyoak|Spence Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|last=Strickler|first=Eva|publisher=Canadian Stage &amp; Arts Publications Ltd.|year=1988|isbn=0919952380|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dolls made by elders are full of energy and imagination. They are sculptures made from fur and fabric. Some are reminders of what the culture used to be like and others are just fantasy of the imagination the dollmaker. The dolls made by Spence Bay’s best dollmakers are full of intense artistry. Dolls could have been made from [[caribou]] antler to create a certain texture. Dollmakers could have also used [[soapstone]] to create eyes and generate certain emotions and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Issenman|first=Betty|date=1989-01-01|title=Review of Inuit Dolls: Reminders of a Heritage|jstor=40510866|journal=Arctic|volume=42|issue=4|pages=377–378|doi=10.14430/arctic1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dollmakers have also made dolls specifically called Packing Dolls that generally wear an [[amauti]]. Packing dolls refer to dolls that have a [[parka]] that is designed with a baby pouch tailored as part of the mother’s clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Inuit Packing Dolls exhibit shares culture|last=Miller|first=Heather Andrews|date=November 1, 2010|work=|newspaper=Alberta Sweetgrass|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iranian Arabs''' ({{lang-ar|عرب إيران}} ''ʿArab Īrān''; {{lang-fa|عرب‌های ايران}} ''Arabhāye Irān'') refers to the citizens or residents of [[Iran]] who are ethnically [[Arab]]. Iranian Arabs form around 2% of Iran's population which is around 1.5 million people.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

==Overview==
The Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 AD. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]]), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the "Arab" conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia. The Arab expedition to Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result of the joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al-madar) as well as the desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar).&lt;ref name=IranicaDaniel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Daniel |first=E. L. | title= Arab settlements in Iran | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2011-04-09|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arab-iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Minorities at Risk]] Project 2001, about 40% of Arabs are unskilled workers living in urban areas. The Arabs in the rural areas are primarily farmers and fishermen. The Arabs living along the Persian Gulf coastal plains are mostly pastoral nomads. Tribal loyalties are strong among rural Arabs, but also have an influence in urban areas. These affect Arab socialisation and politicisation.&lt;ref name="homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/iran_081205.doc Iran Overview from [[British Home Office]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718101816/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/iran_081205.doc |date=2009-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Payame Noor University]], which has 229 campuses throughout the country, in 2008 declared that Arabic will be the "second language" of the university, and that all its services will be offered in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], concurrent with [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiozamaaneh.com/news/2008/03/post_4081.html رادیو زمانه | خبر اول | ایران | عربی دومین زبان دانشگاه پیام نور شد&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Shapur II|Shapur II the Great]] (309–379 A.D.) of the [[Sassanid Empire]], after a [[punitive expedition]] across the Persian Gulf early in his reign, transplanted several clans of the [[Taghleb]] to Dārzīn (Daharzīn) near [[Bam, Iran|Bam]], several clans of the [[Abd al-Qays]] and [[Tamīm]] to Haǰar (the Kūh-e Hazār region) southeast of [[Kermān]], several clans of the [[Banu Bakr|Bakr ben Wāʾel]] to Kermān, and several clans of the [[Hanzala]] to Tavvaz, near present-day [[Dalaki|Dālakī]] in [[Fārs]].&lt;ref name=IranicaOberling&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Oberling and Hourcade |first=P.and B. | title= Arab tribes of Iran | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2011-04-09|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arab-iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although after the Arab conquest of the Sassanid Persian empire in the 7th century, many Arab tribes settled in different parts of Iran, it is the Arab tribes of [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]] that have retained their identity in language, culture, and Shia Islam to the present day. But ethno-linguistic characteristics of the region must be studied against the long and turbulent history of the province, with its own local language ''khuzi'', which may have been of [[Elamite]] origin  and which gradually disappeared in the early medieval period. The immigration of Arab tribes from outside the province was also a long-term process. There was a great influx of Arab-speaking immigrants into the province from the 16th to the 19th century, including the migration of the [[Banu Kaab]] and [[Banu Lam]]. There were attempts by the Iraqi regime during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–88) to generate Arab nationalism in the area but without any palpable success.&lt;ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Sampling [[Y-Chromosome|NRY]] diversity, it was found that the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] [[Haplogroup F-M89 (Y-DNA)|haplogroups F]] and [[Haplogroup J-M172 (Y-DNA)|J2]] are carried at very high frequency among the Iranian Arabs—those two markers alone accounting for over half of Iranian Arab haplogroups.&lt;ref name="Nasidze"&gt;Nasidze, I., Quinque, D., Rahmani, M., Alemohamad, S. A. and Stoneking, M. (2008), "Close Genetic Relationship Between Semitic-speaking and Indo-European-speaking Groups in Iran." ''Annals of Human Genetics'', 72: 241–252.&lt;/ref&gt; This high ratio of [[Haplogroup F-M89 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup F]], in particular, relates them, in a genetic sense, to peoples of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and of the [[Barbary Coast]], while an elevated frequency of haplogroup J-M172 is typical of [[Levant|Near Eastern]] peoples and reflective of the genetic legacy of early agriculturalists in, and their [[Demic diffusion|diffusion]] from, the Neolithic Near East ''c''. 8000–4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;

===Khuzestan===
{{Main|Ahwazi Arabs}}
Most Iranian Arabs in [[Khūzestān Province]] are [[bilingual]], speaking [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as their mother tongue, and [[Persian language|Persian]] as a second language. The [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken in the province is [[Khuzestani Arabic]], which is a [[Iraqi Arabic|Mesopotamian]] dialect shared by Arabs across the border in [[Iraq]]. It can be easily understood by other Arabic-speakers.

From the immigrant Arab tribes of Khuzestan (from the present-day Iraq), the [[Banu Kaab]] at Dawraq (the later Fallāhīya and the present-day [[Shadegan]]) and the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Mawlāʾī]] at [[Hoveyzeh]] can be mentioned.&lt;ref name="tribesIranica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Towfīq|first=F|title=ʿAŠĀYER  "tribes" in Iran|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asayer-tribes|work=Encyclopædia Iranica.|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[Bani Turuf]] tribe is settled in the [[Dasht-e Azadegan County|Dasht e Azadegan]] (formerly Dasht-e Mīshān) around the town of Hūzagān (formerly [[Hoveyzeh]]), and consists of seven tribes, the Sovārī, Marzaā, Shorfa, Banī Sāleh, Marvān, Qāṭeʿ, and Sayyed Nemat. North of the lands of the ʿAnāfeja of the Āl Katīr, in the area called Mīānāb, between the Kārūn and [[Karkheh River]]s, dwell several Arab tribes, of which the best known are the Kaab (probably an offshoot of the Banī Kaʿb of southern Khuzestan), the ʿAbd al khānī, the Mazraa, the Al Bū Rāwīya, and the Sādāt. These tribes gradually immigrated into Iran during and after the early years of the Qajar period.&lt;ref name="tribesIranica"/&gt;

===Fars===
{{Main|Khamseh Arabs}}
[[Khamseh Arabs|Khamseh Arab]] nomads live in eastern [[Fars Province]] (From Lar and close surrounding areas to Khorrambid and Bavanat). Arabs that live in eastern Fars Province and Hormozgan mostly belong to the tribes of [[Banu Tamim]], [[Banu Kaab]] and [[Banu Hammed]].

===Khorasan===
{{Main|Arabs in Khorasan}}
Most [[Arabs in Khorasan|Khorasani-Arabs]] belong to the tribes of [[Sheyban]]i, [[Zangooyi]], [[Mishmast]], [[Khozaima]] and [[Azdi]]. [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] Arabs are Persian speakers and only a few speak Arabic as their mother tongue. Khorasani-Arabs in the cities [[Birjand]], [[Mashhad]] and [[Nishapur]] are a big ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Arabs. Filip Hetti 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Elton Daniel in ''The History of Iran'' (Greenwood Press, 2001), states that the Arabs of Iran ''"are concentrated in the province of Khuzistan and number about half a million"''.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Iran (Greenwood Press, 2001), (pg. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historical Dictionary of Iran'' puts the number at 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. (1995) p.172&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian Arabs form 2% of Iran's population.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10834">The '''Irish Exhibition of Living Art''' ('''IELA''') was a yearly exhibition of Irish abstract expressionism and avant-garde Irish art that was started in 1943 by [[Mainie Jellett]].&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Doherty|first=Brian|title=In Dublin: Pubs, Poets, Painters-Alive, Alive-O|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/116068288/|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 Aug 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===World War II Ireland===
During World War II, Ireland remained mostly uninvolved in the war that swept through most the rest of Europe, known only as "the Emergency" in Ireland.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Caleb|title=That is only war: Irish writers and the emergency|journal=UMI Dissertations Publishing|year=2006|pages=2–4|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304978789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking a "neutral" stance in the war, Ireland did not engage directly in the war on either side and declined to make any kind of established allegiance to the Axis or Allied powers.  As a result, Ireland experienced a period of isolation from the rest of the Western world, with few Irishmen travelling abroad and few foreigners travelling to Ireland.  This period of isolation set in motion a period of criticism and questioning of the fledgling country's national identity and ideals, with various factions unhappy with the status quo in the island nation.   Some of the primary concerns for those unsatisfied with the state of the Ireland at the time included a government unconcerned with the republican ideals the nation was created with, widespread poverty in Ireland, and a general inability for the nation to be a major player on the world stage capable of defending itself.  With these concerns and isolation, the Irish people sought to question the direction Ireland was headed in.  And in this war period and the time that immediately followed, Ireland and its artists also sought to question what constituted "Irish art" and how that would impact Irish identity.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar /&gt;

===Art In Ireland===
Art in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s still primarily consisted of traditional representational art.  Championed by the Royal Hibernian Academy and the National College of Art, this traditionalist art remained the favored style of visual artistic creation following the Emergency period.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the this sentence and the previous one|date=April 2015}} Many Irish artists rejected the established institutions and sought philosophical inspiration from other fields, particularly that of literature.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency /&gt; Although it was not until the late 1930s that the character of Irish art was to be seriously challenged as Irish artists began seeking an Irish artistic identity.  With artists like Mainie Jellett leading the way, artists of Ireland, who more frequently received no formal education due to some of the institutions more restrictive policies, found an outlet to challenge the traditionalist movements in Ireland through organizations like the IELA.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Roisin|title=The emergency: a turning point for Irish art?|journal=Circa|year=2000|pages=1–2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1320756901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the opening of the IELA, only one major exhibition took place each year in Dublin, which was the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy.  The RHA, and other major art institutions in Ireland at this time, supported art that accurately portrayed reality.&lt;ref name=LivingArt&gt;{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=John|title=A Painter of Living Art: Jack P. Hanlon 1913-1968|journal=|year=1988|pages=222|doi=10.2307/20492069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the established art forums favored traditional representational art, there was some push back from groups of artists in favor of modernist art.  One of the most well-known of these prior to the IELA was known as the [[White Stag Group]] which was formed in the late 1930s.  The White Stag Group, formed by Kenneth Hall and Basil Rakoczi, had middle-class English roots that eventually took hold in Dublin and the rest of Ireland. It wasn't until organizations like the IELA and White Stag Group came about that non-traditional Irish art had a means of being displayed in a way that was accessible and popular.&lt;ref name=Stag&gt;{{cite book|last=Keown, Edwina|first=and Carol Taaffe|title=Irish Modernism|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Publishers|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iu5qMGrr3QcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the IELA==
The IELA was formed in 1943 after a group of middle-class artists in Ireland sought to oppose the traditional hegemony created by the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) and the National College of Art in Ireland.  Artists in this group included [[Norah McGuinness]], [[Mainie Jellett]], [[Evie Hone]], Fr. [[Jack Hanlon (Priest and Painter)|Jack Hanlon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]], among others.&lt;ref name=IELAbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/irish-exhibition-living-art|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|work=British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of them subscribed completely to the modernism of the rest of western Europe and the United States, these artists did seek to stray off the path established by Irish art institutions.  Many artists that founded the IELA were influenced by the dissenting Impressionist art circles in Paris who broke away from the French Academy.  Even though they understood this may cause friction with established institutions in Ireland, many of the founders saw the French as an example to be followed.  However, many artists managed to form a delicate balance, seeing as artists who displayed their work in the IELA also displayed pieces through the other traditional institutions such as the RHA.  Nonetheless, the IELA's main goal was to provide a forum for artists who sought to reshape the Irish artistic landscape and provided them the means through which to do that.&lt;ref name=LivingArt /&gt;

The beginnings of the IELA can be traced to an open criticism of the RHA by Jellett which ultimately led to other modernist artists like le Brocquy having their works rejected for exhibitions hosted annually by the RHA.  In response to this, Jellett and other modernist artists established the IELA to create a forum to display the work of artists regardless of what school or style they subscribed to.  Reviews of the IELA's first show in 1943 indicated the division in the art world over artistic identity and creativity.&lt;ref name=IELAhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-exhibition-of-living-art.htm|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) (1943-1980s)|work=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|publisher=History and Foundation of the IELA|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some instances, this division was deeply entrenched, especially in the National College of Art, which was opposed to modernist movements for some time.  However, this opposition was not felt as strongly in every established institution in the country.  Even though steadfastness for traditional art was common, much of the art world in Ireland remained fairly well connected and eased their opposition to the tide of modernism coming from continent-inspired artists.  Both the modernist and traditionalist camps had their work displayed by the same institutions in some instances.  Ultimately, this coexistence allowed for institutions like IELA to be friendly with organizations such as the RHA, without which the IELA would have no traction in the Dublin art world.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

Not only did the IELA seek to break from the traditional norms of Irish art, it was displayed some progressive trends for its time, whether intentionally or otherwise.  For example, women artists played a critical role in the formation and establishment of the IELA.  The first two presidents of the Exhibition, Mainie Jellett and Norah McGuinness, were women who held the position during the formative years of the Exhibition.  Jellett, who served as the president before her death in 1944, played a key role in its formation, and McGuinness, who served for over 20 years after its foundation, played a critical role in maintaining the direction that the IELA stood for.&lt;ref name=WomenArtists&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayes, Elizabeth, Jeni Rogers, Wanda Ryan-Smolin|title=Irish Women Artists: From the 18th Century to the Present Day|journal=|year=1990|pages=45–49|jstor=1358389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following its conception, the IELA became a fixture in the Irish art world.  However, while they did become established, they did not allow themselves to lose sight of the founding principles of the institution.  True to the spirit of the IELA, the original management stepped down and handed off the Exhibition to a younger generation of artists in 1972.  The IELA continued to influence young artists well into the future.&lt;ref name=HistofIreland&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=J. R.|title=A New History of Ireland, Volume VII: Medieval Ireland 1921-1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=606–607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfFXarIhGqEC&amp;pg=PT84&amp;lpg=PT84&amp;dq=A+New+History+of+Ireland,+Volume+VII&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=86rx_eRc1m&amp;sig=6b7_13lLlYMHNVISv3W-mEt_Ows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Os0qVcq4AoewggTgvYG4BQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Irish%20Exhibition%20of%20Living%20Art%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, the IELA remains a showcase for contemporary art and has since expanded to include other art forms such as performance, video, and installation art.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;  The IELA has played an enormous role in developing the Irish art scene and providing an outlet through which the artists of Ireland can display their works while also challenging the norm in Irish art, even being called a part of the "birth of Modernism in the visual arts in Ireland."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lilliput|first=Dorothy|title=Knowing the difference Brian Kennedy welcomes a 'splendid' history of Irish modern art|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=142626&amp;sr=HLEAD(Knowing%20the%20difference%20Brian%20Kennedy%20welcomes%20a%20%60splendid%20history%20of%20Irish%20modern%20art)%20and%20date%20is%201998|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 Jan 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Exhibition even expanded to include postmodernist art to expose both the public and artists alike to new developing styles.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

'''James Onanefe Ibori''' (born 4 August 1959) is a Nigerian politician who was [[List of Governors of Delta State|Governor]] of [[Delta State]] in [[Nigeria]] from 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007. An ethnic [[Urhobo People|Urhobo]] by descent, Ibori is a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP). He is an influential leader in the [[Niger Delta]] region and a national figure in Nigeria.

==Early life==
Born to the family of late Chief Ukavbe Ibori and Mrs. Comfort Oji Ibori of Otefe in [[Oghara]] clan, [[Ethiope West]] Local Government Area of [[Delta State]], he attended Baptist High School, Oghareki, now Oghareki Grammar School, before proceeding to the [[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]] where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Economics]] and [[Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Constitution Amendment Must Allow Popular Will, Says Eyinne  | newspaper = ''[[AllAfrica.com]]''  | publisher = AllAfrica Global Media  | date = 24 February 2006 | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200602240267.html  | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ibori moved to [[London]], [[England]] in the 1980s where he married his wife, Theresa. He worked as a cashier at [[Wickes]] [[DIY]] store in [[Ruislip]], [[Middlesex]]. In 1990, the couple were arrested for theft from the store, and fined £300. In 1991, he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card, and fined £100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2130593/James-Ibori-Wickes-cashier-governor-oil-rich-Nigerian-state-scam.html#ixzz1sJzvJVAD | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Simon | last=Tomlinson | title=Former Wickes cashier who became governor of oil-rich Nigerian state jailed for 13 years as judge says £50m fraud figure may be 'ludicrously low' | date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Nigeria, between 1994 and 1997 he served as a consultant to the Federal Government of President [[Sani Abacha]], in the areas of public policy formulation and implementation. 
In 1999, Ibori took out a mortgage on a property in [[Abbey Road]], London. To mask his previous convictions in the UK, he obtained a false birth certificate and then passport, medically impossible as it was dated a month after his elder sisters birthdate.&lt;ref name=BBC17184075&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17184075 | work=BBC News | title=James Ibori: How a thief almost became Nigeria's president | date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Ibori's political career began in 1990 when he joined the [[National Republican Convention]] (NRC). In 1991, he was nominated to contest for the Federal House of Representatives seat, to represent Ethiope Federal Constituency. He lost the election to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate.

When the Sani Abacha Transition Programme kicked off, he joined the [[Grassroots Democratic Movement]] (GDM). The GDM clinched a good number of local, state and federal positions, including one of the three senatorial seats in the state. The transition programme was abruptly terminated with the death of Abacha. Ibori then with the leaders of other defunct political groups in Delta State, formed the Delta National Congress (DNC).

The DNC later merged with many others of like ideas to birth the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Peoples Democratic Party]] (PDP). It was on the platform of the PDP that he contested and won the January 9, 1999 Delta State Gubernatorial Election.

Proposed as governor of Delta State, under Nigerian law Ibori had to swear that he had no previous convictions. Using the false birth certificate and passport that he had used for the mortgage application in London, he passed the tests falsely, and was elected to become the governor from 1999.&lt;ref name=BBC17184075/&gt; In 2003, he was re-elected as governor for another four-year term.

At the PDP's ruling party's pre-election convention in 2006, Ibori was on hand to lift up the hand of the victorious [[Umaru Yar'Adua]]. After Yar'Adua was selected as their presidential candidate, Ibori was accused of bank-rolling Yar'Adua's 2007 campaign, and promised a Vice-Presidential position in return. But after Yar'Adua died in office, Vice-President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] succeeded Yar'Adua, an avowed political opponent of Ibori.&lt;ref name=BBC17184075/&gt;

==Corruption charges==

===United Kingdom charges===
Ibori's corruption charges started with filling of petitions by his kinsmen under the auspices of Delta State Elders and Stateholders Forum influenced by the foremost Ijaw leader, [[Chief E. K. Clark]], OFR, CON who was also the former Minister of Information. The petition was sent to [[Nuhu Ribadu]],the head of Nigeria's financial crimes agencies who initially failed to act on the petition which made the Forum, who, with other activists, revealed Ibori's crimes and made spirited efforts to bring Ibori and EFCC before court to compel Ibori's prosecution with the aid of their lawyer Kayode Ajulo.

In 2007, the [[Metropolitan Police]] raided the London offices of lawyer Bhadresh Gohil. Hidden in a wall behind a fireplace, they found computer [[hard drive]]s containing details of a myriad off-shore companies, run for Ibori by Gohil, fiduciary agent Daniel Benedict McCann, and corporate financier Lambertus De Boer. All of these men were later jailed for a total of 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2130593/James-Ibori-Wickes-cashier-governor-oil-rich-Nigerian-state-scam.html#ixzz1sLApsWeM | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Simon | last=Tomlinson | title=Former Wickes cashier who became governor of oil-rich Nigerian state jailed for 13 years as judge says £50m fraud figure may be 'ludicrously low' | date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these corruption allegations, the United Kingdom courts froze Ibori's assets there, valued at about £17 million ($35 million), in early August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Estelle  |last=Shirbon |title=Britain freezes assets of former governor |url=http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=86&amp;art_id=nw20070806134708872C996099 |work=Reuters (IOL) |publisher= Independent News &amp; Media|date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Nkoyo, was arrested at [[Heathrow Airport]] in London on 1 November 2007, in connection with the probe of the assets of her husband, particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Airport 'arrest' for Nigeria wife |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7074573.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher= BBC|date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released after being questioned. In an exclusive interview with [[CNN]], Ibori denied allegations against him claiming they were politically motivated. He accused [[Nuhu Ribadu]] and the UK Courts of playing politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2010/03/16/purefoy.nigeria.corruption.cnn?iref=allsearch |title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First set of Nigerian charges===
On December 12, 2007, Ibori was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at the Kwara State Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Ige, Ise-Oluwa; Emmanuel Ulayi (2007-12-12).

These corruption charges brought against Ibori by the government of former President Obasanjo are among many begun by anticorruption czar [[Nuhu Ribadu]] against former officials of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP. Ribadu additionally alleged that Ibori attempted to bribe him to drop the charges with a cash gift of $15 million, which Ribadu immediately lodged in the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN. The cash remains in the CBN as an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://saharareporters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4056:iboris-goose-and-ribadus-trumpet&amp;catid=81:external-contrib&amp;Itemid=300|title=Ibori’s Goose and Ribadu’s Trumpet|publisher=Saharareporters.com|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, A Federal High Court sitting in Asaba, Delta State, discharged and acquitted Ibori of all 170 charges of corruption brought against him by EFCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5498438-146/story.csp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820121243/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5498438-146/story.csp |date=August 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFCC filed a notice of appeal against the December 17, 2009 judgement, and has begun a new round of investigations on the former governor following a petition by members of the Delta State Elders, Leaders and Stakeholders Forum, which was made available to the public in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5540578-146/ibori_faces_new_investigation__.csp |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322220749/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5540578-146/ibori_faces_new_investigation__.csp |archivedate=March 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second set of Nigerian charges===
In April 2010, about three months after the take over of government by [[Goodluck Jonathan]], Ibori's case file was reopened. A new allegation that he embezzled N40 billion ($266 million) was pressed against him. Attempts to arrest him were unsuccessful. It was reported that he fled from [[Abuja]] to [[Lagos]] and then to the creeks of [[Oghara]], his homeland in the [[Niger Delta]]. It was reported that he has been guarded by armed militias and they once had a shoot out with government security forces. He claimed that the charges were frivolous and that he was a victim of political persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/43966/1/Security-forces-set-for-showdown-with-Ibori/Page1.html |accessdate=April 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425183416/http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/43966/1/Security-forces-set-for-showdown-with-Ibori/Page1.html |archivedate=April 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8634835.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria attack halts Ibori arrest | date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Ibori fled Nigeria, prompting the EFCC to request the assistance of [[Interpol]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20111002094443/http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art201004265464445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/sat/index.php/front-page-articles/931-ibori-still-in-nigeria-intelligence-report.html |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503000244/http://www.tribune.com.ng/sat/index.php/front-page-articles/931-ibori-still-in-nigeria-intelligence-report.html |archivedate=May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 2010 the Governor of the CBN, Malam Sanusi Lamido revealed that Ibori had used Delta State as collateral for N40 billion loan when he was governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassnewspaper.com/NG/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63067:ibori-uses-delta-state-as-collateral-for-n40-billion-loan-says-cbn-governor-&amp;catid=672:top-stories&amp;Itemid=794 |accessdate=July 12, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest in Dubai, extradition to UK===
On 13 May 2010, Ibori was arrested in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] under Interpol arrest warrants, issued from United Kingdom courts and enacted by the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art2010051311295937|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20100522091632/http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art2010051311295937|deadurl=yes|title=The Punch:: Ibori arrested in Dubai- Report|date=22 May 2010|archivedate=22 May 2010|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huhuonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1572:chief-james-onanefe-ibori-arrested-in-uaedubai&amp;catid=103:more-news |title=FCT New Transport Policy: Mr. President, Can You Please Fire Bala Mohammed? |publisher=huhuonline |date= |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/05/13/ibori-arraigned-in-dubai-2/ |title=Ibori arraigned in Dubai - Vanguard News |publisher=Vanguardngr.com |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibori was granted bail pending an extradition hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saharareporters.com/real-news/sr-headlines/6067-uk-police-confirms-iboris-arrest-in-dubai.html |accessdate=May 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515054050/http://www.saharareporters.com/real-news/sr-headlines/6067-uk-police-confirms-iboris-arrest-in-dubai.html |archivedate=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20111002095021/http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art20100514630756&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saharareporters.com/real-news/sr-headlines/6069-ibori-granted-bail-plans-escape-from-dubai.html |accessdate=May 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515054131/http://www.saharareporters.com/real-news/sr-headlines/6069-ibori-granted-bail-plans-escape-from-dubai.html |archivedate=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed that the United Kingdom would "seek Mr Ibori's extradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/7720634/Nigerian-politician-faces-extradition-to-Britain-on-money-laundering-charges.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Damien | last=McElroy | title=Nigerian politician faces extradition to Britain on money laundering charges | date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibori's case and extradition became one of the longest, most complex and expensive operations mounted by [[Scotland Yard]] in recent years. Prosecutors alleged that companies owned by Ibori and his family were beneficiaries from the sale of state assets, including shares in a mobile telephone operator, as well as crude oil deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy |first=Damien |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/7720634/Nigerian-politician-faces-extradition-to-Britain-on-money-laundering-charges.html |title=Nigerian politician faces extradition to Britain on money laundering charges |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFCC confirmed on Thursday June 10, 2010, that Ibori was in custody awaiting extradition to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5579242-146/dubai_revokes_iboris_bail__.csp |accessdate=June 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614182527/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5579242-146/dubai_revokes_iboris_bail__.csp |archivedate=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction of Associates===
In London, where Ibori is being sought in the case of money laundering, the authority continued with the prosecution of his associates who were in the dock for helping Ibori to launder money.

On 1st and 2 June 2010, UK juries found James Ibori's sister, Christine Ibie-Ibori&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/48541/1/UK-court-convicts-Iboris-sister/Page1.html |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605192242/http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/48541/1/UK-court-convicts-Iboris-sister/Page1.html |archivedate=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his associate, Udoamaka Okoronkwo, guilty on counts of money laundering, in a verdict delivered at the Southwark Crown Court, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/Metro/Crime/5575623-146/uk_court_declares_iboris_associate_guilty.csp |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605180425/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/Metro/Crime/5575623-146/uk_court_declares_iboris_associate_guilty.csp |archivedate=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. James Ibori, via his media aide released a statement questioning the validity of the verdict which he claimed absolved the two other women, Ms Okoronkwo and Adebimpe Pogoson who were charged alongside his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/front-page-news/6274-london-court-convicts-iboris-sister-ex-delta-gov-rejects-verdict |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605055449/http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/front-page-news/6274-london-court-convicts-iboris-sister-ex-delta-gov-rejects-verdict |archivedate=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's verdict of 2 June 2010 however returned a guilty decision against Okoronkwo as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art2010060213531471|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20111002095403/http://www.punchontheweb.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art2010060213531471|deadurl=yes|title=The Punch:: UK Court indicts another Ibori‘s associate|date=2 October 2011|archivedate=2 October 2011|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Ibie-Ibori and Udoamaka Okoronkwo were each sentenced to 5 years in prison on Monday 7 June 2010 by the UK court even as the defense counsel pleaded for mercy that the convicts were merely manipulated by James Ibori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saharareporters.com/news/6223-iboris-associates-sentenced-to-21-years-in-prison.html |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609133131/http://www.saharareporters.com/news/6223-iboris-associates-sentenced-to-21-years-in-prison.html |archivedate=June 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction===
On 27 February 2012, accused of stealing US$250 million from the Nigerian public purse, Ibori pleaded guilty to ten counts of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud at [[Southwark Crown Court]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_BRITAIN_NIGERIA_IBORI?SITE=NDBIS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-02-27-14-47-07 |accessdate=March 2, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the guilty plea entered by Ibori, the EFCC brought before an Appeal Court the 6 year old ruling of a Federal High Court in Asaba which acquitted Ibori in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203010327.html | title=Nigeria: EFCC Awaits Appeal Court Date On Ibori's 170 Count Charges| author=RONALD MUTUM| publisher=All Africa| date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They EFCC sought the court  to set aside the ruling of the lower court on the grounds that the presiding judge, Justice Awokulehin, erred in law while delivering his judgement. A three-man panel of justices at the Benin Division of the Court of Appeal on May 15, 2014 ruled that the ex- governor has a case to answer. With this judgment, the coast is clear for Ibori to face further trial in Nigeria upon the completion of his jail term in London.

On Tuesday, April 17, 2012, Ibori was sentenced to 13 years by Southwark Crown Court for his crimes.&lt;ref name=BBC17739388&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17739388 | work=BBC News | title=Former Nigeria governor James Ibori jailed for 13 years | date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailytimes.com.ng/article/ibori-gets-13-year Ibori gets 13 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420020024/http://dailytimes.com.ng/article/ibori-gets-13-years |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among possessions confiscated were:&lt;ref name=BBC17739388/&gt;
*A house in [[Hampstead]], north London, for £2.2m
* A property in [[Shaftesbury]], [[Dorset]], for £311,000
* A £3.2m mansion in Sandton, near [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]
* A fleet of armoured [[Range Rover (L322)|Range Rovers]] valued at £600,000
* A £120,000 [[Bentley Continental GT]]
* A [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Maybach 57 and 62|Maybach 62]] bought for €407,000 cash, that was shipped direct to his mansion in South Africa

After the sentencing hearing, Sue Patten, head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] central fraud group, said it would bid to confiscate the assets Ibori had acquired his riches "at the expense of some of the poorest people in the world".&lt;ref name=BBC17739388/&gt;

==Release==
James Ibori was released from prison in December 2016 after a court order. He served 4 years out of the 13 years he was sentenced to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/218612-james-ibori-released-london-prison-reports.html|title=James Ibori released from London Prison - Reports - Premium Times Nigeria|date=21 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is indication of his arraignment in Nigeria courts as it is believed that his conviction in United Kingdom is not related to several other financial improprieties committed by him.

They are now found mainly in [[Sindh]] province and have become part of [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] community.

==History and present circumstances==

The Kasgar (from [[Persian language|Persian]] کاسگر meaning goblet-makers) are an occupational group who are makers of the '' kas kuza (Persian: کاسه کوزه)''  goblets and other earthen pots. They are concentrated in the [[Awadh]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh]].  Information regarding the origin of the community is obscure. They are similar to Muslim kumhar in west uttar pradesh.
The Kasgar are an endogamous community, and they practice both parallel and cross cousin marriages.

Among the Kasgar, the caste council known as a [[panchayat]], plays an important role in resolving disputes among the community.  They perceive themselves to be of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] status. The community is split by sectarian affiliation, with some members belonging to the [[Shia]] sects, while others are [[Sunni]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 746&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurds in Israel''' refers to people of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] origin residing in [[Israel]]. The Kurdish population in Israel is small and is mainly composed of individuals and families, who fled Iraq and Turkey during the [[Iraqi–Kurdish conflict|Iraqi–Kurdish]] and the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-he|טורקיה והכורדים: קלאב MAD}} [http://news.walla.co.il/item/967428]&lt;/ref&gt; during the 20th century, as well as temporal residents arriving in Israel for medical care.

==Population==
Historically, a small Arabized population of Kurdish origins exists in Galilee and Jerusalem area, though it has mostly intermixed with local Arabs; their exact numbers are not available since they are counted as ethnic Arabs in the official Israeli census. Some Arabized families of Kurdish background can still be identified by specific surnames.

The Kurdish population in Israel is small and is mainly composed of individuals and families, who fled Iraq and Turkey during the [[Iraqi–Kurdish conflict|Iraqi–Kurdish]] and the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]s during the 20th century. In 2006, the number of Kurdish refugees from Turkey was estimated at 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-he|טורקיה והכורדים: קלאב MAD}} [http://news.walla.co.il/item/967428]&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate for both Iraqi and Turkish Kurds was 150 persons in 2007.

In March 2001, a group of 19 Kurdish men entered Israel via Lebanon, asking for asylum, but were denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/law/clinics/english/Safe%20heaven.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2001, a group of 42 [[Kurdish refugees]] attempted to enter Israel via Lebanon, illegally crossing the Israeli–Lebanese border, but were returned to Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.725117|title=נדחתה בקשתם של 42 כורדים למקלט מדיני|date=10 August 2001|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 40 Iraqi Kurdish children, mostly from [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], were hosted with their parents and medically treated in Israel, as part of the project initiated by Israeli ''Save a Child’s Heart Organization'' (SACH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.org.il/eng|title=IMA -|first=Slavin-Internet|last=Technologies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was reported that Israel accepted three Kurdish children from Iraqi Kurdistan for medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2013/12/state7616.htm|title=Kurdish children from Iraqi Kurdistan receive medical treatment in Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were settled into Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, southern Tel Aviv area. They were some of the 183 children with Iraqi nationality, entering Israel for medical treatment since the establishment of the program.

In January 2015, Yazidi organizations made an official request from Israeli government to absorb Yazidi refugees from Iraq. There was no official statement by Israeli government as a result, but Yazidi sources claimed that refugee absorption took place and thanked Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/001-D-379131-00.html|title=News1 - האם ייתכן שישראל קלטה פליטים יזידים|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no response from Israeli Parliament members, upon asking them on this matter of absorbing Yazidi refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-yazidi-ambassador-explains-why-so-many-want-to-join-the-idf/|title=Israel’s Yazidi ‘ambassador’ explains why so many want to join the IDF |work=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Israeli Jewish community of Kurdistani background==
Israel is a home to some 200,000 Jews of [[History of the Jews in Kurdistan|Kurdistani]] origins, who are mostly descended from nearly 50 thousand Kurdish Jews evacuated from Iraq during [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]] in the early 1950s. [[Israeli Jews]] of Kurdistani background preserve ties with the ethnic Kurdish communities in the Middle East, including with the Kurdish individuals residing in Israel.

'''Lovari''' ("horse-dealer", from Hungarian "ló", ''horse'') is a subgroup of the [[Romani people]], who speak their own dialect, influenced by [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] dialects. They live  predominantly throughout [[Central Europe]] ([[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Germany]]) as well as in [[Romania]], [[Croatia]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Ukraine]].

==Ethnology==
The ''Lovari'' are a [[Romani people]] who speak a dialect influenced by [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] dialects. The Lovari are further divided into the '''Machvaya''', named after the [[Mačva]] region, which they settled from modern day Hungary.

==Employment==
Their historical trade was horse-trading and fortune-telling.

==Customs==
Lovari's traditional costume is based on traditional Central European Romani national costumes and is seldom used nowadays. They also have very strict contamination customs.

==Diaspora==
[[Tucson, Arizona]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]] both house large numbers of Machvaya as do the United States, Canada, [[Brazil]] and the United Kingdom as a whole.

The '''Ngalop''' ({{lang-dz|སྔལོངཔ་}} {{bo|w=snga long pa}}; "earliest risen people" or "first converted people" according to [[folk etymology]])&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; are people of [[Tibet]]an origin who migrated to [[Bhutan]] as early as the ninth century. Orientalists adopted the term "Bhote" or [[Bhotiya]], meaning "people of Bod ([[Tibet]])", a term also applied to the [[Tibetan people]], leading to confusion, and now is rarely used in reference to the Ngalop.

The Ngalop introduced [[Tibetan culture]] and [[Buddhism]] to Bhutan and comprise the dominant political and cultural element in modern Bhutan. Furthermore, cultural, ethnic, and linguistic identity in Bhutan are not always mutually exclusive. For these reasons, Ngalops are often simply identified as '''Bhutanese'''. Their language, [[Dzongkha]], is the national language and is descended from Old Tibetan. The Ngalop are dominant in western and northern Bhutan, including [[Thimphu]] and the Dzongkha-speaking region. The term Ngalop may subsume several related linguistic and cultural groups, such as the [[Kheng people]] and speakers of [[Bumthang language]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-EG&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Ethnic Groups |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-I&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Introduction |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The Ngalop are concentrated in the western and central valleys of Bhutan, whose total population in 2010 was about 708,500.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Together the Ngalop, [[Sharchops]] and tribal groups constituted up to 72 percent of the population in the late 1980s according to official Bhutanese statistics.&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-s&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Society |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1981 census claimed Sharchops represented 30% of the population and Ngalops about 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/bhutan/backgrounders/index.html |title=Bhutan Backgrounder |work=SATP online |publisher=South Asia Terrorism Portal |date=2002-09-20 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The World Factbook]]'', however, estimates the "Bhote" Ngalop and Sharchop populations together to total about 50 percent, or 354,200.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{CIA_World_Factbook_link|bt|Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming Sharchops still outnumber Ngalops some three to two, the total Ngalop population is around 141,700.

==Language==
Ngalops speak [[Dzongkha]]. As Ngalops are politically and culturally dominant in Bhutan, Dzongkha is the language of government and education throughout the kingdom. Other groups that identify as culturally Ngalop speak the [[Kheng language|Kheng]] and [[Bumthang language]]s. To a large extent, even the [[Sharchops]] of eastern Bhutan, who speak [[Tshangla language|Tshangla]], have adopted Ngalop culture and may identify as Ngalop.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS-EG"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-L&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Languages |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Ngalops largely follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]], particularly the [[Drukpa Lineage]] of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Vajrayana]] that is the [[state religion]] of Bhutan. A significant number also follow the [[Nyingma]] school, which was dominant in early [[history of Bhutan|Bhutanese history]].

===Bon===
{{main|Bon in Bhutan}}
[[Bon]] practitioners are a minority, although the practices of the Ngalops, like that of most Bhutanese, are characterized by incorporated elements of the older [[ethnic religion]] that is also referred to by the term ''Bon''.&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-RT&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Religious Tradition |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
The primary agricultural crops are [[Bhutanese red rice]], [[potato]]es, [[barley]], and other temperate climate crops. Ngalop people build houses out of timber, stone, clay, and brick. The Ngalop are also known for building large fortress-monasteries known as [[dzong architecture|dzong]]s that now serve as government offices. The [[Druk Gyalpo]] and most of the government are Ngalop, and all citizens of the country are required to follow the national dress code, the [[driglam namzha]], which is Ngalop in origin.&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-H&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Housing |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date = September 1991|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ngalops follow [[matrilineal]] lines in the inheritance of land and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Agriculture, Environment and Rural Production|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/Gender/BHU.PDF|website=Fact Sheet Bhutan|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=8 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Pubcycle2.gif|thumb|A visual representation of the publication cycle]] --&gt;
'''Publication cycle''' is the process through which [[author]]s take their ideas and put them into viewable form. This includes all forms of [[publication]], from initial [[research report]]s, to [[article (publishing)|articles]] posted on [[website]]s, and the commonly recognized [[magazine]] articles and [[book]]s.

==Publication process==

===Idea===
The cycle begins with the authors deciding on what topic they wish to publish about. This can be a very quick step for some authors, who decided on a topic and develop it more later in the process, or the author can take a large amount of time fully developing a complete idea.

===Research===
This is when authors take their ideas and find out all the information that is readily available. For [[scientific publication]], this includes previously done experiments as well has conducting more experiments that focus mainly on the chosen topic. For literary authors, this step includes reading previous publications and to see if any other authors have published work similar to theirs.

===Informal communication===
Informal communication is when authors get together and exchange ideas without there being any formal purposes or any structured agenda to guide them along. This includes dinners, going to the bar, [[phone call]]s, parties, and small gatherings.

===Idea protection===
Idea protection is when authors formalize their ideas and reserve their rights to them. This includes [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], trademark, [[registered trademark]]s, and [[Creative Commons|creative commons]]. It is important for authors to protect their work so that others do not take credit for their work.

===Report findings===
This can be done in many different ways. There are formal reports, such as lab reports, research documents, and other [[white paper]] publications. Informal versions include posts on person web pages, blogs, and new forms like [[facebook]] posts.

===Conferences===
These meetings include both formal and inform forms of communication and are great ways not only to present your findings but also begin the cycle. Presentations and discussions are held to publicize research.

===Magazines and newspapers===
One of the more public and common types of publications, these are one of the most popular types of printed publications. These are used at many levels such as small towns, college [[campus]]es, and regional or national levels.

===Journal articles===
These vary a lot throughout their process, but they generally have the same objective in mind: to present an idea or position These can range from a personal to corporate journal and have many various subjects. Depending on the level, the journal article may be peer-reviewed by others in the field or a dedicated editing staff.
* Examples
* The Wall Street Journal
* Personal Diary

===Book publication===
This is possibly one of the longest processes due to the many levels of review that go into the production of a [[book]]. There are usually many editions of books because each must be reviewed and revised before it actually goes into production. Also, many revisions to manuscripts may be made because of grammatical errors or a focus that needs to be fleshed out in more detail.

===Government documents===
There are many varieties of these documents. They can range from bills, deeds, [[constitution]]s or government contracts. These carry the most complexity with them because it must be kept updated regularly to reflect the current version of the document. Amendments to government documents make these documents have a longer publication cycle than most other documents because they must constantly be revised and it has to publicly be known that an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] has been added and usually there are a series of checks these documents must pass through before their publication cycle has ended.

==Types of publication==
* '''Research reports''' are published when authors do experiments to help support their topics. Reports are generally a formal type of publications, but it depends on the author. Some authors simply publish research findings, without any detailed explanations or formal papers. Other authors will write up full reports, with all the findings, calculations, and conclusions drawn from the information found.
* '''Conference papers''' are published following [[Meeting|conferences]]. Authors find these helpful, not only for reviewing what happened during the conference, but also finding out what happened at conferences they were unable to attend.
* '''Magazines and [[newspaper]]s''' are some of the most commonplace publications that people think of. They are the main source of recent, up to date information that affects everyday life. These types of media are generally published from a day to a week after the event being reported on occurred. [[Daily newspaper]]s operate on a [[24-hour news cycle]].
* '''Journals''' are slower to publish information, but are more reputable than magazines and newspapers. Journals go through a much more formal and strict review process to ensure that the information is authenticated and trustworthy.
* '''Books''' are the key publication type, used not only for information, but also telling stories, listing facts, and sharing opinions. Books go through a very long revision process which makes sure not only that all errors in the writing have been fixed, but also that there are no copyright infringements.
* '''Encyclopedias''' are similar to books because they have a complicated revision process, but because of the information contained in [[encyclopedia]]s and because they are periodicals, they are different in how they function. When encyclopedias are republished, all that changes is the information that has been proven wrong or has altered since the last publication. But even so, they are not normally published more than once a year.

=== Online publication types ===
* '''Blogs''' are simply people or a [[corporation]]'s ideas that are published throughout the internet. These are not usually edited and usually have the most interaction with readers. They usually employ comment boxes that allow for people to comment on. The more followers the [[blog]] has, the more credible it appears.
* '''Forums''' are usually for support or posting reviews and specific questions about a specific product or brand.
* '''E-Books''' (see [[E-Book]]) An electronic book (or e-book) is a book publication made available in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices.
* '''Personal website''' are usually hosted by an individual. It usually reflects the interest of that individual and can have any variety content they see fit to host and have the rights to host.
* '''Corporate and government websites''' are usually contributed to expressly by employees of a particular company or department of the government. There is usually a small amount of funding that is solely devoted to the internet division of a particular camp. There is also a need to have servers and a large financial cost can be incurred due to the bandwidth that is needed because of the traffic that may travel to the page.
* '''Tutorials''' are simply videos or texts that demonstrate how to perform a particular task. These can be a part of a larger site, such as Youtube.com, where users are able to post content that other may critique and view.

'''Punjabi Shaikh''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  پنجابی شيخ}}}}) are prominent branch of [[Shaikh]] in [[South Asia]].

==Name==
'''Sheikh''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: '''شيخ''' ), is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning elder of a tribe, lord, honorable revered old man, or [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]]. In [[South Asia]] it is used as an ethnic title generally attributed to Muslim trading families.

The Punjabi Shaikh are a multi-ethnic community descended from native traders who converted to Islam. 
In [[South Asia]], after the advent of [[Islam]], some higher and lower castes in [[India]]), such as [[Brahmins]], [[Baniyas]] and [[Khatri]]s, converted to [[Islam]] in the [[Punjab region]] and adopted this title. They are known as '''Punjabi Shaikh''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) '''پنجابی شيخ'''. Punjabi Shaikhs are mostly urban and non agriculturist but a few families also cultivate their own land in the western districts. Their main professions are business and public service. In Punjab, they stereotypically have a reputation for business acumen. Many [[Rajput]] clans had converted to Islam, also known as [[Muslim Rajputs]], during the early 12th century and were also given the honorary title of Sheikh (elder of the tribe) by [[Pir (Sufism)|Pirs]]. Sheikh Rajputs were the earliest in Rajputs to embrace [[Islam]]. Another example [[Khawaja Shaikh]], with their sub-division the [[Chiniotis]] and the [[Qanungoh Shaikh]] are two such communities.

Before the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, [[Khatri]]s were living in all the districts of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Most of them were concentrated in the western districts. People from all classes; [[Muslim Khatris|Khatris]], [[Muslim Rajput|Rajput]]s, [[Jat Muslim|Jat]]s, [[Gujjar]]s, [[Gakhars]], etc.; had converted to [[Islam]]. The [[Siddiqui]] Shaikhs and [[Quraishi]] [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikhs]], [[Dhund Abbasi|Abbasi]]s are communities that are the descended from these converted classes. They are found in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] speaking Shaikhs and also found in [[Sindh]] as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] speaking Shaikhs. The Siddiqui Shaikhs are also living in [[North India|northern India]] and also in [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab, India|East Punjab]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Haryana]] as well as in [[Bihar]], [[West Bengal]], [[Maharashtra]] and  [[Telangana]].

The [[Saraswat Brahmin]], including [[Mohyal]]s, adopted Sheikh as their title upon high caste conversions to [[Islam]]. The [[Kayastha]] also adopted Islam as [[Muslim Kayasths]] they became part of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community.

== Shaikh ==
Members of the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh community]] are those who after converting to [[Islam]] from different Hindu [[Forward caste|Upper castes]] formed [[Muslim Khatris]], [[Sunni Khoja]],   [[Khawaja]] ({{lang-ar|''' خواجہ شيخ'''}}) and community belong many prominent [[Muslim]] trading families of [[South Asia]] such as [[Arora]], [[Chawla]], [[Sehgal]], [[Paracha]], Chattaa, Bathla adopted the title of [[Shaikh]].

== Qanungoh Shaikh ==
{{Main|Qanungoh Shaikh}}

Qanungoh Shaikhs ({{lang-fa|''' قانونگوہ شيخ'''}}) belonged to all the districts of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. They have different lineages and represent families who were holding hereditary  office of  ''Qanungoh'' (''Law readers'')  during the Muslim period.

This designation was used in the Punjab and other provinces of India and Pakistan for hereditary registrar of landed property in a subdivision of a district.

== Siddiqui and farooqui Shaikhs ==
{{Main|Siddiqui}}
The [[Siddiqui]] and [[farooqui]] are also clans of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] found in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The [[Siddiqui]] and [[Farooqui]] mostly are [[Muslim Kayasths]] who converted to Islam from the Hindu [[Kayastha]] caste. The These clans are also found in [[North India|northern Indian]] states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[West Bengal]], [[Pataudi State|Pataudi]] and [[Haryana]]. They are usually [[Urdu language|Urdu]] speaking community while some can be found to be [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] speaking.

==Kashmiri Shaikh==
{{Main|Kashmiri Shaikh}}
[[File:Iqbal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Muhammad Iqbal]], the national poet of Pakistan]]
The [[Kashmiri Shaikh]] are another community living in different districts of the [[Kashmir]] and [[Punjab]]. They emigrated from [[Kashmir]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. [[Muhammad Iqbal|Allama Shaikh Muhammad Iqbal]] belonged to this group. Muhammad Iqbal grandfather Shaikh Rafiq migrated to [[Sialkot]] in the early 19th century.

'''Real-time economy''' is an environment where all the [[Financial transaction|transactions]] between business entities are in [[Digital media|digital format]], increasingly generated automatically, and completed in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] (as they occur) without store and forward processing.&lt;ref&gt;Real-Time Economy Community, realtimeeconomy.net&lt;/ref&gt; The real-time enterprise is a giant [[spreadsheet]] of sorts, in which new information, such as an order, is automatically processed and percolates through a firm's computer systems and those of its suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;The Real-Time Economy: How about Now? Ludwig Siegele - The Economist, February 1, 2002 http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3003286/1/c_2984786&lt;/ref&gt; The core objective of the real time economy is the reduction of latency between and within processes. Latency reduction will reduce capital occupancy costs by occupying assets (physical and labor) for less time.&lt;ref&gt;The Real-time economy: The Technological Basis for Reengineered Business Reporting, Rutgers Accounting Web, http://raw.rutgers.edu/node/29&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Real-Time Economy was created and is under development by the University of Aalto in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Gospodarka czasu rzeczywistego - biznesowy tygrysi skok, http://przegladbaltycki.pl/900,gospodarka-czasu-rzeczywistego-biznesowy-tygrysi-skok.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10012">'''Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia''' has been an issue from the late nineteenth century up to the present, due to the overcrowded population of the [[Ethiopian highlands]]. As the population of Ethiopia has increased in the twentieth century, the need to move inhabitants has only increased as available cropland per family declined to its current level of less than one hectare per farmer.

==Precursors==
The policy of encouraging voluntary resettlement and villagization in [[Ethiopia]] began in 1958, when the government established the first known planned resettlement in [[Sidamo Province]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Resettlement under the Derg==
Shortly after the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], as part of their policy of [[Land reform in Ethiopia|land reform]] it became [[Derg]] policy to accelerate resettlement. Article 18 of the 1975 Land Reform Proclamation stated that "the government shall have the responsibility to settle peasants or to establish cottage industries to accommodate those who, as a result of distribution of land . . . remain with little or no land." Accordingly, in 1975/76 there were eighty-eight settlement centers accommodating 38,818 households. The government conducted most of these resettlement programs under the auspices of the [[Relief and Rehabilitation Commission]] (RRC) and the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development]]. By 1982 there were 112 planned settlements populated by more than 120,000 people. The settlements were concentrated mainly in the south and southwest. In 1984 [[Addis Ababa]] announced its intention to resettle 1.5 million people from the drought-affected northern regions to the south and southwest, where arable land was plentiful. By 1986, according to Mulatu Wubne, the government had resettled more than 600,000 people. More than 250,000 went to [[Welega]]; about 150,000 settled in the Gambela area of [[Illubabor Province|Illubabor]]; and just over 100,000 went to [[Pawe Special Woreda|Pawe]], the largest planned resettlement in [[Gojjam]] and largely sustained by [[Ethiopia-Italy relations|Italian]] financial support. In addition, another 78,000 went to [[Kaffa Province|Kaffa]], [[Shewa]], and western [[Begemder]].&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Mulatu Wubne. "Resettlement and villagization". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]'' (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1991). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1986 the government halted the resettlement program, largely to fend off the negative reaction from the international community. [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], in his review of the book ''Politics and the Ethiopian Famine, 1984-1985'', notes that some critics of the regime at the time compared "the resettlement centres to Hitler's concentration camps", and having visited them noted that Ethiopia is "a poor and economically underdeveloped country. Resettlement is therefore being carried out 'on a shoe-string', and the centres, like the country at large, face many difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, "The Ethiopian Famine: Cultural Survival's New Report", ''Anthropology Today'', vol. 2 No. 3 (June 1986), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; But in November 1987 the program resumed, and in March 1988 [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] spoke of the need to move at least 7 million people; 100,000 - 200,000 were resettled when the program resumed in 1987 and March 1988 when it was suspended.&lt;ref name=Gebru-149n&gt;Gebru Tereke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 149 n.28&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed resettlement would resolve the country's recurring drought problem and would ease population pressure from northern areas where the land had been badly overused. Western donors and governments, whom Addis Ababa expected to help with the program, remained apprehensive of the government's intentions, however. Some believed that the plan to resettle 1.5 million people by 1994 was unrealistic, given the country's strained finances. Others argued that resettlement was a ploy to depopulate areas of unrest in the [[Ethiopian Civil War|ongoing conflict]], particularly in [[Eritrea]] and [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]. Additional arguments against resettlement included charges of human rights violations, forced separations of families, and lack of medical attention in resettlement centers, which resulted in thousands of deaths from malaria and sleeping sickness.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Gebru Tareke, studying the government records of this resettlement program, provides a more accurate picture. "Between 1984 and 1986," he writes, "594,190 people were hastily, forcibly, and pitilessly uprooted from the cool, dry highlands of Shewa, Tigray, and Wello to the hot, wet lowlands of [[Gojjam]], [[Illubabor Province|Illubabor]], [[Kaffa Province|Kafa]] and [[Welega|Wellega]], and an estimated cost of 767 million birr (US $374 million)."&lt;ref name=Gebru-149&gt;Gebru Tareke, ''Ethiopian Revolution'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Of this number, the largest group 367,016 or 62% came from [[Wollo]]; 108,241 or 18% from Shewa; 89,716 or 15% from Tigray.&lt;ref name=Gebru-149n/&gt; "The seven sites for settlement were randomly selected by [[Mengistu]] and [[Legesse Asfaw]]. No ecologists, agronomists, horticulturalists, economists, or anthropologists were consulted, and no consent from either the resettlers or the host population was solicited."&lt;ref name=Gebru-149/&gt; The new settlers encountered harsh conditions: as many as 33,000 or 5.5% died from starvation and tropical diseases, while at least 84,000 or 14% more are believed to have fled these new settlements.&lt;ref name=Gebru-150&gt;Gebru Tereke, ''Ethiopian Revolution'', pp. 150&lt;/ref&gt; As for the claims that the resettlement was primarily motivated to depopulate the rebel areas, or to establish buffer areas against the rebel groups, Gebru is largely dismissive, noting that no people were removed from [[Eritrea]], for example, and that the population transferred from Tigray and Wollo were too small to have made any meaningful difference.&lt;ref name=Gebru-150/&gt;

===Villagization in the 1980s===
In 1985 the government initiated a new relocation program known as villagization. The objectives of the program, which grouped scattered farming communities throughout the country into small village clusters, were to promote rational land use; conserve resources; provide access to clean water and to health and education services; and strengthen security. Government guidelines stipulated that villages were to house 200 to 300 households, with 100-square-meter compounds for each family.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1985 Addis Ababa established a national coordinating committee to oversee the villagization plan's implementation. By March 1986, about 4.6 million people in Shewa, [[Arsi Province|Arsi]], and [[Hararghe]] had been relocated into more than 4,500 villages. Although the government had villagized about 13 million people by 1989, international criticism, deteriorating security conditions, and lack of resources doomed the plan to failure. Nevertheless, Mengistu remained committed to the villagization concept.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Opponents of villagization argued that the scheme was disruptive to agricultural production because the government moved many farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. There also was concern that villagization could have a negative impact on fragile local resources, particularly on water and grazing land; accelerate the spread of communicable diseases; and increase problems with plant pests and diseases. In early 1990, the government essentially abandoned villagization when it announced new economic policies that called for free-market reforms and a relaxation of centralized planning.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The pressure on large-scale state farms was under attack by Western donors, who channeled their agricultural aid to the peasant sector. These donors maintained that experiences elsewhere in Africa and in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union had shown that state farms were inefficient and a drain on scarce resources.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Voluntary resettlement in the 2000s==
Voluntary resettlement programs were renewed in the mid-2000s, as the government encouraged farmers to move from less productive to more productive regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=48797 "ETHIOPIA: Rural resettlement programme criticised"] ([[IRIN]]-Africa), March 1, 2004, accessed on July 17, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; Some new settlements showed promise;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocha-eth.org/Archive/DownloadableReports/resettlementSNNPR0603.pdf "Resettlement as a Response to Food Insecurity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040901020853/http://www.ocha-eth.org/Archive/DownloadableReports/resettlementSNNPR0603.pdf |date=2004-09-01 }}, UN-EUE Report May/June 2003 (accessed 19 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; however, at others the problems of self-sufficiency once again reared their heads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dppc.gov.et/downloadable/reports/nutrition/Chewaka%20%20Nutrition%20Survey%20Report.pdf "Nutrition Survey Report of Chewaka Resettlement Area Bedele Woreda, Illubabur Zone"], May 2004, pp. 3f (accessed 27 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19280">In the state of '''[[Maryland]]''', the '''[[right of self-defense]]''' is mostly governed by [[case law]], but there is also a statute.

==General Principles==

Maryland continues to follow [[common law]] principles on the use of force in self-defense, although there is a statute (discussed below) on the subject of immunity from civil lawsuits for the use of force to defend a home or a business.

In the case of ''Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner'', 179 Md. 598, 20 A.2d 485 (1941), which involved a civil lawsuit for assault and battery, the [[Court of Appeals of Maryland]] set forth the general common law principles of the doctrine of self-defense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The law of self-defense justifies an act done in the reasonable belief of immediate danger.  If an injury was done by a defendant in justifiable self-defense, he can neither be punished criminally nor held responsible for damages in a civil action. . . .  One who seeks to justify an assault on the ground that he acted in self-defense must show that he used no more force than the exigency reasonably demanded.  The belief of a defendant in an action for assault that the plaintiff intended to do him bodily harm cannot support a plea of self-defense unless it was such a belief as a person of average prudence would entertain under similar circumstances.  The jury should accordingly be instructed that to justify assault and battery in self-defense the circumstances must be such as would have induced a rea[s]onable man of average prudence to make such an assault in order to protect himself.  The question whether the belief of the defendant that he was about to be injured was a reasonable one under all the circumstances is a question for the consideration of the jury.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', 179 Md. at 600-01, 20 A.2d at 487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court of Appeals said in the case that, even if the plaintiff had struck the defendant's employees first, the plaintiff would still be entitled to prevail in an action for battery if the defendant's employees, in repelling the plaintiff's acts, "used unreasonable and excessive force, meaning such force as prudent men would not have used under all the circumstances of the case."  ''Id.'', 179 Md. at 600, 20 A.2d at 487.

==The Use of Deadly Force in Self-Defense==

Maryland also continues to follow [[common law]] principles on the issue of when one may use deadly force in self-defense.  In the case of ''State v. Faulkner'', 301 Md. 482, 485, 483 A.2d 759, 761 (1984), the Court of Appeals of Maryland summarized those principles, and stated that a homicide, other than [[felony murder]], is justified on the ground of self-defense if the following criteria are satisfied:

{{quote|(1) The accused must have had reasonable grounds to believe himself in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from his assailant or potential assailant;

(2) The accused must have in fact believed himself in this danger;

(3) The accused claiming the right of self defense must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict;

(4) The force used must have not been unreasonable and excessive, that is, the force must not have been more force than the exigency demanded.}}

''See also Roach v. State'', 358 Md. 418, 429-30, 749 A.2d 787, 793 (2000).

In addition, when one is in one's home, one may use deadly force against an attacker if deadly force is necessary to prevent the attacker from committing a felony that involves the use of force, violence, or surprise (such as murder, robbery, burglary, rape, or arson).  ''See Crawford v. State'', 231 Md. 354, 190 A.2d 538 (1963).

==Duty to Retreat and the Castle Doctrine==
Maryland also follows the [[common law]] rule that, outside of one's home, a person, before using deadly force in self-defense, has the duty "'to retreat or avoid danger if such means were within his power and consistent with his safety.'"  ''DeVaughn v. State'', 232 Md. 447, 453, 194 A.2d 109, 112 (1963), ''cert. denied'', 376 U.S. 527 (1964), quoting ''Bruce v. State'', 218 Md. 87, 97, 145 A.2d 428, 433 (1958).  ''See also Burch v. State'', 346 Md. 253, 283, 696 A.2d 443, 458 (1997).

But a person does not have to retreat if it would not be safe for the person to do so.  "[I]f the peril of the defendant was imminent, he did not have to retreat but had a right to stand his ground and to defend and protect himself."  ''Bruce v. State'', ''supra'', 218 Md. at 97, 145 A.2d at 433.

The duty to retreat also does not apply if one is attacked in one's own home.  "[A] man faced with the danger of an attack upon his dwelling need not retreat from his home to escape the danger, but instead may stand his ground and, if necessary to repel the attack, may kill the attacker."  ''Crawford v. State'', 231 Md. 354, 361, 190 A.2d 538, 541 (1963).  The Court of Appeals said in ''Crawford'', a case in which the defendant fatally shot a younger man who was attempting to break into his home to beat and rob him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;* * * A man is not bound to retreat from his house.  He may stand his ground there and kill an[y] person who attempts to commit a felony therein, or who attempts to enter by force for the purpose of committing a felony, or of inflicting great bodily harm upon an inmate.  In such a case the owner or any member of the family, or even a lodger in the house, may meet the intruder at the threshold, and prevent him from entering by any means rendered necessary by the exigency, even to the taking of his life, and the homicide will be justifiable.&lt;ref&gt;
''Id.'', 231 Md. at 361, 190 A.2d at 542, quoting Clark and Marshall, ''Law of Crimes'', (6th ed. Wingersky rev.), § 7.03, pages 436-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This principle is known as the "[[Castle Doctrine]]", "the name being derived from the foundational principle that 'a man's home is his castle' and his ultimate retreat."  ''Barton v. State'', 46 Md. App. 616, 618, 420 A.2d 1009, 1010-1011 (1980).  A man "is not bound to flee and become a fugitive from his own home, for, if that were required, there would, theoretically, be no refuge for him anywhere in the world."  &lt;ref&gt;''Barton'', 46 Md. App. at 618, 420 A.2d at 1010&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
A person does not have to be the owner of the home or the head of the household in order to be able to invoke the "Castle Doctrine."  Instead, "any member of the household, whether or not he or she has a proprietary or leasehold interest in the property, is within its ambit . . . ." &lt;ref&gt;''Barton'', 46 Md. App. at 619-20, 420 A.2d at 1011&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, even in one's own home, the degree of force used in self-defense must not be "excessive."  ''Crawford v. State'', ''supra'', 231 Md. at 362, 190 A.2d at 542.  Quoting a treatise on criminal law, the Court of Appeals said in ''Crawford'':

{{quote|It is a justifiable homicide to kill to prevent the commission of a felony by force or surprise.

The crimes in prevention of which life may be taken are such and only such as are committed by forcible means, violence, and surprise, such as murder, robbery, burglary, rape, or arson.

* * *

* * *

It is also essential that killing is necessary to prevent the commission of the felony in question.  If other methods could prevent its commission, a homicide is not justified; all other means of preventing the crime must first be exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', 231 Md. at 362-63, 190 A.2d at 542, quoting, 1 ''Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure'' (Anderson Ed., 1957), § 206, at pages 453-55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Burden of Proof on Self-Defense==
Although self-defense is commonly called a "defense," a defendant who invokes self-defense in a criminal case in Maryland does not have the burden of proving that he or she acted in self-defense.

Instead, the defendant in a criminal case only has a burden of ''production'' on the issue of self-defense.  This means that a defendant who wishes to invoke the doctrine only needs to "generate the issue" by introducing some evidence that he or she acted in self-defense.  If the defendant satisfies that burden of production and thus generates the issue, then it is the ''prosecution'' that has the burden of proving that the defendant did ''not'' act in self-defense.  In other words, once the defendant satisfies his or her burden of production on the issue of self-defense, then the prosecution has the burden of ''persuasion'' on the issue of self-defense.

If the defendant does not generate the issue of self-defense, then the prosecution does not have to prove that the defendant had not acted in self-defense.

The [[Court of Appeals of Maryland]] adopted these principles in the case of ''State v. Evans'', 278 Md. 197, 207-08, 362 A.2d 629, 636 (1976).  The Court said allocating the burdens of production and persuasion in this manner was required by the Supreme Court's decision in ''Mullaney v. Wilbur'', 421 U.S. 684 (1975).

In ''civil'' cases, by contrast, self-defense remains a defense, meaning that the burden of proving its applicability is on the defendant.  ''See Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, supra,'' 179 Md. at 600-01, 20 A.2d at 487.

==Pattern Jury Instructions on Self-Defense in Criminal Cases==
If the duty-to-retreat criteria is met, then the following self-defense criteria are examined, as contained within the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction.  Optional or alternate inclusions into the jury instruction are enclosed with &lt; &gt;. Phrases surrounded with () are substituted with specific instances of the case.

===Self-defense (MPJI-Cr 5:07)===
Self-defense is a defense, and the defendant must be found not guilty if all of the following three factors are present:
# The defendant actually believed that &lt;they&gt; were in immediate and imminent danger of bodily harm.
# The defendant's belief was reasonable.
#The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend &lt;themselves&gt; in light of the threatened or actual harm.

"Deadly-force is that amount of force reasonably calculated to cause death or serious bodily harm. If the defendant is found to have used deadly-force, it must be decided whether the use of deadly-force was reasonable. Deadly-force is reasonable if the defendant actually had a reasonable belief that the aggressor's force was or would be deadly and that the defendant needed a deadly-force response."

"In addition, before using deadly-force, the defendant is required to make all reasonable effort to retreat. The defendant does not have to retreat if the defendant was in &lt;their&gt; home, retreat was unsafe, the avenue of retreat was unknown to the defendant, the defendant was being robbed, the defendant was lawfully arresting the victim. If the defendant was found to have not used deadly-force, then the defendant had no duty to retreat."

===Defense of Others (MPJI-Cr 5:01)===
Defense of others is a defense, and the defendant must be found not guilty if all of the following four factors are present:
# The defendant actually believed that the person defended was in immediate and imminent danger of bodily harm.
# The defendant's belief was reasonable.
# The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend the person defended in light of the threatened or actual force.
# The defendant's purpose in using force was to aid the person defended.

===Defense of Habitation - Deadly Force (MPJI-Cr 5:02)===
Defense of one's home is a defense, and the defendant must be found not guilty if all of the following three factors are present:
# The defendant actually believed that (victim) was committing &lt;was just about to commit&gt; the crime of (crime) in &lt;at&gt; the defendant's home.
# The defendant's belief was reasonable.
# The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against the conduct of (victim).

===Defense of Property - Nondeadly Force (MPJI-Cr 5:02.1)===
Defense of property is a defense, and the defendant must be found not guilty if all of the following three factors are present:
# The defendant actually believed that (victim) was unlawfully interfering &lt;was just about to unlawfully interfere&gt; with property.
# The defendant's belief was reasonable.
# The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against the victim's interference with the property.

"A person may not use deadly force to defend &lt;his&gt; &lt;her&gt; property. Deadly force is that amount of force reasonably calculated to cause death or serious bodily harm."

==Pattern Jury Instructions on Self-Defense in Civil Cases==

Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 15:4(a) &amp; (b) states:

{{quote|
a.  Defense of Self, Another or Property

Persons are not responsible for assault or battery if they were defending themselves, other persons, their property or their employer's property, so long as they used only such force as was reasonably necessary to protect themselves, other persons, their property, or their employer's property from actual attack or threat of imminent harm.  Threat of imminent harm does not mean that one must wait until the other person makes the first move.

b.  Use of Deadly Force

A person may use deadly force only as a last resort.  The person must reasonably believe that he or she or a third person was in immediate danger of serious bodily harm and that there was no other reasonable means of defense or ability to escape.}}

==Civil Immunity==
While the use of force in self-defense may be justifiable, the person defending himself or herself still runs the risk of being [[Lawsuit|sued]] by the attacker for monetary damages.  In 2010, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed, and Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] signed, a bill to address this issue and to provide for an immunity to such civil lawsuits in certain cases in which a person used force, including deadly force, to defend his or her home or business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://delegatemike.com/?p=2298 |title=Maryland Governor Signs "Castle Doctrine" Bill |accessdate=2010-05-21 |author=Delegate Mike Smigiel  |date=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute — § 5-808 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code — provides as follows:

{{quote|(a) In this section, "person" does not include a governmental entity.

(b) A person is not liable for damages for a personal injury or death of an individual who enters the person's dwelling or place of business if:

     {{quote|(1) The person reasonably believes that force or deadly force is necessary to repel an attack by the individual; and

      (2) The amount and nature of the force used by the person is reasonable under the circumstances.}}

(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to a person who is convicted of a crime of violence under § 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, assault in the second degree, or reckless endangerment arising out of the circumstances described in subsection (b) of this section.

(d) The court may award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to a defendant who prevails in a defense under this section.

(e) This section does not limit or abrogate any immunity from civil liability or defense available to a person under any other provision of the Code or at common law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlis.state.md.us/asp/statutes_respond.asp?article=gcj&amp;section=5-808&amp;Extension=HTML § 5-808. Civil immunity for defense of dwelling or place of business]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The statute essentially codifies the common law rule of self-defense.  It is arguable that the statute makes the "Castle Doctrine" applicable to actions committed to defend a person's business.  But the statute is not entirely clear on that point, because of its requirement that the force be "reasonable under the circumstances" and the absence of specific language saying that the defendant may stand his or her ground in the business.  Importantly, the statute also provides that, if a defendant prevails in a defense under the statute, then the court "may" order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.  The statute further provides that the immunity which it creates does not apply if the defendant had been convicted of certain criminal charges in connection with the incident.

By its terms, the statute does not apply to criminal prosecutions.

The General Assembly enacted the statute nine years after an incident that occurred on the night of March 19, 2001, in which one or both of the co-owners of a cement company in [[Glyndon, Maryland]] opened fire on three intruders on the company's premises, killing one of them and wounding the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Craig, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-03-20/news/0103200197_1_geckle-baltimore-county-steinbach 1 killed, 2 hurt in county shooting], [[Baltimore Sun]] (March 20, 2001).  Retrieved on July 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's premises had also been burglarized the two previous nights, and the two co-owners (who were brothers) were staying overnight at the business to guard it.  In February 2004, the estate and young son of the deceased intruder sued the two brothers and their company for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Hanes, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-02-10/news/0402100033_1_geckle-steinbach-brothers Lawsuit seeks $13 million from brothers who killed burglar], [[Baltimore Sun]] (February 10, 2004).  Retrieved on July 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to online records of the Maryland court system, the plaintiffs dropped the lawsuit on January 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Bishop, et al. v.

Accessed July 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not stated in the online records whether or not the case was settled.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of the shooting in 2001, bills were introduced in each of the two chambers of the General Assembly to shield business owners from civil lawsuits for deadly force against a person "who unlawfully and forcefully enters" the business.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Barker, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-03-27/news/0103270219_1_carroll-county-geckle-body-armor Bill would shield business owners using deadly force from lawsuits], [[Baltimore Sun]] (March 27, 2001).

'''Sabeen Mahmud''' (20 June 1974 – 24 April 2015) ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|صبین محمود}}}}) was a [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[Pakistan]]i human rights activist and social worker who founded the [[Karachi]]-based cafe ''[[The Second Floor]]''. She also presided over the Karachi branch of [[TiE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-182592-Sabeen-Mahmud-Director-T2F-gunned-down-in-Karachi|title=Sabeen Mahmud Director T2F gunned down in Karachi|date=25 Apr 2015|work=TheNews.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised in [[Karachi]], she was educated at [[Karachi Grammar School|Karachi Grammar]] and later at the [[Kinnaird College for Women University|Kinnaird College]]. She later founded an interactive media and technology consulting firm and worked to establish the Citizens Archive of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1178106|title=Sabeen Mahmud — a profile|last=Siddiqui|first=Maleeha Hamid|date=2015-04-25|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set up [[The Second Floor|''The Second Floor (T2F)'']] in 2007 aimed at providing a community space for open dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.t2f.biz/|title=T2F {{!}} A Project of PeaceNiche|website=www.t2f.biz|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Sabeen's leadership, T2F arranged a series of liberal social activities.&lt;ref name="Zaidi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1178157/sabeen-the-one-who-never-backed-down|title=Sabeen, the one who never backed down|last=Zaidi|first=Hassan Belal|date=2015-04-25|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also co-lead protests against the ''[[Red Mosque]]'' in Islamabad, and also took part in ''Pakistan for All'', a campaign to end [[Sectarianism in Pakistan|sectarianism]] and [[religious intolerance]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Zaidi"/&gt;

On 24 April 2015, she hosted a debate on [[Balochistan conflict]] which included activist's like [[Mama Qadeer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1178050/t2f-hosts-the-balochistan-discussion-that-others-shy-away-from|title=T2F hosts the Balochistan discussion that others shy away from|last=Rafi|first=Haneen|date=2015-04-25|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the event, she was shot dead by a gunman on her way home after hosting a seminar at T2F.&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt; As of 20 May 2015, Pakistani authorities have arrested the culprit behind Mahmud's murder.&lt;ref name="ET5" /&gt; Sabeen is referred to as part of 'Pakistan’s liberal, urban, globalised civil society'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/PkJpppMet5HfH8WLAqeHrN/Death-of-a-liberal.html|title=Death of a liberal|last=Soofi|first=Mayank Austen|date=2015-04-25|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mahmud wanted to challenge injustice and discrimination, and to encourage critical thinking; she told ''[[DAWN (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' that her biggest dream is to "change the world for the better through the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t2f.biz/wp-content/uploads/sabeen_dawn_profile.pdf|title=Profile: ‘Sabeen Mahmud’: Striving For Better|author=Saad Shafqat|work=Dawn|date=18 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded PeaceNiche, an organisation that provides a "social platform" for public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/985/t2f-a-pursuit-of-the-heart/|title=T2F: A pursuit of the heart|date=7 Aug 2010|work=Tribune blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahmud2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Sabeen|title=Creative Karachi: Establishing an Arts &amp; Culture Center for the World's Most Rapidly Growing City (Innovations Case Narrative:PeaceNiche and The Second Floor)|journal=Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization|volume=8|issue=3-4|year=2013|pages=27–41|issn=1558-2477|doi=10.1162/INOV_a_00185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmud founded a small tech company called "bits" with Zaheer Kidvai, with whom she worked in 2 other companies from the age of 14.5, and considered him her mentor. In 2006, she founded The Second Floor (T2F), a cafe that hosted public forum discussions, film screenings, poetry writing, stand-up comedy and live theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1178106/sabeen-mahmud-a-profile|title=Sabeen Mahmud — a profile|work=DAWN|date=24 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Sabeen co-hosted Pakistan's [http://codeforpakistan.org/programs/civic-hackathons/karachi-civic-hackathon/ first civic hackathon], held at T2F in [[Karachi]],&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/pakistans-first-hackathon/|title=Meet the Woman Behind Pakistan's First Hackathon|publisher=Wired|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was designed to bring together people from different disciplines to brainstorm ways to solve civic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/sabeen-mahmud-hackathon/|title=Meet Sabeen Mahmud, a Woman Trying to Change Pakistan One Line of Code at a Time|work=The Mary Sue|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud hosted public figures, including [[Ayesha Siddiqa]] who authored a controversial book on military financing, leading to the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] contacting The Second Floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/05/168678897/pakistani-cafe-is-oasis-in-desert-of-civil-discourse|title=Pakistani Cafe Is Oasis In Desert Of Civil Discourse|date=5 Jan 2013|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, she told [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] that she didn't want an armed security guard in The Second Floor "I said, that’s the price you pay for having a public space. I’m not having people checked and a military guy there because of a pervasive fear." She went on to state "Read Chomsky. Things are dangerous and bad things happen.

==Death==
During the late hours of 24 April 2015, Mahmud, while traveling in her [[Suzuki Swift]] (registration Number AWH 541),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anatomy of a murder|url = http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153209|accessdate = 2015-07-31|first = Naziha Syed Ali {{!}} Fahim|last = Zaman}}&lt;/ref&gt; was fatally shot by gunmen near the [[Defence Housing Authority, Karachi|DHA]] library on her way home after hosting a seminar. As her car stopped at a red light less than 500 metres to the north of T2F, Saad Aziz who was riding a motorcycle driven by Aliur Rehman aka Tony rode up alongside it and shot Mahmud, who was in the driving seat, four or five times with a 9mm gun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a police official, the murder was a direct [[Target killings in Pakistan|target killing]]&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt; and was booked by the police under the Terrorism Act. Her mother was also critically wounded in the attack and taken to the [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi|Aga Khan Hospital]] for treatment.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/875375/t2f-director-shot-dead-in-karachi/|title=T2F director Sabeen Mehmud shot dead in Karachi|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminar, titled 'Unsilencing Balochistan (Take 2)', was held at the T2F cafe and focused on [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. Among the guest speakers was the Baloch activist [[Mama Qadeer]].&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt;

Etzioni writes that supranationality can be thought of as "a composite of several elements."  These elements can be present alone or all together.  The three elements of supranationality are defined as follows:

#Making of significant decisions by a body that is not made of national representatives and that does not receive instructions from national governments.  (Though such a body is frequently elected by national authorities or their constituents. Frequently such a body is made up of officials acting in an individual capacity.)
#The subjects or participants (national governments or individuals) are legally obligated to comply with the decisions of the body.
#Individuals or other private parties may interact directly with the body and/or have legal obligations as stated above.

==History==
The Metropolitan Club was formed in 1891 by [[J. P. Morgan]],&lt;ref name=Insider/&gt; who served as its first president. 

It was actually the second organization with that name in its neighborhood.  ''The New York Times'' reported Tuesday, March 10, 1891, about the name selected the prior Saturday:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is already a Metropolitan Club, which for some years has occupied quarters in the neighborhood in which the millionaires think of building.&lt;ref name=NYT.Tue&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The New York Times  |date=March 10, 1891

|title=Very Hard On The Postmen.; It Would Seem That There Is One Metropolitan Club Too Many.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually, the first organization to claim the name "Metropolitan Club" seemed to be described by ''The Times'' for over a decade without the prefix "The".&lt;ref&gt;"The Democratic State Nominations were ratified on Saturday night by '''t'''he Metropolitan Club, at a public meeting held in Stuyvesant Institute. The lecture-room was crowded. Judge S.S.BOWNE was ..." Note that it says ''"the''" (NOT "'''T'''he") by Metropolitan Club. {{cite web

&lt;!-- Oct. 4, 1858 was before the Internet, but the date is correct --&gt;

===Original members===
Other original members of the club included [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]] and [[James A. Roosevelt]]. "Each member, which included Vanderbilts and Whitneys, contributed $5,000 to buy the plot of land."&lt;ref name=Insider/&gt;

===The building===
The architects of the original building (erected in 1893)&lt;ref&gt;Some sources claim 1894, but it is clear that much if not most of the work was done in 1893. One item even mentions 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; were McKim, Mead &amp; White.

The east wing, erected in 1912, was designed by Ogden Codman Jr.&lt;ref name=C.rev&gt;{{cite web

Its 1894 clubhouse, designed by [[Stanford White]], stands at 1-11 East 60th Street, on the northeast corner of [[Fifth Avenue]]. The land on which the Clubhouse stands (100 feet fronting on Fifth Avenue and 200 feet on 60th Street) was acquired from the [[Lily Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Duchess of Marlborough]] who signed the purchase agreement in the United States Consulate in London. [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]] signed the purchase agreement on behalf of the club.

The address of the Club's building is ''One East 60th Street'';&lt;ref name=Insider&gt;"The Metropolitan Club, located at 1 East 60th Street on the corner of 5th Avenue, was founded  in 1891 by J.P.

'''Turks in Azerbaijan''' are [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Azerbaijan Republic]]. The community is largely made of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish descendants, [[Meskhetian Turks]] and recent immigrants from [[Turkey]].

== History ==

===Ottoman migration===
[[Ottoman Turks]] began to settle in [[Azerbaijan]] when the region came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1578 and 1603 and then again in the second Ottoman conquest of 1724 until the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. The [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] in 1926 recorded 8,570 [[Ottoman Turks]] living in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Ottoman Turks are no longer listed separately in the census; it is presumed that those who were living in Azerbaijan have either been assimilated into [[Azeri]] society or have left the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akiner|1983|loc=381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 19,000 descendants of the [[Ottoman Turks]] (not including the Meskhetian Turks) are estimated to be living in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt;

===Meskhetian Turks migration===
The [[Meskhetian Turks]] first arrived in Azerbaijan at the end of the nineteenth century, and more followed in 1918-1920.&lt;ref name="Coene 2009 loc=67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coene|2009|loc=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, migration to [[Azerbaijan]] increased dramatically after [[World War II]] when the [[Soviet Union]] was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against [[Turkey]]. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], then [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]], demanded to the surrender of three [[Provinces of Turkey|Anatolian provinces]] ([[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Ardahan]] and [[Artvin]]); thus, war against Turkey seemed possible, and [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted to clear the strategic Turkish population situated in [[Meskheti]], located near the Turkish-Georgian border which were likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennigsen|Broxup|1983|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1944, the Meskhetian Turks were forcefully deported from the Meskheti region in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and accused of smuggling, banditry and espionage in collaboration with their kin across the [[Turkey|Turkish]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|2005|loc=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalistic policies at the time encouraged the slogan: "Georgia for Georgians" and that the Meskhetian Turks should be sent to [[Turkey]] "where they belong".&lt;ref name="Kurbanov &amp; Kurbanov 1995 loc=237"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurbanov|Kurbanov|1995|loc=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cornell|2001|loc=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] deported the Meskhetian Turks to [[Central Asia]] (especially to [[Uzbekistan]]), thousands dying en route in cattle-trucks,&lt;ref name=MRGI&gt;{{cite web|author=Minority Rights Group International|title=Meskhetian Turks|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/2531/russian-federation/meskhetians-or-meskhetian-turks.html|accessdate=2011-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200536/http://www.minorityrights.org/2531/russian-federation/meskhetians-or-meskhetian-turks.html|archivedate=2009-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not permitted by the Georgian government of [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] to return to their homeland.&lt;ref name="Kurbanov &amp; Kurbanov 1995 loc=237"/&gt; 

Between the late 1950s and 1970s, about 25,000 to 30,000 Meskhetian Turks settled in Azerbaijan;&lt;ref name="Aydıngün et al 2006 loc=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coene 2009 loc=67"/&gt; furthermore, approximately 50,000 Meskhetian Turkish refugees came to Azerbaijan due to continued discrimination&lt;ref name="Azembassy"&gt;{{cite news|author=Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|title=Report on mass human rights violation|url=http://www.azembassy.org.uk/sehife.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0205|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=2012-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306111605/http://www.azembassy.org.uk/sehife.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0205|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2003 loc=21"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|2003|loc=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AzerbaijanInternational"&gt;{{cite news|title= Exile of the Meskheti Turks: Still Homesick Half a Century Later|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/51_folder/51_articles/51_meskheti.html|first=Caleb|last=Daniloff|work=Azerbaijan International|year=1997|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pentikäinen|Trier|2004|loc=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Meskhetian Turks living in Uzbekistan became the victims of [[riots]] by the ethnic [[Uzbeks]] in the [[Ferghana valley]] which led to over a hundred deaths.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the first wave of Meskhetian Turkish refugees from the Ferghana Valley settled in the [[Saatli]] and [[Sabirabad Rayon|Sabirabad]] region and the regions of [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz]], [[Beylagan]] and [[Baku]].&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=19"/&gt; Some 5,000 Meskhetian Turks have also arrived to Azerbaijan from Russia during the 1990s, and a few hundred arrived from [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] to Azerbaijan proper during the 1991-1994 war.&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=19"/&gt;

===Mainland Turkish migration===
Azerbaijan has witnessed increasing numbers of immigrants from [[Turkey]]. By 2009, 17,577 Turkish citizens were living in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=csgb/&gt;

The Meskhetian Turks are settled mostly in rural areas and in the cities of [[Baku]], [[Beylagan]], [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz]], [[Saatli]], and [[Sabirabad Rayon|Sabirabad]]. Those living in urban areas tend to be better off than those in agricultural areas.&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aydıngün et al 2006 loc=13"/&gt;

===Population===
According to the 2009 Azerbaijani population census there were 38,000 Turks living in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=census/&gt; However, official data regarding the Turkish community in Azerbaijan is unlikely to provide a true indication of the population as much of the community is officially registered as "Azerbaijani".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meskhetian Turks: Solutions and Human Security|chapter=Chapter Two:  Contemporary Conditions and Dilemmas|url=http://www.osi.hu/fmp/html/mesktwo.html|first=Arthur C.|last=Helton|work=Open Society Institute|year=1998|accessdate=2012-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415043834/http://www.osi.hu/fmp/html/mesktwo.html|archivedate=2007-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, no distinction is made in the census between Meskhetian Turks and Turks from Turkey who have become Azerbaijani citizens, both groups are classified in the official census as "Turks" or "Azerbaijani".&lt;ref name=census/&gt; 

Approximately 19,000 descendants of [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] Turkish migrants are still living in Azerbaijan and practice [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; However, since the twentieth century a new wave of Turkish migrants arrived from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Meskhetia]]) and [[Turkey]]. In the late 1950s and 1970s approximately 25,000 to 30,000 Meskhetian Turks settled in Azerbaijan&lt;ref name="Aydıngün et al 2006 loc=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coene 2009 loc=67"/&gt; and a further 50,000 Meskhetian [[Turkish people|Turkish]] refugees arrived from [[Uzbekistan]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2003 loc=21"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Azembassy/&gt; According to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] 100,000 Meskhetian Turks were living in Azerbaijan in 1999&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999 loc=14"/&gt; Academic estimates have suggested that the Meskhetian Turkish community of Azerbaijan numbers 90,000 to 110,000.&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aydıngün et al 2006 loc=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burford 2011 loc=42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NATOPA/&gt; In addition, as of 2009, there were 17,577 Turkish citizens living in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=csgb/&gt;

'''Utmanzai''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: اتمان زی), also spelled '''Uthmanzai''' or '''Atmaanzai''', is a [[Pashtun tribe]] in Pakistan and Afghanistan.[[File:Mandarh.jpg|thumb|Peshawar tribes]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Family Tree.jpeg|thumb|Yousafzai Mandarh]] --&gt;
Utmanzai are generally considered to be a clan of [[Yusufzai]], but they are, in fact, cousin tribes. Ottman, the ancestor of Utmanzais was the son of Umar, who was the brother of Yusuf, the ancestor of Yusufzais. They live in [[Charsadda]], [[Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Topi]], Kotha, Maini, Batakara in Swabi District, Abbottabad, Sari Pandori, Khalabat Township, Haripur District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan. In Punjab they are settled in [[Kasur District]] and on displacement after construction of [[Tarbela Dam]], have settled in Attock, Hazara, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Khanewal Districts of Punjab .

[[File:Utmanzai.jpg|thumb|Utmanzai tribe]] 

The Utmanzai hold the extreme east of the right bank of the [[River Indus]], also settling in a small area in the south of the Gadoon valley, and early in the 15th century were called across the Indus by the Gujjars of Hazara as allies against the Tareen Afghans, and appropriated the Gandgarh tract from Tarbela to the southern border of Hazara. Prior to the 1960s, a huge population of Utmanzai tribe were living at the both sides of Indus river. People living there were migrated to different places in Pakistan due to the establishment of new Dam called Tarbela Dam near Tarbela Village. Most of them have settled in Haripur Khalabat Township. Some of them have settled in Punjab district Attock (Utmanabad, Pathankot, Islamkot, Sultanpur, Dareak). In Afghanistan Utmanzai lives near to the Pak-Afghan border(Torkham) in the village name Gardee Ghose.

[[File:Nara Monument.jpg|thumb|Nara Monument]]

In the times of Ahmad Shah Durani,Baba Said Khan, the head of the Said Khani family of the Utmanzai Pathans, held towns of Kota and Topi in Yusafzai area. He also founded Kalabat town to protect his possessions in Hazara. He was perpetually
fighting with the Other Pashtun tribes such as the Tarins, but managed to hold his own and gradually to extend his estates. His grand grandson,
Sadula Khan, was one of the boldest opponents of the Sikhs,defeating Sardar Hari Singh at Nara in the Gandgarh hills,Hazara
in the year 1824. A white pillar was put up by the British Major Abbott to mark the spot where Sadula Khan and his
retainers had fought and conquered.

'''Women in Guyana''' are [[South American women]] who lives in or are from [[Guyana]]. In general, Guyanese women play significant roles in modern-day Guyanese society as house-workers, farmers, market vendors, teachers, nurses, civil servants, and clerks. A few women of Guyana have become senior position holders in the [[Government of Guyana]]; there had even been one Guyanese who took the role as the [[President of Guyana]]. Education-wise, women in Guyana have outperformed male Guyanese in regional examinations. There are currently more women in Guyana who attend education in universities.&lt;ref name=Guyana&gt;{{cite web|last=Seecharan|first=Clem|title=Guyana|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Guyana.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Guyanese women living in urban areas of Guyana have taken roles as breadwinners for their families, particularly in working-class families.&lt;ref name=Guyana/&gt; 

In religion, obeah women participate as religious leaders in folk religion.&lt;ref name=Guyana/&gt;

{{Ranks of Nobility}}
[[File:Yeoman.warder.toweroflondon.arp.jpg|200px|thumb|A [[Yeoman Warder]] at the [[Tower of London]] in England]]
A '''yeoman''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|m|ə|n}} was a member of a [[social class]] in [[late medieval]] to [[early modern]] [[history of England|England]].  In early recorded uses, a yeoman was an [[Servant|attendant]] in a [[Nobility|noble]] [[household]];  hence titles such as "Yeoman of the Chamber", "Yeoman of the Crown", "Yeoman Usher", "King's Yeoman", [[Yeomen Warders]], [[Yeomen of the Guard]]. The later sense of yeoman as "a [[commoner]] who cultivates his own land" is recorded from the 15th century; in [[military]] context, yeoman was the rank of the third order of "fighting men", below [[knight]]s and [[squire]]s, but above [[servant|knaves]].
A specialized meaning in [[naval]] terminology,  "[[petty officer]] in charge of supplies", arose in the 1660s.

==Etymology==
The term is first recorded c. 1300. Its etymology is unclear. It may be a contraction of Old English ''iunge man'', meaning "young man" (compare [[:wikt:knave|knave]], meaning "boy"), but there are alternative suggestions, such as derivations from an unattested ''*ġeaman'' (a hypothetical cognate of [[Old Frisian|Old]] [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] ''gaman'', from ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gea-]]'' "province") meaning "villager; rustic".
[[The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale]] appears in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', written between 1387 and 1400.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}
{{Feudal status}}
During the late 14th to 18th centuries, yeomen were [[farmer]]s who owned land ([[Fee simple|freehold]], [[leasehold]] or [[copyhold]]). Their wealth and the size of their landholding varied. [[Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Richard Wagner]], Garter Principal [[King of Arms]], wrote that "a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres" (40 hectares) "and in social status is one step down from the [[Landed gentry]], but above, say, a [[husbandman]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Sir Anthony R., ''English Genealogy'', Oxford University Press, 1960, pp. 125–130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often it was hard to distinguish minor landed gentry from the wealthier yeomen, and wealthier [[Husbandman|husbandmen]] from the poorer yeomen.

The ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary|Concise Oxford Dictionary]]'' (edited by H.W. &amp; F.G. Fowler, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1972 reprint, p.&amp;nbsp;1516) states that a yeoman was "a person qualified by possessing free land of 40/- (shillings) annual [feudal] value, and who can serve on juries and vote for a [[Knight of the Shire]]. He is sometimes described as a small landowner, a farmer of the middle classes".

The term had a military sense as in the [[Yeomanry Cavalry]] of the late 18th century and [[Imperial Yeomanry]] of the late 1890s. The 'yeoman archer' was unique to [[England and Wales]] (in particular, the south Wales areas of [[Monmouthshire]] with the famed archers of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]]; and [[Glamorgan]], [[Crickhowell]], and [[Abergavenny]]; and South West England with the Royal [[Forest of Dean]], Kingswood Royal Forest near Bristol, and the [[New Forest]]). Though Kentish [[Weald]] and [[Cheshire archers]] were noted for their skills, it appears that the bulk of the 'yeomanry' was from the English and [[Welsh Marches]] (border regions).

The original Yeomen of the Guard (originally archers) chartered in 1485 were most likely of [[Britons (historic)|Brittonic]] descent, including [[Wales|Welshmen]] and [[Breton people|Bretons]]. They were established by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], himself of Welsh descent, who was exiled in [[Brittany]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]].  He recruited his forces mostly from [[Wales]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England on his journey to victory at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth Field]].

Yeomen were often [[constable]]s of their [[parish]], and sometimes [[chief constable]]s of the district, [[shire]] or [[hundred (division)|hundred]]. Many yeomen held the positions of [[bailiff]]s for the [[High Sheriff]] or for the shire or hundred. Other civic duties would include [[churchwarden]], bridge warden, and other [[warden (disambiguation)|warden]] duties. It was also common for a yeoman to be an [[Supervisor|overseer]] for his parish. Yeomen, whether working for a lord, king, shire, knight, district or parish served in localised or municipal police forces raised by or led by the [[landed gentry]].

Some of these roles, in particular those of constable and [[bailiff]] were carried down through families. Yeomen often filled ranging, roaming, surveying, and policing roles. In [[Chaucer]]'s Friar's Tale, a yeoman who is a bailiff of the forest who tricks the Summoner turns out to be the [[devil]] ready to grant wishes already made.

The earlier class of [[Franklin (class)|franklins]] (freemen or French or Norman freeholders) were similar to yeomen: wealthy peasant landowners, freeholders or village officials. They were typically village leaders ([[aldermen]]), constables or [[mayor]]s. Franklin militias were similar to later yeomanries. Yeomen took over those roles in the 14th century as many of them became leaders, constables, sheriffs, justices of the peace, mayors and significant leaders of their country districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O0XVn9ETkQIC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=yeoman+franklins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj_uzz543TAhUhI8AKHZlXDhwQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=yeoman%20franklins&amp;f=false|title=Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England|last=Cerasano|first=S.

In districts remoter from [[landed gentry]] and [[burgess (title)|burgesses]], yeomen held more official power: this is attested in statutes of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] indicating yeomen along with knights and squires as leaders for certain purposes.

The yeoman also comprised a military class or status (usually known as in the third order of the fighting class, between squire and page). By contrast, in contemporary feudal continental Europe, the divide between commoners and [[gentry]] was far wider: though a middle class existed, it was less esteemed than the yeoman of England of that time.

==United States==
{{Main|Plain Folk of the Old South}}
[[File:Wisconsin state coat of arms (illustrated, 1876).jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of Wisconsin during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], with yeoman on the right]]
In the United States, yeomen were identified in the 18th and 19th centuries as non-slaveholding, small landowning, family farmers. In Southern areas where land was poor, like [[East Tennessee]],&lt;ref&gt;The difficulty yeoman farmers faced in this region was notorious enough that it inspired the lyrics "Corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top; dirt's too rocky by far" in [http://www.utk.edu/athletics/tn_songs.shtml Rocky Top], now one of Tennessee's state songs.&lt;/ref&gt; the landowning yeomen were typically [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]], but some managed to grow some crops for market. Whether they engaged in subsistence or [[commercial agriculture]], they controlled far more modest landholdings than those of the [[Planter (American South)|planters]], typically in the range of 50–200 acres.  In the North, practically all the farms were operated by yeoman farmers as [[family farms]].

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was a leading advocate of the yeomen, arguing that the independent farmers formed the basis of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel C. Hyde Jr., "Plain Folk Yeomanry in the Antebellum South", in John Boles, Jr., ed., ''Companion to the American South,'' (2004) pp 139–155&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, [[Jeffersonian Democracy]] as a political force was largely built around the yeomen.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hahn, ''The Roots of Southern Populism: Yeoman Farmers and the Transformation of the Georgia Upcountry, 1850–1890'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Civil War, organizations of farmers, especially the [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]], formed to organize and enhance the status of the yeoman farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Woods, ''Knights of the Plow: Oliver H. Kelley and the Origins of the Grange in Republican Ideology'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard===
{{Main|Yeoman (United States Navy)}}
In the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]], the enlisted rating of yeoman describes an enlisted service member who performs administrative and clerical work ashore and embarked aboard vessels at sea. They deal with protocol, naval instructions, enlisted evaluations, commissioned officer fitness reports, naval messages, visitors, telephone calls and mail (both conventional and electronic). They organize files and operate office equipment and order and distribute office supplies. They write and type business and social letters, notices, directives, forms and reports.

It was celebrated as summer, before the [[Pentecost|Whitsunday]] or at the ''[[Poqraw]]'' eve ([[The Intercession]]). Commoners arranged a collective meal, and called for rain. Recent years Çük is celebrated in several districts of Tatarstan and is held in the manner of [[Sabantuy]], in Chuvash чӳке(н) - rinse.
