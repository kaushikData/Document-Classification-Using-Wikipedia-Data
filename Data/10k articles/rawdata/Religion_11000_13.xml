'''Abraham Straski''' (1903 &amp;ndash; 1987) was a [[Poland|Polish]] born [[Painting|painter]] who moved to the [[United States]] after surviving the [[Nazi]] concentrations camps in the [[Holocaust]]. His works are usually representations of [[rabbis]] done in warm, rich colors.

==Life==

Straski was raised in pre-World War II Europe as a devout follower of the Jewish faith.  While growing up, he grew close to Rabbis in his community who taught him [[violin]], [[cello]], and the [[Torah]]. He drew his inspiration for art from the Rabbis surrounding him in his local community.  During [[World War II]], his family was forced into a concentration camp.

While in the camps, Straski whenever possible saved small pieces of scrap paper and made thumbnail sketches of his teachers who he vowed would never be forgotten. It is said "he kept his sanity by painting the Rabbis of his youth.".&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=2003 | title=Jewish art, photography &amp; artifacts on exhibit at Chicago Fine Arts | work=THEATRE BUILDING CHICAGO DEBUTS 27TH SEASON | publisher=Theater Building Chicago | url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/artchicago/message/264 | accessdate=17 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some movements or sects within traditionally [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] or [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions recognize that it is possible to practice religious faith, spirituality and adherence to tenets without a belief in deities. People with what would be considered religious or spiritual belief in a supernatural controlling power are defined by some as adherents to a religion; the argument that atheism is a religion has been described as a contradiction in terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |credits=[[Bill Maher]] |series=Real Time with Bill Maher |serieslink=Real Time with Bill Maher |network=HBO |date=2012-02-03 |quote=Religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, and atheism is — precisely not that. Got it? Atheism is a religion like abstinence is a sex position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish atheism}}
In general, formulations of [[Jewish principles of faith]] require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the [[Shema]]). In many modern [[Jewish religious movements]], rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of [[Judaism]]. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practice Judaism as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] does not require any belief in a deity, and certain popular [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] prayer books, such as ''[[Gates of Prayer]]'', offer some services without mention of God. Jewish atheists who practice [[Humanistic Judaism]] embrace Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in a supernatural god, as the sources of their Jewish identity. One study found that only 48% of self-identified Jews believe in God.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf |title=While Most Americans Believe in God, Only 36% Attend a Religious Service Once a Month or More Often |author=Taylor, Humphrey. |year=2003 |quote=Protestants (90%) are more likely than Roman Catholics (79%) and much more likely than Jews (48%) to believe in God. Protestants (47%) are also more likely than Catholics (35%) to attend church once a month or more often. Only 16% of Jews go to synagogues once a month or more often. |accessdate=January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109031643/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an [[Cult image|idol]], Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rachmani|2002a}}; {{harvnb|Rachmani|2002b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian atheism}}
High rates of atheism have been found among self-identified [[Christian]]s in the United States. For example, 10% of self-identified [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and 21% of self-identified [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] were found to be atheists in a [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] survey from 2003.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive" /&gt;

There is no single [[Christianity|Christian]] approach toward atheism. The approach taken varies between [[Christian denomination]]s, and Christian ministers may intelligently distinguish an individual's claims of atheism from other nominal states of personal perspective, such as plain disbelief, an adherence to science, a misunderstanding of the nature of religious belief, or a disdain for organized religion in general.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] makes this explicit. While it identifies atheism as a violation of the [[Ten Commandments|First Commandment]], calling it "a sin against the virtue of religion", it is careful to acknowledge that atheism may be motivated by [[virtue|virtuous]] or [[moral]] considerations, and admonishes the followers of Roman Catholicism to focus on their own role in encouraging atheism by their religious or moral shortcomings:
:(2125) [...] The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, English version, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7E.HTM section 3.2.1.1.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628151746/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7E.HTM |date=June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous idiosyncratic atheist belief is that of [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]]. His book ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism'' (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless "a Christian confession of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altizer|1967|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Making clear the difference between his position and that of both [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] notion of the [[God is dead|death of God]] and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says, "To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altizer|1967|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey by "Faith Communities Today"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/news/011205.html Surveys: 'Uuism' unique Churchgoers from elsewhere, Christian Century Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122075528/http://www.uua.org/news/011205.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 18% of [[Unitarian Universalist]]s (UU) consider themselves to be atheists, with 54% considering themselves humanist. According to this study 16% of UUs consider themselves Buddhist, 13% Christian, and 13% [[Paganism|Pagan]].

===Islam===
{{See also|Discrimination against atheists in Islamic countries|Cultural Muslim}}
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Islam]], atheists are categorized as ''[[kafir]]'' ([[Wiktionary:كافر|كافر]]), a term that is also used to describe [[Shirk (Islam)|polytheists]] (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''), and that translates roughly as "denier" or "concealer". ''Kafir'' carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the Islamic community. In Arabic, "atheism" is generally translated ''ilhad'' ([[Wiktionary:إلحاد|إلحاد]]), although this also means "heresy".

The [[Quran]] is silent on [[Apostasy in Islam#Punishment for apostasy|the punishment for apostasy]], though not the subject itself. The Quran speaks repeatedly of people going back to unbelief after believing, and gives advice on dealing with "hypocrites":
Sura 9:73,74 {{quote|"O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them.  Their abode is Hell,-- an evil refuge indeed.  They swear by God that they said nothing [evil], but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was [their] only return for the bounty which God and His Apostle had enriched them!  If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back [to their evil ways], God will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter.  They shall have none on this earth to protect or help them."| Qur'an, sura 9 ([[At-Tawba]]), ayat 73-73&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|73|e=74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Hadith]] expound upon dealing with apostates:
{{quote|Narrated Abdullah: Allah's Messenger said, 'The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Messenger, cannot be shed except in three cases:  in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (Apostate) and leaves the Muslims."|{{hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|17}}}}

{{quote|Narrated Abu Qilaba: Once Umar bin Abdul Aziz sat on his throne in the courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him....He replied 'By Allah, Allah's messenger never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations:  1)  A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,)  2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and,  3) a man who fought against Allah and His messenger, and deserted Islam and became an apostate....'|{{hadith-usc|bukhari|9|83|37}}}}

{{quote|Narrated Ikrima: Some Zanadiqa ([[Zindiq|Zanadiqa]] refers to those who innovate within Islam, adding rules to Islam which didn't previously exist) were brought to 'Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn 'Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire). I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Apostle, "Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him."|{{hadith-usc|bukhari|9|84|57}}}}

The Qur'an refers to atheism in this verse:
The term commonly used for atheists is "Dahriyyah" from the Arabic word for "time" in a verse which speaks of people "who says that our death and Decimation are caused only by the passing of time".  (in [[Al-Jathiya|aljathiah]],)  24)

[045:024] And they say: "There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time)." And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture.

Other relevant Hadithic verses include Bukhari, volume 9, #58, 64, 271.

Muslims are not at liberty to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]] or become atheists. Atheists in Islamic countries and communities frequently [[Persecution of atheists in Islamic countries|conceal their non-belief]] (as do people with other condemned qualities, such as homosexuality).

In recent times, capital punishment for atheism is almost never applied, and convicted atheists may be jailed with an opportunity to recant or be stripped of certain civil rights. Religiosity in the Arab world is seen to be essential for morality and atheism is widely associated with immorality. Religious attitudes grew more conservative since the 1980s, compared to the preceding decades when secular socialism was politically dominant. Nonetheless, atheism is tolerated if it is not conspicuous and a worldwide support network for ex-Muslims has existed since 2007. Some commentators believe that the number of undeclared atheists in the Arab world is substantial. According to 2012 WIN/Gallup poll of Saudi citizens, 5 percent of Saudis identify as "convinced atheists", the same percentage as in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Invisible Atheists|author=AHMED BENCHEMSI|date=April 23, 2015|newspaper=New Republic|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly large [[Ex-Muslim|ex-Muslim communities]] in the [[Western world]] that adhere to no religion have been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Losing their religion: the hidden crisis of faith among Britain’s young Muslims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/17/losing-their-religion-british-ex-muslims-non-believers-hidden-crisis-faith|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Pan, ''[http://www.cfr.org/publication/8252/europe.html Europe: Integrating Islam]'', [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 2005-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification.&lt;ref name="Losing Their Religion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-06-22/losing-their-religion|title=Losing Their Religion|date=17 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany no longer embrace Islam in adulthood.&lt;ref name="fowid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |title=Religionszugehörigkeit Bevölkerung Deutschland |publisher=Forschungsgruppe Weltanschauungen in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115132325/http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
Atheism is often considered acceptable within [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Atheism in Hinduism}}
[[Atheism]] is a valid form of belief in [[Hinduism]]. Certain Hindu schools however view the path of the atheist as a very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn =  978-81-208-0899-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the six fundamental ''[[Āstika and nāstika|Astika]]'' schools of Hindu philosophy, the [[Samkhya]] do not accept God and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dasgupta| first = Surendranath| title = A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1992| page = 258| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258| isbn = 978-81-208-0412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya lacks the notion of a 'higher being' that is the ground of all existence. It proposes a thoroughly dualistic understanding of the cosmos, in which two parallel realities ([[Purusha]], the spiritual, and [[Prakriti]], the physical) coexist and the aim of life is the gaining of liberating self-knowledge of the Purusha.  Here, no God (better stated ''theos'') is present, yet Ultimate Reality in the form of the Purusha exists.

[[Cārvāka]] (also ''Charvaka'') was a [[materialist]] and atheist school of thought in [[India]], which is now known principally from fragments cited by its [[Astika]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world (cf [[Epicureanism]]). There is some evidence that the school persisted until at least 1578.

===Jainism===
{{See also|Transtheism}}
[[Jainism]] believes that the emancipated soul is itself God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sangave| first = Vilas| title = Aspects of Jaina religion – Issue 12 of Jñānapīṭha Mūrtidevī granthamālā: English series| publisher = Bhartiya Jnanpith| year = 2006| page = 27| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8UhvGRoyAqMC&amp;pg=PA27| isbn = 978-81-263-1273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jains do not believe in a creator God, but there is belief in numerous gods within the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chambliss| first = Joseph| title = Philosophy of education: an encyclopedia – Volume 1671 of Garland reference library of the humanities| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 1996| page = 38| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-YJlpiTbckgC&amp;pg=PA38| isbn = 978-0-8153-1177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] is often described as [[Nontheism|non-theistic]], since Buddhist authorities and canonical texts do not affirm, and sometimes deny, the following:

* The existence of a [[Creation myth|creation]], and therefore of a [[creator deity]]
* That a god (deva), gods, or other divine beings are the source of moral imperatives. Instead, the [[Dharma]] is an attribution of the universe
* That human beings or other creatures are responsible to a god or gods for their actions

All canonical Buddhist texts that mention the subject accept the ''existence'' (as distinct from the ''authority'') of a great number of spiritual beings, including the Vedic deities. From the point of view of Western theism, certain concepts of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] found in the [[Mahayana]] school of Buddhism, e.g. of [[Amitabha]] or the Adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with Western concepts of God, but [[Gautama Buddha]] himself denied that he was a god or divine.

==Chinese religions==
Some forms of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] do not explicitly affirm, nor are they founded upon a faith in, a higher being or beings. However, Confucian writings do have numerous references to ''[[Tian]]'' (Heaven), which denotes a transcendent power, with a personal connotation. [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] writings, such as that of [[Chu Hsi]], are vague on whether their conception of the Great Ultimate is like a personal deity or not. Although the Western translation of the [[Tao]] as "god" in some editions of the [[Tao te Ching]] is highly misleading, it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the [[Tao]] by [[Laozi]] has theistic or nontheistic undertones. Religious forms of Taoism do believe in a variety of cosmological beings, which are analogies to the cosmic forces within the universe.

==Other religions==
Religions that can be described as grey areas, and do not belong in the aforementioned categories, such as [[Unitarian Universalism]].

===Unitarian Universalism===
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a liberal religion, first founded when Unitarians and Universalists came together in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uua.org/central-east/regionalization/regi |title= Regionalization FAQ - Background Questions &amp; Nuts and Bolts |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Unitarian Universalist Association, atheists and agnostics are accepted and welcomed into the UU religion. 'People with atheist and agnostic beliefs find a supportive community in our congregations. We are pro-science, pro-reason, and pro-Evolution...Unitarian Universalism honors the differing paths we each travel. Our congregations are places where we celebrate, support, and challenge one another as we continue on these journeys.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/who-we-are/beliefs/atheist-agnostic|title= Atheist and Agnostic Unitarian Universalists|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UU also accepts Christians, and many other religions who believe in a higher being, but it is not restricted - the UUA says that 'Unitarian Universalists are agnostic, theist, atheist, and everything in between.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/higher-power |title= Existence of a Higher Power in Unitarian Universalism|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satanism==
{{See also|Satanism|Theistic Satanism}}
[[LaVeyan Satanism]] is atheistic, rejecting belief in God and all other deities, including, to the surprise of many, Satan. "Satanism begins with atheism," said [[Church of Satan]] High Priest [[Peter H. Gilmore]] in an interview. "We begin with the universe and say, 'It’s indifferent. There’s no God, there’s no Devil. No one cares!'"&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Satanism: An interview with Church of Satan High Priest Peter Gilmore|Interview with Peter H. Gilmore]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]', November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of God is performed and satisfied by the satanist him/herself. The needs of worship, ritual, and religious/spiritual focus are directed inwards towards the satanist, as opposed to outwards, towards a deity. It rejects concepts such as prayer, the afterlife, and divine forces.

Legal treatment of atheism has in the past and continues to vary tremendously across different jurisdictions.  Three major types of national regime exist: [[state atheism]], where atheism is supported by the government; [[state religion]], where a specific religion or sect is supported by the state, and a [[secular state]] which supports neither.  Most ancient civilizations (from city-states to empires) had state religions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Law|author=Henry James Sumner Maine|publisher=Cosimo Classics (New York, 2005)|isbn=978-1596052260}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern countries are secular.  State atheism is currently practiced in China and Vietnam, but unlike the strongly enforced bans on religious worship in the early Soviet Union and after the Communist Revolution in China, [[freedom of religion]] is currently established by law in both China and Vietnam, and respected in practice to some degree (see [[Freedom of religion in China]] and [[Freedom of religion in Vietnam]]).  The minority of modern countries with state religions have established interpretations of either Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.

Countries with state religions range from those with extremely tolerant laws, like the [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], to those where the police enforce daily prayer, like [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]].  Under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system of the Ottoman Empire]], separate systems of family law are enforced by religious authorities for their separate communities. This system was inherited by and is still in use to various degrees in various Middle Eastern countries, including [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Egypt]], and [[Greece]] (for religious minorities).  Similar separate systems are used in [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].  These systems sometimes create legal problems for atheists and couples of different religions.  Atheists may be forced to declare an approved religion, or may be assigned one based on their ethnicity.

Even in counties where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution or other fundamental law, practices or beliefs of a specific religion might be reflected in ostensibly secular codes.  For example, [[blue law]]s in some Christian countries have enforced certain observances of the [[Sabbath]] on Sunday, for example by banning alcohol sales or forcing businesses to close.  Laws surrounding [[nudity]], [[pornography]], [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[homosexuality]], [[gambling]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]] often track religious sensibilities, though some argue that these are cultural rather than religious prohibitions, though there may be an influence of religious thinking on culture.  Major early transitions from state religions to secular states in Western Christiandom were noted in [[Colonial North America]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]]. Prohibitions against state support for any particular religion or against required participation are not always enforced, particularly early in this transition process, and local laws in strongly religious communities may conflict with higher-level law.  For example, official [[school prayer]] was allowed in the United States until 1962.  Freedom of religion was affirmed in nearly all countries in 1966 by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].  Despite having no state religion, the German government collects religious taxes for the constituents of several religions; the fee for leaving a religious body has been [[Freedom_of_religion_in_Germany#Fee_for_leaving_a_religious_corporate_body_under_public_law|challenged by atheists]].

Some states, regardless of state endorsement of a religion, protect major religions against insult (which may include profession of atheism or criticism of religion by atheists), including [[Freedom of religion in Indonesia|Indonesia]].  Other religious crimes which may cause legal problems for atheists include 
[[heresy]], [[blasphemy]], [[apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abraham's Children: Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict |editor=Kelly James Clark |publisher=Yale University Press (USA)|year=2012|isbn=978-0300179378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain (English Law) ===
The chief law officer is called [[Lord Chancellor]] and holds the [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|title]] of 'the [[conscience]] of the [[monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780192839756/English-Constitution-Bagehot-Walter-0192839756/plp |author= Walter Bagehot|year=1867|publisher=Oxford University Press (USA 2001) |isbn=978-0192839756 |title=The English Constitution (Oxford World's Classics) |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British subjects have a long history of religious upheaval from the time when [[Henry VIII of England]] ordered the [[English Reformation]]. There followed a long period of alternate suppressions and liberalizations until, following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] when common law became progressively more descriptive than prescriptive, judges were allowed some latitude in determining guilt (which is why [[English law]] is so ambiguous).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Religious Tradition and the Genius of Anglicanism|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publisher|author=Most Reverend Rowan Williams Archbishop of Canterbury|year=2009|isbn=978-1606082096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British "religious atheists" are numerous and might include [[George Fox]], [[John Wesley]] and, notably [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose body is displayed in the South Cloister of [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John Tyndall's Transcendental Materialism and the Conflict Between Religion and Science in Victorian England (Distinguished Dissertations)|editor=Stephen  Kim|year=1996|isbn=978-0773422780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Atheism in the United States is protected under the [[First Amendment]]'s [[Free Exercise Clause]]. There are also online churches that have been created by atheists to secure legal rights, to ordain atheist clergy to hold ceremonies, as well as for parody, education, and advocacy.&lt;ref name=firstchurchofatheism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstchurchofatheism.com/index.php/about/ |title=About First Church of Atheism |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711004751/http://firstchurchofatheism.com/index.php/about/| archivedate= 11 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoffreethought.org/ |title=North Texas Church of Freethought |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080425/http://www.churchoffreethought.org/| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcof.org/Content-Public/Page-Edit/Page.asp?iID=-1145332288 |title=Houston Church of Freethought |accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080916/http://www.hcof.org/Content-Public/Page-Edit/Page.asp?iID=-1145332288| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46214/ |title=Do Atheists Need a Church? |accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11: 
{{quote|As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Matt Dillahunty]] |url=http://www.atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=742 |title=Atheism and the Law |format= |publisher=Atheist Community of Austin |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615213106/http://atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=742 |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Bishop of Greenland''' is a [[diocese|diocesan]] [[bishop]] of the [[Church of Denmark]], and the leader of the [[Church of Greenland]], which is an episcopal church in the [[Lutheran]] tradition.

==History==
Historically (before the [[Reformation]]) the Bishop of Greenland was known as the [[Garðar, Greenland|Bishop of Garðar]]. After the reformation, the diocese fell into disuse. In 1984 Kristian Mørch was appointed as vice-bishop to oversee and work in Greenland as a resident bishop. It was only in 1993 that a diocese was once more established in Greenland with its name changed to the Diocese of Greenland and the bishop known as the bishop of Greenland. Kristian Mørch became the first bishop.

==Current Bishop of Greenland==
The current bishop is the Right Reverend [[Sofie Petersen]].&lt;ref&gt;See biographical entry [http://groenlandsstift.dk/gb/biskoppen.html here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504200627/http://groenlandsstift.dk/gb/biskoppen.html |date=May 4, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; She is an accomplished theologian, and during her episcopacy she has personally overseen the introduction of a new translation of the Bible in Greenlandic, as well as a Greenlandic language hymnal, and a Greenlandic edition of the (originally Danish language) prayer book of the Church of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;All these achievements are reported [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/294753:Mennesker--Travl-groenlandsk-teolog here] (text in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Kerry - An Aboriginal Bora Ceremony, 1898.jpg|frameless|center|275px]]|caption=Photograph of a Bora ceremony, taken in 1898 by [[Charles Kerry]].
}}
'''Bora''' is an [[initiation]] ceremony of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] people of [[Australia|Eastern Australia]], descended from groups that existed in Australia and surrounding islands before European colonisation. The word "bora" also refers to the site on which the initiation is performed. At such a site, boys, having reached puberty, achieve the status of men. The initiation ceremony differs from Aboriginal culture to culture, but often, at a physical level, involved [[scarification]], circumcision, [[subincision]] and, in some regions, also the removal of a tooth.{{sfn|Rolls|Johnson|2010|p=40}} During the rites, the youths who were to be initiated were taught traditional sacred songs, the secrets of the tribe's religious visions, dances, and traditional lore. Many different clans would assemble to participate in an initiation ceremony. Women and children were not permitted to be present at the sacred bora ground where these rituals were undertaken.{{sfn|Rolls|Johnson|2010|p=40}}

==Bora terminology==
The word ''Bora'' was originally taken from the [[Gamilaraay language]] spoken by the [[Gamilaraay|Kamilaroi]] people who lived in the region north of the [[Hunter Valley]] in New South Wales to southern Queensland.{{sfn|Fuller|Hamacher|Norris|2013|p=31}} It was then adopted broadly to describe similar ritual sites and the ceremonies associated with them performed throughout Eastern Australia.{{sfn|Fuller|Hamacher|Norris|2013|p=30}} Many other terms exist across Australia{{sfn|Rolls|Johnson|2010|p=40}} to denote similar initiatory rites on a ceremonial ground, such as ''burbung'' ([[Wiradjuri]]), and ''kuringal'' ([[Yuin]]).{{sfn|Berndt|1974|p=28}} The specific word is said to come from the belt worn by initiated men.

==Bora grounds and mythology==
The appearance of the site varies among cultures, but it is often associated with [[stone arrangements]], [[Sydney Rock Engravings|rock engravings]], or other [[Indigenous Australian art|art works]]. In the bora rites of southeastern Australia, two circles were drawn, connected by a pathway, a schema which appears to replicate a sky Bora, or the configuration of a series of positions in the [[Milky Way]]. Typically, bora ground comprised a larger circle with a diameter of between 20–30 metres, and a smaller ring around 10–15 metres in diameter. The former was a more public space while the latter was sacred, and restricted to male participants who were either the instructing male elders or the initiands.{{sfn|Fuller|Hamacher|Norris|2013|pp=31–32}}

In south-east Australia, the Bora is often associated with the creator-spirit [[Baiame]]. In the [[Sydney]] region, large earth mounds were made, shaped as long bands or simple circles. Sometimes the boys would have to pass along a path marked on the ground representing the transition from childhood to manhood, and this path might be marked by a stone arrangement or by spirit footprints (''mundowa''),{{sfn|Prineas|Gold|1997|p=184}} cut into the rock. In other areas of south-east Australia, a Bora site might consist of two circles of stones, and the boys would start the ceremony in the larger, public, one, and end it in the other, smaller, one, to which only initiated men are admitted. Matthews (1897) gives an excellent eye-witness account of a Bora ceremony, and explains the common use of the two circles. One very fine example of a two ring bora ceremonial site used to exist in [[Alberton, Queensland|Alberton]] till it was destroyed, and made way for a pineapple plantation in the late 1950s. The smaller southern ring contained a [[dolmen]]-like structure.{{sfn|Ponosov|1974|pp=69–70}}

The rings are joined by a sacred walkway. While most are confined to south-east [[Queensland]] and eastern [[New South Wales]], five earth rings have been recorded near the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] town of [[Sunbury earth rings|Sunbury]], although Aboriginal use has not been documented.{{sfn|Fuller|Hamacher|Norris|2013|pp=31–32}}{{sfn|Frankel|1982|pp=89–97}}{{sfn|Eidelson|1997|pp=92–97}}

Bora rings in the form of circles of individually placed stones are evident in [[Werrikimbe National Park]] in northern New South Wales.

'''Charles Bailey''' (1870&amp;ndash;1947) was an Australian [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] medium who was exposed as a fraud.&lt;ref name="Watt 2007"&gt;Irwin, Harvey J; [[Caroline Watt|Watt, Caroline]]. (2007). ''An Introduction to Parapsychology, 5th ed''. McFarland. pp. 24-26. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3059-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career== 

Bailey was born in [[Melbourne]]. He worked as a bootmaker and became a famous apport [[mediumship|medium]]. He claimed with the help of his [[spirit guide]] "Abdul" that he could apport live items such as [[fish]], crabs, turtles, [[coin]]s, stones and antiques in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channelling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. pp. 27-28. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Bailey was exposed as a fraud in [[Grenoble]], France. He produced two live birds but was unaware that the dealer who he had bought the birds from was present in the séance.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]]. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-1578592098}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joseph McCabe]] before the séance he had hidden the birds in the "unpleasant end of his [[Human gastrointestinal tract|alimentary canal]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]].

[[File:Cain Henri Vidal Tuileries.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cain, by [[Henri Vidal (sculptor)|Henri Vidal]], [[Jardin des Tuileries]], [[Paris]]]]

The '''curse of Cain''' and the '''mark of Cain''' are phrases that originated in the story of [[Adam and Eve]] in the Hebrew Bible. In the stories, if someone did something to harm [[Cain]], the damage would come back sevenfold. Some interpretations view this as a physical mark, whereas other interpretations see the "mark" as a sign, and not as a physical marking on Cain himself. The [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] reads "set a mark upon Cain."

== Origins ==
{{Main article|Cain and Abel}}
{{Religious text primary|section|date=November 2017}}
There is no clear consensus as to what Cain's mark was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thursby|first=Jacqueline S.|date=2013|title=A SLAVE TALE: CLOSING AN ANCIENT ANATHEMA.|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1498460617|journal=NAAAS Conference Proceedings. National Association of African American Studies|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2017}} The word translated as "mark" in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+4%3A15&amp;version=NIV Genesis 4:15] is '' 'owth'', which could mean a sign, omen, warning, remembrance, motion, gesture, agreement, miracle, wonder, or, most commonly, a letter. In the [[Torah]], the same word is used to describe the stars as signs or omens ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A14&amp;version=NIV Genesis 1:14]), the rainbow as the sign of [[God]]'s promise to never again destroy his creation with a [[Genesis flood narrative|flood]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+9%3A12&amp;version=NIV Genesis 9:12]), [[circumcision]] as a token of God's covenant with [[Abraham]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+17%3A11&amp;version=NIV Genesis 17:11]), and the miracles performed by [[Moses]] before the [[Pharaoh]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV Exodus 4:8],[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+4%3A9&amp;version=NIV 9],[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+4%3A17&amp;version=NIV 17],[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+4%3A28&amp;version=NIV 28]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A3&amp;version=NIV 7:3]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+8%3A23&amp;version=NIV 8:23]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+10%3A1&amp;version=NIV 10:1],[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+10%3A2&amp;version=NIV 2]).

== Curse of Cain ==
[[File:Glasgow Botanic Gardens. Kibble Palace. Edwin Roscoe Mullins - 'Cain' (c. 1899).jpg|thumb|[[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]]. Kibble Palace. Edwin Roscoe Mullins - ''Cain'' or ''My Punishment is Greater than I can Bear'' ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+4%3A13&amp;version=NIV Genesis 4:13]), about 1899.]]
The narrative of the curse of Cain is found in the text of {{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:11-16|HE}}. The curse was the result of Cain murdering his brother, Abel, and lying about the murder to God.{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=93}} When Cain spilled his brother's blood, the earth became cursed as soon as the blood hit the ground. In a sense, the earth was left "drinking Abel's blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=95}}: {{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:12|HE}} gives a two-part [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] for Cain's curse. The first concerns the earth that was cursed by Abel's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=97}}: Kugel, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Should Cain attempt to farm the land, the earth would not yield produce for him. This may imply why he went on to build cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=97}}: Wenham, 108&lt;/ref&gt; namely the City of Enoch. The second part of the curse marks Cain as a fugitive ({{Lang-he-n|נע}} ) and a wanderer ({{Lang-he-n|נד}} ). The combination making up this Hebrew phrase {{Hebrew|נע ונד}}, "fugitive and wanderer", is unique in the Hebrew Bible. Modern interpretations of the Hebrew verse 12 suggest that Cain went on to live a nomadic lifestyle and that he was also excluded from the family unit.{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=97}} In the [[Septuagint]], the emphasis on Cain's curse is dramatically increased by the combination of the Greek participles στένων καὶ τρέμων ("groaning and shaking upon the earth").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=98}}: Brayford, 254&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syriac Christianity]]{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=100}} interprets the Greek version to mean that Cain experienced a real physical affliction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=98}}: ''See footnote 14''&lt;/ref&gt; that would enable others to know who he was when they saw him. [[Philo]] interprets the ''Greek'' verse 12 as an allegory for Cain's fear of being [[wikt:soulless|soulless]]. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and the [[Targum]]s translate the same verse to mean that Cain feared being "an exile and an unstable man".{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=98-100}}

==Mark of Cain==
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for ''mark'' (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Oth'', {{Hebrew|אות}}) could mean a sign, an omen, a warning, or a remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= BDB |first= [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]] |title= The Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon: with an appendix containing the Biblical Aramaic; coded with the numbering system from "Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible" |publisher= Hendrickson |location= Peabody |isbn= 9781565632066 |edition= 7. print. 1997 |author2=[[Samuel Rolles Driver]] |author3=[[Charles Augustus Briggs]] |page= 16f }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mark of Cain'' is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=119}}: Mellinkoff, 1942, p.210; Moberley, 2007, p.11-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that the mark was a Hebrew letter placed on either the face or the arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=120}}: (''Tg. Ps.-J.'' Gen 4:15, ''Pirqe R. El.'' 21)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]] translates the ''mark'' as a "sign". Thus, it is speculated that the mark served as a ''sign'' to others not to commit the same offense.&lt;ref name="GenRab22"&gt;{{harvnb|Byron|2011|p=120}}: ''Gen. Rab.'' 22:12&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also uncertainty as to why Cain should have feared being killed, since the Book of Genesis does not at that point indicate that there were any human beings then alive other than his parents, Adam and Eve.{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=106}} It is possible that Cain was referring to his future siblings and their descendants, or his own descendants and family, since Cain did in fact take a wife (Genesis 4:17).{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Judaism===
[[Abba Arika]] ("Rab") said that God gave Cain a dog, making him an example to murderers. [[Abba Jose ben Hanan]] said that God made a horn grow out of Cain. [[Haninah|R. Hanin]] said that God made Cain an example to [[penitent]]s (''[[Genesis Rabbah|Gen. Rab.]]'' 22:12).&lt;ref name="GenRab22"/&gt;

[[Rashi]] comments on Genesis 4:15 by saying that the mark was one of the Hebrew letters of the [[Tetragrammaton]]:
"He engraved a letter of His [God's] Name onto his [Cain's] forehead."&lt;ref name="Rashi_Parshat_Bereshit_4_15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8168/showrashi/true#v15 |title=Genesis - Chapter 4 (Parshah Bereishit) - Tanakh Online - Torah - Bible |publisher=Chabad.org |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kabbalah]], the [[Zohar]] states that the mark of Cain was one of the twenty-two [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] of the [[Torah]], although the Zohar's native [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] does not actually tell us which of the letters it was. Some commentators, such as [[Michael Berg (Kabbalah Centre)|Rabbi Michael Berg]] in his English commentary on the Zohar, suggest that the mark of Cain was the letter [[Waw (letter)|vav]].&lt;ref name="Zohar_Parshat_Bereshit"&gt;[http://www.zohar.com/zohar.php?portion=2&amp;section=69 Zohar Parshat Bereshit]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Requires login.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
According to author Ruth Mellikoff, commentators' interpretations of the nature of the "mark" depended on their views regarding the status of Cain, as either being given additional time to repent or as being further shamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hl4cspVFWmMC&amp;pg=PA5 |last=Mellinkoff |first=Ruth |title=The Mark of Cain |page=13 |publisher=University of California Press, |year=1981 |isbn=9780520906372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant Beliefs on the Mark of Cain==
At some point after the start of the [[Slavery in the United States|slave trade in the United States]], many{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations began teaching the belief that the mark of Cain was a dark skin tone, although early descriptions of [[Romani people|Romani]] as "descendants of Cain" written by [[Franciscan]] monk [[Symon Semeonis]] suggest that this belief had existed for some time. Protestant preachers wrote exegetical analyses of the curse, with the assumption that it was dark skin.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, Josiah [https://archive.org/stream/slaveryasitrela00priegoog#page/n136/mode/2up/search/Cain ''Slavery as it Relates to the Negro or African Race''] (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early church exegesis===
In [[Syriac Christianity]], early exegesis on the "curse" and the "mark", associated the curse of Cain with black skin, although not in a racial sense.{{sfn|Goldenberg|2003|p=180}}

In an Eastern Christian (Armenian) Adam-book (5th or 6th century), it is written: "And the Lord was wroth with Cain. . . He beat Cain's face with hail, which blackened like coal, and thus he remained with a black face".&lt;ref&gt;The History of Abel and Cain, 10, in Lipscomb, ''The Armenian Apocryphal Adam Literature'', pp. 145, 250 (text) and 160, 271 (translation)&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this indicated that his face, not his body, had been changed, and that this change had no bearing on any racial or ethnic group.

===Baptist segregation===
The split between the Northern and Southern [[Baptists|Baptist]] organizations arose over doctrinal issues pertaining to [[slavery]] and the education of slaves. At the time of the split, the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] group used the curse of Cain as a justification for slavery. Some 19th- and 20th-century Baptist ministers in the [[Southern United States]] taught the belief that there were two separate heavens; one for [[Black people|blacks]], and one for [[White people|whites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.emmetttillmurder.com/Ebony%201956.htm |title= Land of the Till Murder |publisher= ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' |date= April 1956 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050311114146/http://www.emmetttillmurder.com/Ebony%201956.htm |archivedate= 2005-03-11 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Baptists have either taught or practiced various forms of [[racial segregation]] well into the mid-to-late-20th century, though members of all races were accepted at worship services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery |last1= Miller |first1= Randall M. |last2= Smith |first2= John David |year= 1988 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 0-313-23814-6 |page= 78 |quote= Slaves were accepted for membership in the same manner as whites. After expressing a desire to join a church, one was required to relate his or her religious experience. If the congregation was favorably impressed by one's testimony, the applicant was accepted into the fellowship and was baptized. When black church members moved from one community to another, they were given letters of dismissal which they might place with another Baptist church. Black church members worshiped in the sanctuary with whites, participated in the service of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], and contributed to help support the various programs of the denomination. Still blacks and females in antebellum Baptist churches held a membership status subordinate to that of white adult males, since that group determined denominational policies and procedures. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] officially denounced [[racism]] and apologized for its past defense of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kunnerth |first= Jeff |title= Baptists Renounce Racist Past |newspaper= Orlando Sentinel |date= 21 June 1995 |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-06-21/news/9506210026_1_southern-baptist-northern-baptists-general-baptist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curse of Cain was used to support a ban on ordaining blacks to most Protestant clergies until the 1960s in both the United States and Europe{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. The majority of Christian churches in the world, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, [[Anglican]] churches, and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, did not recognize these interpretations and did not participate in the religious movement to support them. Certain Catholic [[diocese]]s in the Southern United States adopted a policy of not ordaining blacks to oversee, administer the [[sacraments]] to, or accept confessions from white parishioners. This policy was not based on a "curse of Cain" teaching, but was justified by the widely held perception that slaves should not rule over their masters. However, this was not approved of by the [[Pope]] or by any papal teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery.&lt;!-- This former inline text needs to be converted to a proper reference citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curse of Ham===
{{Further information|Canaan#Black Africans as descendants of Canaan}}
The Curse of Cain was often conflated with the [[Curse of Ham]]. According to the Bible, [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] discovered his father [[Noah]] drunk and naked in his tent, but instead of honoring his father by covering his nakedness, he ran and told his brothers about it. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] by saying that he was to be "a servant of servants". ({{bibleref2|Genesis|9:20-27|KJV}}) One interpretation of this passage states that Ham married a descendant of Cain, who was black, so that the descendants of Canaan were both marked with black skin and cursed to be servants of servants. While there is no indication in the Bible of Ham's wife descending from Cain, this interpretation was used to justify slavery and it was particularly popular in America during the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=AmericanHam&gt;Benjamin Braude, "The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, "William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103–142. See also [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1853423 William McKee Evans], "From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swift Superstition"&gt;John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, "'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'", ''American Literary Realism'', vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars now believe that the [[Canaanites]] are of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] origin, and therefore unrelated to black Africans.

===Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Black people in Mormon doctrine|Black people and early Mormonism|Black people and Mormonism|Black Mormons}}
[[Mormonism]] began during the height of Protestant acceptance of the curse of Cain doctrine in America, as well as the even more popular [[curse of Ham]] doctrine.  Like many Americans,&lt;ref name=AmericanHam /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swift Superstition" /&gt; [[Mormons]] of the 19th century commonly assumed that black Africans had Cain's "mark" of black skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/sermons_talks_interviews/brigham1852feb5_priesthoodandblacks.htm |title= Brigham Young's Speech on Slavery, Blacks, and the Priesthood |date= Feb 5, 1852 }}. Reprint by [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner|Utah Lighthouse Ministry]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ham's curse to be servants of servants.&lt;ref name=SmithHam&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate/Volume 2/Number 7/Letter to Oliver Cowdery from Joseph Smith, Jr. (Apr. 1836) | last  = Smith | first = Joseph | year  = 1836 | pages = 290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Joseph Smith]] indicated his belief in the curse of Ham theory in a parenthetical reference as early as 1831,&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript History 19 June 1831 {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the reference is not to the "curse or mark of Cain" as in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], it is attributed to [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.7-8,12,22?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p6 an act of genocide] upon "the people of Shum" and includes the statement that after this act the descendent of Cain were shunned: "And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, for the seed of Cain were black, and had not place among them." ({{lds|Moses|moses|7|22}})

As related by [[Abraham O. Smoot]] after his death, [[Apostle]] [[David W. Patten]] said he encountered a black man in [[Paris, Tennessee]], who said that he was [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. The account states that Cain had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men. &lt;ref name="Wilson 1904"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiting 2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Whiting|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}} The recollection of Patten's story is quoted in [[Apostle]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s ''[[The Miracle of Forgiveness]]''. 

The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the [[Old Testament]] in LDS Institutes, teaches that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain:
{{blockquote|Therefore, although Ham himself had the right to the priesthood, Canaan, his son, did not. Ham had married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain (Abraham 1:21–24), and so his sons were denied the priesthood.&lt;ref name="lds.org"&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament Student Manual Genesis-2 Samuel|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/genesis-4-11-the-patriarchs?lang=eng&amp;clang=pes&amp;_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Priesthood ban====
{{Main article|Black people and priesthood (LDS)}}
There is evidence that Joseph Smith did not consider the ban on black men to the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] to be relevant in modern times, since he himself (and other church leaders close to him) ordained black men into it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black History Timeline|url=http://www.blacklds.org/history|work=BlackLDS.org|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Elijah Abel]] and [[Walker Lewis]].

After the [[death of Joseph Smith]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) was the largest of several organizations claiming succession from Smith's church. [[Brigham Young]] (the second [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]]) accepted the idea that people of African ancestry were generally under the curse of Cain, and in 1852, he stated that people of black African descent were not eligible to hold the church's priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilford Woodruff]], Diary of Wilford Woodruff, January 16, 1852. "[A]ny man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] … in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ".&lt;/ref&gt; Young taught that in the [[war in heaven]], both Cain and Abel were leaders.  The spirits of black people fought under Cain and were assigned to be Cain's descendant.  Those that fought under Abel were assigned to be Abel's descendants.  Cain hoped that by killing his brother, the spirits that were under him would have an advantage over the spirits under Abel.  However, God cursed Cain and his descendants to not have the priesthood until all of Abel's descendants had the priesthood.  The spirits of black people understood this and stood with Cain and accepted the punishment.&lt;ref name="Neither White Nor Black" &gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Bush |editor-first= Lester E., Jr. |editor2-last= Mauss |editor2-first= Armand L. |editor2-link= Armand L. Mauss |title= Neither White Nor Black: Mormon Scholars Confront the Race Issue in a Universal Church |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |year= 1984 |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=438 |isbn= 0-941214-22-2|quote=Cain, in murdering Abel, had “deprived his brother of the privilege of pursuing his journey through life, and of extending his kingdom by multiplying upon the earth.” Cain had reportedly hoped thereby to gain an advantage over Abel—the number of one’s posterity somehow being important in the overall scheme of things. Brigham Young further explained that those who were to have been Abel’s descendants had already been assigned to his lineage, and if they were ever to come “into the world in the regular way, they would have to come through him.” In order that Cain’s posterity not gain an advantage the Lord denied them the priesthood until such time as “the class of spirits presided over by Abel should have the privilege of coming into the world.” Those spirits formerly under Cain’s leadership were reportedly aware of the implications of this decision, yet “still looked up to him, and rather than forsake him they were willing to bear his burdens and share the penalty imposed upon him.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwTrAAAAMAAJ|title=Dialogue|page=253|publisher=Dialogue Foundation|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ban on the priesthood affected black members differently than it did in other churches because the LDS Church has a [[Laity|lay]] priesthood in which virtually all worthy male members become priesthood holders.

Several of his successors defended it as being a result of the curse of Cain, though some disagreed. [[Sterling M. McMurrin]] reported that, in 1954, church president [[David O. McKay]] said: "There is not now, and there never has been a doctrine in this church that the negroes are under a divine curse. There is no doctrine in the church of any kind pertaining to the negro. We believe that we have a scriptural precedent for withholding the priesthood from the negro. It is a practice, not a doctrine, and the practice someday will be changed. And that's all there is to it."&lt;ref&gt;Sterling M. McMurrin affidavit, March 6, 1979. See ''[[David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism]]'' by [[Greg Prince]] and [[William Robert Wright]], page {{page needed|date=September 2012}}. Quoted by [http://www.ldsgenesisgroup.com/howtoreach.html Genesis Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713192439/http://www.ldsgenesisgroup.com/howtoreach.html |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, LDS Church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]] reported receiving [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|a revelation]] from God allowing all worthy male members of the church to receive the priesthood without regard to race or color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=12&amp;topic=events |title= Spencer W. Kimball – Significant Events |publisher= lds.org |accessdate= 2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/2 |title= Official Declaration 2 }} (LDS [[standard works]]); see also: [[Official Declaration 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The news was greeted with joy and relief by Mormons. Although the church had previously been criticized for its policy during the [[civil rights movement]], the change seems to have been prompted by problems facing mixed-race converts in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= Richard |last= Bushman |authorlink= Richard Bushman |year= 2008 |title= Mormonism: a very short introduction |pages= 111–12 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 0-19-531030-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has neither been an official or an explicit church repudiation of its policy, nor has there been an admission that it was a mistake. Many black church members think that giving an apology would be a "detriment" to church work and a catalyst for further racial misunderstanding. [[African Americans|African-American]] church member Bryan E. Powell says: "There is no pleasure in old news, and this news is old." Gladys Newkirk agrees, stating: "I've never experienced any problems in this church. I don't need an apology .... We're the result of an apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bill |last= Broadway |publisher= ''[[Washington Post]]'' |date= 1998-05-30 |url= http://www.ldshistory.net/1990/mhablack.htm |title= Black Mormons Resist Apology Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Black Mormons say that they are willing to look beyond the former teachings and cleave to the doctrines of the church, in part because of its powerful, detailed teachings on life after death.&lt;ref name=Ramirez2005&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-blackmormons,1,708682.story?page=1&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |title= Mormon past steeped in racism: Some black members want church to denounce racist doctrines |first= Margaret |last= Ramirez |date= 2005-07-26 |publisher= ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church has issued an official statement about past practices and theories regarding skin color, stating: "[t]oday, the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, ... Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood |title= Race and the Priesthood |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Utah was considering slavery, Brigham Young told the Utah Territorial Legislature that the curse of Cain required slavery.  He argued that until all of the descendants of Abel have access to the priesthood, all of the descendants of Cain should remain in servitude.&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;{{citation |title= The Teachings of President Brigham Young: Vol. 3 1852–1854 |editor-first= Fred C. |editor-last= Collier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkRZGQ8oO8IC|year= 1987 |first= Brigham |last= Young |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Colliers Publishing Company |isbn= 0934964017 |oclc= 18192348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}  He argued that because they did not have the right to govern the affairs of the Church due to the priesthood ban, they also shouldn't have the right to govern the affairs of the state, including the right to vote.&lt;ref name=Collier /&gt;{{rp|47}} He warned that if they made the children of Cain equal to them, they would be cursed.&lt;ref name=Collier /&gt;{{rp|48}}  He also argued that if someone married a descendant of Cain, that they would also have the same curse.&lt;ref name=Collier /&gt;{{rp|48}}

'''David Kwang-sun Suh''' an ordained minister of the [[Presbyterian Church of Korea]] and was the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at  [[Ewha Womans University]] of Seoul, Korea until he was arrested in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to Third World theologies |last=Parratt |first=John |page=98 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-79739-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is perhaps best known as a major representative of the first generation of Korean [[minjung theology|minjung theologians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David Kwang-sun| last= Suh|title=The Korean Minjung in Christ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3U0EAAAACAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-57910-509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minjung Theology ==
Suh traces the origins of minjung theology to the [[March First Movement]] of 1919, an independence movement triggered by the end of [[World War I]] and the death of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Kojong]], the last king of the [[Yi Dynasty]].  It was during the 1919 independence movement when Korean [[minjung]] and Korean Christians partnered together to rise against foreign domination and liberate themselves from Japanese rule, thereby giving birth to [[minjung theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Suh, 36-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

While Suh sees minjung theology as being borne from a political movement, he also clarifies that it has risen from the indigenous [[Korean shamanism]] as a religion of the poor, oppressed, and marginalized.  Combined with the spiritual mindset of Korean shamanism, Suh writes that "For the powerless minjung, the power of the spirit, more particularly the power of the Holy Ghost, is most respected and awed.  To become a Christian is to believe in the power of the Holy Ghost which is much more powerful than their shaman spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Suh, 116&lt;/ref&gt;  The spirituality of the minjung, then, is a spirituality that has emerged from the feelings of ''[[Han (cultural)|han]]''—the deep feeling of suffering and helplessness experienced by the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|author1=Virginia Fabella|author2=Kwang-sŏn Sŏ|title=Asian Christian spirituality: reclaiming traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxPZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 May 2011|date=February 1992|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=978-0-88344-800-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dravida Sangha''' was established in 470&amp;nbsp;AD by a [[Tamil Jain|Jain]] monk named Vajranandi in the city of [[Madurai]] in present-day [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is considered to be the forerunner of the legendary [[Tamil Sangam]]s of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] lore.  Madurai at that time was under the sway of the [[Kalabhra]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Takanobu|title=Tamil Love Poetry and Poetics|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dravida Sangha was also mentioned by other Jaina literature for alleged laxity of conduct in respect to bathing and eating prescribed food. Furthermore, it was alleged that members of the Sangha also abandoned Jaina religious requirement of wandering mendicancy and adopted settled life such as trading and farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Narendra|title=Encyclopaedia of Jainism|pages=2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prof. George Hart, who holds the endowed Chair in Tamil Studies by University of California, Berkeley, and has written that the legend of Tamil Sangam (literary assembly) was based on the Jain assembly (Sangham) at Madurai:
:"There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sa(n)gha established about 604 AD in Maturai.It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the [[Tamil Sangams|cangkam]] legend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems|url=http://tamil.berkeley.edu/html/chapter_1.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/19970709071128/http://tamil.berkeley.edu/html/chapter_1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1997-07-09|publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Islam''' is a concept based on verses of the [[Quran]] as well as [[hadith]]s that emphasize the positive benefits to be gained from the acquisition of knowledge. 

==Etymology==
In Arabic three terms are used for education. The most common is ''ta'līm'', from the root '''alima'', which means knowing, being aware, perceiving and learning. Another term is ''Tarbiyah'' from the root of ''raba'', which means spiritual and moral growth based on the will of God. The third term is ''Ta'dīb'' from the root ''aduba'' which means to be cultured or refined in social behavior.&lt;ref name="education.stateuniversity."/&gt;

==Ideas==
[[Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas]] described the Islamic purpose of education as a balanced growth of the total personality through training the spirit, intellect, rational self, feelings and bodily senses such that faith is infused into the whole personality.&lt;ref name="education.stateuniversity."/&gt;

[[Hossein Nasr| Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] stated that, while education does prepare humankind for happiness in this life, "its ultimate goal is the abode of permanence and all education points to the permanent world of eternity".&lt;ref name="education.stateuniversity."/&gt;

According to the [[Nahj al-Balagha]], there are two kinds of knowledge: knowledge merely heard and that which is absorbed. The former has no benefit unless it is absorbed. The heard knowledge is gained from the outside and the other is absorbed knowledge means the knowledge that raised from nature and human disposition, referred to the power of innovation of a person.&lt;ref name="Mutahhari"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mutahhari|first1=Murtaza|title=Training and Education in Islam|publisher=Islamic College for Advanced Studie|isbn=978-1904063445|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G8gZiib_ka0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=education+in+Islam#v=onepage&amp;q=education%20in%20Islam&amp;f=false|page=5|date=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Madrasah1.jpg|thumb|A madarasa of the Jamia Masjid mosque in [[Srirangapatna]], India]]

The Quran is the optimal source of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fathi|first1=Malkawi|last2=Abdul-Fattah|first2=Hussein|title=The Education Conference Book: Planning, Implementation Recommendations and Abstracts of Presented Papers|date=1990|publisher=International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)|isbn=978-1565644892|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YvxfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Quran+as+the+main+source+of+knowledge#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20as%20the%20main%20source%20of%20knowledge&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For teaching Quranic traditions, the [[Maktab]] as elementary school emerged in mosques, private homes, shops, tents, and even outside. &lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Language"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Viv|first1=Edwards|last2=Corson|first2=David|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education|publisher=Kluwer Academic publication|isbn=978-1565644892|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0oOfpipO9sQC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Maktab++children#v=onepage&amp;q=Maktab%20%20children&amp;f=false|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="education.stateuniversity."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Islam - History of Islamic Education, Aims and Objectives of Islamic Education|url=http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2133/Islam.html|website=education.stateuniversity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has organized five conferences on Islamic education: in [[Mecca]] (1977), [[Islamabad]] (1980), [[Dhaka]] (1981), [[Jakarta]] (1982), and [[Cairo]] (1987).&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Education|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/print/opr/t236/e0212|website=oxfordislamicstudies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gohil''', '''Gohel''' or '''Guhilas of Saurashtra''' ruled parts of [[Saurashtra region]] of present-day [[Gujarat]] state of India as  subordinates or independents starting 12th century. Their origin is traced to [[Guhila dynasty]] of [[Mewar]] and they had migrated to Saurashtra in 12th century. The earliest known inscription of Gohils is found from [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] so they must be ruling in southwest of peninsula under [[Chaulukya dynasty]]. They later moved to the east coast where they established themselves and the region came to be known as [[Gohelwar|Gohilwad]] and ruled till the independence of India in 1947. The erstwhile [[princely state]]s of [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]], [[Palitana State|Palitana]], [[Lathi State|Lathi]], [[Vala State|Vala]] and [[Rajpipla State|Rajpipla]] belonged to Gohil rulers.

==Origin==
Traditionally, Gohils trace their origin to the king named Shalivahana. [[D. R. Bhandarkar]], [[Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya|C. V. Vaidya]] and [[Gaurishankar Oza]] have established origin of Gohils with [[Guhila dynasty]] of Medapata (Guhilots of [[Mewar]]). This Shalivahana is identified with Shalivahana, the Guhila king of Medapata. He mentioned in Atpur (Ahar) inscription of his son Shaktikumara dated 977 [[Common Era|CE]] ([[Vikram Samvat|VS]] 1034). He is sometimes misidentified with [[Shalivahana]] of south who is sometimes associated with [[Saka Era]]. Guhilas considered themselves as [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] (of solar race).&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singhji|first=Virbhadra|title=The Rajputs of Saurashtra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYK7ZSpPzkUC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1994|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-546-9|chapter=A Historical Outline of Saurashtra|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray1935"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=H.

===Mangrol stone-inscription===
The Mangrol stone-inscription of the Guhila Thakkura Muluka was found incised on a slab of black stone attached to the wall of a stepwell in the town of [[Mangrol, Gujarat|Mangrol]] near Junagadh. It is the earliest epigraph of Gohil dynasty. It is dated Ashwin Vadi 13 of VS 1202/Simha Samvat 32 (15 October 1145 Monday). It has 25 lines opening with ''Om Namah Sivay'' and an invocation to Hara ([[Shiva]]). It then praises [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] king [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]], successor of [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]]. Then it mentions the family of Guhila, Sahara, his son Sahajiga, who was an ''anga-niguhaka'' (commander of army) of the Chaulukyas; his eldest son Muluka, protector of Surashtra (''Saurashtraraksh-kshama'' and ''Saurashtra-nayaka''); his younger brother Somaraja who built a Maheshwara (Shiva) temple at [[Somnath]] and named it Sahajigeshwara after his father. Muluka made granted one Ka ([[Karshapana]]?) from custom house (''shulka-mundapika'') of Mangalapura (modern Mangrol) and other gift for service of it. The inscription is composed by [[Pashupata]] teacher Prasarvajna.&lt;ref name="Ray1935"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.31980|title=Appendix to Epigraphia Indica And Record of the Archeological Survey of India|last=Bhandarkar|first=D.

===Ghelana inscription===
This inscription was found in the Kamanatha Mahadeva temple in Ghelana village near Mangrol. It is dated Vallabhi year 911 (1229 CE). It mentions Ranaka Rana(???), son of Thakur Mulu, who granted ''Asanapatta'' for worship of the god in Bhrigu Matha.

B.|date=February 1939|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=688|chapter=Inscriptions Of Kathiawad No. 5|via=|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thakur Mulu is probably the same Thakkura Muluka mentioned in the Mangrol stone-inscription. Based on this and Magrol inscriptions, it is known that they were ruling in the southwest region of Saurashtra, probably as the neighbour of [[Jethwa]]s. It is not known why they moved to the eastern coast of Saurashtra later.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
===Early Gohils===
====Mohadasa====
It is said that a descendant of Salivahana settled in Khera-gadh on the banks of [[Luni river]] in the [[Jodhpur State]]. The last prince of Khera, Mohadasa, was killed by Siaji, grandson of the Rathod ruler 'Jayacandra' of [[Kanauj]], according to the tradition.&lt;ref name="Ray1935"/&gt;

====Sejakji====
Traditions say that Mohadasa's grandson, Sejakji (1194–1254 CE or 1240–1290 CE), migrated to Saurashtra about VS 1250 and entered in service of [[Chudasama dynasty|Chudasama]] king Mahipala ruling from Junagadh. He obtained 12 villages around Sapur and from his progeny descended the Gohils of Saurashtra and other regions.&lt;ref name="Ray1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to Bardic accounts, he entered in service of another Chudasama king Kavat and had his daughter Valamkunvarba married to Khengar, son of Kavat. Kavat gave him a grant of Shahpur and surrounding twelve villages in Panchal (central Sairashtra). Sejakji's sons Shahji and Saranji obtained Mandvi Chovisi and Arthila Chovisi due to interests of their sister Valamkunvarba. The rulers of [[Palitana State]] and [[Lathi State]] traces their ancestry to these two brothers.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt; James W. Watson, in ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Kathiawar'' Volume VIII (1884) had given VS 1290 and reason as their rivalry with Rathods.&lt;ref name="GBP1884"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c70MAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA711|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency : Kathiawar|last=|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1884|isbn=|editor=Watson|editor-first=James W.|volume=VIII|location=Bombay|pages=114, 547}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sejakji is reported to have established new village named Sejakpur and won several villages surrounding it.&lt;ref name="Ray1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;

Based on Mangrol stone-inscription, Muluka was a feudatory chief under Chaulukya king Kumarapala. Gaurishankar Oza identifies his father Sahajiga with Sejakji. He suggests that Sahajiga had first migrated from Luni valley and took service under Chaulukya king Siddharaja Jayasimha. He had participated as a commander of Chaulukya forces in his war against Saurashtra and thus he was later appointed as a chief of Saurashtra. H. C. Ray agrees with suggestion citing Muluka mentioned in the inscription as the protector of Saurashtra.&lt;ref name="Ray1935"/&gt;

====Ranaji and Visoji====
[[File:Ranpur-5.jpg|right|thumb|The statue of Ranaji]]
Ranaji/Ranoji (1254–1309 CE or 1290–1309 CE), descendant of Sejakji, established [[Ranpur]] and moved their capital to it. With help of Koli forces of Dhanmer, he captured Vala ([[Vallabhipur]]). It is told that he died in battle with forces of [[Ahmedabad]], the capital of [[Gujarat Sultanate]]. Virbhadra Singhji has identified him as the grandson of Sejakji&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt; while other sources identify him as a son of Sejakji.&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt;

Sejakji's fifth brother Visoji married a daughter of Dhandh of Mer or Koli tribe of village Khas who was ruler of [[Dhandhuka]]. Their descendants are known as Khasiyas after name of the village.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt; Watson identifies Visoji as the son of Ranoji. They lived in Khas for fifteen generations and Aranji II moved to neighbouring Matiyala in the early eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt;

====Mokhadaji ====
{{main|Mokhadaji Gohil}}

Ranaji's son, Mokhadaji (1309–1347 CE) captured Bhimdad from Vala Rajput and [[Umrala]] from Kolis. Then he captured Khokhra and later [[Ghogha]] expelling Muslim Kasbati (chief). From Baria Kolis, he conquered the [[Piram Island]] in the [[Gulf of Cambay]]. He established himself there and took up piracy. This irked [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultan]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] who was in Gujarat to quell rebellion. After hard-fought battle, he killed Mokhadaji and captured Ghogha and Piram island in 1347 CE.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt;

According to one story, Mokhadaji had no children until he was fifty. Balansha, a Muslim saint of Karakadi, was pleased by him with sacrifice. By his grace, he had sons so he built a mosque in his honour and vowed that his descendant will offer a leather (called Budi) when they are virgin.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;

===Descendant States===
The rulers of [[Palitana State|Palitana]] and [[Lathi State]]s trace their ancestry to Shahji and Saranji, two sons of Sejakji.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;

Mokhadaji's elder son Dungarji (1347–1370) fled to Und-Saravaiyawad but he was captured by the Delhi forces. He was later reinstated as a chief of Ghogha and regained his father's possession of Umrala. His successor Visoji (1370-1395) was involved in a dispute of Jani and Rana clans of Audichya Brahman landlords of [[Sihor]]. Jani clan summoned Visoji while Rana clan summoned Kandhoji Gohil of [[Gariadhar]]. Visoji defeated Kandhoji and captured Sihor. He fortified it and made it his capital. His successors were Kanoji (1395–1420 CE) and Sarangji (1420–1445 CE), Sivdasji (1445–1470 CE), Jethiji (1470–1500 CE), Ramdasji (1500–1535 CE), Sartanji (1535–1570 CE), Visoji (1570–1600 CE), Dhunaji (1600–1619 CE), Ratanji (1619–1629 CE ), Harbhamji (1620–1622 CE), Govindji (1622–1636 CE), Satrasalji (1636 CE), Akherajji II (1636–1660 CE), Ratanji II (1660–1703). His son Bhavsinhji (1703–1764) established [[Bhavnagar]] in 1722–23 and made it capital of [[Bhavnagar State|his state]] moving from [[Sihor]].&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/b/bhavnagar.html|title=BHAVNAGAR|last=Soszynski|first=Henry|website=members.iinet.net.au|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalark.net/India/bhavnag2.htm|title=Bhavnagar|last=|first=|date=|website=www.royalark.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vala State]] was founded in 1740 by Akherajji (1764–1772 CE), son of Bhavsinhji, for his twin brother Visaji.

Mokhadaji's younger son Samarsinhji was taken to his maternal uncle Chokrana, the prince of Junaraj (old Rajpipla), of Parmar dynasty of [[Ujjain]]. As Chokrana had no heir, Samarsinhji took up a new name, Arjunsinhji and succeeded him. The rulers of [[Rajpipla State]] are his descendants.&lt;ref name="Singhji1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/India/rajpip2.htm|title=Rajpipla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.royalark.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many small estates in [[Gohelwar|Gohilwad]] region of Saurashtra were offshoots from the parent stem.&lt;ref name="GBP1884"/&gt; These States and estates were continued to rule for centuries and even under the [[British Raj]]. They were [[political integration of India|merged]] with the [[Union of India]] when India became [[Independence of India|independent in 1947]].

The grant of imprimatur is normally preceded by a favourable declaration (known as a ''[[nihil obstat]]'')&lt;ref name="ahd"&gt;{{citation | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nihil%20obstat | title=The America Heritage Dictionary | accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a person who has the knowledge, orthodoxy, and prudence necessary for passing a judgement about the absence from the publication of anything that would "harm correct faith or good morals."&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law - IntraText"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2Q.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|work=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In canon law such a person is known as a ''censor''&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law - IntraText"/&gt; or sometimes as a ''censor librorum'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "censor of books"). In this context, the word "censor" does not have the negative sense of [[censorship|prohibiting]], but instead refers to the person's function of evaluating—whether positively or negatively—the doctrinal content of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.catholicweb.com/Bishop_DOSP/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=192168&amp;From=home|title=Office of the Bishop (Diocese of St. Petersburg) at 6363 9th Avenue North, Saint Petersburg, FL 33710 US - Office of Censor Librorum|work=catholicweb.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225610/http://home.catholicweb.com/Bishop_DOSP/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=192168&amp;From=home|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[episcopal conference]] may draw up a list of persons who can suitably act as censors or can set up a commission that can be consulted, but each [[ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] may make his own choice of person to act as censor.&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law - IntraText"/&gt;

An imprimatur is not an endorsement by the bishop of the contents of a book, not even of the religious opinions expressed in it, being merely a declaration about what is ''not'' in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284204/imprimatur |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: '&amp;#39;imprimatur'&amp;#39; |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the published work, the imprimatur is sometimes accompanied by a declaration of the following tenor:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nihil obstat and imprimatur are declarations that a book or pamphlet is free of doctrinal or moral error. No implication is contained therein that those who have granted the nihil obstat or imprimatur agree with the contents, opinions or statements expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3MO0Ty95SwC&amp;pg=PP3&amp;lpg=PP3&amp;dq=%22agree+with+the+contents,+opinions+or+statements+expressed%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0CsR26k9g-&amp;sig=HLnj2Xeq2snx4H7YGM1ARkDL5uY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mbSIS7DjHKj20wT1k-XRCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22agree%20with%20the%20contents%2C%20opinions%20or%20statements%20expressed%22&amp;f=false |title=An example of such a declaration |publisher=Books.google.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The person empowered to issue the imprimatur is the [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Local ordinaries|local ordinary]] of the author or of the place of publication.&lt;ref name="intratext2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 824 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he refuses to grant an imprimatur for a work that has received a favourable nihil obstat from the censor, he must inform the author of his reasons for doing so.&lt;ref name="intratext1"/&gt; This enables the author, if he wishes, to make changes so as to overcome the ordinary's difficulty in granting approval.&lt;ref name="newadvent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03519d.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: '&amp;#39;Censorship of Books |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If further examination shows that a work is not free of doctrinal or moral error, the imprimatur granted for its publication can be withdrawn. This happened three times in the 1980s, when the [[Holy See]] judged that complaints made to it about religion textbooks for schools were well founded and ordered the bishop to revoke his approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n17_v34/ai_20358695 ''National Catholic Reporter'', 27 February 1998: Vatican orders bishop to remove imprimatur],&lt;/ref&gt;

The imprimatur granted for a publication is not valid for later editions of the same work or for translations into another language. For these, new imprimaturs are required.&lt;ref name="intratext2"/&gt;

The permission of the local ordinary is required for the publication of prayer books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 826 §3 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[catechism]]s, and other catechetical texts&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 827 §1.&lt;/ref&gt; and for school textbooks on Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, or religious or moral subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., §2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended, but without obligation, that books on the last-mentioned subjects not intended to be used as school textbooks and all books dealing especially with religious or moral subjects be submitted to the local ordinary for judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., §3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imprimatur effectively dates from the dawn of printing, and is first seen in the printing and publishing centres of Germany and [[Venice]];&lt;ref name="newadvent1"/&gt; many secular states or cities began to require registration or approval of published works around the same time, and in some countries such restrictions still continue, though the collapse of the [[Soviet bloc]] has reduced their number.  In 2011, Bishop [[Kevin C. Rhoades]] was the first bishop to grant an imprimatur to an [[iPhone]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31640?l=english |title=iPhone Confession App Receives Imprimatur |publisher=Zenit |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002031431/http://www.zenit.org/article-31640?l=english |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', bearing the imprimatur of [[Samuel Pepys]], then-President of the [[Royal Society]]]]

English laws of 1586, 1637, and 1662 required an official licence for printing books. [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662|The 1662 act]] required books, according to their subject, to receive the authorization, known as the imprimatur, of the Lord Chancellor, the Earl Marshall, a principal Secretary of State, the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Bishop of London. This law finally expired in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''imprimatur''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other senses==
In commercial printing the term is used, in line with the meaning of the Latin word, for final approval by a customer or his agent, perhaps after review of a test printing, for carrying out the printing job.

As a [[metaphor]], the word "imprimatur" is used loosely of any form of approval or endorsement, especially by an official body or a person of importance,&lt;ref name=WotD/&gt; as in the newspaper headline, "Protection of sources now has courts' imprimatur,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0215/1224264466584.html |title=Irish Times, 15 February 2010, retrieved 27 February 2010 |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also much more vaguely, and probably incorrectly, as in "Children, the final imprimatur to family life, are being borrowed, adopted, created by artificial insemination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Richard |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D91330F93AA25755C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 |title=New York Times, 19 June 1988, retrieved 27 February 2010 |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-06-19 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Haskama, approval, הַסְכָּמָה is a rabbinic approval of a religious book concerning Judaism. It is written by a prominent rabbi in his own name, not in the name of a religious organization or hierarchy.

It is often in the form of a letter, possibly on stationery, and generally includes not only "approbation, recommendation, or endorsement" of the work, but also a blessing for the success of the author in this and other accomplishments.&lt;ref name=Musings&gt;http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/07/haskama-letters-part-i&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, at times a Haskama given to the author is printed, verbatim, in later works from the same author&lt;ref&gt;as evidenced by new works from major publishers including Haskamos (=plural of Haskama) from rabbinic scholars no longer in this world.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28521/how-does-one-request-a-haskama-approbation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first Haskama in Volume I of {{cite book
|title=THE BRISKER RAV |last=Meller |first=Shimon |isbn=978-1-58330-969-8
|publisher=Feldheim  |date=2007}}, a 4 volume set,  says "(originally written for ... and included here with permission from ...)." The last is a 2-page "Blessings from the Author's Father."&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional value for haskama letters, long ago, was to serve as a form of copyright, to protect the author or the printer from any unauthorized reproduction.&lt;ref name=Musings/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">'''Irminism''' (German: '''Irminenschaft''' or '''Irminenreligion''') is a current of [[Ariosophy]] based on a Germanic deity '''''Irmin''''' supposedly reconstructed from literaric, linguistic and onomastic sources. Among other sources the Prefix "Irmin" is  documented in the  ''[[Irminsul]]'' "great pillar that supports all"/"Columna Universalis Sustenans Omni", as described in Einhards 'Vita Karoli Magni', and informed by [[Tacitus]] (~1st century) via a mentioned Germanic tribe name of ''[[Hermiones]]''; The [[Old Saxon]] adjective ''irmin'' being synonymous to "great, strong". As such it may also have been an epithet of later deities like [[Ziu]] ([[Týr]]) or [[Wodan]] ([[Odin]])). Purported evidence &lt;!-- of what? --&gt; also stems from the occurrence of the word "Irmingot", found in the [[Old High German]] "[[Hildebrandslied]]".
Notably the [[Nazi occultism|Nazi occultist]] [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] claimed a historical Irminism, established in 12,500 BC, later ousted by [[Wotanism]]. Wiligut became the spiritual advisor to [[Heinrich Himmler]], who practiced Irminism.

'''Islam''' is a minority religion in [[Botswana]], where most people follow [[Christianity]] and indigenous beliefs. [[Islam]] came to the country through [[Muslim]] immigrants from [[South Asia]], who settled in the area during the [[British colonial rule]]. According to the 2001 census, there are around 5,000 Muslims in Botswana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90083.htm |work=U.S. Department of State |date=14 September 2007 |title=Botswana. International Religious Freedom Report 2007|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is less than 1 percent of the population. The relations between the different religious groups remain peaceful and friendly despite rising inter-religious tensions in the other parts of [[Africa]].

Most of the other Muslim groups are Malay Brunei, Malay [[Kedayan]]s (converts from indigenous tribal groups) and Chinese converts.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic banking in Southeast Asia, Islam in Brunei pushes other religions out of the way .

==History==
Islam was adopted in the 15th century when a Malay Muslim was installed as [[sultan]]. The sultan traditionally was responsible for upholding Islamic traditions, although the responsibility was usually delegated to appointed officials. 

Since the 1930s sultans have used rising oil revenues to provide an extensive social welfare system and promote Islam, including subsidizing the [[Hajj]], building [[mosque]]s, and expanding the Department of Religious Affairs.

With the constitution in 1959, Islam became the official religion of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/03/08/golden-history-islam-brunei |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003072346/http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/03/08/golden-history-islam-brunei |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest statistics for '''Islam in Paraguay''' estimate a total [[Muslim]] population of 20,000, representing 0.05 percent of the population. Most of the Muslims are descendants of immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The major [[Islamic]] organization in [[Paraguay]] is the ''Centro Benéfico Cultural Islámico Asunción'', led by Faozi Mohamed Omairi. The community is concentrated in and around the capital, [[Asuncion]].

In 2010, there were an estimated 5,000 [[Muslim]]s in [[Slovakia]] representing fewer than 0.1% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.cas.sk/clanok/176603/na-slovensku-je-5-tisic-moslimov-bude-v-nasej-krajine-mesita/]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century parts of central and southern Slovakia was occupied by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and was bonded to the [[Uyvar Eyalet]] (along with [[Eğri Eyalet]]) for some decades after Turkish settlements were established for example in [[Nógrád (county)|Novohrad region]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. Turks also had a suzerainty over the [[Principality of Upper Hungary]], which controlled eastern Slovakia.

==History==
Decades after the [[Battle of Mohács|Hungarian defeat of Mohacs]] (1526) Turkish troops occupied [[Štúrovo]] (Párkány) and other parts of today's southern central Slovakia and encouraged the Protestant Christian groups while Habsburg Austrian troops occupied and recatholized the northern and western parts. Later on the Turks seized some further territories in southern central Slovakia and pillaged in territories up to [[Nitra]].  Finally, however, when the Turks lost the [[Battle of Vienna]] and  the Ottoman vassal [[Imre Thököly]] was defeated in Slovakia, between 1687 and 1699 Turkish Ottoman rule in Hungary was finally broken.

==Muslim demographics==
Most of the Muslims in Slovakia are refugees from former Yugoslavia ([[Bosnians]] and [[Albanians]]) {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} or workers from modern Turkey ([[Turkish people|Turks]]) {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, beside them a few Arab students and migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia. Most of the Muslims live in the capital [[Bratislava]], smaller communities also exist in [[Košice]] and [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

Slovakia is the last member state of the European Union without a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluska.sk/spravy/zo-zahranicia/slovensko-je-poslednou-krajinou-unie-kde-nie-je-mesita.html |title=Slovensko je poslednou krajinou únie, kde nie je mešita |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 November 2014 |website=Pluska |publisher=7 PLUS, s.r.o. |accessdate=5 April 2014 |language=slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a dispute erupted about the building of an Islamic centre in Bratislava: the capital's mayor refused such attempts of the Slovak ''Islamic Waqfs Foundation''.

In 2015, amidst the [[European migrant crisis]], Slovakia agreed to admit 200 Christian asylum seekers, but refused to accept Muslims under an EU scheme to share migrants between member states. Slovak Ministry of Interior Affairs explained this decision by the absence of Muslim places of worship in Slovakia which will allegedly complicate the refugees' integration in Slovak society. The decision was criticised by the EU which doubted its legality and expressed concern for its discriminatory nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/599520/migrant-crisis-immigrant-EU-Slovakia-Muslim-Syria-Christian-European-Union |title=Slovakia refuses to accept Muslim migrants |author=Matthew Holehouse, Justin Huggler |date=20 August 2015 |website= |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2016, Slovakia passed legislation to effectively block Islam from gaining official status as a religion in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovakia-religion-islam-idUSKBN13P20C&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia is the only country within the European Union without any mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, Alica (2015): Multiculturalism and Religious Tolerance Politics Concerning Muslims in Slovakia.

==Islamic Center of Cordoba, Bratislava ( Kultúrne Centrum Córdoba, Mešita )==

Islamic Center of Cordoba(Kultúrne Centrum Córdoba, Mešita), is located down the Obchodná street, Bratislava. It is the only place of Muslim worship in the country under Islamic foundation in Slovakia. Even though it’s an unofficial Mosque,it is open every day of the year for all daily prayers except the Fajr prayer.Friday sermon is held in Arabic, English and Slovak language and starts Friday on 13:00 am. The mosque is not very big, but it is enough to hold congregation prayers of about 30 to 40 people. There is a wooden podium that is used for Friday sermons, but there is no decoration with elaborated patterns as found in common mosques. The Kultúrne Centrum Córdoba has tried to attain an official mosque permit from the government, but had its proposal rejected.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/muhammad-zulfikar-rakhmat/finding-slovakias-forgott_b_9571980.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26925">'''Jewish business ethics''' is a form of applied [[Jewish ethics]] that examines ethical issues that arise in a business environment. It is noted &lt;ref&gt;Dr. [[Meir Tamari]] [http://www.torah.org/learning/business-ethics/intro.html The Challenge of Wealth - Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224124738/http://www.torah.org/learning/business-ethics/intro.html |date=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the [[Torah]], there are over 100 ''[[Mitzvot]]'' concerning the ''[[kashrut]]'' (fitness) of one's money, many more, in fact, than concerning the ''kashrut'' of food.  The subject thus receives an extensive treatment in [[Rabbinic literature]], both from an ethical (''[[Musar movement|Mussar]]'') and a legal (''[[Halakha]]'') point of view.

==Ethical perspective==
The general gravity with which business ethics are treated in Jewish thought is illustrated by the widely quoted &lt;ref&gt;Mentioned, for example, in the popular Halachik work ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' ([http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur62.html ch 62]).&lt;/ref&gt; Talmudic tradition ([[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 31a &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2102.htm 31a]&lt;/ref&gt;) that in one's [[Afterlife#Olam Haba|judgement in the next world]] the ''first'' question asked is: "were you honest in business?"  In addition to this, and numerous other Talmudic passages, the [[Musar literature|Mussar]] and [[Chassidic]] literature also discuss business ethics at great length. Examples follow.

''[[Aggadah|Aggadic]]'' and [[Midrashic]] discussions relating to honesty in business include the following.  [[Yoma]] 86:B &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2508.htm 86:B]&lt;/ref&gt; is an often cited example, where this obligation is examined in the context of [[Chillul Hashem|profanation of God’s Name]] ({{Bibleverse||Leviticus|22:32.|HE}})  and of [[Shema#V.27ahavta|the Love of God]] ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:5.|HE}}). To position the question, a ''[[Talmudic]]'' dictum (''[[Bava Kamma]]'' 30a) states: "He who wishes to achieve saintliness should study the [mishnaic] order of [[Nezikin]]." [[Avot de-Rabbi Natan]] teaches that "character is tested through business." &lt;ref&gt;Avot D’rabi Natan, ed. Schechter, version B, Chap. 31, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;   The major [[Mishnaic]] principle of ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' - which underpins much ''[[Hashkafah]]'' and [[Jewish thought]] - requires that one earns one's living through productive labor, while also warning against [[materialism]]; see section [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Earning a livelihood|#Earning a livelihood]] there.  [[Nashim|''Kiddushin'']] [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%93 4:14] discusses a general approach to work, and the ideal that one's profession be "clean", i.e. without prospect for dishonesty.

The ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'', considered a foundational Mussar text, devotes much discussion to honesty in business, and the role this plays as regards [[Moral character|character development]] in general; see for example [http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/11.htm Ch 11]. Rabbi [[Yisrael Lipkin Salanter]] (19th century), founder of the [[Musar movement]] in Eastern Europe, put a great deal of emphasis on business ethics, and taught that just as one checks carefully to make sure their food is kosher, so too should one check to see if his money is earned in a kosher fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Chofetz Chaim, Sfat Tamim, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chofetz Chaim]]’s first published work concerned honesty in weights and measures.

Some examples in Chassidic thought follow; for further resources here see &lt;ref&gt;chabad.org : [http://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/9419/jewish/Business-Ethics.htm Business Ethics]&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute:  [http://www.myjli.com/index.html?task=courses_detail&amp;cid=1006  Money Matters: Jewish Business Ethics]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a ''[[Maamarim (Chabad)|Maamar]]'' of the [[Lubavitch]] [[Rebbe]], [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], it is learned that meditation and prayer, while spiritually transformative, do not match the power of doing business ethically ([http://chabadlibrary.org/books/default.aspx?furl=/admur/mlukat/2/4 ''Padah B’Shalom'', 5739]).&lt;ref&gt;Tzvi Freeman: [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1748866/jewish/The-Kabbalah-of-Making-Money.htm The Kabbalah of Making Money].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Admor]] of [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], Rabbi [[Aharon Rokeach]], in discussing the angels descending and ascending on the [[Jacob's ladder#Judaism|ladder seen in the dream of Ya'akov]], notes that the ''[[gematria]]''  value of ''sulam'', ladder, is equivalent to that of ''kesef'', money.  The teaching here is that while a few are able to ascend spiritually in the way they earn and spend their money others, instead, descend here. Indeed, therefore, "nowhere in the whole field of human activity are the lusts and needs that need separation and religious guidance greater than in this field of human activity".  The "Shelah", [[Isaiah Horowitz]],  states (in ''Sha'ar Haotiyot'') that
:"The [[Mezzuzah]] that we affix to the doorpost is connected to the things that we bring in and take out of our houses. We gather into our homes the wealth that G-d has bestowed upon us. All should therefore be in truth and in faith as befits a house on which the Law of G-d is inscribed on the door posts. This is the secret of conducting one's business in faithfulness. In other words, what one brings into the house, that is what one earns, should be in faithfulness. What we take out, what we spend our money on should also be in faith."

==Legal treatment==
As mentioned, there are over 100 ''[[Mitzvot]]'' (commandments) concerning commercial and business conduct&amp;nbsp;– a few examples are discussed in the following sub-sections.   The [[principle]]s relating to these commandments are developed and expanded upon in the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (particularly in Order ''[[Nezikin]]'').  The detailed laws are then delineated in the [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|major codes of Jewish law]] (e.g. ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', particularly books 11. ''Nezikin'', 12. ''Kinyan'' and 13. ''Mishpatim''; and ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'', particularly ''[[Choshen Mishpat]]'').
Further, specific questions here, numbering in the thousands, have been discussed in various [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsa]] over the centuries. For a general survey, see "The Challenge of Wealth," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2201416.Challenge_of_Wealth|title=Challenge of Wealth|author=Meir Tamari|work=Goodreads|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. [[Meir Tamari]].

===Requirement of accurate weights and measures===
According to the [[Book of Leviticus]] (19:35-36): "You shall not falsify measures of length, weight, or capacity. You shall have an honest balance, an honest weight, an honest ephah, and an honest hin."

===Prohibition of monetary deception (ona'at mamon)===
Leviticus 25:14 teaches: "When you sell anything to your neighbor or buy anything from your neighbor, you shall not deceive one another."  The Talmud ([[Bava Metzia]] 49b and 50b) and later codes ([[Rambam]], Mekhira, Chapter 12) expand on this verse to create a series of specific laws prohibiting ''[[ona'ah]]'', monetary deception.  The prohibition is on the sale of an article at so much more, or to the purchase of an article at so much less, than its market value that fraud or the taking of an undue advantage is presumed.  A discrepancy of one-sixth enables the wronged party to secure the cancelation of the sale or purchase; that is, an article worth six money-units in the market may not be sold for seven or bought for five (B. M. 49b). It seems that overcharge by the merchant selling to the consumer was the most frequent instance in which the application of the rule was called for; the claim had to be made as soon as the buyer had had an opportunity to show his purchase to a merchant or to one of his friends. It is said that R. Ṭarfon taught at Lydda that the discrepancy must amount to one-third to justify an action, whereupon the merchants rejoiced; but when he extended the time for rescission to the whole day they demanded the restoration of the old rule.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=70&amp;letter=O|title=ONA'AH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either seller or purchaser, whether merchant or one in private life, may make the complaint, notwithstanding the opinion to the contrary of R. Judah ben Ilai. The purchaser imposed upon may ask either for rescission of the transaction or for the return of the excess paid by him.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

In the case of changing money it was suggested that a lack in weight of even one in twelve should be sufficient ground for complaint, but the prevailing opinion fixed here also the ratio of one in six. Within a great city the time for complaint extends until the money in question can be shown to a money-changer; in villages, where no money-changer is to be found, until the eve of the Sabbath, when the party deceived is apt to tender the coin in payment for his purchases.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

===Prohibition of verbal deception (ona'at devarim)===
Leviticus 25:17 teaches: "Do not deceive one another, but fear your God, for I the Lord am your God." Since Leviticus 25:14 was understood as referring to monetary deception, the Talmud concludes that Leviticus 25:17 refers to verbal deception, "ona'at devarim."

In [[Baba Metziah]] (iv. 10), the Mishnah proceeds: "As there is 'wronging' in buying and selling, so there is 'wronging' in words; a man may not ask, 'What is this article worth?' when he has no intention of buying; to one who is a repentant sinner it may not be said, 'Remember thy former conduct'; to him who is the son of proselytes one may not exclaim, 'Remember the conduct of thy forefathers'; for it is said, 'Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him'" (Ex. xxii. 21). In a baraita (B. M. 58b) which follows this section the subject is further developed. "When a proselyte comes to study the Law one should not say, 'He that ate the meat of fallen or torn beasts, of unclean and creeping things, now comes to study the Law that was spoken by the mouth of Omnipotence!' When trouble or sickness comes upon a man, or when he has to bury his children, none should say to him, as Job's friends said to Job, 'Where is thy fear of God, thy trust, thy hope, and the innocence of thy ways?'" The baraita forbids also practical jokes. "If ass-drivers come to one for fodder, one may not send them to N. N. to buy it, knowing that N. N. never sold hay or grain in his life."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

On the authority of R. Simeon ben Yoḥai, it was said that wronging by words is worse than wronging in trade, for the Scripture as to the former, but not as to the latter, commands, "Thou shalt fear thy God": R. Eleazar says, because one injures the man himself, the other affects only his property; R. Samuel b. Naḥman says, because in one case there is opportunity for restoration, in the other there is not. The Talmud then dwells upon the unpardonable sin of "blanching the face of one's neighbor in public," and closes with the admonition that under all circumstances a man should beware of "wronging" his wife, because her tears are ever ready to accuse him before the throne of God.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

===Geneivat da’at ("stealing a person’s mind")===
{{Main|Geneivat da'at}}
[[Geneivat da'at]], literally "stealing of the mind/knowledge", refers to a kind of dishonest [[misrepresentation]] or [[deception]]. The prohibition on geneivat da'at is attributed to the Talmudic sage [[Samuel of Nehardea]] in [[Babylonian Talmud|Talmud]] ''[[Chullin]]'' (94a): "It is forbidden to mislead people, even a non-Jew." One [[Midrash]] states that ''geneivat da'at'' is the worst type of [[theft]] because it directly harms the person, not merely their money.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;''Encyclopedia Talmudit'' 6:225-231. On the ranking of theft, see [[Mekhilta]] ''Mishpatim'' 13, Tosefta BK 7, Hilchot De'ot 2:6. On the exception for honoring a person, such as a guest, see Hullin 94b and Tur HM 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Resnicoff, Steven H. "Ends and means in Jewish law" JLA v.15, 2004, p.151, states that geneivat da'at is more "blameworthy... because the injury to the person is more personal and direct; it is not merely a financial injury...."&lt;/ref&gt; In rabbinic [[midrash|exegesis]], the law is associated with [[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#31:26|Gen. 31:26]] and [[s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel#15:6|II Samuel 15:6]].

Rabbi [[David Golinkin]] has explained the principle's application to [[business ethics]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would call it false packaging or false labeling. The Talmud gives a number of specific examples: One should not sift the beans at the top of the bushel because he is "deceiving the eye" by making the customer think that the entire bushel has been sifted. It is forbidden to paint animals or utensils in order to improve their appearance or cover up their defects (Bava Metzia 60a-b).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are all familiar with this kind of ruse. A wholesaler takes an inferior brand of shirt and puts on Pierre Cardin labels. You buy a box of perfect-looking tomatoes or strawberries, only to discover upon opening the box at home that they were packaged with the bad spots facing down. And we all know how used cars are touched up and polished for the sole purpose of overcharging the customer. Such behavior is clearly forbidden by Jewish law.&lt;ref name="uscj.org"&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/Basic_Principles_of_6097.html Some Basic Principles of Jewish Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812224432/http://www.uscj.org/Basic_Principles_of_6097.html |date=2004-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Putting a stumbling block before the blind===
{{Main|Lifnei iver}}

A statement in the [[Torah]] (Leviticus 19:14) prohibits "placing a stumbling block before the [[blindness|blind]]."  Jewish tradition sees this as a figuratively expressed prohibition against misleading people.  When it comes to business ethics, Rabbi [[David Golinkin]] has pointed to the following examples of what this principle prohibits:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A real estate agent should not dupe a young couple into buying a home with structural faults simply in order to make a fast buck. A stockbroker should not sell his client a bad investment just to collect the commission. A salesman should not convince his customer to buy an expensive item he really has no use for."&lt;ref name="uscj.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contemporary applications==
There are numerous published responsa dealing with specific contemporary issues; a few of many examples are discussed below.&lt;ref name="DarcheNoam"/&gt;

===Treatment of workers===
The [[Jewish Labor Committee]] prepared a list of articles, books and other items, by over 60 authors, entitled "Readings on Traditional Jewish texts on Labor and Worker Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishlaborcommittee.org/2006/01/readings_on_traditional_jewish_1.html|title=Jewish Labor Committee|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Michael Feinberg's article "Wage Theft Study Guide: A Jewish Perspective" is also online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwj.org/resources/wage-theft-a-jewish-perspective |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911185410/http://www.iwj.org/resources/wage-theft-a-jewish-perspective |archivedate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] authored a [[responsum]] in 2008, approved by [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], which argued that Jews are obligated to pay their workers on time, strive to pay their workers a living wage,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=March 2016}} and "to treat their workers with dignity and respect." The responsum prohibited "publicly yelling at, mocking, or otherwise embarrassing workers; forbidding employees from speaking their native languages at work; banning all bathroom breaks; changing work hours or adding shifts without advance notice; or making improper sexual comments or advances toward workers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/358 Dispatches from the Workplace: Rabbis for Worker Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20052010/jacobs-living-wage.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127140236/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20052010/jacobs-living-wage.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcing laws regarding the proper treatment of workers in the food industry has been central to the efforts of Conservative Judaism's [[Hekhsher Tzedek]] commission.

===Not wasting time at work===
It is important not to steal company time.  Rabbis had often noted the importance of working hard, such as the Biblical Jacob, who worked very hard for many years, despite being deceived by Jacob's father-in-law. Therefore, employees should avoid spending too much time on-line (e.g., Facebook) or other diversions when at their job.&lt;ref&gt;Business Ethics of our Fathers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistleblowing===
Rabbi [[Barry Leff]] authored a responsum in 2007, approved by Conservative Judaism's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], regarding an employee's obligation to report wrongdoing on the part of his or her employer.  He concluded that "In any case of wrongdoing, there is an obligation to rebuke the person doing wrong if it can be assumed there is a reasonable chance the rebuke will be listened to, and the rebuke can be administered without substantial personal cost to the reporter."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Whistleblowing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Institutions including [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Law and Marketplace Ethics|url=http://hds.harvard.edu/faculty-research/conferences-and-seminars/business-across-religious-traditions/bart-events|publisher=BUSINESS ACROSS RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, Harvard Divinity School|date=January 31, 2008|quote=The legal dimension of the Jewish religious tradition emerged as an all-encompassing system of law that did not conceive of anything outside its purview. Thus, the tradition is replete with reflections on, and regulations governing, business practices of all kinds, from the credit markets to the labor markets. This discussion focused on a passage of Talmud—the primary source of almost all Jewish law—that deals with many aspects of unjust enrichment and ill-gotten gains. In the process, participants learned about the tradition's views on pricing, interest, wages, and the ethics of the marketplace more generally.

The '''prohibition of extracting semen in vain''' (in [[Hebrew]]: איסור הוצאת זרע לבטלה) is a rabbinic prohibition found in the [[midrash]] and [[Talmud]].  The prohibition forbids a male from intentional wasteful spilling of his [[semen]].

==Orthodox Judaism==
The [[Talmud]] forbids male masturbation, as it leads to unnecessary spilling of semen, or the impure thoughts of women other than the man's lawful wife. This prohibition is derived from the Biblical narrative of [[Onan]] (Talmud Niddah 13a). The Talmud (''ibid'') likens the act to [[murder]] and [[idolatry]]. The wrath displayed by God toward Onan was invoked not through the act of spilling semen, but through disobedience to God's command for Onan to [[Yibbum|impregnate his brother's widow]] (see the story in Genesis 38:8-10).  Others consider the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] excessive for failure to properly follow the laws of Levirate marriage — the Biblical option offered to those refusing a Levirate marriage was that the woman who was refused, would spit over the males shoe, after removing it from his foot. Because Onan's punishment was so much more severe, they argue that the spilling of semen was the relevant offense. Onan was not masturbating, but practising [[birth control]] by [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]].

According to the [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]], "It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any other in the Torah".&lt;ref name=Kitzur&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, סימן קנא: א (Chapter 151: 1); Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Beis Shmuel'' expounds that this is not literal, but rather serves to frighten man into avoiding the [[sin]].&lt;ref name="Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'Ezer 23:1"&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'Ezer 23:1&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement among the ''[[poskim]]'', decisors of Jewish law, whether masturbation is an acceptable way of procuring semen for [[artificial insemination]] or [[in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/semen.html Jewish Law - Articles ("The Use of Cryopreserved Sperm and Pre-embryos In Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics")&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism in general neither prohibits nor discourages female masturbation, although some authorities consider female masturbation as necessarily involving "impure thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/sex.html Kosher Sex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other movements==
[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] rabbis have decided on more liberal conclusions. Reconstructionist Rabbi Alexis Roberts maintains that masturbation is "harmless, natural and healthy. It may provide release and pleasure, as well as self-knowledge that is useful for pleasurable sex with a partner. It may make it easier for young people to have sexual release in the years when they are too young for a mature, committed, loving relationship."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/84/story_8459_1.html Masturbation: Is It Kosher?]". Beliefnet.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reform Rabbi Jonathan Stein, in a proposed schema for normative Reform evaluation of different sexual activities, proposed that masturbation be considered "mutar", a term generally translated as "permissible", but which he renders as "tolerable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Masturbation should be discouraged, but we would not consider it harmful or sinful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Spilling semen in vain==
'''Sperm in vain''' (or '''Semen in vain''' or '''Seed in vain'''; [[Hebrew]]: '''זרע לבטלה''', pronounced: ''Zera Levatala'') is a Talmudic term for any sexual act in which a male's sperm is consciously "wasted",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.briskodesh.org/glossary.htm Bris Kodesh] i.e., released as an act not for the purpose of procreation, or in normal intercourse with one's wife, even when she is for whatever reason not able to become pregnant from that seed,, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; whether because she is pregnant, infertile, or elderly. This is proper for the purpose of fulfilling the "Onah" Mitzvah-commandment, the husband's marital obligations.

{{quote

Prior to the 20th century, it was a Jewish term usually (but not only) referring to masturbation.  In [[Shulchan Aruch]], on "Yoreh Deah", it is stated that wasting sperm is considered to be a sin greater than any sin in the [[Torah]].

Homosexual intercourse is also considered an act of spilling semen in vain; as for masturbation, despite not having been explicitly prohibited in the Torah, the Halkha and the Oral Torah views masturbation as an Halakhaic prohibition and a great sin. Even marital sexual acts in which the semen is not deposited in the vagina, is considered an act of seed in vain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Halakhic attitude towards a female masturbation is found in the opinions of the [[Ben Ish Chai]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41237&amp;pgnum=37 Od Yosef Chai p. 37], quoting the [[Arizal]] in ''Shaar HaKavanos, Inyan Drushei Layla'', sec. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41237&amp;pgnum=37 7]&lt;/ref&gt; who says that it is wrong because it creates evil forces (''Kelipos''), and Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]],&lt;ref&gt;''Igros Moshe, Even Ha'ezer'' 1,  sec. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; who forbids it because it involves indulging in sexual fantasy about men, which falls under the prohibition of forbidden thoughts, which are forbidden for women as well. However, it does not carry the severity of male masturbation, because it does not involve the release of seed.

In modern days, the Halakhic question on whether taking a male sperm for the purpose of medical examinations or insemination is debated among the authorities.

''[[Leviticus]]'' chapter 15 in the [[Law of Moses]] states that any male having a "flow" is ceremonially defiled, he must cleanse himself with water,  This "flow" refers to ejaculation of semen (verse 32), whether through masturbation&lt;ref name="jonesandjones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Stanton|last2=Jones|first2=Brenna|year=2014|chapter=CHAPTER 13: Developing Moral Discernment About Masturbation and Petting|title=How and When to Tell Your Kids About Sex: A Lifelong Approach to Shaping Your Child's Sexual Character|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=exv0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT253 |location=Colorado Springs, CO|publisher=NavPress, Tyndale House|page=253|isbn=9781612912301|quote=1. We are aware of only one argument that attempts to draw directly from the Scripture to establish a basis for the acceptance of masturbation, found in J. Johnson, "Toward a Biblical Approach to Masturbation, Journal of Psychology and Theology 10 (1982): 137-146. Johnson suggest that Leviticus 15:1-618 should set the tone for our dealing with masturbation. Verses 16 and 17 say that a man who has an emission of semen should wash and be ceremonially unclean until evening. Verse 18 goes on to say that if a man and woman have intercourse, the same cleanliness rules apply. By bringing up intercourse separately, the passage surely does imply that the emission of semen in verses 16 and 17 occurred for the man individually. The passage may be referring to a nocturnal emission, or wet dream, rather than masturbation, but the passage is not specific. Johnson suggests that this Leviticus passage is significant for treating a solitary sexual experience, whether wet dream or masturbation, as a purely ceremonial cleanliness issue and not as a matter of morality. The passage also puts no more disapproval on the solitary experience than it does on intercourse. Since Christians today commonly view the Old Testament ceremonial law as no longer valid, this author suggests that masturbation is not in itself a moral concern from a biblical perspective and is no longer a ceremonial concern either.|oclc=104623265}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nocturnal emission]].&lt;ref name="jonesandjones"/&gt;  This temporary ceremonial defilement isn't masturbation-specific, it also applies to intercourse among married heterosexual partners&lt;ref name="jonesandjones"/&gt;

Other than this ceremonial defilement, there are no consequences or punishments specified for masturbation or mere ejaculation to be found in Mosaic Law. However, the ''[[Temple Scroll]]'', used by the sect responsible for the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], states that a man may not enter the holy grounds of the Future Temple in the [[New Jerusalem]] for a period of seven days after ejaculating.

[[Maimonides]] stated that the Tanakh does not prohibit masturbation.&lt;ref name=myjewishlearning&gt;Maimonides, ''Commentary to the Mishnah, Sanhedrin'' 7:4, apud {{cite book|last1=Dorff|first1=Elliot N.|author-link1=Elliot N.

In the Mishnah, masturbation is treated under a broader view about frequent examination of the male and female organs. It teaches that while for women it is praiseworthy to frequently examine themselves, for men their hands "ought to be cut off".&lt;ref name="Talmud Niddah 13a"&gt;Talmud Niddah 13a&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition is derived from the Biblical narrative of [[Onan]], who practiced [[birth control]] by [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]]. The Talmud likens the act to [[murder]] and [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name="Talmud Niddah 13a"/&gt;

According to the [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]], "It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any other in the Torah".&lt;ref name="Kitzur"/&gt; However, ''Beis Shmuel'' expounds that this is not literal, but rather serves to frighten man into avoiding the [[sin]].&lt;ref name="Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'Ezer 23:1"/&gt;

Leviticus discusses a ritual defilement relating to emission of sperm. The traditional rabbinical interpretation of Leviticus 15 was that it applies to ''all'' sperm flows, including sperm flows due to masturbation.  {{quote|But [in P] the ejaculation of semen results in only a one-day impurity that requires laundering and ablutions (15:16-18), regardless of whether the act takes place during (legitimate) intercourse or by the self, deliberately (masturbation) or accidentally (nocturnal emission).|[[Jacob Milgrom]]|Leviticus 17-22, pp. 1567-1568, apud |[[Robert A.

== Leniencies for married couples ==

Rabbinic authorities have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife. The [[tannaim]] [[Rabbi Eliezer]] and [[Rabbi Meir]] ([[Tosefta]], Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female [[birth control]]) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34). [[Tosefot]] cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak ([[Isaac ben Samuel]]) who permitted an occasional exterior ejaculation with one's wife on the condition that one does not accustom himself to always doing so (Tosfoth, Yebamoth 34b, Tosfoth Sanhedrin 58b)). The ''Bayit Chadash'' ([[Yoel Sirkis]]) commentary to the [[Rabbeinu Asher]] (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the tosafist opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Asher to Yebamoth ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is likewise quoted in [[Tur Shulchan Aruch]], Even Ha'ezer ch. 25.

Rabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi [[Elijah Spira]], commented that an occasional exterior ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered "extracting semen in vain" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife '''and''' it is done on rare occasion - as this is not likened to the desire of [[Onan]], who wished to avoid impregnating [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliyah rabbah" to ch. 240 of Orach Chayim, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aguddah]] work also sides with the lenient opinion, permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Agudah, p. 115 col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the [[Maharsha]]) likewise takes a lenient view.&lt;ref&gt;Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a&lt;/ref&gt;

A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani]] the Elder:

{{Quote|What was the (forbidden) action of Er and Onan that the torah prohibits? that committed with the intent of not diminishing her beauty (due to pregnancy) and he doesn't desire to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] of procreation (פרו ורבו) with her. But if his intent.. is for his inclination and to satisfy his desire and his intent is not to avoid impregnating her, it is permitted, ..he whose intent is to fulfill the desire of his inclination does not transgress as "all that a man wants to do with his wife he may do" (tractate nedarim, 20b) - and this isn't called "wasting his seed".|Tosfoth Ri"d to tractate Yebamoth, p. 12b (Yad HaRav Herzog, Jerusalem)}}

Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ria"z", jerusalem 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his commentary to the verse "Adam and his wife, and were not embarrassed" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to "quiet (lit. seat)" his desire.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

From amongst rabbis of the [[achronim]] era, the [[Tzemach Tzedek]] differentiated between extracting one's seed alone (masturbation) and extra-vaginal extracting of one's seed with one's wife, with the latter a form (albeit strange) of a tandem relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, ch. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leniencies ==
Some ''[[poskim]]'' (decisors of Jewish law) rule that it is possible to masturbate to avoid ''arayot'' (forbidden relationships).&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Chaim Rappoport, Judaism and Homosexuality: An Authentic Orthodox View, pp. 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In vitro ==
There is disagreement among the ''poskim'' whether masturbation is an acceptable way of procuring semen for [[artificial insemination]] or [[in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/semen.html Jewish Law - Articles ("The Use of Cryopreserved Sperm and Pre-embryos In Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics")&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|360px|thumb|alt=The divine Kalpavriksha tree in mythology, a stone carving of a tree with mythical characters surrounding it.|Kalpataru, the divine tree of life being guarded by mythical creatures [[Kinnara|Kinnara and Kinnari]], flying [[Apsara]] and [[Devata]]. 8th century [[Pawon|Pawon temple]], [[Java]], Indonesia.]]

'''Kalpavriksha''' ([[Devanagari]]: कल्पवृक्ष), also known as '''kalpataru''', '''''karpaga viruksham'',''kalpadruma''' or '''kalpapādapa''', is a wish-fulfilling divine tree in [[Hindu mythology]]. It is mentioned in [[Sanskrit]] literature from the earliest sources. It is also a popular theme in [[Jain cosmology]] and [[Buddhism]]. Sage [[Durvasa]] and [[Adi Shankaracharya]], meditated under the Kalpavriksha. The birth of [[Ashokasundari]], the daughter of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]], is attributed to the Kalpavriksha tree. Another daughter [[Aranyani]] was also gifted to Kalpavriksha for safekeeping.

The Kalpavriksha originated during the [[Samudra manthan]] or "churning of the [[ocean of milk]]" along with the [[Kamadhenu]], the divine cow providing for all needs. The king of the gods, [[Indra]], returned with this tree to his paradise.

Kalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as [[Parijata]] (''Erythrina variegata''), ''[[Ficus benghalensis]]'', [[coconut tree]] (''Cocos nucifera''), ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Madhuca longifolia]]'', ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'', ''[[Diploknema butyracea|Bassia butyracea]]'', and [[mulberry tree]] (''Morus nigra'' tree). The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature.

== Religious beliefs ==
Kalpavriksha is an artistic and literary theme common to the Hindu [[Bhagavatas]], the Jains and the [[Buddhists]].{{Sfn|Agrawala|2003|p=87}}

=== In Hinduism ===
[[File:Kalpavriksha with Flowers in Ranchi, Jharkhand.jpg|thumb|327x327px|Kalpavriksha with Flowers in Ranchi, Jharkhand]]
Kalpavriksha, the tree of life, also meaning "World Tree" finds mention in the [[Vedic scriptures]]. In the earliest account of the [[Samudra manthan]] or "churning of the ocean of milk" Kalpavriksha emerged from the primal waters during the ocean churning process along with Kamadhenu, the divine cow that bestows all needs. The tree is also said to be the [[Milky way]] or the birthplace of the stars [[Sirius]]. The king of the gods, Indra returned with this Kalpavriksha to his abode, the paradise and planted it there. Tree also finds mention in the Sanskrit text Mānāsara, part of ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]''.{{Sfn|Toole|2015|p=73}}{{Sfn|Beer|2003|p=19}}Another myth says that Kalpavriksha was located on earth and was transported to Indra's abode after people started misusing it by wishing evil and wrong things.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=620}}  In Indra's "Devaloka" it is said that there are five Kalpavrikshas, which are called Mandana, [[Parijata]], Santana, Kalpavriksha and Harichandana, all of which fulfill various wishes.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=620}} Kalpavriksha, in particular, is said to be planted at [[Mt. Meru]] peak in the middle of Indra's five paradise gardens. It is on account of these wish-granting trees that the [[asuras]] waged a perpetual war with the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the "divine flowers and fruits" from the Kalpavriksha, whereas the [[demigods]] lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its "trunk and roots". The Parijata is often identified with its terrestrial  counterpart, the [[Indian coral tree]] (''Eyrthrina indica''), but is most often depicted like a [[magnolia]] or [[frangipani]] ([[Sanskrit]]: [[champaka]]) tree. It is described as having roots made of gold, a silver [[Trunk (botany)|midriff]], [[lapislazuli]] boughs, [[coral]] leaves, [[pearl]] flower, [[gemstone]] buds, and [[diamond]] fruit.{{Sfn|Beer|2003|p=19}} It is also said that Ashokasundari was created from a Kalpavriksha tree to provide relief to Parvati from her loneliness.&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;

In [[Hindu mythology]] Shiva and Parvati after much painful discussions while parting with their daughter Aranyani gave her away to the divine Kalpavriksha for safe keeping when the demon [[Andhakasura]] waged war. Parvati requested Kalpavriksha to bring up her daughter with "safety, wisdom, health and happiness," and to make her Vana Devi, the protector of forests.{{Sfn|Sivkishen|2015|p=578}}

=== In Jainism ===
{{Main article|Jain Cosmology}}
[[File:Kalpavruksha-Wall-Painting-In-Jain-Basadi-Moodbidri.JPG|250px|thumb|alt=Artisitc representation of the Kalpavriksha in Jainism. A wall painting of a tree on red backdrop.|The wall painting of Kalpavruksha in [[Saavira Kambada Basadi]], Moodbidri, Karnataka]]

Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which fulfill the desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times children are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].&lt;ref name=Edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalchakra |work=Jainism simplified|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter06.html|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining lamps and a radiant light at night.&lt;ref name=Edu /&gt;

According to Jain cosmology, in the three ''Aras'' (unequal periods) of the descending arc ([[Avasarpini]]), Kalpavrikshas provided all that was needed, but towards the end of the third ''ara'', the yield from them diminished. Eight types of these trees are described in some texts, each of which provided different objects. Thus from the "Madyanga tree" delicious and nutritious drinks could be obtained; from the "Bhojananga", delicious food; from "yotiranga", light more radiant than the sun and the moon; while from "Dopanga" came indoor light. Other trees provided homes, musical devices, table ware, fine garments, wreaths and scents.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=620}}

The ''[[Tiloya Panatti]]'' give the following list: ''Pananga'', ''Turiyanga'', ''Bhusananga'', ''Vatthanga'', ''Bhoyanga'', ''Alayanga'', ''Diviyanga'', ''Bhayananga'', ''Malanga'', ''Tejanga'' with excellent drinks, music, ornaments, garments, edibles and ready-made dishes, mansions to live in, lamps, utensils and garlands of flowers respectively while the last type, namely ''Tejanga'', seems to be self-luminous, serving the purpose of heavenly luminaries.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=71}}

=== In Buddhism ===
In Buddhism a small wish granting tree is depicted decorating the upper part of the "long-life vase" held by "longevity deities" like [[Amitayus]] and [[Ushnishavijaya]]. The goddess [[Śramaṇa|Shramana]] devi holds jeweled branch of Kalpavriksha in her left hand.{{Sfn|Beer|2003|p=19}}

Worship of the ''[[Ficus benghalensis|Nyagrodha tree]]'' as a form of non-human worship is depicted in a Buddhist sculpture at [[Besnagar]].{{Sfn|Gupta|1991|p=48}} This sculpture in Besnagar, also known as Vidisa (Bhilsa), is dated to third century BC and is exhibited in the [[Indian Museum|Calcutta Museum]].{{Sfn|Randhawa|1964|p=10}}

In [[Myanmar]], where [[Theravada Buddhism]] is practiced, the significance of the Kalpavriksha is in the form of an annual ritual known as [[Kathina]] (presenting a robe) in which the [[laity]] present gifts to the monks in the form of money trees.{{Sfn|Padma|2013|p=83}}

== Identification with other trees ==
[[File:Kalpvriksha.jpg|thumb|alt=Kalpavriksha in Rajasthan. Two large trees trunks with sacred threads tied to it.|Kalpavriksha in Mangaliyawas (near [[Ajmer]], Rajasthan in India)]]
[[File:Parijat-tree-at-Kintoor-Barabanki-003.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Parijata tree considered a Kalpavruksha, a branch and trunk of the tree is seen.|[[Parijata]] tree at Kintoor, [[Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh|Barabanki]].]]
In different states of India some trees are specifically referred to as the Kalpavriksha. These are stated below.

The banyan tree (''[[Ficus benghalensis]]''), also called ''Nyagrodha'' tree, which grows throughout the country is referred to as Kalpavriksha or Kaplaptaru because of its ability to amply provide for human needs.{{Sfn|Jha|2013|p=83}}{{Sfn|Gupta|1991|p=48}}

The coconut tree (''[[Cocos nucifera]]'') found in most regions of the country is called "Kalpavriksha", as every part of it is useful in one way or the other. The coconut water inside the nut is a delicious drink. In dried form it is called [[copra]] and is used to manufacture oil. The coconut husk, called coir, is used to make rope. Leaves are used to make huts, fans, mats. [[Palm sugar]] is made from budding flower. The dried midrib is used to make boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Allied S Environmental Education For Class 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNuop3Y2GIUC&amp;pg=PT18|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-8424-065-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashwatha]] tree (sacred fig tree) is also known as Kalapvriksha where the deities and Brahma are stated to reside, and it is where sage Narada taught the [[rishis]] on the procedure for worshipping the tree and its usefulness.{{Sfn|Samarth|Kendra|2008|p=173}}

Mahua tree (''[[Madhuca longifolia]]'') holds an important place in the day-to-day life of the tribal people. It is like the Kalpavriksha wish tree called madhu (''[[Madhuca indica]]'').{{Sfn|Rastogī|2008|p=46}}

Shami tree (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]''), found in desert areas of the country, called in local dialect as ''khejari'' or ''jaant'' is called Kalpavriksha. In [[Rajasthan]] desert area its roots go deep to a depth of {{Convert|17|–|25| m}}. This checks the erosion of the sandy soil of the desert. For this reason the tree stays green even drought conditions of weather. People of Rajasthan hence regard this tree as Kalpavriksha, because at the time of drought when no grass or fodder is found anywhere the animals are able to sustain by eating its green leaves.{{Sfn|Rastogī|2008|p=53}}

''Chyur tree'' in the high altitudes of the [[Himalayas]] growing at an altitude between 500 and 1000&amp;nbsp;m, known as the Indian butter tree (''[[Diploknema butyracea]]''), is called a Kalpavriskha, or tree of paradise by the people of the mountainous region as it yields [[honey]], [[jaggery]] and [[ghee]]. It is in the shape of an umbrella.{{Sfn|Rastogī|2008|p=25}}

In [[Joshimath]] in [[Uttarakhand]] a [[Morus (plant)|mulberry tree]], which is said to be 2400 years old, is renowned and revered as the Kalpavriksha as it was the location where, in the 8th century, [[Adi Sankaracharya]] did "penance" under the tree as he considered it an incarnation of Lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name= Limaye&gt;{{cite web|last= Limaye |first= Anita |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-06-01/news/27446002_1_temple-kalpavriksh-uttaranchal|title=Visit the 2,400 year old Kalpavriksh|date= 1 June 2006|publisher=The Economic Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003050654/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-06-01/news/27446002_1_temple-kalpavriksh-uttaranchal |archive-date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that sage [[Durvasa]] meditated under this tree,&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt; in Urgam.{{Sfn|Nair|2007|p=65}} The mountain slopes of [[Kailasa]] are stated to have a profusion of Kalpavrikshas.{{Sfn|Nair|2007|p=65}}

At Mangaliyawas near [[Ajmer]], Rajasthan, there are two revered trees (Male and Female) which are more than 800 years old, known as Kalpavrikshas. They are worshipped on an [[Amavasya]] day in the Hindu month of [[Shraavana]].&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajforest.nic.in/writereaddata/chapter1-6.pdf|format=pdf|title=Background Context and Observation Recording|work=Sacred Plants|publisher=National Informatics Center Rajasthan Forest Department|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ranchi ([[Jharkhand, Ranchi, India]]) there are three Kalpavrikshas. They are at a locality called Hinoo. 
In Tamil Nadu's culture, ''tala'' (''[[Borassus flabellifer]]'') a variety of Palmyra palm (''[[Borassus]]''), also known as toddy, is referred to as Kalpataru as all its parts have a use. This tree is also native to [[Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], has normally a life span of 100 years, grows up to {{Convert|20|m}} height; its leaves in the shape of a fan are rough texture. The leaves were used for writing in the ancient times.{{Sfn|Jha|2013|p=111}}

In the [[Harivansh Puraan]], the Parijata, baobab tree, is called a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart from the village of [[Kintoor]], near [[Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh|Barabanki]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince [[Arjuna]] of the [[Pandava|Pandava clan]] who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother [[Kunti]] after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord [[Krishna]] brought this tree from heaven to please his wife [[Satyabhama]].{{Sfn|Wickens|2008|p=61}}

Kalpalatha is another wish fulfilling tree, a creeper, which was extolled during the later part of the Aryan period. It is said that a person standing below this tree would be blessed with beautiful ornaments, dresses and even unmarried girls.{{Sfn|Randhawa|Mukhopadhyay|1986|p=2}}

== In iconography ==
In iconography, Kalpavriksha, the wish-fulfilling tree, is painted within a picture of a landscape, decorated with flowers, silks, and suspended with jewelry.{{Sfn|Beer|2003|p=19}} It is a pattern which has a prominent symbolic meaning.{{Sfn|Agrawala|2003|p=87}} Ornamental Kalpavriksha design was a feature that was adopted on the reverse of the coins and sculptures in the [[Gupta period]].{{Sfn|Bajpai|2004|p=152}}

Kalpavriksha is also dated to the [[Dharmachakra]] period of Buddhism. The paintings of this period depicting the tree with various branches and leaves have a female figure painted on its top part. The female figure is painted from mast upwards holding a bowl in her hand. Similar depiction of female figure with tree representing it as presiding deity was a notable feature during the [[Sunga period]] as seen in the image of "Salabhanvka" in the railing pillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of the Bihar Purāvid Parishad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlluAAAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Bihar Puravid Parishad.|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most paintings of Kalpavriksha Shiva and Parvati are a common feature. It forms a  canopy over Shiva. In one painting Paravati is paying obeisance to  Lord Shiva with her hands held up in adoration when she is blessed with a stream of water from the Kalpavriksha.{{Sfn|Dehejia|1999|p=96}}

== In literature ==
A Kalpavriksha is mentioned in the Sanskrit work [[Shilpa Shastras|Mānāsara]] as a royal insignia. In [[Hemādri]]'s work ''Caturvargacīntama'', the Kalpavriksha is said to be a tree of gold and gem stones.&lt;ref name="BlenchSpriggs2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Blench|author2=Matthew Spriggs|title=Archaeology and Language IV: Language Change and Cultural Transformation|url={{google books|plainurl=y |id=NUvnqjutFmoC}}|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-81623-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In poetry Kalpavriksha is compared to [[Lakshmi]] as its sister emerging from the sea. It is born to the Naga King Kumuda, the fifth descendant of [[Takshaka]], along with  his sister Kumudavati. It emerged from below the bed of the [[Sarayu River]] challenging Kusa considered an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] just in the disguise as a son.{{Sfn|Sivaramamurti|1980|p=74}}

[[Kalidasa]], in his poetry ''[[Meghadūta]]'' epitomizing wish-fulfilling trees found in the capital of the Yaksha king extols the virtues of Kalpavriksha as "the dainties and fineries for the fair women of Alaka, coloured clothes for the body, intoxicating drinks for exciting glances of the eyes, and flowers for decorating the hair and ornaments of various designs".{{Sfn|Cunningham|1962|p=viii}}

In December 2009 Bolton filed a complaint with the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] concerning the ''Ideas'' program on [[Radio New Zealand National]], which featured Marxist poet and sociologist [[Scott Hamilton (sociologist)|Scott Hamilton]]. Hamilton had stated that Bolton was an avid "holocaust denier", had a "close relationship" with the revisionist [[Adelaide Institute]], insinuated himself into the anti-war movement where he made anti-Semitic and "holocaust denial" statements, and exercised a bad political influence over "unwary youth". Bolton claimed that all of Hamilton's allegations were incorrect.{{cn|date=October 2017}} The Broadcasting Standards Authority initially upheld Bolton's complaint on all grounds, and criticised Radio New Zealand for not having verified the accuracy of Hamilton's statements before airing the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2009/2009-097.html |title=RNZ and Bolton - 2009-097 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526000351/http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2009/2009-097.html |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but reversed this decision in December 2010 and declined to uphold any of Bolton's complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/4081 » Broadcasting Standards Authority&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 Bolton complained to the Press Council against a lengthy feature article run by ''The Press'', Christchurch, "A Right Muddle" by John McCrone. Bolton stated that the article wrongly stated that Bolton was a "neo-Nazi Satanist", that he was associated with "[[white power]]" and "pseudo-fascist views", that he was the founder of New Right New Zealand, among other matters. The Press Council in a ruling dated for release as 26 March 2010, upheld parts of the complaint, determining that the article is "inaccurate and biased".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.nz/rulings/kerry-bolton-against-the-press |title=Kerry Bolton Against The Press |publisher=Presscouncil.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lalish''' ({{lang-ku|Laliş}}, also called {{lang|ku|Lalişa Nûranî}}) is a small mountain valley village situated in the [[Shekhan District]] of [[Dihok Governorate]] in Northern Iraq. It contains the holiest  temple in the Yezidi faith. The temple belongs to ancient times wherein many archaeologists and historians agree that the temple was a part of [[Sumer]]ian and other ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, and from as early as the 25th century BC through to the 7th century AD the entire region of northern Iraq was an integral part of [[Assyria]].&lt;ref name="ttg" /&gt; Later it became the location of the tomb of [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]], who is a central figure of the [[Yazidi]] faith.&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soguel|first1=Dominique|title=World Middle East A sanctuary for Iraqi Yazidis – and a plea for Obama's intervention|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0812/A-sanctuary-for-Iraqi-Yazidis-and-a-plea-for-Obama-s-intervention|accessdate=August 13, 2014|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The village is above the town of [[Ain Sifni|Shekhan]], which had the second largest population of Yazidi prior to the [[persecution of Yazidis by ISIL]].&lt;ref name=ttg0&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq crisis: the last stand of the Yazidis against Islamic State|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11029765/Iraq-crisis-the-last-stand-of-the-Yazidis-against-Islamic-State.html|accessdate=August 14, 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village is about thirty-six miles northeast of [[Mosul]].&lt;ref name=ei&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allison|first=Christine|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=YAZIDIS i.

At least once in their lifetime, Yazidis are expected to make a six-day [[Yazidi#Pilgrimage|pilgrimage to Lalish]] to visit the tomb of Şêx Adî and other sacred places.&lt;ref name=csm/&gt; These other sacred places are shrines dedicated to other holy beings. There are two sacred springs called Zamzam, which is in a cave below Sheikh Adi's sanctuary, and Kāniyā. Lalish is also the location of pirrā selāt (Ṣerāṭ Bridge) and a mountain called Mt. ʿArafāt which has sites significant in other faiths.  Yazidis living in the region are also expected to make a yearly pilgrimage to attend the autumn seven-day ''Feast of the Assembly'',&lt;ref name=ei/&gt; which is celebrated from 23 [[Elul|Aylūl]] to 1 [[Tishrei|Tašrīn I]].

==History==
Lalish village dates back about 4000 years.&lt;ref name=ttg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Richard|title=Iraq dispatch: terrified Yazidi people seek refuge inside holy temple|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11030445/Iraq-dispatch-terrified-Yazidi-people-seek-refuge-inside-holy-temple.html|accessdate=August 13, 2014|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 12th century, [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|Adi ibn Mosāfer]] moved to Lalish. Adi died in 1162 and was buried. During a major battle against the Yazidi in 1414, the tomb of Adi was razed.&lt;ref name=ei/&gt;

Beginning on 10 August 2014, Yazidi refugees have been fleeing to the village from [[Sinjar]] after the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] placed that [[Sinjar massacre|city under siege]].&lt;ref name=csm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ttg/&gt; Many fleeing Sinjar travelled through [[Syria]] to reach Lalish and [[Shekhan District|Shekhan]].&lt;ref name=ttg0/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">'''Lifespring!''' is a [[Christian]] [[podcast]] (or [[Godcast]]), with no connection with the trainings or organizations with the same name (see [[Lifespring]]). The Lifespring! podcast is notable because it was the first Christian podcast not based on repurposed church [[sermons]]. The first episode was published on November 13, 2004.

Lifespring! is hosted by Steve Webb of Riverside, California, USA.

There are (as of February 2009), thirteen shows in the Lifespring! lineup:

This is a list of [[medieval stone churches in Finland]]. A total number of 104 [[fieldstone church]]es were built between the [[13th century|13th]] and [[16th century]], of which 83 have been preserved. Numbers include the sacristies of uncompleted churches as well as three churches in [[Vyborg]] which is now part of [[Russia]].

The construction years for each church are listed in accordance with the 1994 [[PhD]] [[thesis]] of historian Markus Hiekkanen, "Suomen keskiajan kivikirkot" (Finnish medieval stone churches), although since the publication of his thesis it has emerged that some historians disagree with some of the dates he offers. Until Hiekkanen's research, most of the churches were generally considered 100–200 years older.

The provinces in this list refer to the [[historical provinces of Finland]] which differ from the modern [[regions of Finland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">This is a '''list of [[mosque]]s in the [[Maldives]]'''. The first mosques built in the Maldives were initially made of materials that easy degraded over time such as wood, coconut, and palm leaves. Later on, by the middle of the 17th to early 19th centuries, Maldivian coral stone mosque architecture developed and flourished. Due to the country's proximity with the Arabian peninsula, Arabian onion-dome mosque architecture soon replaced the majority of indigenous Maldivian coral stone mosques by the middle of the 19th century. Today, only six Maldivian coral stone mosques are in good condition, all of which are listed as [[UNESCO]] Tentative Sites under the nomination name of ''Coral Stone Mosques of Maldives''.

'''Mary Baker Eddy''' (July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) established the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], as a Christian denomination and worldwide movement of spiritual healers. She wrote and published the movement's textbook, ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' and 15 other books. She started several weekly and monthly magazines—the ''[[Christian Science Sentinel]]'', ''The [[The Christian Science Journal|Christian Science Journal]]'', and ''[[The Herald of Christian Science]]''—that feature articles on Christian Science practice and verified testimonies of healing. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', a global newspaper that has won seven [[Pulitzer Prize]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Specials/Monitor-Centennial/Pulitzer-Prizes|title=Pulitzer Prizes - CSMonitor.com |date=|website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy's book ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures'' has been a best seller for decades, and was selected as one of the "75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World," by the Women's National Book Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnba-books.org/?s=mary+baker+eddy 75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Eddy was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwomen.org/women-of-the-hall/search-the-hall/details/2/56-Eddy National Women's Hall of Fame: Mary Baker Eddy]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, The Mary Baker Eddy Library opened its doors, giving the public access to one of the largest collections about an American woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/ The Mary Baker Eddy Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Bow, New Hampshire===
====Family====
[[File:Mary Baker Eddy's birthplace, Bow, New Hampshire (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=engraving|Eddy's birthplace]]
Eddy was born Mary Morse Baker in a farmhouse in [[Bow, New Hampshire]] to farmer Mark Baker (d.&amp;nbsp;1865) and his wife Abigail Barnard Baker, née Ambrose (d.&amp;nbsp;1849). Eddy was the youngest of the Bakers' six children: boys Samuel Dow (1808), Albert (1810), and George Sullivan (1812), followed by girls Abigail Barnard (1816), Martha Smith (1819), and Mary Morse (1821).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] and John V. Dittemore, ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition'', A. A. Knopf, 1932, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Baker was a strongly religious man from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] background, a firm believer in the final judgment and eternal damnation, according to Eddy.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Baker Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', Christian Science Publishing Society, 1891, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[McClure's]]'' magazine published a series of articles in 1907 that were highly critical of Eddy, stating that Baker's home library consisted of the Bible—though Eddy responded that this was untrue and that her father had been an avid reader.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willa Cather]] and [[Georgine Milmine]], [http://www.unz.org/Author/MilmineGeorgine "Mary Baker G. Eddy: The Story of Her Life and the History of Christian Science"], ''McClure's'', [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907jan/1-17/ January 1907], 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Baker Eddy, ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', Christian Science Publishing Society, 1913, 308; Mary Baker Eddy, [http://www.endtime.org/library/mbe/reply_to_mcclures_magazine.html "Reply to McClure's Magazine"], Christian Science Endtime Center, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy wrote that her father had been a [[justice of the peace]] at one point and a chaplain of the New Hampshire State Militia.&lt;ref name=Eddy1913p309&gt;Eddy, ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', 309.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a reputation locally for being disputatious; one neighbor described him as "[a] tiger for a temper and always in a row."&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Dittemore 1932, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''McClure's'' reported several similar stories from neighbors, including that he once killed a crow with his walking stick for violating the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907jan/1-17/ January 1907], 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine described him as a supporter of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and alleged that he had been pleased to hear about [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy responded that Baker had been a "strong believer in [[States' rights]], but slavery he regarded as a great sin."&lt;ref name=Eddy1913p309/&gt;

The Baker children inherited their father's temper, according to ''McClure's''; they also inherited his good looks, and Eddy became known as the village beauty. Life was nevertheless spartan and repetitive. Every day began with lengthy prayer and continued with hard work. The only rest day was the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 230, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health====
[[File:Mark Baker, father of Mary Baker Eddy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|Mark Baker]]
Eddy and her father reportedly had a volatile relationship. [[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] and John V. Dittemore wrote in 1932 that Baker sought to break Eddy's will with harsh punishment, although her mother often intervened; in contrast to Mark Baker, Eddy's mother was described as devout, quiet, light-hearted, and kind.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy experienced periods of sudden illness, perhaps in an effort to control her father's attitude toward her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Fraser]], ''God's Perfect Child'', Metropolitan Books, 1999, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who knew the family described her as suddenly falling to the floor, writhing and screaming, or silent and apparently unconscious, sometimes for hours.&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 236; Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]], one of Eddy's biographers, worked for the Christian Science church and wrote in 1966:

{{quote|This was when life took on the look of a nightmare, overburdened nerves gave way, and she would end in a state of unconsciousness that would sometimes last for hours and send the family into a panic. On such an occasion Lyman Durgin, the Baker's teen-age chore boy, who adored Mary, would be packed off on a horse for the village doctor&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]], ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gillian Gill]] wrote in 1998 that Eddy was often sick as a child and appears to have suffered from an eating disorder, but reports may have been exaggerated concerning hysterical fits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillian Gill]], ''Mary Baker Eddy'', Da Capo Press, 1998, 39–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy described her problems with food in the first edition of ''Science and Health'' (1875). She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread, and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: "Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Baker Eddy, [http://www.mbeinstitute.org/ScienceAndHealth/SandH.htm ''Science and Health''], 1st edition, Christian Science Publishing Company, 1875, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy experienced near invalidism as a child and most of her life until her discovery of Christian Science.  Like most life experiences, it formed her lifelong, diligent research for a remedy from almost constant suffering. Eddy writes in her autobiography,"From my very childhood I was impelled by a hunger and thirst after divine things, - a desire for something higher and better than matter, and apart from it, - to seek diligently for the knowledge of God as the one great and ever-present relief from human woe." She also writes on page 33 of the chapter, "Medical Experiments," in her autobiography, "I wandered through the dim mazes of 'materia medica,' till I was weary of 'scientific guessing,' as it has been well called. I sought knowledge from the different schools, - allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, and from various humbugs, - but without receiving satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;(Retrospection and Instrospection, Copyright 1901, by Mary Baker G. Eddy, Copyright renewed 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tilton, New Hampshire===
[[File:EddyChildhoodChurch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Congregational Church]] in [[Tilton, New Hampshire|Tilton]], [[New Hampshire]], which Eddy attended]]
In 1836 when Eddy was fifteen, the Bakers moved twenty miles to Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire, known after 1869 as [[Tilton, New Hampshire|Tilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My father was taught to believe that my brain was too large for my body and so kept me much out of school, but I gained book-knowledge with far less labor than is usually requisite. At ten years of age I was as familiar with Lindley Murray's Grammar as with the Westminster Catechism; and the latter I had to repeat every Sunday. My favorite studies were natural philosophy, logic, and moral science. From my brother Albert, I received lessons in the ancient tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a youngster, she was often tutored by Albert, a brilliant young man in his own right who clerked for Franklin Pierce as a lawyer and later became a state politician himself before his untimely death. Another tutor was the Reverend Enoch Corser, who was Mary's spiritual guide, as well. He told his son Bartlett concerning Mary, "I never before had a pupil with such depth and independence of thought.  She has some great future, mark that  She is an intellectual and spiritual genius." "Bright, good, and pure, aye brilliant!"

&lt;!---the following has been hidden because it does not indicate where the quotation ends: Joseph S. Robinson in his book ''Waymarks in the Life of Mary Baker Eddy'', writes of Mary Baker Eddy's education, "Mary Baker Eddy---&gt;Eddy completed her education at the Holmes Academy in Plymouth and Sanbornton Academy at the Bridge, between the years 1838 and 1842, when the present Tilton School served as a female college. She had an instructor of more than average talents in Professor Dyer Hook Sanborn. He was the author of a treatise on normal school teaching, and his "Analytical Grammar" went through eight editions. He was also the town's "superintending school committee" and he became Representative in 1845. Lucy Cross, historian of Northfield, states that it was a "celebrated school," for he was a "model educator," turning out "many finely educated lady teachers."{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Mary Baker Eddy served as a substitute instructor at the same institution after its name had changed to the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College.

Bates and Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there, but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser.  She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Dittemore 1932, 16–17, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on 26 July 1838 when she was 17, according to church records published by ''McClure's'' in 1907. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of [[predestination]] with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old [[Finding in the Temple|Jesus in the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 14–15; Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in response to the ''McClure's'' article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken by her.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', 311: "My reply to the statement that the clerk's book shows that I joined the Tilton Congregational Church at the age of seventeen is that my religious experience seemed to culminate at twelve years of age. Hence a mistake may have occurred as to the exact date of my first church membership."&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy objected so strongly to the idea of predestination and eternal damnation that it made her ill:

{{quote|My mother, as she bathed my burning temples, bade me lean on God's love, which would give me rest if I went to Him in prayer, as I was wont to do, seeking His guidance. I prayed; and a soft glow of ineffable joy came over me. The fever was gone and I rose and dressed myself in a normal condition of health. Mother saw this and was glad. The physician marveled; and the "horrible decree" of Predestination – as John Calvin rightly called his own tenet – forever lost its power over me.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Marriage, widowhood===
[[File:Mary Baker G. Eddy, 1850s (2).jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Eddy in the 1850s]]
Eddy was badly affected by four deaths in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gottschalk]], ''Rolling Away the Stone'', Indiana University Press, 2006, 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt; She regarded her brother Albert as a teacher and mentor, but he died in 1841. In 1844, her first husband George Washington Glover (a friend of her brother Samuel's) died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843 and set up home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where Glover had business, but he died of [[yellow fever]] in June 1844 while living in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington II was born on 12 September in her father's home.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk 2006, 62–63; Gill 1998, xxix, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk 2006, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; She tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire ''Patriot'' and various [[Odd Fellows]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] publications. She also worked as a [[substitute teacher]] in the [[New Hampshire Conference Seminary]], and ran her own [[kindergarten]] for a few months in 1846, apparently refusing to use [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then her mother died in November 1849. Eddy wrote to one of her brothers: "What is left of earth to ''me''!" Her mother's death was followed three weeks later by the death of her fiancé, lawyer John Bartlett.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk 2006, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, Eddy wrote, her son was sent away to be looked after by the family's nurse; he was four years old by then.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ as to whether Eddy could have prevented this.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999, 38"&gt;Fraser 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It was difficult for a woman in her circumstances to earn money and, according to the legal doctrine of [[coverture]], women in the United States during this period could not be their own children's guardians. When their husbands died, they were left in a legally vulnerable position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/wes/collections/women_law/ "Women and the Law"], ''Women, Enterprise &amp; Society'', Harvard Business School, 2010: "A married woman or ''feme covert'' was a dependent, like an underage child or a slave, and could not own property in her own name or control her own earnings, except under very specific circumstances. When a husband died, his wife could not be the guardian to their under-age children."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Patterson Duncan Baker.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Elizabeth Patterson Duncan Baker, Mark Baker's second wife]]
Mark Baker remarried in 1850; his second wife Elizabeth Patterson Duncan (d. 6 June 1875) had been widowed twice, and had some property and income from her second marriage.&lt;ref name=Gill1998p86&gt;Gill 1998, 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Baker apparently made clear to Eddy that her son would not be welcome in the new marital home.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999, 38"/&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|A few months before my father's second marriage ... my little son, about four years of age, was sent away from me, and put under the care of our family nurse, who had married, and resided in the northern part of New Hampshire. I had no training for self-support, and my home I regarded as very precious. The night before my child was taken from me, I knelt by his side throughout the dark hours, hoping for a vision of relief from this trial.&lt;ref name=Eddy1891p20&gt;Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', [https://archive.org/stream/retrospectionin00eddy#page/20/mode/2up 20–23].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George was sent to stay with various relatives, and Eddy decided to live with her sister Abigail. Abigail apparently also declined to take George, then six years old.&lt;ref name=Gill1998p86/&gt; Eddy married again in 1853. Her second husband, Daniel Patterson, was a dentist and apparently said that he would become George's legal guardian; but he appears not to have gone ahead with this, and Eddy lost contact with her son when the family that looked after him, the Cheneys, moved to Minnesota, and then her son several years later enlisted in the Union army during the Civil War. She did not see him again until he was in his thirties:

{{quote|My dominant thought in marrying again was to get back my child, but after our marriage his stepfather was not willing he should have a home with me. A plot was consummated for keeping us apart. The family to whose care he was committed very soon removed to what was then regarded as the Far West.

After his removal a letter was read to my little son, informing him that his mother was dead and buried. Without my knowledge a guardian was appointed him, and I was then informed that my son was lost. Every means within my power was employed to find him, but without success. We never met again until he had reached the age of thirty-four, had a wife and two children, and by a strange providence had learned that his mother still lived, and came to see me in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Eddy1891p20/&gt;}}

==Study with Phineas Quimby==
[[File:Phineas Parkhurst Quimby.jpg|180px|thumb|alt=photograph|Eddy's methods are seen as being derived from the ideas of [[Phineas Quimby]] and [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rennie Schoepflin, "Christian Science", in Paul S. Boyer (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to United States History'', Oxford University Press, 2001, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In October 1862, Eddy became a patient of [[Phineas Quimby]],&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; a magnetic healer from Maine. From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of [[mesmerism]] entirely benign.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II.&lt;!--page?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Quimby was steeped both in the Protestant Christianity of his time and the science of the industrial revolution. He wrote in 1864, "The wise man, in like measure&amp;nbsp;... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science."&lt;ref&gt;Quimby papers, Library of Congress, Vol. 6, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the ''Portland Evening Courier'' in November 1862, Eddy wrote:

{{quote|With this physical and mental depression I first visited P. P. Quimby, and in less than one week from that time I ascended by a stairway of one hundred and eighty-two-steps to the dome of the City Hall, and am improving ad in-finitum. To the most subtle reasoning, such a proof, coupled to as it is with numberless similar ones, demonstrates his power to heal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buchanan, ''American Women's Rights Movement: A Chronology of Events and of Opportunities from 1600 to 2008'', Branden Books, 2009, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Mary Baker Eddy, c. 1864.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Eddy around 1864]]
She wrote in a letter in 1864, "I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Lyman Powell, ''Christian science, the faith and its founder'', G.P. Putnam's sons, 1917, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy denied mesmerism in another letter to the ''Portland Evening Courier'', claiming that Christ was the cure:

{{quote|P. P. Quimby stands upon the plane of wisdom with his truth. Christ healed the sick, but not by jugglery or with drugs. As the former speaks as never man before spake, and heals as never man healed since. Christ, is he not identified with truth, and is not this the Christ which is in him? We know that in wisdom is life, `and the life was the light of man.' P. P. Quimby rolls away the stone from the sepulchre of error, and health is the resurrection. But we also know that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine 1909, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Quimby had his own notions concerning the nature of these unseen forces which Eddy accepted early on, but she later drew decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and rejected any form of [[hypnotism]]. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another, and learned from one another. Quimby reportedly later said that he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and, at one point, referred to him as an "advanced thinker" with a "high and noble character."&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1971, 172, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. She refutes hypnotism in ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,'' calling it mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient. She states, "The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him."&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures," by Mary Baker Eddy, p.375&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall in Swampscott==
Eddy experienced a healing on February 4, 1866, after she slipped and fell on some ice while walking in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]] on February 1 causing a spinal injury:

{{quote|On the third day thereafter, I called for my Bible, and opened it at Matthew, 9:2 [And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.&lt;small&gt;(King James Bible) &lt;/small&gt;]. As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I arose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed. That short experience included a glimpse of the great fact that I have since tried to make plain to others, namely, Life in and of Spirit; this Life being the sole reality of existence.&lt;ref name="CSJournal1899"&gt;{{Citation

She later filed a claim for money from the city of Lynn for her injury on the grounds that she was "still suffering from the effects of that fall" (though she afterwards withdrew the lawsuit).&lt;ref name="Nenneman"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill writes that Eddy's claim was probably made under financial pressure from her husband at the time. Her neighbors believed her sudden recovery to be a near-miracle.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eiEMHjyvTGEC&amp;pg=PA161 161-170].&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy's attending physician Alvin M. Cushing, a [[Homeopathy|homeopath]], testified under oath that he "did not at any time declare, or believe, that there was no hope for Mrs. Patterson's recovery, or that she was in critical condition."&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Martin Gardner, ''The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy'', Prometheus Books, 1993.&lt;!--page--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy wrote in her autobiography, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', that she devoted the next three years of her life to biblical study and what she considered the discovery of Christian Science: "I then withdrew from society about three years,--to ponder my mission, to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take the things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great curative Principle, --Deity."&lt;ref name="RetroIntro"&gt;Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 8–9, 22, 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy became convinced that illness could be healed through an awakened thought brought about by a clearer perception of God and the explicit rejection of drugs, hygiene, and medicine, based on the observation that Jesus did not use these methods for healing:

{{quote|It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene, nor provide them for human use; else Jesus would have recommended and employed them in his healing. ... The tender word and Christian encouragement of an invalid, pitiful patience with his fears and the removal of them, are better than hecatombs of gushing theories, stereotyped borrowed speeches, and the doling of arguments, which are but so many parodies on legitimate Christian Science, aflame with divine Love.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'', 143:5, 367:3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Spiritualism==
Eddy separated from her second husband Daniel Patterson, after which she boarded for four years with several families in Lynn, Amesbury, and elsewhere. [[Frank Podmore]] wrote:

{{quote|But she was never able to stay long in one family. She quarrelled successively with all her hostesses, and her departure from the house was heralded on two or three occasions by a violent scene. Her friends during these years were generally Spiritualists; she seems to have professed herself a Spiritualist, and to have taken part in ''séances''. She was occasionally entranced, and had received "spirit communications" from her deceased brother Albert. Her first advertisement as a healer appeared in 1868, in the Spiritualist paper, ''[[The Banner of Light]]''. During these years she carried about with her a copy of one of Quimby's manuscripts giving an abstract of his philosophy. This manuscript she permitted some of her pupils to copy.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Podmore, ''Mesmerism and Christian Science: A Short History of Mental Healing'', George W. Jacobs and Company, 1909, 262, 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Mary Baker G. Eddy, Lynn, 1871.JPG|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Eddy in Lynn, MA, 1871]]
Eddy clearly distinguished Christian Science from [[Spiritualism]] in a chapter in Science and Health entitled [[Christian Science versus Spiritualism]].[https://www.christianscience.com/the-christian-science-pastor/science-and-health/chapter-iv-christian-science-versus-spiritualism] According to [[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]], Eddy gave a public talk opposing Spiritualism in Warren, Maine in the spring of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1966, 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Hiram Crafts, a student of hers, stated in an affidavit: "At that date I was a Spiritualist, but her teachings changed my views on that subject and I gave up spiritualism."&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1966, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

After she became well known, reports surfaced that Eddy was a medium in Boston at one time.&lt;ref name="Peel, Robert 1966, p. 133"&gt;Peel 1966, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time when she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away.&lt;ref name="Gill, Gillian 1998, p. 627"&gt;Gill 1998, 627.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also bedridden during that time.&lt;ref name="Peel, Robert 1966, p. 133"/&gt; Peel has been challenged by other researchers who write that Eddy acted as a trance channeler and worked in and around Boston as a Spiritualist medium giving public [[séance]]s for money.&lt;ref&gt;John Ankerberg, ''The Facts on the Mind Sciences'', Atri Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, she visited her friend Sarah Crosby in 1864, who believed in Spiritualism. Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy's brother Albert and writing letters which she attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Sybil Wilbur, "The Story of the Real Mrs. Eddy," ''Human Life'', March 1907, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark who was interested in Spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy's arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least one other who was there at the time—Hiram Crafts—that "her science was far superior to spirit teachings."&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's son George tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said that she abhorred the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1966, 210-211.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cather and Milmine, Mrs. Richard Hazeltine attended seances at Clark's home,&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', May 1907, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and she said that Eddy had acted as a [[trance medium]], claiming to channel the spirits of the [[Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Cather and Milmine 1909, 64–68, 111–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy was also known for channeling messages from the dead brother of her friend Sarah Crosby. According to Martin Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1993, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was [[Abraham Lincoln]]. According to eyewitness reports cited by Cather and Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Cather nd Milmine, 1909.&lt;!--page?--&gt; Also see Robert Hall, ''The Modern Siren'', H. L. Thatcher, 1916 ([https://archive.org/stream/modernsiren00hallgoog#page/n38/mode/2up archive.org]).&lt;/ref&gt; In these later séances, Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leonard, ''Talking to the Other Side: a History of Modern Spiritualism And Mediumship: A Study of the Religion, Science, Philosophy and Mediums that Encompass this American-Made Religion'', iUniverse, Inc., 2005, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice but denounced it in her Christian Science writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianscience.com/read-online/science-and-health/chapter-4-christian-science-versus-spiritualism Christian Science versus Spiritualism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529064512/http://christianscience.com/read-online/science-and-health/chapter-4-christian-science-versus-spiritualism |date=May 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy came to believe, after she founded Christian Science, that [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|spirit manifestation]]s had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Braude, ''Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America'', Indiana University Press, 2001, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce, publishing her work==
Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery in 1873. She published her work in 1875 in a book entitled ''Science and Health'' (years later retitled ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'') which she called the textbook of Christian Science, after several years of offering her healing method. The first publication run was 1,000 copies, which she self-published. During these years, she taught what she considered the science of "primitive Christianity" to at least 800 people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Authority'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977, 483, n. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of ''Science and Health'' (chapter entitled "Fruitage") contains testimonies of people who claimed to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.&lt;ref name="NOTES 1998, p. 324"&gt;Gill 1998, 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, she married Asa Gilbert Eddy; in 1882, they moved to Boston, and he died that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/mary-baker-eddy/timeline Mary Baker Eddy Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of plagiarism==
===Quimbyism===
[[Phineas Quimby]] by 1859 had connected his healing practices with the Christ of the [[New Testament]]. He also called his method of healing the "science of health" and the "science of Christ," and had used the term "Christian Science" to describe his work.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House Publishers, 2003, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of science James C. Whorton, "In Quimby's mind, Christ and science were synonymous; his method of healing he thus called the Science of Christ and even, toward the close of his life, "Christian Science."&lt;ref&gt;James C. Whorton, ''Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&amp;pg=PA119 119].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers, including Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine in ''McClure's'', and [[Martin Gardner]], have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy:

{{quote|Many critics of Eddy maintained that she basically stole all of her ideas from her longtime teacher, Phineas P. Quimby. It was he who had worked to develop the healing system that she adopted to be used as the base-doctrine in Christian Science. If she did not take all of his ideas, she, at the very least, based her system of healing on his basic treatises about mental healing.&lt;ref&gt;Todd 2005, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating: "The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser.  This greater error thereafter occupies the ground, leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''Science and Health'', 104:22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In the 24th edition of ''Science and Health'', up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between [[Vedanta|Vedanta philosophy]] and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], but they were later removed. According to Gill, in the 1891 revision Eddy removed from her book all the references to [[Eastern religions]] which her editor, Reverend [[James Henry Wiggin]], had introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 332–333.&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue [[Swami Abhedananda]] wrote:

{{quote|Mrs. Eddy quoted certain passages from the English edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but unfortunately, for some reason, those passages of the Gita were omitted in the 34th edition of the book, Science and Health ... if we closely study Mrs. Eddy's book, we find that Mrs. Eddy has incorporated in her book most of the salient features of Vedanta philosophy, but she denied the debt flatly.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Prajnanananda, ''The Philosophical Ideas of Swami Abhedananada'', Calcutta: Ramakrishna Vedanta Math, 1971, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other writers, such as [[Jyotirmayananda Saraswati]], have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient [[Hindu]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Nanda, ''Vivekananda: His Gospel of Man-making with a Garland of Tributes and a Chronicle of his Life and Times, with Pictures'', Swami Jyotirmayananda, 1993, 480; Timothy Miller, ''America's Alternative Religions'', State University of New York, 1995, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historian]] Damodar Singhal wrote:

{{quote|The Christian Science movement in America was possibly influenced by India. The founder of this movement, Mary Baker Eddy, in common with the Vedantins, believed that matter and suffering were unreal, and that a full realization of this fact was essential for relief from ills and pains ... The Christian Science doctrine has naturally been given a Christian framework, but the echoes of Vedanta in its literature are often striking.&lt;ref&gt;Damodar Singhal, ''Modern Indian Society and Culture'', Meenakshi Prakashan, 1980, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wendell Thomas in ''[[Hinduism Invades America]]'' (1930) suggested that Eddy may have discovered [[Hinduism]] through the teachings of the [[Transcendentalism|New England Transcendentalists]] such as [[Bronson Alcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendell Thomas, ''Hinduism Invades America'', The Beacon Press, Inc., 1930, 228–234 ([https://archive.org/stream/hinduisminvadesa013865mbp#page/n227/mode/2up archive.org]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Gottschalk]], in his ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' (1973), wrote:

{{quote|The association of Christian Science with Eastern religion would seem to have had some basis in Mrs Eddy's own writings. For in some early editions of ''Science and Health'' she had quoted from and commented favorably upon a few Hindu and Buddhist texts... None of these references, however, was to remain a part of Science and Health as it finally stood... Increasingly from the mid-1880s on, Mrs Eddy made a sharp distinction between Christian Science and Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gottschalk]], ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'', University of California Press, 1973, 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In regards to the influence of Eastern religions on her discovery of Christian Science, Eddy states in ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany'': "Think not that Christian Science tends towards [[Buddhism]] or any other 'ism'. Per contra, Christian Science destroys such tendency."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Mary Baker ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany'', page 119, line 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building a church==
[[File:Mary Baker Eddy cph.3b20582.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mary Baker G. Eddy in later years.]]
Eddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, ''The [[Manual of The Mother Church]]'', and revising ''Science and Health''. By the 1870s she was telling her students, "Some day I will have a church of my own."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, "to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist'', 1910, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist,  "designed to be built on the Rock, Christ...."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist'', 1910, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, she founded the [[Massachusetts Metaphysical College]],&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1971, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1977, 483, n. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition. This was a large sum for the period and generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Caplan, ''Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy'', University of California Press, 2001, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as [[Christian Science Practitioner]]s in the church's periodical, ''[[The Christian Science Journal]]''. She also founded the ''[[Christian Science Sentinel]]'', a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing.

In 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;A New Home," ''The Christian Science Journal'', September 1888, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today.&lt;ref&gt;See Christian Science Reading Room listings in current edition of the Christian Science Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston (The Mother Church). In the early years Eddy served as pastor. In 1895 she ordained the Bible and ''Science and Health'' as the pastor.&lt;ref&gt;NOTES: Eddy, Manual of the Mother Church, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1977, 372.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', a daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded the ''Christian Science Journal'' in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; a monthly magazine aimed at the church's members and, in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 410.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Christian Science Sentinel'', a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the ''[[Herald of Christian Science]]'', a religious magazine with editions in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1977, 415, n. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malicious animal magnetism==
The converse of [[mental healing]] was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health – what Eddy termed "malicious animal magnetism." She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moore, ''Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'', Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 Eddy had an argument with her student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe that he was using mental powers to destroy her so she ordered her students to "mobilize all their mental energy to combat him".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth A. Tucker, ''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzHsXbXOab0C&amp;pg=PA157 157].&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of "mental assassination".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1995, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Haller, ''American Medicine in Transition, 1840-1910'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FeaucvGO41MC&amp;pg=PA139 139].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eugene V. Gallagher]]:

{{quote|Eddy believed that former students actually had the power to commit "mental assassination". After a breakup with one of her early protégés, Daniel H. Spofford, she thought he was using mental malpractice to undermine her Christian Science practice. In a celebrated case (1878) that earned her much negative publicity, she took part in a [[Salem witchcraft trial (1878)|lawsuit against Spofford]], claiming that he deliberately practiced malicious mesmerism on one of her unhealed patients, Lucretia Brown. Irreverently dubbed "The Second Salem Witch Trial", the suit was eventually thrown out of court.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Gallagher; Michael W. Ashcroft, 
''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oZiScvbS6-cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA93 93].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The belief in malicious animal magnetism "remains a part of the doctrine of Christian Science."&lt;ref&gt;William Williams, ''Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File, 2000.&lt;!--page?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an article entitled "Malicious Animal Magnetism" published in the ''Christian Science Journal'', February 1889, Eddy wrote that mental assassination was one of the greatest crimes and that anyone practicing it should be put to death by a human executioner.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Peabody, ''Religio-Medical Masquerade'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sbb4mwCTI18C&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Several persons committed suicide because of the fear of malicious animal magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Locke, ''Eddyism: Is it Christian? Is it Scientific? How Long Will it Last?'', Grafton Publishing Company, 1911, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Tomlinson, a student of Mary Baker Eddy, committed suicide by throwing herself out of a window.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Dakin, ''Mrs. Eddy: the biography of a virginal mind'', Blue Ribbon Books, 1930, 462.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Christian Scientist Marion Stephens committed suicide by gassing herself in a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/04/26/104931087.pdf "Lay Eddyite Suicide to 'Death Thought'. Malicious Animal Magnetism" Said to Have Caused Miss Stephens to End Her Life"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years Eddy apparently became paranoid, believing that 50,000 people were trying to kill her by projecting their evil thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Dittemore 1932.&lt;!--page--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy wrote that if she died it would be due to malicious animal magnetism rather than from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker 2004, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of medicine==
[[File:Calvin A. Frye cph.3b20581.jpg|thumb|180px|Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary]]
A diary kept by Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary, suggested that Eddy had a lifelong dependence on morphine.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1993.&lt;!--page--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Miranda Rice, a friend and close student of Eddy, told a newspaper in 1906: "I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies. She begged me to get some for her. She sent her husband Mr. Eddy for some, and when he failed to get it went herself and got it. She locked herself into her room and for two days excluded every one. She was a slave to morphine."&lt;ref&gt;Fleta Springer, ''According to the Flesh: A Biography of Mary Baker Eddy'', Coward-McCann, 1930, 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Gill writes that the prescription of morphine was normal medical practice at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1998, 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographers who have described Eddy as a morphine addict include [[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] and [[Edwin Franden Dakin]].&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, Christopher M. (2013). ''The Spiritualist Movement: Speaking with the Dead in America and Around the World''. ''Volume 1: American Origins and Global Proliferation''. Praeger. p. 58. {{ISBN|978-0-313-39947-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy recommended to her son that, rather than go against the law of the state, he should have her grandchildren vaccinated. She also paid for a [[mastectomy]] for her sister-in-law.&lt;ref name=Whorton2004p128&gt;Whorton 2004, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy was quoted in the ''New York Herald'' on 1 May 1901: "Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vaccinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will do the children no harm. So long as Christian Scientists obey the laws, I do not suppose their mental reservations will be thought to matter much."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, ''General Miscellany'', 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy used glasses for several years for very fine print, but later dispensed with them almost entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1977, 108–109, 411, n. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; She found she could read fine print with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Peel 1971, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 [[Arthur Brisbane]] interviewed Eddy. At one point he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six, she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Brisbane,  "An Interview with Mrs. Eddy," ''Cosmopolitan Magazine'', August 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of her life she was frequently attended by physicians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537909808580830#preview "The Rise and Fall of Christian Science"], ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'', 13(2), 1988, 189–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological evaluation==

In 1907, in the course of a legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed Eddy, then 86 years old, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs, and concluded that she was able to.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Dittemore 1932, 411, 413, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[Allan McLane Hamilton]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the attacks on Eddy were the result of "a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself," and that "there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0810FF3B5A15738DDDAC0A94D0405B878CF1D3 ''The New York Times'' 1907].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1907 article in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' noted that Eddy exhibited [[Hysteria|hysterical]] and [[Psychosis|psychotic]] behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1907). [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/462330 ''Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy’s Case of Hysteria'']. ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' 7: 614-615.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Karl Menninger]] in his book ''The Human Mind'' (1927) cited Eddy's paranoid delusions about malicious animal magnetism as an example of a "[[Schizophrenia|schizoid]] personality".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Menninger]], ''The Human Mind'', Garden City Publishing Company, 1927, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Leon Joseph Saul and [[Silas L. Warner]], in their book ''The Psychotic Personality'' (1982), came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of [[Psychopathy|Psychotic Personality Disorder]] (PPD).&lt;ref&gt;Leon Saul and Silas Warner, ''The Psychotic Personality'', Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982, 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, psychologists [[Barber and Calverley|Theodore Barber]] and Sheryl C. Wilson suggested that Eddy displayed traits of a [[fantasy prone personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Sheryl C; Barber, Theodore X. (1983). ''The Fantasy-Prone Personality''. In Anees A. Sheikh. ''Imagery: Current Theory, Research and Application''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 340-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[George Eman Vaillant]] wrote that Eddy was [[Hypochondriasis|hypochrondriacal]].&lt;ref&gt;George Vaillant, ''Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers'', American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1992, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopharmacologist [[Ronald K. Siegel]] has written that Eddy's lifelong secret morphine habit contributed to her development of "progressive [[paranoia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald K. Siegel]], ''Whispers: The Voices of Paranoia'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:2005-08 DCI Trip-Boston 001.JPG|thumb|200px|Monument to Eddy in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]
Eddy died on the evening of December 3, 1910 at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]] section of [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D01EFDD1638E333A25756C0A9649D946196D6CF "Mrs. Eddy Dies Of Pneumonia; No Doctor Near"], ''The New York Times'', December 5, 1910: "Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, died Saturday night at 10:45 o'clock. The death was kept a secret until this morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. It was first publicly announced at the Mother Church this morning. Mrs. Eddy was in her ninetieth year."&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried on December 8, 1910 at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Her memorial was designed by New York architect [[Egerton Swartwout]] (1870–1943). Hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including ''The Boston Globe'', which wrote, "She did a wonderful—an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good."&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Eddy's Life and Achievement," ''The Boston Globe'', December 5, 1910, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Currently, there are almost 1,700 Christian Science churches in 76 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See Christian Science Church listings in current issue of The Christian Science Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a century, ''The Christian Science Journal'' and the ''Christian Science Sentinel'' have been publishing accounts of restored health based on the system of care that Eddy taught.

In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy's birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn), [[pyramid]] with a 121 square foot footprint was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in [[Bow, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes1921"&gt;{{citation

Also demolished was Eddy's former home in Pleasant View, as the board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Hartsook, ''Christian Science After 1910'', Bookmark, 1994, 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rashtrakuta Manyakheta Kings Infobox}}
'''Rashtrakuta''' ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|rāṣṭrakūṭa}}'') was a royal [[dynasty]] ruling large parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]] between the sixth and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta [[Indian inscriptions|inscription]] is a 7th-century [[copper plate grant]] detailing their rule from Manapura, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of [[Achalpur|Achalapur]] (modern Elichpur in [[Maharashtra]]) and the rulers of [[Kannauj]]. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language.

The Elichpur clan was a [[feudatory]] of the [[Badami Chalukyas]], and during the rule of [[Dantidurga]], it overthrew Chalukya [[Kirtivarman II]] and went on to build an empire with the [[Gulbarga]] region in modern [[Karnataka]] as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]], rising to power in [[South India]] in 753. At the same time the [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] of [[Bengal]] and the [[Prathihara|Prathihara dynasty]] of [[Malwa]] were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. An Arabic text, ''Silsilat al-Tawarikh'' (851), called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world.&lt;ref name="siraf"&gt;Reu (1933), p39&lt;/ref&gt;

This period, between the eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a [[tripartite struggle]] for the resources of the rich [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic plains]], each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] ruled a vast empire stretching from the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] and [[Yamuna River]] [[doab]] in the north to [[Cape Comorin]] in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by [[Hinduism]] and the later kings by [[Jainism]].

During their rule, [[Jain]] mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]]. [[Amoghavarsha I]],  the most famous king of this dynasty wrote ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'', a landmark literary work in the [[Kannada]] language. Architecture reached a milestone in the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] style, the finest example of which is seen in the [[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasanath Temple]] at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] in modern [[Maharashtra]]. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at [[Pattadakal]] in modern [[Karnataka]], both of which are [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

[[File:Rashtrakuta-empire-map.svg|thumb|Core territory of the empire of [[Manyakheta]]]]
The origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic of Indian history. These issues pertain to the origin of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 2nd century [[Common Era|BCE]],&lt;ref name="arattas"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] (1933), pp1–5&lt;/ref&gt; and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the 6th and 7th centuries. The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] (present day Malkhed in the [[Gulbarga district]], Karnataka state), who ruled between the 8th and 10th centuries has also been debated.&lt;ref name="connect"&gt;Altekar (1934), pp1–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="connect1"&gt;Reu (1933), pp6–9, pp47–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study1" /&gt;

The sources for Rashtrakuta history include medieval [[Indian inscriptions|inscriptions]], ancient literature in the [[Pali]] language,&lt;ref name="pali"&gt;Reu (1933), p1&lt;/ref&gt; contemporaneous literature in Sanskrit and [[Kannada]] and the notes of the Arab travellers.&lt;ref name="sources"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72&lt;/ref&gt; Theories about the dynastic lineage (''[[Suryavansha|Surya Vamsa]]''—Solar line and ''[[Chandravansha|Chandra Vamsa]]''—Lunar line), the native region and the ancestral home have been proposed, based on information gleaned from inscriptions, royal emblems, the ancient clan names such as "Rashtrika", epithets (''Ratta'', ''Rashtrakuta'', ''Lattalura Puravaradhiswara''), the names of princes and princesses of the dynasty, and clues from relics such as coins.&lt;ref name="study1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Reu (1933), pp1–15&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate over which ethnic/linguistic groups can claim the early Rashtrakutas. Possibilities include the north western ethnic groups of India,&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;[[John Faithfull Fleet|J. F. Fleet]] in Reu (1933), p6&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kannadiga]],&lt;ref name="kann"&gt;A Kannada dynasty was created in [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] under the rule of Badami Chalukyas (Altekar 1934, p21–26)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kann2"&gt;Kamath 2001, p72–3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reddi]],&lt;ref name="red"&gt;A.C. Burnell in Pandit Reu (1933), p4&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maratha]],&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;C.V. Vaidya (1924), p171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mar1"&gt;D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu, (1933), p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; or the tribes from the [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref name="pun"&gt;Hultzsch and Reu in Reu (1933), p2, p4&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars however concur that the rulers of the imperial dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the [[Kannada language]] as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians [[Sheldon Pollock]] and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada),&lt;ref name="language"&gt;Kamath (2001), p73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="language1"&gt;Pollock 2006, p332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="houb"&gt;Houben(1996), p215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="language2"&gt;Altekar (1934), p411–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dal"&gt;Dalby (1998), p300&lt;/ref&gt; and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty.&lt;ref name="credit"&gt;Sen (1999), pp380-381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature"&gt;During the rule of the Rashtrakutas, literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flowered (Kamath 2001, pp 88–90)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature1"&gt;Even royalty of the empire took part in poetic and literary activities – Thapar (2003), p334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature2"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp17–18, p68&lt;/ref&gt; Though these Rashtrakutas were [[Kannadiga]]s,&lt;ref name="study1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kanna"&gt;Altekar (1934), pp21–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanna1"&gt;Possibly Dravidian Kannada origin (Karmarkar 1947 p26)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mas"&gt;Masica (1991), p45-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ravi"&gt;Rashtrakutas are described as Kannadigas from Lattaluru who encouraged the Kannada language (Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p87)&lt;/ref&gt; they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rashtrakuta Dynasty|url= https://books.google.com/?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=Rashtrakuta|author=Hoiberg and Ramchandani|publisher=Students Brittanica|work=|accessdate=2008-10-13 | isbn=978-0-85229-760-5|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of the Rashtrakuta empire included nearly all of [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]] and parts of [[Andhra Pradesh]], an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that the feudatory King [[Dantidurga]], who probably ruled from Achalapura in [[Berar Province|Berar]] (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to the army of the [[Badami Chalukyas]]) of Kirtivarman II of [[Badami]] in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire.&lt;ref name="karnatik"&gt;Reu (1933), p54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karnata"&gt;From Rashtrakuta inscriptions call the Badami Chalukya army ''Karnatabala'' (power of ''Karnata'') (Kamath 2001, p57, p65)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="achala"&gt;Altekar in Kamath (2001), p72&lt;/ref&gt; He then helped his father-in-law, [[Pallava]] King Nandivarman regain [[Kanchi]] from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras of [[Malwa]], and the rulers of [[Odisha|Kalinga]], [[Kosala]] and [[Srisailam]].&lt;ref name="srisila"&gt;Sastri (1955), p141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulbarga"&gt;Thapar (2003), p333&lt;/ref&gt;

Dantidurga's successor [[Krishna I]] brought major portions of present-day Karnataka and [[Konkan]] under his control.&lt;ref name="kon"&gt;Sastri (1955), p143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secure"&gt;Sen (1999), p368&lt;/ref&gt; During the rule of [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]] who took control in 780, the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the [[Kaveri River]] and [[Central India]].&lt;ref name="kon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abdication"&gt;Desai and Aiyar in Kamath (2001), p75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abd"&gt;Reu (1933), p62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panindia"&gt;Sen (1999), p370&lt;/ref&gt; He led successful expeditions to Kannauj, the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Gurjara [[Pratihara]]s and the [[Pala Empire|Palas]] of Bengal, gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory. He also brought the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] and [[Gangas]] of [[Talakad]] under his control.&lt;ref name="kon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="effectively"&gt;The Rashtrakutas interfered effectively in the politics of Kannauj (Thapar 2003), p333&lt;/ref&gt; According to Altekar and Sen, the Rashtrakutas became a pan-India power during his rule.&lt;ref name="panindia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All-India"&gt;From the Karda inscription, a ''digvijaya'' (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p75)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===

The ascent of Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, [[Govinda III]], to the throne heralded an era of success like never before.&lt;ref name="era"&gt;The ablest of the Rashtrakuta kings (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p77)&lt;/ref&gt; There is uncertainty about the location of the early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time.&lt;ref name="earlycapital"&gt;Modern Morkhandi ([[Mayurkhandi]] in [[Bidar district]] (Kamath 2001, p76)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlycapital1"&gt;modern Morkhand in Maharashtra (Reu 1933, p65)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlycapital2"&gt;Sooloobunjun near Ellora (Couseris in Altekar 1934, p48). Perhaps Elichpur remained the capital until Amoghavarsha I built Manyakheta. From the Wani-Dmdori, Radhanpur and Kadba plates, Morkhand in Maharashtra was only a military encampment, from the Dhulia and Pimpen plates it seems Nasik was only a seat of a viceroy, and the Paithan plates of Govinda III indicate that neither Latur nor Paithan was the early capital.(Altekar, 1934, pp47–48)&lt;/ref&gt; During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] Emperor [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]],&lt;ref name="kon" /&gt; the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the [[Ganges]].&lt;ref name="icy"&gt;Kamath 2001, MCC, p76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Himalayas"&gt;From the Sanjan inscriptions, {{cite web|title=The Rashrakutas|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/rashtrakutas/|author=Dr. Jyotsna Kamat|publisher=1996–2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His military exploits have been compared to those of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Arjuna]] of [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref name="arjuna"&gt;Keay (2000), p199&lt;/ref&gt; Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala ([[Kosala|Kaushal]]), [[Mysore|Gangavadi]], humbled the [[Pallavas]] of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in [[Vengi]] and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the [[Pandyas]] and the Cheras all paid him tribute.&lt;ref name="kerela"&gt;From the Nesari records (Kamath 2001, p76)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kerela1"&gt;Reu (1933), p65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;Sastri (1955), p144&lt;/ref&gt; As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar.&lt;ref name="arjuna" /&gt; The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from [[Cape Comorin]] to [[Kannauj]] and from [[Banaras]] to [[Bharuch]].&lt;ref name="hima"&gt;"The victorious march of his armies had literally embraced all the territory between the Himalayas and Cape Comorin" (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p77)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lord"&gt;Sen (1999), p371&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor of Govinda III, [[Amoghavarsha I]] made [[Manyakheta]] his capital and ruled a large empire. Manyakheta remained the Rashtrakutas' regal capital until the end of the empire.&lt;ref name="newcapital"&gt;Which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newcapital1"&gt;A capital city built to excel that of [[Indra]] (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newcapital2"&gt;Reu 1933, p71&lt;/ref&gt; He came to the throne in 814 but it was not until 821 that he had suppressed revolts from [[Feudatory|feudatories]] and ministers. Amoghavarsha I made peace with the [[Western Ganga dynasty]] by giving them his two daughters in marriage, and then defeated the invading [[Eastern Chalukyas]] at Vingavalli and assumed the title ''Viranarayana''.&lt;ref name="vira"&gt;from the Cambay and Sangli records. The Bagumra record claims that Amoghavarsha saved the "Ratta" kingdom which was drowned in a "ocean of Chalukyas" (Kamath 2001, p78)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vinga"&gt;Sastri (1955), p145&lt;/ref&gt; His rule was not as militant as that of Govinda III as he preferred to maintain friendly relations with his neighbours, the Gangas, the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pallavas with whom he also cultivated marital ties. His era was an enriching one for the arts, literature and religion. Widely seen as the most famous of the Rashtrakuta Emperors, [[Amoghavarsha I]] was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="scholar"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetoric" /&gt; His ''Kavirajamarga'' is considered an important landmark in Kannada poetics and ''Prashnottara Ratnamalika'' in Sanskrit is a writing of high merit and was later translated into the Tibetan language.&lt;ref name="rhetoric1"&gt;Reu (1933), p38&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to the emperor [[Ashoka]] and called "Ashoka of the South".&lt;ref name="Ashoka"&gt;Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p80&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of [[Krishna II]], the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size decreased to the area including most of the Western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and Gujarat.&lt;ref name="reduce"&gt;Sastri (1955), p161&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta. [[Indra III]] recovered the dynasty's fortunes in central India by defeating the Paramara and then invaded the [[doab]] region of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna River|Jamuna]] rivers. He also defeated the dynasty's traditional enemies, the Pratiharas and the Palas, while maintaining his influence over [[Vengi]].&lt;ref name="reduce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pala"&gt;From the writings of [[Adikavi Pampa]] (Kamath 2001, p81)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="regain"&gt;Sen (1999), pp373-374&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor [[Govinda IV]].&lt;ref name="control"&gt;Kamath (2001), p82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="control1"&gt;The Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta gained control over Kannauj for a brief period during the early 10th century (Thapar 2003, p333)&lt;/ref&gt; After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories in the north and east, [[Krishna III]] the last great ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the [[Narmada River]] to [[Kaveri River]] and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.&lt;ref name="kanchi"&gt;From the Siddalingamadam record of 944 – Krishna III captured Kanchi and Tanjore as well and had full control over northern Tamil regions (Aiyer in Kamath 2001, pp82–83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi11"&gt;From the Tirukkalukkunram inscription – Kanchi and Tanjore were annexed by Krishna III.

===Decline===

In 972 A.D.,&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=Satish|title=History of Medieval India|date=2009|publisher=Orient Blackswan Private Limited|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-250-3226-7|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the rule of [[Khottiga Amoghavarsha]], the [[Paramara]] King [[Siyaka]] Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta, the capital of the Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall.&lt;ref name="Amoghavarsha IV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoghavarsha IV|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050671/Manyakheta|publisher=2007 Encyclopædia Britannica|work=|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decline was sudden as [[Tailapa II]], a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur district]], declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat.&lt;ref name="Tailapa"&gt;The province of Tardavadi in the very heart of the Rashtrakuta empire was given to Tailapa II as a ''fief'' (provincial grant) by Rashtrakuta [[Krishna III]] for services rendered in war (Sastri 1955, p162)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tailapa1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p101&lt;/ref&gt; Indra IV, the last emperor, committed [[Sallekhana]] (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at [[Shravanabelagola]]. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The [[Western Chalukyas]] annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the [[Krishna River]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Godavari River]] doab called [[Vengi]]. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.&lt;ref name="yadgir"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp100–103&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, the rise of Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] had a great impact on India, even on India's north. Sulaiman (851), [[Al-Masudi|Al Masudi]] (944) and Ibn Khurdadba (912) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world.&lt;ref name="contemp"&gt;Reu (1933), p39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reded"&gt;Keay (2000), p200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imperial"&gt;Kamath (2001), p94&lt;/ref&gt; According to the travelogues of the Arabs Al Masudi and Ibn Khordidbih of the 10th century, "most of the kings of Hindustan turned their faces towards the Rashtrakuta king while they were praying, and they prostrated themselves before his ambassadors. The Rashtrakuta king was known as the "King of kings" (''Rajadhiraja'') who possessed the mightiest of armies and whose domains extended from Konkan to Sind."&lt;ref name="Burjor"&gt;[[Burjor Avari]] (2007), ''India: The Ancient Past:''
A History of the Indian Sub-Continent from c. 7000 BC to AD 1200'', pp.207–208, Routledge, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-415-35615-2}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have called these times an "Age of Imperial Kannauj". Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj, levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India, the era could also be called the "Age of Imperial Karnataka".&lt;ref name="Imperial" /&gt; During their political expansion into central and northern India in the 8th to the 10th centuries, the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after its fall or came to power much later. Well-known among these were the Rashtrakutas of [[Gujarat]] (757–888),&lt;ref name="guj"&gt;Reu (1933), p93&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ratta dynasty|Rattas]] of [[Saundatti]] (875–1230) in modern Karnataka,&lt;ref name="kar"&gt;Reu (1933), p100&lt;/ref&gt; the Gahadavalas of Kannauj (1068–1223),&lt;ref name="gaha"&gt;Reu (1933), p113&lt;/ref&gt; the Rashtrakutas of [[Rajasthan]] (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893–996),&lt;ref name="has"&gt;Reu (1933), p110&lt;/ref&gt; Dahal (near [[Jabalpur]]),&lt;ref name="Dah"&gt;Jain (2001), pp67–75&lt;/ref&gt; Mandore (near [[Jodhpur]]), the [[Rathore]]s of Dhanop,&lt;ref name="dhan"&gt;Reu (1933), p112&lt;/ref&gt; Rashtraudha dynasty of Mayuragiri in modern Maharashtra&lt;ref name="mayur"&gt;De Bruyne (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.&lt;ref name="kannau"&gt;Majumdar (1966), pp50–51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajadhiraja Chola]]'s conquest of the island of Ceylon in the early 11th century CE led to the fall of four kings there. According to historian K. Pillay, one of them, King Madavarajah of the [[Jaffna kingdom]], was an usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pillay|first1=K. |year=1963 |title=South India and Ceylon |journal=|publisher=[[University of Madras]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url= |oclc=250247191|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
{{Karnataka History}}
Inscriptions and other literary records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected the crown prince based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (''Mahasandhivigrahi'') whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called ''Panchamahashabdas''. Under him was the commander (''Dandanayaka''), the foreign minister (''Mahakshapataladhikrita'') and a prime minister (''Mahamatya'' or ''Purnamathya''), all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;whose main responsibility was to draft and maintain inscriptions or ''Shasanas'' as would an archivist. (Altekar in Kamath (2001), p85&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Mahasamantha'' was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (''Rajneeti'') and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of [[Amoghavarsha I]], administered Edathore ''Vishaya''.

The kingdom was divided into ''Mandala'' or ''Rashtras'' (provinces). A ''Rashtra'' was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on occasion was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen ''Rashtras''. Under a ''Rashtra'' was a ''Vishaya'' (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a ''Rashtra''. For example, Bankesha, a commander of [[Amoghavarsha I]] headed [[Banavasi]]-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the ''Vishaya'' was the ''Nadu'' looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a ''Grama'' or village administered by a ''Gramapathi'' or ''Prabhu Gavunda''.&lt;ref name="mandala"&gt;Kamath (2001), p86&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rashtrakuta army consisted of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment (''Sthirabhuta Kataka'') in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;From the notes of Al Masudi (Kamath 2001, p88)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rashtrakutas issued coins (minted in an ''Akkashale'') such as ''Suvarna'', ''Drammas'' in silver and gold weighing 65&amp;nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]], ''Kalanju'' weighing 48&amp;nbsp;grains, ''Gadyanaka'' weighing 96&amp;nbsp;grains, ''Kasu'' weighing 15&amp;nbsp;grains, ''Manjati'' with 2.5&amp;nbsp;grains and ''Akkam'' of 1.25&amp;nbsp;grain.&lt;ref name="coins"&gt;Kamath (2001), p88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta}}
[[File:Kasivisvanatha temple at Pattadakal.jpg|thumb|right|Kashivishvanatha temple at [[Pattadakal]], Karnataka]]
The Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, [[Khandesh]] and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, [[Ujjain]], [[Paithan]] and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. [[Muslin]] cloth were manufactured in Paithan and [[Warangal]]. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from [[Bharuch|Bharoch]]. White [[Calico (textile)|calicos]] were manufactured in [[Burhanpur]] and Berar and exported to [[Persia]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="trade"&gt;Altekar (1934), p356&lt;/ref&gt; The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of [[betel]] leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory [[Gangas]], produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of [[Thane|Thana]] and Saimur.&lt;ref name="trade1" /&gt;

The Deccan  was rich in minerals, though its soil was not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains. The copper mines of [[Cudappah]], [[Bellary]], Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, [[Ahmadnagar]], Bijapur and [[Dharwar]] were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy.&lt;ref name="trade2"&gt;Altekar (1934), p355&lt;/ref&gt; Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, [[Kurnool]] and [[Golconda]]; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres. The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra. [[Mysore]] with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry.&lt;ref name="trade3"&gt;From notes of Periplus, Al Idrisi and Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p357)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rashtrakuta empire controlled most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade.&lt;ref name="trade1"&gt;Altekar (1934), p354&lt;/ref&gt; The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time.&lt;ref name="trade4"&gt;Altekar (1934), p358&lt;/ref&gt; The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, [[betel nut]]s, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] wines, tin, lead, [[topaz]], [[storax]], sweet clover, flint glass, [[antimony]], gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants.&lt;ref name="trade5"&gt;Altekar (1934), p358–359&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden ''Gadyanaka'' on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver ''Ctharna'' ( a coin) on vessels travelling locally.&lt;ref name="trade21" /&gt;

Artists and craftsman operated as corporations (guilds) rather than as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A [[Saundatti]] inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region.&lt;ref name="trade7"&gt;Altekar (1934), p368&lt;/ref&gt; Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.&lt;ref name="trade9"&gt;Altekar (1934), p370–371&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's income came from five principal sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories.&lt;ref name="trade10"&gt;Altekar (1934), p223&lt;/ref&gt; An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, such as when it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on [[crown land]], wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors.&lt;ref name="trade11"&gt;Altekar (1934), p213&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, customary presents were given to the king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.&lt;ref name="trade23"&gt;From the Davangere inscription of Santivarma of Banavasi-12000 province (Altekar 1934, p234&lt;/ref&gt;

The king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants.&lt;ref name="trade14"&gt;From the writings of Chandesvara (Altekar 1934, p216)&lt;/ref&gt; The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region.&lt;ref name="trade15" /&gt; The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war.&lt;ref name="trade16"&gt;From the notes of Al Idrisi (Altekar (1934), p223&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted.&lt;ref name="trade18"&gt;From the Begumra plates of Krishna II (Altekar 1934, p227&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.&lt;ref name="trade15"&gt;Altekar (1934), p222&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxes were levied on artisans such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable items such as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%.&lt;ref name="trade21"&gt;Altekar (1934), p230&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active.&lt;ref name="trade26"&gt;Altekar (1934), p242&lt;/ref&gt; The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim.&lt;ref name="trade27"&gt;From the writings of Somadeva (Altekar 1934, p244)&lt;/ref&gt; Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.&lt;ref name="trade22"&gt;From the Hebbal inscriptions and Torkhede inscriptions of Govinda III (Altekar 1934, p232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Ellora-Kailasanatha-5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasanatha Temple]]]]

===Religion===
The Rashtrakuta kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="tole"&gt;"Wide and sympathetic tolerance" in general characterised the Rashtrakuta rule (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p92)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on [[Indian inscriptions|inscriptions]], coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards [[Jainism]] since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and a few in [[Apabhramsha]] and [[Prakrit]] were Jains.&lt;ref name="writer"&gt;Kamath (2001), p92&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in [[Bagalkot district]] and their loyal feudatory, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], built Jain monuments at [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region.&lt;ref name="population"&gt;Altekar in Kamath (2001), p92&lt;/ref&gt; King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain [[acharya]] [[Jinasena]] and wrote in his religious writing, ''Prashnottara Ratnamalika'', "having bowed to Varaddhamana ([[Mahavira]]), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika". The mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]] wrote in his ''Ganita Sarasangraha'', "The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide." Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age.&lt;ref name="grain"&gt;Reu (1933), p36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grain1"&gt;The Vaishnava Rashtrakutas patronised Jainism (Kamath 2001, p92)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized [[Hinduism]]'s followers of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]], [[Vaishnava]] and [[Shaktism|Shakta]] faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god [[Vishnu]] or god [[Shiva]]. The [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]] inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the [[Mahalakshmi Temple (Kolhapur)|Lakshmi temple]] at [[Kolhapur]] to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the ''Hiranyagarbha'' (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and [[Khambhat|Cambay]] plates of King [[Govinda IV]] mention [[Brahmin]]s performing such rituals as ''[[Rajasuya]]'', ''Vajapeya'' and ''Agnishtoma''.&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;Kamath (2001), p91&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[copper plate grant]] of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend ''Parama Maheshwara'' (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as ''Veeranarayana'' showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had the sign of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas.&lt;ref name="ganga"&gt;Reu (1933), p34&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing.&lt;ref name="ritual" /&gt; Their family deity was a goddess by name ''Latana'' (also known as ''Rashtrashyena'', ''Manasa'' ''Vindyavasini'') who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom.&lt;ref name="falcon"&gt;Reu (1933, p34&lt;/ref&gt; They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara ([[Surya]], the sun god).&lt;ref name="writer" /&gt;

In short, the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, [[Jainism]], Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. [[Buddhism]] too found support and was popular in places such as [[Dambal]] and [[Balligavi]], although it had declined significantly by this time.&lt;ref name="buddha"&gt;The Rise and Decline of [[Buddhism]] in India, K.L. Hazara, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1995, pp288–294&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="decrease"&gt;A 16th-century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favourably by Buddhist writers (Thapar 2003, pp 349–350, 397)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic]] contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and [[Arab]] lands. [[Jumu'ah|Jumma]] [[Masjid]]s existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century&lt;ref name="jumma"&gt;From the notes of 10th-century Arab writer Al-Ishtakhri (Sastri 1955, p396)&lt;/ref&gt; and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as [[Kayalpattanam]] and [[Nagore]]. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as [[Mappila]]s (''Moplahs'') and were actively involved in [[horse trading]] and manning shipping fleets.&lt;ref name="jumma1"&gt;From the notes of Masudi (916) (Sastri 1955, p396)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{See also|Society of Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta}}
Chronicles mention more [[caste]]s than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system, some as many as seven castes.&lt;ref name="caste"&gt;From the notes of Magasthenesis and Strabo from Greece and Ibn Khurdadba and Al Idrisi from Arabia (Altekar 1934, p317)&lt;/ref&gt; One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of [[Brahmins]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]] and [[Sudras]].&lt;ref name="caste1"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p317)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Zakaya'' or ''Lahud'' caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics.&lt;ref name="caste3"&gt;Altekar (1934), p318&lt;/ref&gt; People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The ''Antyajas'' caste provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the ''Sat-Kshatriya'' sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.&lt;ref name="caste4"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p324)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caste10"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, pp330–331)&lt;/ref&gt;

The careers of Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and philosophy&lt;ref name="caste6"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni, Altekar (1934) p325&lt;/ref&gt; or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts.&lt;ref name="caste7"&gt;From the notes of Abuzaid (Altekar 1934, p325)&lt;/ref&gt; Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts).&lt;ref name="caste8"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p326)&lt;/ref&gt; Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.&lt;ref name="caste9"&gt;Altekar (1934), p329&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 9th century, kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India.&lt;ref name="caste11"&gt;From the notes of Yuan Chwang, Altekar (1934), p331&lt;/ref&gt; Admitting Kshatriyas to [[Vedic period|Vedic]] schools along with Brahmins was customary, but the children of the Vaishya and [[Shudra]] castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions&lt;ref name="caste12"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p332, p334)&lt;/ref&gt; Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys,&lt;ref name="caste15"&gt;From the notes of Ibn Khurdadba (Altekar 1934, p337)&lt;/ref&gt; but was relatively frequent among other castes.&lt;ref name="caste16"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p337)&lt;/ref&gt; Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided.&lt;ref name="caste17"&gt;From the notes of Al Masudi and Al Idrisi (Altekar 1934, p339)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint families were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even father and son have been recorded in inscriptions.&lt;ref name="caste18"&gt;From the Tarkhede inscription of Govinda III, (Altekar 1934, p339)&lt;/ref&gt; Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women.&lt;ref name="caste19"&gt;Altekar (1934), p341&lt;/ref&gt; The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 years of age and the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes.&lt;ref name="caste20"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p342)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] (a custom in which a dead man's widow would [[Self-immolation|immolate]] herself on her husband's funeral [[pyre]]) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families.&lt;ref name="caste22"&gt;From the notes of Sulaiman and Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p343)&lt;/ref&gt; The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged.&lt;ref name="caste23"&gt;Altekar (1934), p345&lt;/ref&gt; The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.&lt;ref name="caste24"&gt;From the notes of Ibn Khurdadba (Altekar 1934, p346)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth, a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a ''[[dhoti]]'' for the lower part of the body. Only kings could wear [[turban]]s, a practice that spread to the masses much later.&lt;ref name="caste26"&gt;Altekar (1934), p349&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers, both male and female, in the king's palace. [[Devadasi]]s (girls were "married" to a deity or temple) were often present in temples.&lt;ref name="caste27"&gt;Altekar (1934), p350&lt;/ref&gt; Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or different species. The [[Atakur inscription]] ([[hero stone]], ''virgal'') was made for the favourite hound of the feudatory Western Ganga King Butuga II that died fighting a wild boar in a hunt.&lt;ref name="caste29"&gt;Altekar (1934), p351&lt;/ref&gt; There are records of game preserves for hunting by royalty. Astronomy and astrology were well developed as subjects of study,&lt;ref name="caste29" /&gt; and there were many superstitious beliefs such as catching a snake alive proved a woman's chastity. Old persons suffering from incurable diseases preferred to end their lives by drowning in the sacred waters of a pilgrim site or by a ritual burning.&lt;ref name="caste30"&gt;From the notes of Ibn Kurdadba (Altekar 1934, p353)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{See also|Rashtrakuta literature}}
[[File:Jain Narayana temple1 at Pattadakal.jpg|thumb|right|Jain Narayana temple at [[Pattadakal]], [[Karnataka]]]]
[[Kannada language|Kannada]] became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity.&lt;ref name="language2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature2" /&gt; This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain [[Tirthankara|tirthankars]]. Bilingual writers such as [[Asaga]] gained fame,&lt;ref name="asaga"&gt;Warder A.K. (1988), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; and noted scholars such as the [[Mahāvīra (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]] wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I.&lt;ref name="mahavira"&gt;Kamath (2001), p89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ganita"&gt;"Mathematical Achievements of Pre-modern Indian Mathematicians", Putta Swamy T.K., 2012, chapter=Mahavira, p.231, Elsevier Publications, London, {{ISBN|978-0-12-397913-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (850) by King [[Amoghavarsha I]] is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada,&lt;ref name="rhetoric"&gt;Kamath (2001), p90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetoric1" /&gt; though it is evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries.&lt;ref name="amog"&gt;The ''Bedande'' and ''Chattana'' type of composition (Narasimhacharya 1988, p12)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kavirajamarga'' is a guide to poets (''Kavishiksha'') that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as [[Durvinita]], perhaps the 6th-century monarch of [[Western Ganga Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="earlyprose"&gt;It is said ''Kavirajamarga'' may have been co-authored by Amoghavarsha I and court poet Sri Vijaya (Sastri 1955, pp355–356)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlyprose1"&gt;Other early writers mentioned in ''Kavirajamarga'' are Vimala, Udaya, Nagarjuna, Jayabhandu for Kannada prose and Kavisvara, Pandita, Chandra and Lokapala in [[Kannada]] poetry (Narasimhacharya 1988, p2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlyprose2"&gt;Warder A.K. (1988), p240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain writer [[Adikavi Pampa]], widely regarded as one of the most influential [[Kannada]] writers, became famous for ''[[Adipurana]]'' (941). Written in [[champu]] (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first Jain ''tirthankara'' [[Lord Rishabha|Rishabhadeva]]. Pampa's other notable work was ''[[Vikramarjuna Vijaya]]'' (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, [[Mahabharata]], with [[Arjuna]] as the hero.&lt;ref name="bharata"&gt;Sastri (1955), p356&lt;/ref&gt; Also called ''Pampa Bharata'', it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King [[Chalukyas of Vemulavada|Chalukya]] Arikeseri of [[Vemulwada, Karimnagar District|Vemulawada]] (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.&lt;ref name="kanepic"&gt;L.S. Seshagiri Rao in Amaresh Datta (1988), p1180&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable Jain writer in Kannada was [[Sri Ponna]], patronised by King Krishna III and famed for ''Shantipurana'', his account of the life of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain tirthankara. He earned the title ''Ubhaya Kavichakravathi'' (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were ''Bhuvanaika-ramaabhyudaya'', ''Jinaksharamale'' and ''Gatapratyagata''.&lt;ref name="rhetoric" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ubhaya"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988, p18&lt;/ref&gt; Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called "gems of Kannada literature".&lt;ref name="bharata" /&gt;
[[File:kavi file2.jpg|thumb|left|A stanza from the 9th century Kannada classic [[Kavirajamarga]], praising the people for their literary skills]]

Prose works in [[Sanskrit]] was prolific during this era as well.&lt;ref name="Jaina_literature"/&gt; Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]], a native of [[Gulbarga]], who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I.&lt;ref name="mahavira"/&gt; His greatest contribution was ''Ganitasarasangraha'', a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of [[Arikesari II]], a feudatory of Rashtrakuta [[Krishna III]] in [[Vemulwada, Karimnagar District|Vemulavada]]. He was the author of ''Yasastilaka champu'', ''Nitivakyamrita'' and other writings. The main aim of the ''champu'' writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of ''Arthashastra'' from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner.&lt;ref name="artha"&gt;Sastri (1955), p314&lt;/ref&gt; Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called ''Kalyanakaraka''. He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.&lt;ref name="cuisine"&gt;S.K. Ramachandra Rao, (1985), Encyclopedia of Indian Medicine: Historical perspective, pp100-101, Popular Prakashan, Mumbai, {{ISBN|81-7154-255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veg"&gt;Narasimhachar (1988), p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Trivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III. His classics were ''Nalachampu'' (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, ''Damayanti Katha'', ''Madalasachampu'' and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess [[Saraswati]] helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the king's court.&lt;ref name="artha" /&gt; [[Jinasena]] was the spiritual preceptor and [[guru]] of [[Amoghavarsha I]]. A theologian, his contributions are ''Dhavala'' and ''Jayadhavala'' (written with another theologian [[Virasena]]). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were ''Adipurana,'' later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, ''Harivamsha'' and ''Parshvabhyudaya''.&lt;ref name="mahavira"/&gt;

===Architecture===
{{further|Ellora Caves}}
[[File:Kailasha temple at ellora.JPG|thumb|Kailasanath Temple at Ellora, Maharashtra]]
The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga.&lt;ref name="hardy1"&gt;Hardy (1995), p111&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day [[Maharashtra]]. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show [[Pandyan]] influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.&lt;ref name="rockcut"&gt;{{cite book

The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at [[Ellora]] ascribed to his period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent|url=http://www.indoarch.org/place.php?placelink=R%3D4%2BS%3D15%2BP%3D180%2BM%3D962|author=Takeo Kamiya|publisher=Gerard da Cunha-Architecture Autonomous, India|work=|accessdate=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at [[Ellora]] is their creation of the monolithic [[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasanath Temple]], a splendid achievement confirming the "Balhara" status as "one among the four principal Kings of the world".&lt;ref name="reded" /&gt; The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including [[Ravana]], [[Shiva]] and [[Parvathi]] while the ceilings have paintings.

The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is ''Karnata Dravida'' according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the ''Shikharas'' common to the ''Nagara'' style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at [[Pattadakal]] in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="Dravidian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent,20 September 1996 |url=http://www.indoarch.org/place.php?placelink=R%3D4%2BS%3D15%2BP%3D180%2BM%3D0|author=Takeo Kamiya|publisher=Gerard da Cunha-Architecture Autonomous, Bardez, Goa, India|work=|accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy2"&gt;Hardy (1995), p327&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world.&lt;ref name="Freak"&gt;Vincent Smith in {{cite web|title=Society, Religion and Economic condition in the period of Rashtrakutas|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998–2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095148/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.&lt;ref name="rocky"&gt;Percy Brown and James Fergusson in {{cite web|title=Society, Religion and Economic condition in the period of Rashtrakutas|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998–2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095148/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kuknur Navalinga temples.JPG|thumb|left|Dravidian style architecture.

===Language===
[[File:Old Kannada inscription in the mantapa of Navalinga temple at Kuknur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|9th century ''[[Old Kannada]]'' inscription at Navalinga temple in [[Kuknur]], Karnataka]]
With the ending of the [[Gupta Dynasty]] in northern India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of [[Tamilakam]]) interfaced between the increasing use of the local [[Kannada language]] and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="language1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="houb"/&gt; Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;Thapar (2002), pp393–4&lt;/ref&gt; The local language formed the ''desi'' (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more ''marga'' (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (''ghatikas'') taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the [[devotional movements]] of later centuries.&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;Thapar (2002), p396&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;Vaidya (1924), p170&lt;/ref&gt; Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the [[Kaveri River]] and the [[Godavari River]] as "[[Kannada]] country".&lt;ref name="country"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god1"&gt;Rice, E.P. (1921), p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god2"&gt;Rice, B.L. (1897), p497&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of [[Veda]], ''Vyakarana'' (grammar), ''Jyotisha'' (astronomy and astrology), ''Sahitya'' (literature), ''Mimansa'' (Exegesis), ''Dharmashastra'' (law), ''Puranas'' (ritual), and ''Nyaya'' (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the ''[[Kavya]]'' (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="defect"&gt;Altekar (1934), p404&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription in Kannada by King [[Krishna III]], written in a poetic Kanda metre, has been found as far away as [[Jabalpur]] in modern [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="language" /&gt; Kavirajamarga, a work on poetics in Kannada by [[Amoghavarsha I]], shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time. Trivikrama's Sanskrit writing, ''Nalachampu'', is perhaps the earliest in the ''champu'' style from the Deccan.&lt;ref name="vikram"&gt;Altekar (1934), p408&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|la|'''Refugium Peccatorum'''}} meaning '''Refuge of Sinners''' is a [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Titles of Mary|title]] for the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Its use goes back to [[Germanus I of Constantinople|Saint Germanus of Constantinople]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Alphonsus Liguori, ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', Liguori Publications, 1868 , {{ISBN|0-7648-0664-5}} page 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic tradition==
In the Roman Catholic tradition, [[Eve#Christianity|Eve]] is viewed as being responsible for the sufferings of humans since their [[Fall of man|fall and expulsion from paradise]] while the Virgin Mary is viewed as the source of all healing. She is the new Eve, who cannot eliminate the damage created by Eve, but limit it. Her fullness of grace, her position among the disciples of Christ and her title as [[Mother of God]] are seen as assurances that the Virgin Mary is a powerful intercessor.&lt;ref&gt;Lauretanische Litanai, in Marienlexikon. Eos St.Ottilien, 1988, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer===
Refugium Peccatorum is one part of four Marian advocations in the [[Litany of Loreto]], the others being ''Salus Infirmorum'' (healer of the sick) ''Consolatrix Afflictorum'' (consoler of the sad) and ''Auxilium Christianorum'' (help of Christians). Each advocation extolling Mary’s role as advocate for spiritual and corporeal mercy has a rich history, but in general, the notion of asking the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] for help in temporal needs dates back to Saints [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Ambrose of Milan]].

===Community===
The Archconfraternity of the ''Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners'' was established at [[Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Paris|Notre-Dame-des-Victoires]] in the 19th century, and spread throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07168a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
{{Further|Madonna (art)}}
The 18th century [[Jesuit]] preacher [[Antonio Baldinucci]] had a particular devotion to the Refugium Peccatorum image of Virgin Mary in the [[Church of the Gesu (Frascati)]] in Italy and commissioned a copy which he considered miraculous and carried it with him in his travels. The Jesuits spread copies of the image of the ''Madonna of Refuge'' in Mexico by the 19th century, and it began to be depicted in missions there, often with clouds surrounding the lower portion of the image of the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''The art and architecture of the Texas missions'' by Jacinto Quirarte 2002 {{ISBN|0-292-76902-4}} page 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In some 19th-century images, biblical scenes are included below the image of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], e.g. Peter's visions as well as the depiction of a safe harbor (Psalm 108:30).&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/prayers/refugiumpeccatorum.html University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Refugium peccatorum" is also used other works of [[Roman Catholic Marian art]]. For instance, there is a marble statue representing the Virgin Mary, on the grand staircase of the old municipal palace in [[Venice, Italy]]. The name came from the fact that the convicts were allowed to stop in front of the Virgin Mary’s statue to pray for their soul on the way to the scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sbmp.provincia.venezia.it/mir/english/musei/chioggia/chio16.htm |title=Statue in Venice |author= |date= |work= |publisher=sbmp.provincia.venezia.it |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast==
The traditional feast day of Our Lady, Refuge of Sinners is August 13. In [[Mexico]], the feast day is observed on July 4. She is the patroness of [[California]], where the (arch)dioceses there celebrate the feast on July 5.

==Apparitions==
[[Our Lady of Laus]], which the Vatican approved in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_recognizes_marian_apparitions_in_france/ CNA: Vatican recognizes Marian apparitions in France]&lt;/ref&gt; is named Refuge of Sinners because she asked for the conversion of sinners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_recognizes_marian_apparitions_in_france/ CNA: Vatican recognizes Marian apparitions in France]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Forgiveness|}}
{{Teshuva}}
Repentance ({{lang-he-n|תשובה}}, literally, "return", pronounced "tshuva" or "teshuva") is one element of [[atonement in Judaism|atoning]] for [[Jewish views on sin|sin]] in [[Judaism]]. Judaism recognizes that everybody sins on occasion, but that people can stop or minimize those occasions in the future by repenting for past transgressions. Thus, the primary purpose of repentance in Judaism is ethical self transformation.&lt;ref name="Telushkin"&gt;Telushkin, Joseph. ''A Code of Jewish Ethics: Volume 1 - You Shall Be Holy''. New York: Bell Tower, 2006. p. 152-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish penitent is traditionally known as a ''[[baal teshuva]]'' (''lit.'', "master of repentance" or "master of return") ({{lang-he-n|בעל תשובה}}; for a woman: {{Hebrew|בעלת תשובה}}, ''baalat teshuva''; plural: {{Hebrew|בעלי תשובה}}, ''baalei teshuva''). An alternative modern term is ''hozer beteshuva'' ({{Hebrew|חוזר בתשובה}}) (''lit.'', "returning in repentance"). "In a place where ''baalei teshuva'' stand", according to [[halakha]], "even the full-fledged righteous do not stand."&lt;ref&gt;''Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot'' 34b. Editor-in-chief, Tzvi Hersh Weinreb. 
 Koren Publishers Jerusalem, 2012. See commentary by Adin Evan-Israel Steinsaltz on p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repentance and creation==
According to the [[Talmud]], [[God in Judaism|God]] [[Genesis creation narrative|created]] repentance before He created the [[physical universe]], making it among the first things created. (''[[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]]'' 39b).&lt;ref name="Scherman"&gt;[[Nosson Scherman|Scherman, Nosson]]. "An Overview - Day of Atonement and Purity." An Overview. ''The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Yom Kippur''. By Scherman. Trans. Scherman. Brooklyn, NY: Mesorah Publications, 2008. XIV-XXII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==When to repent==
One should repent immediately. A parable is told in the Talmud (''Shabbat'' 153a) that [[Rabbi Eliezer]] taught his disciples, "Repent one day before your death." The disciples politely questioned whether one can know the day of one's death, so Rabbi Eliezer answered, "All the more reason, therefore, to repent today, lest one die tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Telushkin, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Judaism's understanding of the annual process of [[Divine Judgment]], Jews believe that God is especially open to repentance during period from the beginning of the month of [[Ellul]] through the [[High Holidays|High Holiday season]], i. e., [[Rosh HaShanah]] (the Day of Judgement), [[Ten Days of Repentance|Aseret Yimei Teshuva]] (the Ten Days of Repentance), [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement), and, according to [[Kaballah]], [[Hoshana Rabbah]]. Another good time to repent is toward the end of one's life.&lt;ref name="Telushkin" /&gt;

==How to repent==
Numerous guides to the repentance process can be found in rabbinical literature. See especially [[Maimonides]]' ''Rules of Repentance'' in the [[Mishneh Torah]].

According to ''Gates of Repentance'', a standard work of [[Jewish ethics]] written by [[Yonah Gerondi|Rabbenu Yonah of Gerona]], a sinner repents by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Yonah Gerondi|Yonah Ben Avraham of Gerona]]. ''Shaarei Teshuva: The Gates of Repentance''. Trans. [[Shraga Silverstein]]. Jerusalem, Israel: Feldheim Publishers, 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

* regretting/acknowledging the sin;
* forsaking the sin (see below);
* worrying about the future consequences of the sin;
* acting and speaking with humility;
* acting in a way opposite to that of the sin (for example, for the sin of lying, one should speak the truth);
* understanding the magnitude of the sin;
* refraining from lesser sins for the purpose of safeguarding oneself against committing greater sins;
* [[Viduy|confessing the sin]];
* [[Jewish prayer|praying]] for atonement;
* correcting the sin however possible (for example, if one stole an object, the stolen item must be returned; or, if one slanders another, the slanderer must ask the injured party for forgiveness);
* pursuing works of ''[[chesed]]'' and truth;
* remembering the sin for the rest of one's life;
* refraining from committing the same sin if the opportunity presents itself again;
* teaching others not to sin.

===Forsaking the sin===

The second of Rabbenu Yonah's "Principles of Repentance" is "forsaking the sin" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: עזיבת–החטא, ''azivat-hachet''). After regretting the sin (Rabbenu Yonah's first principle), the penitent must resolve never to repeat the sin.&lt;ref&gt;Yonah, 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; However, Judaism recognizes that the process of repentance varies from penitent to penitent and from sin to sin. For example, a non-habitual sinner often feels the sting of the sin more acutely than the habitual sinner. Therefore, a non-habitual sinner will have an easier time repenting, because he or she will be less likely to repeat the sinful behavior.&lt;ref name="Scherman" /&gt;

The case of the habitual sinner is more complex. If the habitual sinner regrets his or her sin at all, that regret alone clearly does not translate into a change in behavior. In such a case, Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] recommends devising "a personal system of reward and punishment" and to avoid circumstances which may cause temptation toward the relevant sin.&lt;ref name="Scherman" /&gt; [[Rabbi Judah]] taught, "Who is the penitent whose repentance ascends until the Throne of Glory? — one who is tested and emerges guiltless" (''[[Yoma]]'' 86b).&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Yonah, 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] interpreted this statement to mean that the sign of a true penitent is one who commits a sin and is later given the opportunity to commit exactly the same sin, yet one chooses not to ("Laws of Repentance" 2:1).&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Telushkin, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal sacrifice and later substitutions==
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Herod's Temple]], as imagined in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]]. It is currently situated adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]
When the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was active, a Jew was required to bring various [[korban|sacrifices]] for certain types of sins, and to perform a version of the ''[[viduy]]'' confession ritual as part of the sacrificial ritual. Yet, even when the Holy Temple still stood, the mere act of bringing an offering never automatically caused God to forgive someone for their sins. The Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) teaches:

*"In sacrifice and offering, you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required." (Psalms 40:6)
*"For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise." (Psalms 51:16-17)
*"For I desire steadfast love, and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God, rather than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6)
*"Take with you words and return to the LORD; say to him, 'Take away all iniquity; accept what is good, and we will pay with bulls the vows of our lips.'" (Hosea 14:2)

Many places [[Rabbinic literature]] emphasizes that performing charitable deeds, praying, and studying Torah are more meritorious than animal sacrifice, and that the former can replace animal sacrifice when the Temple is not active:

*"Rabbi [[Yochanan ben Zakkai]] was walking with ... [[Rabbi Yehoshua]], ... after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Yehoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said, ' ... The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!' Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort: '... We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of [[chesed|loving-kindness]].'" ([[Midrash]] [[Avot of Rabbi Natan|Avot D'Rabbi Nathan]] 4:5)
*"[[Rabbi Elazar]] said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: 'Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice' ({{bibleverse-lb||Proverbs|21:3|HE}})." (Babylonian Talmud, [[Sukkah (Talmud)|Sukkah]] 49)
*"Rabbi Shmuel bar Nahmani said: The Holy One Said to David: 'Solomon, your Son is building the Temple. Is this not for the purpose of offering sacrifices there? The justice and righteousness of your actions are more precious to me than sacrifices.' And how do we know this? 'To do what is right and just is more desirable to Adonai than sacrifice.' (Proverbs 21:3)" (Talmud Yerushalmi, B'rakhot 2.1)
*"One who does ''teshuvah'' is considered as if he went to Jerusalem, rebuilt the Temple, erected the altar, and offered all the sacrifices ordained by the Torah. [For the Psalm says], 'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise [51:19]'" ([[Leviticus Rabbah]] 7:2 (Midrash))
*"Rava said: Whoever studies Torah does not need [to sacrifice offerings] (Menahot 110a) ... Said God: In this world, a sacrifice effected their atonement, but in the World to Come, I will forgive your sins without a sacrifice." ([[Midrash]] Tanhuma Shemini, paragraph 10)
*"Even if a man has sinned his whole life, and repents on the day of his death, all his sins are forgiven him" (Maimonides, Yad, Teshuvah 2:1)

'''Rick Sanchez''' is one of the [[title characters]] from the [[Adult Swim]] [[animated television series]] ''[[Rick and Morty]]''. Created by [[Justin Roiland]] and [[Dan Harmon]], Sanchez is a genius [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[alcoholic]] scientist inspired by [[Emmett Brown|Emmett "Doc" Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]''. Known for his reckless, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] behavior and his rude, [[pessimism|pessimistic]] personality, the character has been well received. He is a [[mad scientist]] who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been proven wrong.

He is formally referred to as '''Rick Sanchez C-137''' (alias: "'''Terror Rick'''") by [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Alternate-universe_versions_of_the_main_characters|the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]], in reference to his original universe, "C-137", and penchant for instigating wars with inter-galactic empires. Both Rick and Morty are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty'' comic series]] follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most issues of subsequent instalments follow the Rick and Morty of "C-137"; the video game ''Pocket Mortys'' follows the Rick and Morty of C-123.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whalen|first1=Andrew|title=‘Pocket Mortys’ Is Out Now, But It’s Not Rick and Morty From The Show|url=http://www.player.one/pocket-mortys-out-now-its-not-rick-and-morty-show-503621|website=Player One|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Rick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137 is the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of Morty and Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He frequently travels on adventures through space and other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foxgist.com/2017/08/29/rick-and-morty-season-3-episode-6-review-toxin-toxic-toxicity/ |title=Rick And Morty Season 3 Episode 6 Review: Toxin Toxic Toxicity |last=Edim |first=Odiso  |date=29 August 2017 |website=FoxGist |access-date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick is portrayed as a [[mad scientist]]; utilizing his mathematical and scientific prowess in conjunction with apathy and egotistical cynicism, he emerges safely from any situation, regardless of the consequences of his self-preservation. Rick also, in some episodes, desperately tries to regain his family after losing their trust. The creators wanted him to look like he was in control strategically, but not at all when it came to personal matters.

In "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. In the episode, the inhabitants cease to provide Rick's car with energy. This is because a scientist from the microverse, resembling Rick in many ways, has created his own miniature universe to supply energy for the beings of his universe. Rick destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing everyone inside. He does not demonstrate remorse for his actions, and instead shows satisfaction. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he would toss them out and create a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=364&amp;t=20185|title=02x06 - The Ricks Must Be Crazy - Rick and Morty Transcripts - Forever Dreaming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode "[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Something Ricked This Way Comes]]", where he outsmarts [[Satan]].

Rick reveals his disdain for love in the episode "[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]", in which he claims that it is "a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed".&lt;ref name=odysseyquotes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rick-and-morty-top-10|title=Top 10 Rick And Morty Quotes|author=Dominick LaGrotta|date=25 January 2016|website=[[Odyssey (publication)|The Odyssey Online]]|access-date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family members, they abandon their original [[dimension]], Dimension C-137 (and their family in that dimension), for [[Multiverse|a new one]]. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension.

In the episode "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", after numerous Ricks in alternate dimensions are murdered, the [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]] accuses Rick C-137 and orders for him to be arrested. Rick C-137 finds himself captured by an [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|"evil" Rick]], but is saved by a legion of alternate-dimension Mortys led by Morty C-137.

In the first episode of the [[Rick and Morty (season 2)|second season]], "[[A Rickle in Time]]", Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty but saves his own life when he realizes that doing so is possible. In the episode "[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Get Schwifty]]", it is revealed that Rick was once in a [[Rock music|rock]] band called the Flesh Curtains, alongside [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Birdperson]] and [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Squanchy]]. In the episode "[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Big Trouble in Little Sanchez]]", Rick [[Mind uploading|transfers his consciousness]] into a younger [[Human cloning|clone]] of himself, whom he calls "Tiny Rick". He soon becomes anguished in his new body, and manages to return to his older true form, and murders a line of other clones he produced. In the second season's finale, "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]", Rick and his family attend Birdperson's wedding, where Birdperson is betrayed and killed by his bride Tammy, a double agent for the Galactic Federation. The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick's status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a [[Penal colony|prison planet]] under the charges of having committed "everything". But in the season three premiere "The Rickshank Redemption", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation's supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out.

The premiere episode of the series' third season, "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]" shows a possible origin for Rick, in which he was a well-meaning scientist who loved his wife Diane and daughter Beth, but had an encounter with a member of the Council of Ricks during his initial testing of a prototype portal gun, who offered him the secret to creating his inter-dimensional portal gun and joining the Council of Ricks. Shortly after his refusal, and his pledge to quit science forever, a bomb was sent through a portal, killing Diane and Beth. Rick claims that this was a fake memory he created in order to trick his interrogator into implanting a virus into the mind-reading device he was attached to, allowing him to hijack his body and escape from the Federation prison. At the end of the episode, Rick again insists, in a rant to Morty, that the death of his wife and daughter was a fake memory, though this may be simply him denying the truth to hide his feelings.

Rick's [[catchphrase]] is "Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub", first introduced in the episode "[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]". In Birdperson's native language, the catchphrase translates to "I am in great pain. Please help me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisecrack.co/shows/wisecrackedition/the-philosophy-of-rick-and-morty/|title=The Philosophy of Rick and Morty|location=Wisecrack|author=Alec Opperman|date=19 December 2015|access-date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/rick-and-morty-recap-ricksy-business-1563309267|title=Rick and Morty Recap - "Ricksy Business"|location=Observation Deck|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=15 April 2014|access-date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality== 
Rick is a sociopathic, emotionally abusive, dismissive, narcissistic, self-centered, incredibly intelligent and alcoholic [[mad scientist]] who often drags his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, and sometimes other members of his family on dangerous adventures. His intelligence makes him believe that existence is miserable and pointless, largely due to his knowledge of infinite universes and timelines with endless possibilities. However, he has proven to be quite wrong on several occasions, even by his more naive grandson. While he has shown signs of loving his family and caring deeply about his best friend Birdperson, he has also been shown to be very self-centered, emotionally abusive and willing to threaten, harm or kill on a whim to get his own way. He does not fear to speak his mind and give his harsh opinions of the things about his family that easily irritate him. His huge ego and reckless, ethically questionable behaviour often lead to him making enemies and getting himself and his family in trouble.

In the pilot, Rick is revealed to be an [[Atheism|atheist]], as he tells Summer that "there is no God."&lt;ref name="Handlen Pilot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title=Rick And Morty: "Pilot"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/rick-and-morty-201108|website=The A.V.

Rick has been stated to be pansexual by Justin Roiland, one of the show's creators and executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/10/rick-and-morty-comic-con-adult-swim-second-season|title=Rick and Morty at Comic Con: Adult Swim cult favorite is back and in-joking|first=Sam|last=Thielman|date=10 July 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shown in "Auto Erotic Assimilation", when Rick connects with Unity, an ex-lover who is a collective hive mind of assimilated individuals from the planet they occupy. Throughout the series, Rick's sexuality has also been heavily hinted at, mostly in his backstory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=Auto Erotic Assimilation | series=[[Rick and Morty]] | credits=Written by Ryan Ridley | network=Adult Swim | airdate=9 August 2015 | season=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The character was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, who first met at [[Channel 101]] in the early 2000s. In 2006, Roiland created ''The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti'', an animated short parodying the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' characters [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] and [[Marty McFly]], and the precursor to ''Rick and Morty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://splitsider.com/2013/11/dan-harmons-rick-and-morty-premieres-on-adult-swim-on-dec-2/ | title=Dan Harmon's ''Rick and Morty'' Premieres on Adult Swim on Dec. 2 | publisher=The Awl | work=Splitsider | date=12 November 2013 | access-date=7 January 2017 | last= Czajkowski| first=Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for ''Rick and Morty'', in the form of ''Doc and Mharti'' was brought up to [[Adult Swim]], and the ideas for a family element and Rick being a grandfather to Morty were developed.&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite news|first= Fred |last= Topel|date=2 December 2013|title=Exclusive Interview: Dan Harmon &amp; Justin Roiland on ‘Rick and Morty' |publisher= [[CraveOnline]] |url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/interviews/612291-exclusive-interview-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-rick-and-morty| access-date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a "horrible Doc Brown manic impression".&lt;ref name=crave /&gt;

== Reception ==

The character has received positive reception. Speaking of Rick's relatability and likability, Dan Harmon stated that "we’ve all been Rick. But Rick really does have bigger fish to fry than anybody. He understands everything better than us. So you give him the right to be jaded and dismissive and narcissistic and sociopathic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/theres-one-secret-rick-and-morty-guys-will-never-r-222269|title=There’s one secret the Rick And Morty guys will never reveal|author=Erik Adams|date=23 July 2015|publisher=''[[The A.V.

David Sims of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted Rick's "bitter amorality" and called the character "a genius who comfortably thinks of himself as the universe's cleverest man and is grounded only by his empathy toward other people, which he tries to suppress as much as possible", therefore writing that Rick's selflessness at the end of the episode "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]" is "the most surprising twist possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/rick-and-mortys-biggest-twist/409036/|title=Rick and Morty’s Biggest Twist: It Has a Heart|author=David Sims|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=5 October 2015|access-date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that "[Rick] slowly realizing that he loved his grandkids and his daughter (and tolerated his son-in-law) no matter how many times he swore at them helped to give the character some necessary depth", and that "behind all the catchphrases and the crazed energy ... There's something dead and sad and fucked up in the guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/one-wedding-and-lot-funerals-rick-and-mortys-seaso-226299|title=One wedding and a lot of funerals on Rick And Morty’s season finale|author=Zack Handlen|date=5 October 2015|publisher=''[[The A.V.

In the first episode of the third season, "The Rickshank Redemption", Rick shows a significant interest in Szechuan sauce and insists that his motivation in life is "finding that McNugget sauce" caused a public interest in having the sauce be reinstated on the McDonald's menu, with some fans attempting to recreate the sauce themselves.&lt;ref name=usatodaysauce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/04/mcdonalds-listens-rick-and-morty-fans-who-want-szechuan-sauce-back/100045828/|title=McDonald's listens to 'Rick and Morty' fans who want the Szechuan sauce back|author=Carly Mallenbaum|date=4 April 2017|website=[[USA Today]]|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/why-is-everyone-talking-about-szechuan-sauce-rick-morty-is-why-and-mcdonalds-might-bring-it-back/|title=Why is everyone talking about Szechuan sauce?

'''Sasha''' and '''Zamani''' are two aspects of time as expressed in some Eastern and Central African cultures.{{Which|date=February 2012}}  Sasha are spirits known by someone still alive, while Zamani are spirits not known by anyone currently alive. Sasha are concerned with, and are expressed as, the present time, the recent past, and the near future; while Zamani is the limitless past. Potential time is the third part of the space-time continuum in African Thought. People must learn from the past to act wisely in the present to create a good future.

== Description ==
According to [[James Loewen]] in his book ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]'':   ''The recently departed whose time overlapped with people still here are the Sasha, the living dead. They are not wholly dead, for they live on in the memories of the living ... when the last person knowing an ancestor dies, that ancestor leaves the Sasha for the Zamani, the dead.  As generalized ancestors, the Zamani are not forgotten but revered.''&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L.K. [http://www.bu.edu/prc/6months/6monthsessay.htm 6 Month Essay], Curator, Photographic Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt;  Loewen cites and paraphrases the explanation from ''African Religions and Philosophy'' by [[John Mbiti]]. Sasha and Zamani are not stages of ''death''. They are the two [[ontological]] stages (or dimensions) of ''history'' in [[Swahili culture]].

In Swahili, the two time dimensions are called sasa and zamani. Both have quality and quantity. People speak of them as big, small, little, short, long, etc. in relation to a particular event. Sasha refers to the events that have just taken place or are taking place now at the moment or are just about to take place in the near future. Sasha time can extend into the future for about six months or, at the most, one year. Zamani time overlaps sasha time to some extent in the present, but it also goes back very far into the past time. It absorbs, holds, and stores all the events that have ever occurred. It is more significant than sasha because it stretches endlessly back into the past. It includes the time of myth when all the stories of creation took place and when the great and famous heroes of the past performed their exploits. (Anderson 1986, Mbiti 1994.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zamani is not limited to what in English is called the past.… Zamani overlaps with Sasha and the two are not separable. Sasha feeds or disappears into Zamani. But before events become incorporated into the Zamani, they have to become realized or actualized within the Sasha dimension. When this has taken place, the events "move" backwards from the Sasha into the Zamani…. It is the final storehouse for all phenomena and events, the ocean of time in which everything becomes absorbed into a reality that is neither after nor before. 
John S. Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Heinemann, 1990), 22.

== Early years ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
He was born Stephen Guarino,&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; the elder of two children, to Italian [[Roman Catholic]] parents in [[Staten Island]], New York.
He was educated initially in a [[public high school]] nearby and then enrolled in the [[Brooklyn College]], where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read [[Nietzsche]] and [[Dostoevsky]] and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics.&lt;ref name = shinn1&gt;{{Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = cite_note-11&gt;{{cite book

{{Quotation|As soon as I went to college I underwent an intellectual revolution. Any religious sentiments I had gained from my mother were driven away by my college professors, who were dyed-in-the-wool Marxist intellectuals, Americans from the 1930s. They taught me their intellectual and atheistic views, and knocked aside my religious worship, saying it was sentimental. One of them said theology could never satisfactorily explain why evil was present in the world. I was attracted to their philosophy because my parents were not intellectual and had never aroused my intellectual capacity. But my professors opened up a whole new world for me. I became eager to study philosophy and literature. I came to see for myself that the church was hypocritical: in the foyer of our church the priests regularly raffled bottles of liquor (they called them “baskets of joy”). I became dissatisfied with the [[Catholic Church]] because it could not provide answers to my questions.|Satsvarupa dasa Goswami|With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969: A Memoir| Introduction&lt;ref name = cite_note-11/&gt;}}
In January 1962 he joined the [[US Navy|Navy]], where he served for two years on board of [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|U.S.S. Saratoga]], a super-carrier. In his introduction to ''With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969'' he writes: "A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world."&lt;ref name = cite_note-11/&gt; "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the [[Bhagavad-gita]] and the [[Upanishad]]s. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen."&lt;ref name = cite_note-11/&gt;

[[File:Satsvarupa-das-goswami-ACBSP.jpg|upright|thumb|left| Satsvarupa dasa Goswami with [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] in 1974]]

In July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] a month later. Prabhupada soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood "to be yoga".&lt;ref name = john&gt;John P Reis, ''God is Not Dead; He Has Simply Changed Clothes: A Study of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness'' University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1975, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] movement.&lt;ref name = shinn1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter by [[A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], November 11, 1967 to Brahmananda, "I do not want crowd of [[Kirtanananda Swami|Kirtananandas]] but I want a single soul like Brahmananda, Mukunda, Rayarama, and &lt;u&gt;Satsvarupa&lt;/u&gt;. The same example is always applicable that one moon is sufficient for the night as not thousands of stars...Without being empowered by Krishna, nobody can preach [[Krishna Consciousness]]. It is not academic qualification or financial strength which helps in these matters, but it is sincerity of purpose which helps us always. Therefore, I wish that you will remain in charge of New York, let &lt;u&gt;Satsvarupa&lt;/u&gt; be in charge of Boston, Let [[Mukunda Goswami|Mukunda]] be in charge of San Francisco...[http://krishnascience.com/Vaisnava%20Library/Biographies/Letters%20from%20Srila%20Prabhupada/1967/67-11A.htm Letters quote]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Rochford1/&gt;

After Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada died, he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. [[Larry Shinn]] in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami:

{{Quotation|Thing that caused me to correct my initial prejudices about the Krishnas was that those who joined the movement came through several modes of conversion and from many different backgrounds.  Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, who later was appointed as one of Prabhupada's guru successors, was one of the earliest devotees I met.  He was in his late twenties when I met him in New York City.  He had discovered the Krishnas as a result of a spiritual quest which was satisfied within this Indian tradition.|L.Shinn|The Maturation of the Hare Krishnas in America|1994&lt;ref name = Shinn/&gt;}}

In a typical [[diksa|initiation]] ceremony as a [[ISKCON Guru System|guru]] of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] he would begin with purification using ''[[achamana]]'' (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the [[holy names]] in the life of a new initiate.&lt;ref name = shinn2&gt;{{Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal servant of Prabhupada==

In addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of [[ISKCON]], Prabhupada, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Prabhupada his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Prabhupada a massage it was "an intense spiritual experience" for him:&lt;ref name = Kimmo3/&gt;

{{quote|Massaging Prabhupada was like new initiation. From my side, it was completely spiritual, ecstatic exchange, the essence of the personal servant's worship of the spiritual master.|Life With the Perfect Master}}

One may understand how the service given to one's [[guru]] can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] and innumerable other [[Vaishnava]] contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.&lt;ref name = Kimmo3&gt;{{Harvnb|Ketola|2008|pp=113–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary contribution ==
As a writer he is following a line of teachers or gurus in his religious tradition. In his review Srivatsa Goswami suggests this view with a reference to the  "path of [[Six Goswamis]]":&lt;ref name = Rosen&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1992|256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satsvarupa dasa Goswami's writing&lt;ref name = "VBase"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/index.php?main=features&amp;content=contents|title=represents 30 digitally available volumes of transcripts of Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami books forming large portion of the collection|author=vedabase.com|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=''Bhaktivedanta Vedabase''|year=2003|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents a contemporary variety from commentaries on scriptures to a free flowing poetry and prose.&lt;ref&gt;Goswami,''One Hundred Prabhupada Poems''. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

One of widely read and translated of all his books is ''Srila Prabhupada-Lilamrta''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prabhupada-lilamrita.bandcamp.com/album/srila-prabhupada-lilamrita Audio book online] ''Srila Prabhupada-Lilamrta'' – Bhagavat-Asraya abridged audio rendition of "Prabhupada, Your Ever Well-wisher".&lt;/ref&gt; It's a biography of the founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement, depicting him through different stages of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis G. Jestice,''Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia'' 2004
ABC-CLIO p.122, {{ISBN|1-57607-355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written with the help of a large research team for a period of over six years. ''Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta'' is based on material given by interviewers and researchers and is based on a system of ascertaining whether a reported biographical story is authentic. By researching tape recordings of Prabhupada author provided accurate quotes of his statements wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;G. Harrison, "I had a copy of the Hare Krishna album with Prabhupada singing 'Hare Krishna' with the devotees," [[George Harrison]] told Satsvarupa Das Gosvami during the Lilamrita interview of [[George Harrison]] quoted from ''Dark Horse: The Life and Art of George Harrison'', Geoffrey Giuliano, 1997 – Page 199&lt;/ref&gt; In this biographical work he would always look for several reliable witnesses, in addition to the one who is recalling a particular event.

{{Quotation|In striking contrast to doldrums Edward Dimock reported in 1966 the volumes remind us that religious tradition can harbor a deceptive vitality and have a remarkable capacity for renewal and regeneration. ..''Srila Prabhupada lilamrita'' clearly follows ''Caitanya Caritamrita'' and concentrated on the "nectar of his life" (i.e. ''caritamrta'').

While following the direction of [[Governing Body Commission]], Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the founder-[[acharya]].&lt;ref name = GRN/&gt; While imitation of Prabhupada was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Prabhupada's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Prabhupada's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.&lt;ref name = Kimmo4&gt;{{Harvnb|Ketola|2008|loc=part seven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In years 1978–1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an [[Acharya]] while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986–1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the "most vocal in the cause of reform" in ISKCON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment. In consultation with the official governing body of the Krishna consciousness society, he agreed to cease initiating disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, ''Visitors'' in ''About the Author'', (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; With the GBC consultation, he retained his [[Goswami]] title and continued in the [[sannyasa]] order and as an ISKCON guru.&lt;ref name = RF&gt;{{cite book |author=Rochford, E.

Following a period of health recovery, at the age of 68, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami took residence in the East Coast United States where he is engaging in a number of preaching activities, such as regular lecturing and traveling to the holy ''dhamas''. All of the associated preaching and traveling is complementing his main service of commenting and answering disciples' questions on the Bhaktivedanta Purports being published as the volumes of ''A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam'' and daily online journal.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''''Savora''''' ({{IPA-he|savoˈʁa|lang}}; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: סבורא, "a reasoner", plural '''''Savora'im''''', '''''Sabora'im''''' {{IPA-he|savoʁaˈʔim|}}, סבוראים) is a term used in Jewish law and history to signify one among the leading rabbis living from the end of period of the ''[[Amoraim]]'' (around 500 CE) to the beginning of the ''[[Geonim]]'' (around 600 CE). As a group they are also referred to as the '''Rabbeinu Sevorai''' or '''Rabanan Saborai''', and may have played a large role in giving the [[Talmud]] its current structure.  Modern scholars also use the plural term '''Stammaim''' ([[Hebrew]]; "closed, vague or unattributed sources") for the authors of unattributed statements in the [[Gemara]].

Much of classical rabbinic literature generally holds that the Babylonian Talmud was redacted into more or less its final form around 550 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Oesterley, W. O. E. &amp; Box, G. H. (1920) ''A Short Survey of the Literature of Rabbinical and Mediæval Judaism'', Burt Franklin:New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to his [[Mishnah Torah]], [[Maimonides]] writes that Rav Ashi compiled the Babylonian Talmud. He also writes that [[Ravina I|Ravina]] and [[Rav Ashi]] (Amoraim, who are mentioned in the Talmud) were the final sages of Israel who transcribed the Oral Torah.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maimondes, Introduction to [[Mishneh Torah]]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some statements within classical rabbinic literature, and later analysis thereof, have led many scholars to conclude that the Babylonian Talmud was smoothed over by the ''Savora'im'', although almost nothing was changed.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'' Shalom Carmy, Ed. The Orthodox Forum Series, Jason Aronson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, multiple versions of the same legalistic discussion are included with minor variations. The text also states that various opinions emanated from various Talmudic academies.&lt;ref name=Berkovits&gt;[[Eliezer Berkovits|Berkovits E.]], "Savora'im". In: ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' (first edition) Keter Publishing, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherira Gaon]] (c.987 CE) indicates that [[Rabbah Jose|Rav Yose]] was the final member of the ''Savora'im''.&lt;ref name=Berkovits/&gt; Occasionally, specific ''Savora'im'' are mentioned by name in the Talmud itself, such as [[Ahai|Rabbi Ahai]], who (according to later authority [[Rashbam]]) was a ''Savora''.&lt;ref name=Berkovits/&gt;

==View of Rabbi Meir Triebitz==
Rabbi Triebitz&lt;ref&gt;[[Machon Shlomo]]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the ''‘chasimas hashas’'' - the final compilation of the Talmud. The Talmud says that [[Ravina I|Ravina]] and [[Rav Ashi]] were the ‘end of instruction’ which is understood by many to mean that they compiled the Talmud. Yet there are statements in the Talmud referring to later generations. And according to [[Sherira Gaon|Rav Sherira Gaon]] the Talmud was not in its final form until many generations later.&lt;ref&gt;http://hashkafacircle.com/shiurim/category/history-development-of-the-talmud/&lt;/ref&gt;

==View of David Weiss Halivni==
The role of the ''Savoraim'' in the redaction of the Talmud was reexamined in Jewish academia because of the work of [[David Weiss Halivni]], author of ''Mekorot u'Mesorot'', a projected ten volume source-critical commentary on the Talmud.

Halivni terms the editors of the Talmud as ''Stamma'im'', a new term for rabbis that he places after the period of the ''[[Tannaim]]'' and ''[[Amoraim]]'', but before the Geonic period. He concludes that to a large extent, the ''Stamma'im'' essentially wrote the Gemara (the discussions in the Talmud about the [[Mishna]]). Halivni posits that during the time of [[Ravina I|Ravina]] and [[Rav Ashi]], they compiled a Gemara that was much smaller than the Gemara known today, and which likely was similar to the Mishna and to the [[Tosefta]]. He sees this proto-Gemara as a compilation of rulings that probably had little record of discussions. Halivni also posits that the ''Stamma'im'' did not always fully understand the context and import of the statement of the ''Tanna'' or ''Amora'' when it was said. The methodology employed in his commentary, ''Mekorot u' Mesorot'', will attempt to give Halivni's analysis of the correct import and context and will demonstrate how the Talmud erred in its understanding of the original context.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Weiss Halivni]] ''Peshat and Drash: Plain and Applied Meaning in Rabbinic Exegesis'' Oxford University Press, NY, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented translation efforts by Buddhist monks in China (all foreigners) were in the 2nd century CE under the influence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]] under [[Kanishka]].&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samad, Rafi-us, The Grandeur of Gandhara. The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; These contacts brought [[Gandharan Buddhism|Gandharan Buddhist]] culture into territories adjacent to China proper.

Direct contact between Central Asian and Chinese Buddhism continued throughout the 3rd to 7th century, well into the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] period. From the 4th century onward, with [[Faxian]]'s pilgrimage to India (395–414), and later [[Xuanzang]] (629–644), Chinese pilgrims started to travel by themselves to northern India, their source of Buddhism, in order to get improved access to original scriptures. 
Much of the land route connecting northern India (mainly [[Gandhara]]) with China at that time was ruled by the [[Kushan Empire]], and later the [[Hephthalite Empire]].

The Indian form of Buddhist [[tantra]] ([[Vajrayana]]) reached China in the 7th century. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was likewise established as a branch of Vajrayana, in the 8th century. But from about this time, the  Silk Road  transmission of Buddhism began to decline with the  [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]], resulting in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] by the 740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Oscar R. Gómez]]|title= Antonio de Montserrat - Biography of the first Jesuit initiated in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism |url=https://www.academia.edu/19586252/Antonio_de_Montserrat_-_Biograf%C3%ADa_del_primer_jesuita_iniciado_en_el_budismo_t%C3%A1ntrico_tibetano  |year=2015|publisher=Editorial MenteClara |isbn=978-987-24510-4-2 |page=32|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Indian Buddhism itself was [[Decline of Buddhism in India|in decline]], due to the resurgence of [[Pauranic Hinduism|Hinduism]] on one hand and due to the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim expansion]] on the other, while Tang-era  [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|Chinese Buddhism was repressed]] in the 9th century, but not before in its turn giving rise to [[Korean Buddhism|Korean]] and [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese]] traditions.

==The transmission of Buddhism==
[[File:Tarimbecken 3. Jahrhundert.png|thumb|300px|Kingdoms in the [[Tarim Basin]] during the 3rd century, connecting the territory of [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|China]] with that of the [[Kushan Empire]]: [[Kashgar]], [[Kucha]], [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]], [[Karasahr]], [[Shanshan]], [[Turfan]].]]

===First contacts===
Buddhism was brought to China via the [[Silk Road]]. Buddhist monks travelled with merchant caravans on the Silk Road, to preach their new religion. The lucrative Chinese [[silk]] trade along this trade route began during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) with the establishment by [[Alexander the Great]] of a system of [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms (323 BC - 63 BC) and trade networks extending from the Mediterranean to modern Afghanistan and [[Tajikistan]] on [[Alexandria Eschate|the borders of China]]. The powerful [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms]] (250 BC-125 BC) in Afghanistan and the later [[Indo-Greek Kingdoms]] (180 BC - 10 CE) practiced [[Greco-Buddhism]] and formed the first stop on the Silk Road, after China, for nearly 300 years. See [[Dayuan]] (''Ta-yuan''; {{zh|c=大宛}}; literarily "Great [[Ionians]]").

The transmission of Buddhism to China via the Silk Road started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han|Ming]] (58–75 CE):

{{quote|It may be assumed that travelers or pilgrims brought Buddhism along the Silk Roads, but whether this first occurred from the earliest period when those roads were open, ca. 100 BC, must remain open to question. The earliest direct references to Buddhism concern the 1st century AD, but they include hagiographical elements and are not necessarily reliable or accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), pp. 669–670.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Extensive contacts however started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were either [[Parthia]]n, Kushan, [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road", pp. 37–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asian missionaries===

[[File:BezeklikSogdianMerchants.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] donors to the Buddha (fresco, with detail), [[Bezeklik]], eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 8th century]]

In the middle of the 2nd century, the [[Kushan]] empire under king [[Kanishka|Kaniṣka]] from its capital at Purushapura (modern [[Peshawar]]), India expanded into Central Asia and went beyond the regions of [[Kashgar]], [[Khotan]] and [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], in the [[Tarim Basin]], modern [[Xinjiang]]. As a consequence, cultural exchanges greatly increased, and Central Asian Buddhist missionaries became active shortly after in the Chinese capital cities of [[Loyang]] and sometimes [[Nanjing]], where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They promoted both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna scriptures. Thirty-seven of these early translators of Buddhist texts are known.

* [[An Shigao]], a [[Parthia]]n prince who made the first known translations of [[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]] Buddhist texts into Chinese (148–170)
* [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], a [[Kushan]] and the first to translate [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] scriptures into Chinese  (167–186)
* [[An Xuan]], a Parthian merchant who became a monk in China in 181
* [[Zhi Yao (monk)|Zhi Yao]] (c. 185), a Kushan monk in the second generation of translators after Lokakṣema.

* [[Fotudeng]] (4th century), a Central Asian monk who became a counselor to the Chinese court
* [[Bodhidharma]] (440–528), the founder of the [[Zen|Chan]] ([[Zen]]) school of Buddhism, and the legendary originator of the physical training of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolin kung fu]]. According to the earliest reference to him, by [[Yang Xuanzhi]], he was a monk of [[Central Asian]] origin whom Yang Xuanshi met around 520 at Loyang.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is referred to as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" (碧眼胡:Bìyǎn hú) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Five monks from Gandhāra who traveled in 485 CE to the country of [[Fusang]] ("the country of the extreme east" beyond the sea, probably Japan), where they introduced Buddhism.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|"In former times, the people of [[Fusang]] knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the [[Song dynasty]] (485 CE), five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) traveled by ship to that country.

===Early translations===
[[File:Eastern Han ingot imprints with barbarous Greek inscriptions.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern Han]] inscriptions on lead ingot, using barbarous Greek alphabet in the style of the [[Kushans]], excavated in [[Shaanxi]], [[China]], 1st-2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Cribb, 1974, "Chinese lead ingots with barbarous Greek inscriptions in Coin Hoards" pp.76-8 [https://www.academia.edu/33859218/Chinese_lead_ingots_with_barbarous_Greek_inscriptions_in_Coin_Hoards_vol.IV_London_1978_pp.76-8?auto=download]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first documented translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese occurs in 148 CE with the arrival of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince-turned-monk, [[An Shigao]] (Ch. 安世高). He worked to establish Buddhist temples in [[Loyang]] and organized the translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, testifying to the beginning of a wave of Central Asian Buddhist proselytism that was to last several centuries. An Shigao translated Buddhist texts on basic doctrines, [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and ''[[abhidharma]]''. [[An Xuan]] (Ch. 安玄), a Parthian layman who worked alongside An Shigao, also translated an early Mahāyāna Buddhist text on the [[bodhisattva]] path.

[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism was first widely propagated in China by the Kushan monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (Ch. 支婁迦讖, active ca. 164–186 CE), who came from the ancient Buddhist kingdom of [[Gandhāra]]. Lokakṣema translated important Mahāyāna sūtras such as the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'', as well as rare, early Mahāyāna sūtras on topics such as ''[[samādhi]]'' and meditation on the buddha [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]]. These translations from Lokakṣema continue to give insight into the early period of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

===Chinese pilgrims to India===
From the 4th century onward, Chinese pilgrims also started to travel on the Silk Road to India, the origin of Buddhism, by themselves in order to get improved access to the original scriptures. According to Chinese sources, the first Chinese to be ordained was [[Zhu Zixing]], after he went to Central Asia in 260 to seek out Buddhism.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

It is only from the 4th century CE that Chinese Buddhist monks started to travel to India to discover Buddhism first-hand. [[Faxian]]'s pilgrimage to India (395–414) is said to have been the first significant one. He left along the Silk Road, stayed six years in India, and then returned by the sea route. [[Xuanzang]] (629–644) and [[Hyecho]] traveled from Korea to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml Ancient Silk Road Travellers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of the Chinese pilgrims is [[Xuanzang]] (629–644), whose large and precise translation work defines a "new translation period", in contrast with older Central Asian works. He also left a detailed account of his travels in Central Asia and India. The legendary accounts of the holy priest Xuanzang were described in the famous novel ''Journey to the West'', which envisaged trials of the journey with demons but with the help of various disciples.

===Merchants===
During the fifth and sixth centuries C.E., Merchants played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism to be an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, Merchants supported Buddhist Monasteries along the Silk Roads and in return the Buddhists gave the Merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, Merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants also helped to establish [[diaspora]] within the communities they encountered and over time, their cultures became based on Buddhism. Because of this, these communities became centers of literacy and culture with well-organized marketplaces, lodging, and storage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism essentially ended around the 7th century with the rise of Islam in Central Asia.

===Decline===
Buddhism in Central Asia began to decline in the 7th century in the course of the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]]. A turning point was the [[Battle of Talas]] of 751.
This development also resulted in the extinction of the local [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] Buddhist culture in the [[Tarim Basin]] during the 8th century.

The Silk Road ''transmission'' between Eastern and Indian Buddhism thus came to an end in the 8th century, on one hand because [[Islam in Central Asia]] repressed Buddhism along the Silk Road itself, but also because Buddhism in both India and China were in decline by that time.

From the 9th century onward, therefore, the various schools of Buddhism which survived began to evolve independently of one another.  The vigorous Chinese culture progressively absorbed Buddhist teachings until a strongly Chinese particularism developed.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}
In the eastern Tarim Basin,  Central Asian Buddhism survived into the later medieval period as the religion of the Uyghur [[Kara-Khoja Kingdom]] (see also [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]]), and Buddhism  became one of the [[Religion in the Mongol Empire|religions in the Mongol Empire]] and the [[Chagatai Khanate]], and via the [[Oirats]] eventually the religion of the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]]s, who settled at the Caspian in the 17th century.
Otherwise, Central Asian Buddhism survived mostly [[Tibetan Buddhism|in Tibet]] and [[Buddhism in Mongolia|in Mongolia]].

==Artistic influences==
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|right|"Heroic gesture of the Bodhisattva", 6th–7th century [[terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang)]]

Central Asian missionary efforts along the Silk Road were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd to the 11th century CE in the [[Tarim Basin]], modern [[Xinjiang]].

Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist]] art of the [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]] district of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, combining Indian and Greek influences.

Highly sinicized forms of this syncretism can also be found on the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin, such as in [[Dunhuang]].

Silk Road artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs or representations of Japanese gods (see [[Greco-Buddhist art]]).

==Buddhism in the Book of Later Han==
The (5th century) ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', compiled by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (398-446 CE), documented early Chinese Buddhism. This history records that around 65 CE, Buddhism was practiced in the courts of both [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (r. 58-75 CE) at [[Luoyang]] (modern [[Henan]]) and, his half-brother, [[Liu Ying (prince)|King Ying]] (r. 41-70 CE) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] at Pengcheng (modern [[Jiangsu]]).

The Book of Han has given rise to discussions on the maritime or overland transmission of Buddhism, and the origins of Buddhism in India or China.

===The Book of Han===
First, the ''Book of the Later Han'' biography of [[Liu Ying (prince)|Liu Ying]], the King of Chu, gives the oldest reference to Buddhism in Chinese historical literature. It says Ying was both deeply interested in [[Huang-Lao]] 黄老 (from [[Yellow Emperor]] and [[Laozi]]) Daoism and "observed fasting and performed sacrifices to the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Huang-Lao or Huanglaozi 黄老子 is the deification of Laozi, and was associated with ''[[fangshi]]'' "technician; magician; alchemist" methods and ''[[Xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal" techniques. "To Liu Ying and the Chinese devotees at his court the "Buddhist" ceremonies of fasting and sacrifices were probably no more than a variation of existing Daoist practices; this peculiar mixture of Buddhist and Daoist elements remains characteristic of Han Buddhism as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 27. Compare Maspero (1981), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 65 CE, Emperor Ming decreed that anyone suspected of capital crimes would be given an opportunity for redemption, and King Ying sent thirty rolls of silk. The biography quotes Ming's edict praising his younger brother:

{{quote|The king of Chu recites the subtle words of Huanglao, and respectfully performs the gentle sacrifices to the Buddha. After three months of purification and fasting, he has made a solemn covenant (or: a vow 誓) with the spirits. What dislike or suspicion (from Our part) could there be, that he must repent (of his sins)? Let (the silk which he sent for) redemption be sent back, in order thereby to contribute to the lavish entertainment of the ''upāsakas'' (''yipusai'' 伊蒲塞) and ''śramaṇa'' (''sangmen'' 桑門).&lt;ref&gt;Tr. by Zürcher (1972), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|"These two Sanskrit terms, given in the Chinese text in phonetic transcription, refer to lay adepts and to Buddhist monks, respectively";&lt;ref&gt;Demiéville (1986), p. 821.&lt;/ref&gt; and show detailed knowledge of Buddhist terminology.}}}}

In 70 CE, King Ying was implicated in rebellion and sentenced to death, but Ming instead exiled him and his courtiers south to Danyang ([[Anhui]]), where Ying committed suicide in 71 CE. The Buddhist community at Pencheng survived, and around 193 CE, the warlord [[Zhai Rong]] built a huge Buddhist temple, "which could contain more than three thousand people, who all studied and read Buddhist scriptures."&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Fan Ye's ''Book of Later Han'' quotes a "current" (5th-century) tradition that [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Emperor Ming]] prophetically dreamed about a "golden man" Buddha. While "The Kingdom of Tianzhu" section (above) recorded his famous dream, the "Annals of Emperor Ming" history did not. Apocryphal texts give divergent accounts about the imperial envoys sent to India, their return with two Buddhist monks, [[Sanskrit]] sutras (including ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'') carried by white horses, and establishing the [[White Horse Temple]].

====Maritime or overland transmission====
Since the ''Book of Later Han'' present two accounts of how Buddhism entered Han China, generations of scholars have debated whether monks first arrived via the maritime or overland routes of the [[Silk Road]].

The maritime route hypothesis, favored by [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Paul Pelliot]], proposed that Buddhism was originally introduced in southern China, the [[Yangtze River]] and [[Huai River]] region, where King Ying of Chu was worshipping Laozi and Buddha c. 65 CE. The overland route hypothesis, favored by Tang Yongtong, proposed that Buddhism disseminated eastward through [[Yuezhi]] and was originally practiced in western China, at the Han capital Luoyang where Emperor Ming established the White Horse Temple c. 68 CE.

The historian Rong Xinjiang reexamined the overland and maritime hypotheses through a multi-disciplinary review of recent discoveries and research, including the [[Gandhāran Buddhist Texts]], and concluded:

{{quote|The view that Buddhism was transmitted to China by the sea route comparatively lacks convincing and supporting materials, and some arguments are not sufficiently rigorous [...] the most plausible theory is that Buddhism started from the Greater Yuezhi of northwest India (present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan) and took the land roads to reach Han China. After entering into China, Buddhism blended with early Daoism and Chinese traditional esoteric arts and its iconography received blind worship.&lt;ref&gt;Rong Xinjiang, 2004, [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp144_han_dynasty_buddhism.pdf Land Route or Sea Route? Commentary on the Study of the Paths of Transmission and Areas in which Buddhism Was Disseminated during the Han Period], tr. by Xiuqin Zhou, ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'' 144, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Origins of Buddhism====
Fan Ye's Commentary noted that neither of the [[Former Han]] histories – the (109-91 BCE) ''Records or the Grand Historian'' (which records [[Zhang Qian]] visiting [[Central Asia]]) and (111 CE) ''[[Book of Han]]'' (compiled by [[Ban Yong]]) –  described Buddhism originating in India:&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Zhang Qian noted only that: 'this country is hot and humid. The people ride elephants into battle.' Although Ban Yong explained that they revere the Buddha, and neither kill nor fight, he has recording nothing about the excellent texts, virtuous Law, and meritorious teachings and guidance. As for myself, here is what I have heard: This kingdom is even more flourishing than China. The seasons are in harmony. Saintly beings descend and congregate there. Great Worthies arise there. Strange and extraordinary marvels occur such that human reason is suspended. By examining and exposing the emotions, one can reach beyond the highest heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. by Hill (2009), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''Book of Later Han'', "The Kingdom of Tianzhu" (天竺, Northwest India) section of "The Chronicle of the Western Regions" summarizes the origins of Buddhism in China. After noting Tianzhu envoys coming by sea through Rinan (日南, Central [[Vietnam]]) and presenting tribute to [[Emperor He of Han]] (r. 89-105 CE) and [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 147-167 CE), it summarizes the first "hard evidence" about Prince Ying and "official" story about Emperor Ming:&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1990), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is a current tradition that Emperor Ming dreamed that he saw a tall golden man the top of whose head was glowing. He questioned his group of advisors and one of them said: "In the West there is a god called Buddha. His body is sixteen ''chi'' high (3.7 metres or 12 feet), and is the colour of true gold." The Emperor, to discover the true doctrine, sent an envoy to Tianzhu (Northwestern India) to inquire about the Buddha's doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom.}}

{{quote|Then Ying, the king of Chu [a dependent kingdom which he ruled 41-71 CE], began to believe in this Practice, following which quite a few people in the Middle Kingdom began following this Path. Later on, Emperor Huan [147-167 CE] devoted himself to sacred things and often made sacrifices to the Buddha and Laozi. People gradually began to accept [Buddhism] and, later, they became numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 31. Compare the account in [[Yang Xuanzhi]]'s (6th-century) [http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Religion/luoyangqielanji.html Luoyang qielan ji 洛陽伽藍記], tr. by Ulrich Theobald.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Buddhism in apocryphal traditions==
[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mogao Caves]] 8th-century mural depicting the [[pseudohistorical]] legend of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] worshipping "golden man" Buddha statues.]]
Despite secular Chinese histories dating the introduction of Buddhism in the 1st century, some [[apocryphal]] Buddhist texts and traditions claim earlier dates in the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-206 BCE) or [[Former Han Dynasty]] (208 BCE-9 CE).

===Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE)===
One apocryphal story, first appearing in the (597 CE) ''Lidai sanbao ji'' 歷代三寶紀, concerns a group of Buddhist priests who supposedly arrived in 217 BCE at the capital of [[Qin Shi Huang]] in [[Xianyang]] (near [[Xi'an]]). The monks, led by the [[shramana]] Shilifang 室李防, presented sutras to the First Emperor, who had them put in jail:

{{quote|But at night the prison was broken open by a Golden Man, sixteen feet high, who released them. Moved by this miracle, the emperor bowed his head to the ground and excused himself.&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (2007), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The (668 CE) ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' Buddhist encyclopedia elaborates this legend with [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka the Great]] sending Shilifang to China.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders (1923), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of [[Liang Qichao]], most modern sinologists dismiss this Shilifang story. Some western historians believe Emperor Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to China, citing the (ca. 265) [[Edicts of Ashoka|13th Rock Edict]] that records missions to Greece, [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;Draper (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, "As far as we can gather from the inscriptions he [Ashoka] was ignorant of the very existence of China."&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2005), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han Dynasty===
There is a Chinese tradition that in 2 BCE, a [[Yuezhi]] envoy to the court of [[Emperor Ai of Han]] transmitted one or more Buddhist sutras to a Chinese scholar. The earliest version derives from the lost (mid-3rd century) ''[[Weilüe]]'', quoted in [[Pei Songzhi]]'s commentary to the (429 CE) ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'': "the student at the imperial academy Jing Lu 景盧 received from Yicun 伊存, the envoy of the king of the Great Yuezhi oral instruction in (a) Buddhist sutra(s)."&lt;ref&gt;Tr. by Zürcher (2007), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Han histories do not mention Emperor Ai having contacts with the Yuezhi, scholars disagree whether this tradition "deserves serious consideration",&lt;ref&gt;Draft translation of the [[Weilüe]] by John E. Hill (2004) [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/notes4_6.html#6_10 The Peoples of the West].&lt;/ref&gt; or can be "reliable material for historical research".&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dream of Emperor Ming====
Many apocryphal sources recount the "pious legend" of [[Emperor Ming of Han|Emperor Ming]] dreaming about Buddha, sending envoys to Yuezhi (on a date variously given as 60, 61, 64 or 68 CE), and their return (3 or 11 years later) with sacred texts and the first Buddhist missionaries, [[Kasyapa Matanga|Kāśyapa Mātanga]] (Shemoteng 攝摩騰 or Jiashemoteng 迦葉摩騰)  and [[Dharmaratna]] (Zhu Falan 竺法蘭). They translated the "Sutra in Forty-two Sections" into Chinese, traditionally dated 67 CE but probably later than 100,&lt;ref&gt;Demieville (1986), p. 824.&lt;/ref&gt; the emperor built the White Horse Temple (Baimasi 白馬寺) in their honor, and Chinese Buddhism began. All accounts of Emperor Ming's dream and Yuezhi embassy derive from the anonymous (middle 3rd-century) introduction to the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (2007), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the (late 3rd to early 5th-century) ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' says,&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (2007), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In olden days emperor Ming saw in a dream a god whose body had the brilliance of the sun and who flew before his palace; and he rejoiced exceedingly at this. The next day he asked his officials: "What god is this?" the scholar Fu Yi said: "Your subject has heard it said that in India there is somebody who has attained the Tao and who is called Buddha; he flies in the air, his body had the brilliance of the sun; this must be that god.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. by Henri Maspero, 1981, ''Taoism and Chinese Religion'', tr. by Frank A. Kierman Jr., [[University of Massachusetts Press]], p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics disagree over the historicity of Emperor Ming's dream; Tang Yongtong sees a possible nucleus of fact behind the tradition, and [[Henri Maspero]] rejects it as propagandistic fiction.

====Emperor Wu and The Golden Man====
Exemplifying how traditional accounts of Chinese Buddhism sometimes combined history and legend, the ''Book of Han'' records that in 121 BCE, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] sent general [[Huo Qubing]] to attack the [[Xiongnu]]. Huo defeated the people of prince Xiutu 休屠 (in modern-day [[Gansu]]) and "captured a golden (or gilded) man used by the King of Hsiu-t'u to worship Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Dubs (1937), 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Xiutu's son was taken prisoner, but eventually became a favorite retainer of Emperor Wu and was granted the name [[Jin Midi]], with his surname [[Jin (Chinese surname)|Jin]] 金 "gold" supposedly referring to the "golden man."&lt;ref&gt;Dubs (1937), 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The golden statue was later moved to the Yunyang  雲陽 Temple, near the royal summer palace Ganquan 甘泉 (modern Xianyang, [[Shaanxi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dubs (1937), 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 6th century) ''[[A New Account of the Tales of the World]]'' claims this golden man was more than ten feet high, and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE) sacrificed to it in the Ganquan 甘泉 palace, which "is how Buddhism gradually spread into (China)."&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (2007), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The (8th century) fresco discovered in the [[Mogao caves]] (near [[Dunhuang]] in the [[Tarim Basin]]) that depicts Emperor Wu worshipping two Buddhist statues, "identified as 'golden men' obtained in 120 BCE by a great Han general during his campaigns against the nomads". Although Emperor Wu did establish the Dunhuang [[Commandery (China)|commandery]], "he never worshipped the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield et al (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Pastor Everaldo Dias Pereira.jpg|thumb|Pastor Everaldo Pereira (''left'')]]
The '''Social Christian Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Social Cristão}}, PSC) is a [[conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Brazil]].

At the [[Brazilian general election, 2010|2010 general elections]], PSC obtained 12 seats in the chamber of deputies and kept this number at 2014 legislative elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/eleicoes-2014/noticia/2014/11/novos-partidos-terao-maior-bancada-da-camara-federal-em-2015-4634660.html (in portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The party was founded in 1985, as a [[centrist]], [[Christian democratic]] party. The party supported [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|presidential election of 1989]], and in 1990, the party won first place in the state election for [[Alagoas]], the home state of then-President Collor.{{cn|date=October 2018}} However, from 1994, the party declined: its candidates repeatedly lost votes, surpassing only those from far-left parties, who originated from rebel wings of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]] without popular support. The PSC did not elect more than 3 representatives in the three subsequent elections. [[Jair Bolsonaro]] was a former member of the party.

==Electoral results==
At the [[Brazilian general election, 2002|legislative elections]] of 6 October 2002, the party won 1 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate. At the legislative elections of October 1, 2006, the party won 9 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

==History==
{{Main|History of Belize#Emigration of the Garifuna}}
The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] arrived in Punta Gorda from the coast of [[Honduras]] in the late 1700s. They had [[Catholic church|Catholic]] roots from their ancestry in [[Dominica]]. In 1862 the first Catholic church among the Garifuna of [[British Honduras]]/Belize was built in Punta Gorda by [[Belgians|Belgian]] [[Jesuit]] Fr. John Genon. From Punta Gorda he served the missions along the coast from Redcliff (Barranco) to [[Stann Creek Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, F. (October 1918). The Catholic Church in British Honduras (1851-1918). ''Catholic Historical Review'', Vol. 4: 1-11, 304-314.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25011583 ''CHR'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File: SarstoonKeckchiVillage.jpg|thumb|left]] 
After Genon’s death in 1878, Punta Gorda became a [[Holy Redeemer Catholic Parish, Belize City|mission]] visited every other month. In 1883 [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] from [[Cobán]], Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, settled in Crique Sarco and Dolores near Punta Gorda. A count of the population in the Toledo District in the 1890s reported around 3700 of whom 3249 were Catholic. School populations included Punta Gorda 100, Barranco 50, [[Monkey River Town]] 40, Sarstoon 90, and [[San Antonio, Toledo|San Antonio]] 120.&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;Woods, Charles M. Sr., et al. ''Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524-2014.'' (Belize: Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}  
	
Many of the Q'eqchi' from Coban worked as laborers on the German-owned Cramer Estates in Temash and [[Sarstoon Temash Institute for Indigenous Management|Sarstoon]] (at left). With World War I the Cramers were forced to close but most Maya remained in the Sarstoon, Temash, and [[Moho River]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Sir Alan. ''Colonial Civil Servant'' (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jesuit Fr. Herman J. Tenk was pastor of Punta Gorda and this large mission area from 1913 to 1938. To him is attributed the tradition of Garifuna [[History of Roman Catholicism in Belize#Schools|teachers]] in the schools, as he fostered their education and employment.&lt;ref&gt;Arana, F.B.

In 1931 the [[Vincent Pallotti|Pallottine]] sisters built Nazareth, their Belizean [[novitiate]] (pictured at right), at Fairview, four miles northwest of Punta Gorda. They have been active in the Maya villages of Toledo District and have admitted 72 Belizeans into their numbers. 

In 1942 Jesuit Fr. [[Marion M. Ganey]] became pastor in Punta Gorda and in 1943 established St. Peter Claver Credit Union, the first of many [[credit union]]s and [[cooperative]]s he would help initiate throughout Belize and later in the [[Fiji]] Islands and South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wallace, F.|title =The Caribs Cooperate|journal =Jesuit Missions | location =Jesuit Archives: Central United States. St. Louis| pages = 9 | date =April 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 a secondary school was opened at St. Peter Claver&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|256}} but had to close in around 1980. 
In 1970 the present church was built. Today It features both Garifuna and Q’eqchi’ choirs.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|272}} 

The parish remains the hub serving 30 Maya [[San Antonio, Toledo|mission stations]], each with its own Catholic-run, government-subsidized grade school. In 2015 St. Peter Claver along with [[St. Martin de Porres Church, Belize City|St. Martin de Porres]] in Belize City were the two parishes in Belize still pastored by members of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Belize#Jesuits|Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Belize| url =http://www.jesuit.org/Assets/Publications/File/JBSummer2013.pdf|page=10|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years (1988–1995) ===
[[File:Sdsticker.jpg|thumb|Early sticker used by the Sweden Democrats with the slogan {{lang|sv|Bevara Sverige Svenskt}} ("Keep Sweden Swedish")]]
The Sweden Democrats party was founded in 1988 as a direct successor to the [[Sweden Party]],&lt;ref name="Rydgren"/&gt; which in turn had been formed in 1986 by the merger of {{lang|sv|[[Bevara Sverige Svenskt]]}} (BSS, in [[English language|English]]: "Keep Sweden Swedish") and a faction of the [[Progress Party (Sweden)|Swedish Progress Party]].&lt;ref name="r1089"&gt;Rydgren, 2006, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; SD claims 6 February 1988 as the date of its foundation, although observers tend to see the party's foundation as part of a complex decade-long series of events, with some even calling into question whether a meeting took place on 6 February.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Widfeldt (2014).

=== Moderation and growth (1995–2010) ===
[[File:Jimmie Åkesson inför partiledardebatt i SVT.jpg|thumb|[[Jimmie Åkesson]], interviewed before an SVT party-leader debate in 2014]]
From 1995 onwards the party's new leader, [[Mikael Jansson]] (a former member of the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]]), strove to make the party more respectable and, after photographs surfaced of some members posing in Nazi uniforms at party meetings, the wearing of any kind of uniform was formally banned in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/09/12/magasinet/politikk/utenriks/sverige/sverigedemokraterna/13277818/ |title=Gikk med naziuniform, hakekors og brunskjorte |newspaper=Dagbladet |first=Astrid |last=Meland |date=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r108&gt;Rydgren, 2006, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrk /&gt; During the 1990s, the party became more influenced by the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]], as well as the [[Freedom Party of Austria]], the [[Danish People's Party]], German [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]] and Italian [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].&lt;ref name=r109 /&gt; SD{{nbsp}}received economic support for the [[Swedish general election, 1998|1998 election]] from the French National Front, and was active in [[Jean-Marie Le Pen|Le Pen's]] [[Euronat]] from the same time.&lt;ref name=nrk /&gt;&lt;ref name=expo&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.expo.se/2010/sverigedemokraterna---fran-gatan-till-parlamentet_3279.html |title=Sverigedemokraterna – från gatan till parlamentet |publisher=Expo Idag |date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SD,{{nbsp}}however, in 1999 left its membership in Euronat to its youth organisation.&lt;ref name=expo /&gt; In 2001 the most extreme faction was expelled from the party, leading to the formation of the more radical [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]].&lt;ref name=r109&gt;Rydgren, 2006, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s the so-called "Scania gang", or "Gang of Four"{{snds}}[[Jimmie Åkesson]] (party leader since 2005), [[Björn Söder]], [[Mattias Karlsson (politician)|Mattias Karlsson]] and [[Richard Jomshof]]{{snds}}continued and expanded the moderation policy, which included ousting openly extremist members.&lt;ref name=nrk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/verden/1.7304305|title=Fra kjelleren til Riksdagen|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|first=Laila Ø.|last=Bakken|date=25 September 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2002 election, former [[Moderate Party]] MP [[Sten Christer Andersson]] defected to SD, citing that the party had gotten rid of its extreme-right elements.&lt;ref name=expo /&gt; In 2003 the party declared the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] to be a cornerstone of its policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rydgren, 2006, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the party changed its logo from the torch to one featuring an ''[[Anemone hepatica]]'', reminiscent of the party's very first, but short-lived, logo (a stylized ''[[Myosotis scorpioides]]'').&lt;ref name=sdhis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/vart-parti/partiets-historik-i-kronologisk-ordning/ |work=Sweden Democrats |title=Partiets historik i kronologisk ordning |accessdate=25 January 2011 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129031803/http://sverigedemokraterna.se/vart-parti/partiets-historik-i-kronologisk-ordning/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrance into parliament (2010–2014) ===
{{undue weight|date=October 2014}}
In the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 general election]], SD{{nbsp}}won representation in the [[Swedish Riksdag]] for the first time, with{{nbsp}}5.7% of the vote and 20{{nbsp}}MPs.

Sweden Democrat MP [[William Petzäll]] was persuaded to leave the party on 26 September 2011 while still retaining his parliamentary seat.&lt;ref name=expressen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/avslojar/1.2572011/sd-ledamoten-william-petzall-lamnar-partiet-blir-politisk-vilde|title=SD-ledamoten William Petzäll lämnar partiet – blir politisk vilde|work=[[Expressen]]|first=David|last=Baas|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=9 October 2011|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done because of Petzäll's [[substance abuse]] and the problems this might cause for SD's{{nbsp}}public image. Petzäll later died of an overdose and his seat was turned over to [[Stellan Bojerud]] in September 2012.

In November 2012, videos from August 2010 were released, in segments, over the course of three days by Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' (a year earlier, ''Expressen'' had released the same videos without making much noise). This came to be known as the [[Iron pipe scandal]], although the same videos had already been released on [[YouTube]] by Erik Almqvist in 2010. The videos, recorded by MP [[Kent Ekeroth]], featured him along with fellow Sweden Democrats MP [[Erik Almqvist]] and [[Christian Westling]]. The videos show Almqvist arguing with comedian [[Soran Ismail]]: Almqvist is referring to Sweden as "my country, not your country", as an insult to Ismail. They are also shown arguing with a drunken man. A woman can also be seen approaching Kent Ekeroth while filming; he calls her a whore and pushes her out of the way. A few minutes later they are seen picking up iron bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44440/20121115/ |title=Swedish press: scandal shows 'true face' of Sweden Democrats |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118062322/http://www.thelocal.se/44440/20121115 |archivedate=18 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming only a month after party leader Åkesson had instated a zero-tolerance policy towards racism in the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/akesson-stadar-upp-i-sd_7578948.svd|title=Åkesson städar upp i sd|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the release of the video caused Almqvist to leave his position as the party's economic policy spokesperson and his place in the executive committee on 14 November. He excused himself as having been under a lot of pressure and threats of violence at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44418/20121114/ |title=Top Sweden Democrat quits after racist film |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117003358/http://www.thelocal.se/44418/20121114 |archivedate=17 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more segments of the video were released, revealing the other two men's involvement, the party announced on 15 November that Ekeroth would take a break from his position as the party's justice policy spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44432/20121115/ |title=Ekeroth takes 'break' after new revelations |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118062251/http://www.thelocal.se/44432/20121115 |archivedate=18 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almqvist and Ekeroth both took time off from their parliament seats. [[Sweden Democratic Youth]] president [[Gustav Kasselstrand]] and vice president [[William Hahne]] criticized the decision to remove Almqvist and Ekeroth in an [[op-ed]] in [[Dagens Nyheter]], arguing that the party should not give in to media pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sdu-fel-peta-almqvist_7671922.svd|title=SDU: Fel peta Alqvist|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SD-sympatisörer inför EU-valet 2014.jpg|thumb|Sweden Democrat supporters in Stockholm during the 2014 European elections]]

Only two weeks after Almqvist and Ekeroth were forced to step down, fellow MP [[Lars Isovaara]] reported being robbed of his backpack and pushed out of his wheelchair by "two unknown men of an immigrant background". When trying to get into the Riksdag, Isovaara was himself reported by the police for racial abuse against safety guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44724/20121128/ |title=Oinking Sweden Democrat spat at guard |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=28 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130222936/http://www.thelocal.se/44724/20121128/ |archivedate=30 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sweden Democrats initially defended Isovaara, but backed down when ''Expressen'' revealed that Isovaara had actually forgotten his backpack at a restaurant, and that the two men had helped him when he fell out of his wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44726/20121129/ |title=Found bag puts Sweden Democrat MP in doubt |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202170753/http://www.thelocal.se/44726/20121129 |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left his seat in the Riksdag on 29 November, and was replaced by [[Markus Wiechel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/isovaaras-ersattare-tidigare-domd-for-fortal/|title=Isovaaras ersättare tidigare dömd för förtal|publisher=[[Expressen]]|first=Oscar|last=Julander|date=29 November 2012|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise in national support (2014– ) ===
In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Sweden)|European election of 2014]] SD received 9.67% of votes, winning two seats in the European Parliament and becoming the fifth party of the country. The party later joined the [[Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe]] and the [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group.

In the [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014 election]] the Sweden Democrats received 12.9%{{nbsp}}of the votes, doubling their support and becoming the third-largest party. The party remained big in [[Scania]] and [[Blekinge]]; for example in [[Malmö]] the party received 14% of the votes, in [[Landskrona]] it received 19% of the votes and in [[Sjöbo]] a total of 30% rendering the party was the largest in that municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/R/kommun/12/65/index.html|title=Valresultat Riksdag Sjöbo kommun 2014|publisher=Valmyndigheten|language=sv|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parties, however, remained firm in their decision to isolate them from exerting influence. Out of 29 constituencies electing parliamentarians, the party was the second largest in "Scania North &amp; East" while being the third largest party in 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/R/rike/index.html|title=Valresultat Rike Riksdag 2014|publisher=Valmyndigheten|language=sv|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although relying heavily on rural areas and the deep south, the party also made strong inroads and results above 15% in some medium-sized central Sweden cities such as [[Norrköping]], [[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gävle]], indicating a widening of its voter base in all areas.

Some time after that, Åkesson announced he would go on sick leave due to [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/oppet-brev-fran-jimmie-akesson/|title=Jimmie Åkesson sjukskriven|work=Sverigedemokraterna|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/akesson-sjukskriven-pa-obestamd-tid/|title=Åkesson sjukskriven på obestämd tid|work=DN.SE|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattias Karlsson (politician)|Mattias Karlsson]] was appointed to temporarily take over Åkesson's duties as party leader.

On Monday, 23 March 2015, it was announced that Åkesson would return from his leave of absence to resume his duties as party leader following an interview to be broadcast on the Friday, 27 March instalment of the ''[[Skavlan]]'' program on [[SVT]], and a subsequent press conference with the Swedish media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samtiden.nu/12972/jimmie-akesson-kommer-tillbaka|title=Jimmie Åkesson kommer tillbaka|work=Samtiden|accessdate=20 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622151222/http://samtiden.nu/12972/jimmie-akesson-kommer-tillbaka/|archivedate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=6123741|title=Uppgifter: Åkesson gör comeback|author=Sveriges Radio|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid media coverage regarding the high immigration figures and the [[European migrant crisis]], the Sweden Democrats soared in all [[Swedish general election, 2018#Opinion polls|opinion polls]] during the summer of 2015, even topping web-based polls from [[YouGov]] and Sentio in late summer, with a little over a quarter of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://yougov.se/news/2015/08/20/sd-ar-sveriges-storsta-parti/|title=SD är Sveriges största parti|language=sv|publisher=YouGov|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also saw rising support in phone-based polls, although the swing was lower.

On 2 July 2018 the two Sweden Democrats MEP left the EFDD group and moved to the [[Soft euroscepticism|soft eurosceptic]] [[European Conservatives and Reformists]].

In the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 general election]], the SD increased its support to 17.6% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Karnitschnig | first1=Matthew | title=Why Sweden's election was all about the rise of the far right | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-election-2018-results-migration-far-right-neurotica/ | date=10 September 2018 | publisher=[[Politico]] | accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Henley | first1=Jon | title=Sweden Election: Far Right Makes Gains as Main Blocs Deadlocked | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/swedish-election-far-right-on-course-for-sizeable-gains-in-vote | date=10 September 2018 | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Pancevski | first1=Bojan | title=Sweden Moves to the Right in an Election Shaped by Immigration | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweden-vote-leaves-no-clear-majority-polls-show-1536521388 | date=9 September 2018 | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Chamberlain | first1=Samuel | title=Sweden election sees gains for far-right, anti-immigrant party | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/09/09/sweden-election-sees-gains-for-far-right-anti-immigrant-party.html | date=9 September 2018 | publisher=[[Fox News]] | accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duxbury2018"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Duxbury | first1=Charlie | title=Sweden braces for political uncertainty as far right makes gains | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/swedens-two-main-blocs-neck-and-neck-in-election-exit-poll/ | date=9 September 2018 | publisher=[[Politico]] | accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sweden Democrats' party programme is based on [[nationalism]] and [[social conservatism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsf.bgu.ac.il/europe/index.aspx?pgid=pg_127842651505941456 |title=Radical Right-wing Populism in Sweden and Denmark |publisher=The Centre for the Study of European Politics and Society (Jens Rydgren) |accessdate=21 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925083436/http://hsf.bgu.ac.il/europe/index.aspx?pgid=pg_127842651505941456 |archivedate=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ideological basis is described in the party's manifesto, first published on 4 May 2003 during the Jansson leadership and then revised on 8 May 2005 (one day after Åkesson became the new chairman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/07/Sverigedemokraternas-principprogram-2005.pdf |title=Sverigedemokraternas principprogram |publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se |date=8 May 2005 |accessdate=21 October 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923000614/http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/07/Sverigedemokraternas-principprogram-2005.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic Studies scholar [[Benjamin R.

=== Immigration ===
The Sweden Democrats believe that the current [[Immigration to Sweden|Swedish immigration]] and integration policies have been a failure. They oppose integration because they believe that integration involves "meeting in the middle" and do not think that the [[Swedes|Swedish people]] should have to bear the burden of what they claim is a reckless immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Åkesson|first=Jimmie|title=Vår politik A till Ö|url=https://sverigedemokraterna.se/vara-asikter/var-politik-a-till-o/#I|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SD{{nbsp}}feels that the current situation, with a large number of immigrants living in cultural enclaves, is not beneficial for the country. They argue that the immigrants themselves are rootless, that there have been rising antagonistic tensions between various population groups (socially, ethnically, religiously and culturally), and the immigration in itself, SD says, has caused social and economic strains on the country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

As the party considers Sweden to have had too much immigration in recent years, which it claims has seriously threatened national identity and societal cohesion, SD{{nbsp}}wants to reinstate a common Swedish national identity, which in turn would mean a stronger inner solidarity. SD{{nbsp}}rejects the policy of [[multiculturalism]]. SD wishes to strongly restrict immigration, and give generous support for immigrants who instead of wanting to assimilate in Sweden voluntarily prefer to emigrate back to their country of origin. As more state funds are made free from funding mass immigration, SD believes that Sweden will be better able to help [[refugee]]s in their own nearby locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sd-vill-satsa-mer-pa-bistand-an-regeringen/|title=SD vill satsa på mer bistånd än regeringen|work=Expressen|access-date=29 October 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SD has referred to the recommendations from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) which state that the return of refugees should be the solution to refugee problems. Torbjörn Kastell (former party secretary from 2003 to 2004) said in 2002 that the party wanted "a multicultural world, not a multicultural society".&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; In a 2008 survey, a significant minority of 39% of all Swedes thought that there were "too many foreigners in the country", and in 2007 a survey showed that 49% of all Swedes wanted to restrict the number of asylum-seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_208921.svd|title=Folk tycker inte som journalister|publisher=''Svenska Dagbladet''—Göteborg TT|date=26 September 2007|accessdate=8 November 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years SD{{nbsp}}has tried to approach the immigration policy of the [[Danish People's Party]], which from 2001 to 2011 provided parliamentary support for the former Danish [[Venstre (Denmark)|liberal]]/[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|conservative]] government in return for a tightening of Danish immigration policies and stricter naturalization laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/46003/article/item/null |title=Vil kopiere Dansk Folkeparti |publisher=''Klassekampen'' |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929232041/http://www.klassekampen.no/46003/article/item/null |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', 14%{{nbsp}}of SD members are of immigrant origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/valet2010/article7178127.ab|title=Invandrare—och Sverigedemokrat |publisher=''Aftonbladet''|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/index.php?showtopic=31568|title=Immigrants and Sverigedemokrat|publisher=''The Local''|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which matches the share of foreign-born inhabitants of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/PublishingCalendarViewInfo____259923.aspx?PublObjId=11400|title=Tabeller över Sveriges befolkning 2009|work=Statistiska Centralbyrån|accessdate=24 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812141807/http://www.scb.se/Pages/PublishingCalendarViewInfo____259923.aspx?PublObjId=11400|archivedate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2010 election in the municipality of [[Södertälje Municipality|Södertälje]] ([[Stockholm County]]), SD{{nbsp}}was the only party with a majority of immigrants on its electoral list, mostly [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] from the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lt.se/nyheter/1.810001-sd-har-flest-invandrare-pa-vallistan|title=SD har flest invandrare på vallistan|publisher=''LT''|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling{{nbsp}}7.31%{{nbsp}}(3,447 votes), SD's{{nbsp}}municipal list in Södertälje got 5{{nbsp}}of the{{nbsp}}65 municipal seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2010/valsedlar/K/kommun/01/81/valsedlar.html#id0110|title=Val till kommunfullmäktige i Södertälje—Valsedlar|publisher=Val.se|date=21 September 2010|accessdate=14 September 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader Helawi and four other Swedes of immigrant origin will sit as municipal councilors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2010/slutresultat/protokoll/protokoll_0181K.pdf|title=Slutlig rösträkning och mandatfördelning—Val till kommunfullmäktige 2010-09-19—Södertälje kommun|publisher=Val.se|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2 October 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The elderly ===
{{Third-party|section|date=August 2016}}
SD wishes to lower the tax rate for the elderly, as well as increase subsidized housing for the elderly. SD also wishes to allocate additional resources to municipalities in order to provide seniors with greater food assistance and, in general, improve their quality of life. SD has also emphasized a desire to crack down on abuses and crimes of which the elderly are particular targets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130818021933/https://sverigedemokraterna.se/vara-asikter/vara-viktigaste-fragor/en-trygg-och-vardig-alderdom/ En trygg och värdig ålderdom]. ''sverigedemokraterna.se''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sami people ===
The Sweden Democrats are critical of the special rights given to the indigenous [[Sami people]] of northern Sweden. In 2008 the party accepted a motion against the rights to [[reindeer husbandry]]. They have argued that those "who do not involve themselves with reindeer husbandry are treated as second class citizens" and that the privileges the herders have are "undemocratic". They want to restructure the councils and funds that are used to benefit the Sami population, so that they are used "regardless of ethnic identity and business operations". They also want to abolish the [[Sami Parliament of Sweden|Sami Parliament]], which claims special privileges for an "ethnic minority while the society claims equal rights for others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sd-till-attack-mot-renagande-samer_1204465.svd|title=SD till attack mot renägande samer|publisher=''Svenska Dagbladet''|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=8 November 2010|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on national identity ===
In an interview for ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag and then-party secretary [[Björn Söder]] elaborated on the SD{{nbsp}}party programme with respect to its views on national identity by saying that he personally did not think people with dual national identities in Sweden would necessarily identify themselves as Swedish. Although an immigrant of any ethnic background in theory can become a Swedish citizen, they would have to adapt and be [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] in order to be considered Swedish in the cultural sense.&lt;ref name="Den leende nationalismen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/val/nyval-2015/den-leende-nationalismen/|title=Den leende nationalismen|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=14 December 2014|accessdate=27 December 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sverigedemokraterna.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/principprogrammet2014_webb.pdf|title=Sverigedemokraternas Principprogram 2011|page=15|publisher=sverigedemokraterna.se|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=1 January 2015|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Björn Söder stated that the officially recognized Swedish minority peoples (e.g. [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Tornedalians]] and [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Jews]]) in many cases have dual cultural identities and that they probably would be proud of both heritages.&lt;ref name="Den leende nationalismen" /&gt; It was widely interpreted that Söder had stated in the interview that Jews cannot be Swedish unless they abandon their Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/swedish-far-right-leader-jews-swedes|title=Swedish far-right leader: Jews must abandon religious identity to be Swedes|author=David Crouch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.632496|title=Far-right Swedish leader: Jews have dual identities and can therefor not be truly Swedish, but that it wouldn't necessarily be a negative thing|date=18 December 2014|work=[[Haaretz.com]]|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Söder's comments were understood to be anti-semitic and caused Swedish parliamentary groups and party leaders to call for Björn Söder's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/partiernas-krav-pa-bjorn-soder-avga-som-talman/|title=Partiernas krav på Björn Söder: Avgå som talman|publisher=dn.se|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=27 December 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] listed the statement as number six on their list of the top ten most anti-semitic events of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/atf/cf/%7B54d385e6-f1b9-4e9f-8e94-890c3e6dd277%7D/TOP-TEN_2014_FINAL-12-31.PDF|title=2014 Top Ten Worst Global Anti-Semitic/Anti-Israel Incidents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/soders-uttalande-bland-de-tio-varsta-under-2014/|title=Söders uttalande bland de tio värsta under 2014|work=DN.SE|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/soder-sexa-bland-antijudiska-handelser/|title=Söder sexa bland antijudiska händelser|work=Expressen|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Söder responded in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', denying the charges of anti-semitism and claiming ''Dagens Nyheter'' had taken his statements out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=386751 |title=Sweden Democrats reject anti-Semitism |work=[[Jpost.com]] |date= |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and order ===
{{Third-party|section|date=August 2016}}
SD wishes to instate the possibility of [[life without parole]] for the worst crimes and to repatriate foreign citizens found guilty of serious crime. SD also wants to establish a public register of convicted [[pedophilia|pedophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/valet-2010/krafttag-mot-brottsligheten/ |title=Krafttag mot brottsligheten |publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se |accessdate=14 September 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830180831/http://sverigedemokraterna.se/valet-2010/krafttag-mot-brottsligheten/ |archivedate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign policy ===
In its foreign policy, the Sweden Democrats reject joining the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] and are opposed to the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/09/Valmanifest_2010.pdf |title=Valmanifest 2010 |publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923010654/http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/09/Valmanifest_2010.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/socialists-win-landslide-sweden-voters-punish-governing-parties-302364 | newspaper = EurActiv | title = Socialists win by landslide in Sweden as voters punish governing parties | date = May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party supports renegotiating the [[Schengen Agreement]] and holding a referendum on Sweden's [[European Union]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.wsj.com/euroskeptics/ Who Else Wants to Break Up With the EU], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 23 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
The Sweden Democrats advocates a cultural policy that would strip funding for multicultural initiatives and strengthen support for traditional Swedish culture. This agenda has often manifest as opposition to state funding of immigrant cultural organizations and festivals, and support for traditional Swedish craft, folk music, and folk dance groups. The party also tends to oppose state support for cultural initiatives deemed provocative or elitist.&lt;ref name="Teitelbaum 2013"&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin (2013). “Come Hear Our Merry Song”: Shifts in the Sound of Contemporary Swedish Radical Nationalism. Ph.D. Dissertation, Brown University. pp. 242–265&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 letter signed by 52{{nbsp}}Swedish anthropologists, including [[Ronald Stade]], criticized the Sweden Democrats' use of the terms "culture" (''kultur'') and "anthropology" (''antropologi''), claiming their views on culture were "[[Gender essentialism|essentialist]] and obsolete", clarifying that culture is "dynamic" and "in constant change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svt.se/opinion/sverigedemokraterna-misstolkar-begreppet-kultur |title=Sverigedemokraterna misstolkar begreppet kultur |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=svt.se |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sweden Democrats criticize modern art and want the citizens to be able to vote about public art.
"The important thing is that what is expressed in the public environment is anchored to the citizens and especially the local residents who are most often in the environment so that they feel an identification" says the party's cultural spokesperson Aron Emilsson.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/sverigedemokraterna-vill-byta-ut-konsten-i-slussens-tunnelbana&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sweden Democrats also want a ban on burqa in public places.&lt;ref&gt;https://samtiden.nu/2018/06/efter-danmark-och-norge-sd-valkomnar-burkaforbud/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family ===
The Sweden Democrats considers children raised in a traditional [[nuclear family]] as the preferred option for the child's development. Those not raised by their biological parents should have the right to associate with or at least find out who they were. SD opposes government sanctioned adoption to single people, same-sex couples and polyamorous relationships unless the adopting party are close relatives or already have a close relationship with the child. Insemination for same-sex couples and polyamorous groups is also discouraged, though weddings should be decided by each religious institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jämställdhetspolitik|url=https://sd.se/var-politik/jamstalldhetspolitik/|website=Sverigedemokraterna|accessdate=28 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although SD{{nbsp}}strongly criticizes what it calls a "Homosex Lobby", the party claims that it is not hostile to homosexuals. Furthermore, party leader Jimmie Åkesson expressed concern that what he describes as [[Islamization]] of Sweden will eventually lead to the rights of [[sexual minorities]] being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sd-siktar-in-sig-pa-hbt-roster_5054837.svd|title=SD siktar in sig på hbt-röster|work=SvD.se|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media boycott ===
The Sweden Democrats have complained about difficulties buying advertising space due to the media banning the party from advertisement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ChapterID=239&amp;CountryID=51&amp;ReportID=83|title=Swedish General Election 2002 : media coverage|publisher=[[British Helsinki Human Rights Group]]|accessdate=1 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212926/http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ChapterID=239&amp;CountryID=51&amp;ReportID=83|archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been criticised by free speech organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalfreepresssociety.org/2009/09/locking-out-the-sweden-democrats/|title=Locking Out the Sweden Democrats|publisher=International Free Press Society (IFPS)|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June 2006, ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' decided to stop their boycott. ''[[Expressen]]'', however, still retains a ban on Sweden Democrat advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fritt-fram-for-sverigedemokraterna-att-annonsera-1.654627 |title=Fritt fram för Sverigedemokraterna att annonsera |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=1 August 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092722/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fritt-fram-for-sverigedemokraterna-att-annonsera-1.654627 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muhammad cartoon debate ===
After the Danish daily newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published twelve cartoons depicting [[Muhammad]] and ignited [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|a controversy]] during the{{nbsp}}2005 autumn and winter, the Sweden Democrats gave their unreserved support to the publication with reference to the [[freedom of speech]]. SD{{nbsp}}stated that it saw no reason why a Danish newspaper should be forced to abide by Muslim rules and prohibitions regarding expression. When the boycott of Danish products was launched in the Middle East, SD{{nbsp}}launched a "Buy Danish" campaign in support of Danish workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sverigedemokraterna.net/kampanj_dk.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=569|title=Stöd Danmark—Köp danskt!|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|date=13 February 2006|accessdate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502182151/http://www.sverigedemokraterna.net/kampanj_dk.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=569&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2 May 2006|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}} In 2006 SD entered [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|the Muhammad cartoon debate]] by publishing a cartoon depicting Muhammad on its youth league (SDU) and ''SD-Kuriren'' websites. The cartoon showed Muhammad from behind holding a mirror in front of his face. However, instead of any facial features, the mirror showed only a blank head. The cartoon was captioned "Muhammad's Face" ({{lang-sv|Muhammeds ansikte}}).&lt;ref name="autogenerated44"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/muhammedteckningar-borta-efter-saposamtal-1.628077 |title=Muhammedteckningar borta efter Säposamtal |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206050438/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/muhammedteckningar-borta-efter-saposamtal-1.628077 |archivedate=6 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication attracted the attention of the Swedish government, which informed internet service provider ''Levonline'' about the SD's publications. Subsequently, ''Levonline'' shut down SD's web page. The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Laila Freivalds]], denied any direct interference. However, at the same time, Laila Freivalds condemned the publication as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/regeringen-har-inte-varit-inblandad-1.674039 |title=Regeringen har inte varit inblandad |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092716/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/regeringen-har-inte-varit-inblandad-1.674039 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-forsvarar-beslut-att-stanga-sd-sajt-1.773593 |title=Säpo försvarar beslut att stänga SD-sajt |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092606/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-forsvarar-beslut-att-stanga-sd-sajt-1.773593 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mycket-kravs-for-sajtstangning-1.681494 |title=Mycket krävs för sajtstängning |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092711/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mycket-kravs-for-sajtstangning-1.681494 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-lagger-locket-pa-1.659632 |title=Säpo lägger locket på |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092726/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-lagger-locket-pa-1.659632 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freivalds then resigned from the [[Persson Cabinet]] after being accused of interference with press freedom and lying about such actions.

This event spurred debate on government censorship in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats also had a [[hate speech]] charge filed against them due to the posted caricature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/centerpartist-polisanmaler-sverigedemokraterna-1.505666 |title=Centerpartist polisanmäler Sverigedemokraterna |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=14 February 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714092705/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/centerpartist-polisanmaler-sverigedemokraterna-1.505666 |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar hate speech charges were filed against other Swedish publishers who had depicted Muhammad.&lt;ref name="autogenerated44" /&gt; However, these charges were immediately deemed to be unfounded by the [[Chancellor of Justice#Sweden|Swedish Chancellor of Justice]] (''Justitiekanslern'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_11790299.asp |title=Kritik mot stängning av nättidning |publisher=''Svenska Dagbladet'' |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428051354/http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_11790299.asp |archivedate=28 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sweden Democrats originally planned to publish a set of cartoons in their newspaper ''SD-Kuriren''. However, after the controversy erupted, Jimmie Åkesson issued a statement on SD's website on 9 February 2006, stating that they would refrain from further publications online and in print, due to concerns that publishing might spur hostile actions against Swedes and Swedish interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1369|title=Vädjanden från landsmän fick oss att stanna upp|publisher=''SD Kuriren''|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908135455/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1369&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=8 September 2006|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1372|title=Sverigedemokratisk Ungdom tar bort bilder efter samtal med SÄPO|publisher=''SD Kuriren''|date=10 February 2006|accessdate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922073908/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1372&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=22 September 2006|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1368|title=Sverigedemokraterna avstår från vidare publicering av Muhammedbilder av hänsyn till svenska liv|publisher=''SD Kuriren''|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807130853/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1368&lt;!--Manually retrieved archive--&gt;|archivedate=7 August 2007|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}

The shutdown of the Sweden Democrats' websites was reported to the [[Committee on the Constitution (Parliament of Sweden)|Committee on the Constitution]] by the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] leader [[Lars Leijonborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/stangning-av-sd-sajt-till-ku-1.760849 |title=Stängning av SD-sajt till KU |publisher=''Dagens Nyheter'' |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2006 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824025713/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/stangning-av-sd-sajt-till-ku-1.760849 |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SD filed charges against the [[Swedish Security Service|Security Service]] (''Säpo'') and the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] with the ''Justitiekansler'' and ''[[Justitieombudsmannen]]'', alleging that the government's interference was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1371|title=Sverigedemokraterna anmäler UD och SÄPO till JO och JK|accessdate=25 May 2006|publisher=''SD Kuriren''|date=10 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921180848/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1371&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=21 September 2006|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}} The spokesperson of the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]], [[Peter Eriksson (politician)|Peter Eriksson]], also expressed concern over possible government involvement in the event.

=== Racist incidents and expulsions ===
The Sweden Democrats have, among all Swedish parliamentary parties, had the largest share of elected municipal representatives resign since the 2010 elections (27.8%).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/hot-tommer-sd-stolar-i-kommunerna/|title=Hot tömmer SD-stolar i kommunerna - DN.SE|date=9 November 2011|newspaper=DN.SE|language=sv-se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these resignations were brought on by racist statements or actions by these representatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 2012, party spokesperson Erik Almqvist resigned after he had been caught on tape making racist and sexist statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/almqvist-tvingades-bort-efter-filmen/|title=Almqvist tvingades bort efter filmen|newspaper=Expressen|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another video later surfaced, showing how Almqvist, in addition to party spokesperson Kent Ekeroth and party official Christian Westling were arming themselves with aluminium pipes before they sought out a confrontation with [[Soran Ismail]], a Swedish comedian of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/sverige/akesson-tveksam-om-ekeroth|title=Åkesson tveksam om Ekeroths framtid|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|newspaper=svt.se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, parliamentarian Lars Isovaara resigned after accusing two people of foreign origin of stealing his bag (which Isovaara had left at a restaurant) and then proceeding to verbally abuse a security guard of a foreign background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/sd-backar-om-stold-fran-isovaara|title=SD backar om "stöld" från Isovaara|last=TT|newspaper=SvD.se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isovaara's replacement in parliament, Markus Wiechel, was found in April 2013 to have referred to a group of black people as "monkeys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20130426/47570|title=Sweden Democrat MP in racist Facebook chat|date=26 April 2013|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, 12 individuals were thrown out of the party for their involvement in [[Nazism in Sweden#Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] or other extremist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/tolv-personer-utesluts-ur-sd|title=Tolv personer utesluts ur SD|last=TT|newspaper=SvD.se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, parliamentarian and then vice party leader [[Jonas Åkerlund (politician)|Jonas Åkerlund]] gained attention for having called immigrants "parasites" during a broadcast on SD's own radio station in 2002, after the recording  was publicly rediscovered. In his defence, Åkerlund stated that he only said it to provoke people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article17830641.ab|title=SD-toppens rasistiska uttalanden|newspaper=Aftonbladet.se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a few weeks before the [[Swedish general election, 2014|general election]], the party chairman of the local [[Stockholm]] branch, Christoffer Dulny, resigned from his position. He had been posting mocking comments about immigrants, calling them "shameless liars" on [[Alternative media|alternative media sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/expressen-avslojar/har-ar-sd-toppens-inlagg-pa-hatsajten/|title=Här är SD-toppens inlägg på hatsajten|newspaper=Expressen.se|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also resigned from his newly won position in the parliament on the same day he was elected, 29 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/christoffer-dulny-lamnar-fler-uppdrag/|title=Christoffer Dulny lämnar fler uppdrag|newspaper=Expressen.se|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, a video of the parliamentarian and economic policy spokesperson Oscar Sjöstedt making [[antisemitic]] jokes was released. Whilst at a party, believed to have taken place in 2011, he laughingly told a story about former co-workers with [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathies mocking Jews and comparing them to sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-skamtar-sjostedt-sd-grovt-om-judar/|title=Här skämtar Sjöstedt (SD) grovt om judar|newspaper=Expressen.se|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, the parliamentarian and second vice party leader [[Carina Herrstedt]] was confronted with having sent an allegedly [[racist]], [[antisemitic]], [[homophobic]] and [[Anti-Romanyism|anti-romanyist]] email to her then spouse in 2011. The email, which had been leaked from the party's internal servers, for instance contained phrases that named black [[football]] players from the team [[Landskrona BoIS]] as "[[niggers]]" whilst also picturing [[Romani people]] as thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/sd-toppens-skamt-om-judar-och-romer/|title=SD-toppens "skämt" om judar och romer|newspaper=Aftonbladet.se|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2015 and 2016 various members of the party were expelled from the SD for expressing extremist or racist views,&lt;ref name="thelocal2"&gt;{{cite news |date=22 April 2015 |title=Sweden Democrat youth leaders face expulsion |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20150422/sweden-democrat-youth-leaders-face-expulsion |work=[[The Local]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SVR2"&gt;{{cite news |date=5 December 2016 |title=Sweden Democrats expel MP after antisemitism accusations |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6580112 |work=[[Sveriges Radio]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinisch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heinisch |first1=Reinhard |last2=Mazzoleni |first2=Oscar |date=2016 |title=Understanding Populist Party Organisation: The Radical Right in Western Europe |url= |location=London |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |pp=204–207 |isbn=978-1-137-58196-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or because of disagreement with the party's shift towards [[Centrism|moderation]] and [[social conservatism]].&lt;ref name="Heinisch"/&gt; In April 2015, the [[Sweden Democratic Youth]] leaders were also expelled for these reasons,&lt;ref name="thelocal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinisch"/&gt; and the organization was dissolved shortly after.&lt;ref name="Heinisch"/&gt; In December 2016, the parliamentarian Anna Hagwall was thrown out of the party after using arguments associated with [[antisemitism]] to argue for a bill that she introduced in parliament intended to reduce concentration of media ownership in Sweden.&lt;ref name="SVR2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sverigedemokraterna-utesluter-anna-hagwall/|title=Sverigedemokraterna utesluter Anna Hagwall - DN.SE|date=5 December 2016|newspaper=DN.SE|language=sv-se|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, a report from ''Dagens ETC'' found that 14 former municipal representatives of the party had infiltrated the SD in order to financially support the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]],&lt;ref name="ETC1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.etc.se/inrikes/sd-topp-medlem-i-nazistgrupp-en-god-sak|title=SD-topp medlem i nazistgrupp: "En god sak"|date=12 September 2017|newspaper=ETC|access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETC2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.etc.se/inrikes/har-ar-sd-politikerna-som-stottat-nazistgruppen-nmr|title=Här är SD-politikerna som stöttat nazistgruppen NMR|date=12 September 2017|newspaper=ETC|access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a neo-Nazi organization, through [[financial transaction]]s,&lt;ref name="ETC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETC2"/&gt; memberships,&lt;ref name="ETC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETC2"/&gt; or purchases of antisemitic and racist literature or souvenirs.&lt;ref name="ETC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETC2"/&gt; In August 2018, 2 members were kicked out due to purchases of [[Nazi memorabilia]] online;&lt;ref name="SVR3"&gt;{{cite news |date=30 August 2018 |title=Two Sweden Democrats kicked out of party for Nazi purchases, Hitler support |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180830/two-sweden-democrats-kicked-out-of-party-for-nazi-purchases-hitler-support |work=[[Sveriges Radio]] |location=[[Stockholm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the expulsions, Michael Erlandsson, one of the SD spokesmen,&lt;ref name="SVR3"/&gt; publicly stated that people who "have these types of views and share these types of materials" have no place in the party.&lt;ref name="SVR3"/&gt; 14 candidates were expelled from the party as well after being exposed as former members of neo-Nazi organizations.&lt;ref name="Expressen"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baas |first1=David |last2=Rogvall |first2=Filippa |date=31 August 2018 |title=14 SD-politiker lämnar – efter nazistavslöjanden |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/fjorton-sd-politiker-lamnar-efter-nazistavslojanden/ |work=[[Expressen]] |location=[[Stockholm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the latest expulsions, SD leader [[Jimmie Åkesson]] declared that the party "works extremely hard to keep clean".&lt;ref name="Expressen"/&gt;

[[Ashley Fox]], leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], praised the Sweden Democrats regarding the party's policy decisions on the expulsion of extremist and racist members:&lt;ref name="Independent2"/&gt; "Over the past decade the Sweden Democrats have made progress in reforming themselves, expelling any members displaying unacceptable views or behaviour and diversifying their party base."&lt;ref name="Independent2"/&gt;

===Lobbying===
The Sweden Democrats came under fire in 2015 for changing their position on profits made by private welfare companies. Before the [[Swedish general election, 2014|election in 2014]] they favored having restrictions on the amount of profit that welfare companies could take and use for their own gain. After the election they have favored the approach of [[Alliance (Sweden)|the Alliance]] parties, that is higher and more restrictive quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliansen.se/2015/05/valfard/|title=Välfärd: Alliansen vill utredning om privata alternativ i välfärden.|date=20 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suspected to be because of extensive [[lobbying]] done by the organisation [[Confederation of Swedish Enterprise|Svenskt Näringsliv]] among others. The story was discovered by the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Industri]]'' on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.di.se/di/artiklar/2015/9/14/foretagen-och-sd-ses-i-smyg/ "Företagen och SD ses i smyg"], ''[[Dagens Industri]]'', 14 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; SD has denied all accusations of corruption.

Takht-i-rustam or '''Takht-e Rostam''' or '''Stupa of Takht-e Rostam'''&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;is a [[stupa]]-[[monastery]] complex 2 km south of the town of [[Haibak]]. Built in the 4-5th century AD while the area was part of the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] the complex is carved entirely from the bedrock and "consists of five chambers, two of them sanctuaries. One of them has a domed ceiling with an elaborate lotus leaf decoration. On an adjacent hill is the stupa, surmounted by a harmika, with several more rough caves around the base. A hoard of Ghaznavid coins was found by chance in one of the caves."&lt;ref&gt;mapping Buddhist monestaries, http://monastic-asia.wikidot.com/takht-i-rustam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Following the [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan]] the original purpose of the monastery was lost. Instead the site was incorporated into [[Persian mythology]] in the story of [[Rostam and Sohrab]] which forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. In the story it is said that [[Rostam]] supposedly traveled to the Kingdom of [[Samangan]] and stayed with the king at Takht-i-rustam.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fighting Temptations''''' is a 2003 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]], written by [[Elizabeth Hunter]] and Saladin K. Patterson, and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[MTV Films]]. The main plot revolves around Darrin Hill ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) who travels to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia as he attempts to revive a church choir in order to enter a gospel competition with the help of a beautiful lounge singer, Lilly ([[Beyoncé]]), with whom he falls in love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fighting Temptations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191133/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the choir's music, Darrin brings the church community back together all the while seeking a relationship with Lilly.

The film is notable for its soundtrack and [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] cast. The film received mixed reviews upon release.

==Plot==
In 1980, a young boy named Darrin Hill ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) and his mother, MaryAnn ([[Faith Evans]]), are run out of their hometown after MaryAnn is soon discovered to be singing secular music when she sings in a church choir. After being confronted about this by the self-righteous Paulina Pritchett ([[LaTanya Richardson]]), MaryAnn is forced to choose between singing professionally or remaining in the choir. MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen on a bus saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave to each other.

In 2003, Darrin has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in [[New York metropolitan area|New York City]] with a bad habit of lying. His only true friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez ([[Lourdes Benedicto]]), does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under [[false pretenses]], having faked his college degree and high school diploma and lied about being the son of a congressman. Eventually, his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss ([[Dakin Matthews]]) and Darrin loses his job. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin soon finds out that Aunt Sally has died.

Darrin returns to his hometown where he finds a new friendship in Lucious ([[Mike Epps]]), the town's happy-go-lucky, womanizing cab driver (who also has a fear of the Lord). After Aunt Sally's funeral Darrin soon learns from the Reverend that Aunt Sally had stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual "Gospel Explosion" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and in doing so, will inherit Aunt Sally's stock in the company that produces the show which is currently worth $150,000.

Upon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining.

After several setbacks, Darrin eventually recruits many new members, most of which he does so by promising half of the competition's prize money to them (though he has no intention of paying anyone). He also reconnects with his childhood friend and crush Lilly ([[Beyoncé]]), who has faced ostracization from the townspeople similar to MaryAnn's, due to her being an R&amp;B [[nightclub singer]], and having a son, Dean, out of wedlock. Lilly, at first, refuses to join the choir as she is both disgusted by Darrin's romantic advances and because she doesn't want to put up with the townpeople's criticism of her, but with some assurance from Darrin, she ultimately relents and becomes the new lead singer of the choir, causing Paulina to quit in retaliation.

Before their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir ''The Fighting Temptations''.

After an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin starts a proper relationship with Lilly by surprising her with an unexpected marriage proposal, to which she accepts. Eighteen months later, the two are shown to be happily married with a baby of their own.

==Production==
The film crew used several locations throughout Georgia. The final scene was filmed in Columbus, GA at the [[RiverCenter for the Performing Arts]]. Several of the extras were local residents of Columbus, GA.

==Reception==
The music of the film received universal acclaim, most notably, Beyoncé's cover of "Fever".

However, the film itself received generally mixed reviews upon its release. The film was criticized for its allegedly poor dialogue, rehashed premise and romantic chemistry between the film's lead actors (Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé) as well as their noticeable age difference. Despite the mixed reviews the film opened at #2. Notably, [[Ebert &amp; Roeper]] reviewed the film and [[Roger Ebert]] gave it thumbs up, while [[Richard Roeper]] gave it thumbs down. It holds a 42% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

The movie was a minor success at the box office, with a worldwide gross of [[United States dollar|US$]]32,445,215 but failed to produce enough revenue for a second installment to go into production (though the primary actors had signed on for one).

However, the cast themselves were very pleased with the film, citing its uplifting story and soundtrack. Gooding has confessed in several interviews following the film's release that he enjoyed filming his kissing scenes with Beyoncé. In a 2011 interview on ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S.)|The Late Late Show]]'', Gooding made a humorous reference to this by saying: (In the false words of the host) "Didn't he make love with Beyoncé on the set of something?".

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack accompanied the film and was released by Sony on September 9, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fighting Temptations |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Temptations-Various-Artists/dp/B0000C0FG0/ |title=Fighting Temptations: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the film itself. The soundtrack received generally positive reviews and was more successful than the film itself. Only one song from the album, "Summertime", is not included in the movie. The late R&amp;B legend [[Luther Vandross]] also recorded a song for the film called "[[Shine (Luther Vandross song)|Shine]]" but it failed to make the final cut of the film as well as the soundtrack. The most obvious reference to this is the fact that Vandross frequently says the title of the film in the song. The song "Come Back Home" appears in the film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. It also noted that several other songs performed during the movie including "Church Is in Mourning (Aunt Sally's Funeral Tribute)" by [[Shirley Caesar]], "Won't Ever Change" by [[Mary Mary]], "Waiting" by [[Ramiyah]], and "Soldier" by [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]], were also not included on the soundtrack.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on February 3, 2004. While there is a high-definition digital release, it has yet to be released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] as of 2018.

==Cancelled sequel==
In a 2003 interview with the late [[Mickey Jones]], (who had a supporting role in the film), for HollywoodJesus.com, he stated that he hoped the film performed well because all of the principal actors had signed on for a sequel. As a result of the film's underperformance at the box office, a continuation never materialized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57615">The '''''Tiruppavai''''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:திருப்பாவை) is a collection of thirty stanzas (''paasurams'') written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] by [[Andal]] (also known as Nachiyar), in praise of the Lord [[Perumal]], (Vishnu). It is part of [[Divya Prabandha]], a work of the twelve [[Alvars]], and is important part of [[Tamil literature]]. Kodhai Devi or [[Goda Devi/Andal]] incarnated on earth in the 98th year after the beginning of the Kali Era (3102 BC).&lt;ref name="Nair2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. K. Nair|title=Sages Through Ages - Volume IV: India's Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AMWIzs7uzsC|date=1 September 2007|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4670-6410-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She performed a wonderful vratham or vow called Dhanurmasa vratham to tell us that, by practicing this vratham, one can attain all materialistic happiness along with the eternal bliss. The period, from when the sun moves into the constellation of Dhanur-rasi or Sagittarius and until it moves out to the constellation of Makara-rasi or Capricorn is known as Dhanurmasam.
In Thiruppavai, [[Andal]] gives a universal call to all people to recite the name and glories of Lord Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.tirumala.org/Home/Download/?ID=1929&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Tiruppavai says==
A summary:
After the sun sets, according to the Vedic scriptures, the period just before the ensuing dawn is called Bramhamuhurtham. It is an auspicious time, for it gives good thoughts and intentions. Practices like meditation and penances done during this hour, give favorable results.
According to the Vedic calendar, one Earth-year is equal one celestial day. So the last six months on the earth (every year) is equal to one celestial night. Hence, the predawn period, the Bramhamuhurtha, for the heavenly beings falls in the month of Dhanurmasam. [[Andal]] taught us this Dhanurmasa vratham because she wanted us to spend these auspicious days in contemplation of God. This vratham was performed for [[Krishna]]. Krishna means good happiness. Man is always in the quest for happiness, in order to attain which, he engages himself in various kinds of jobs. But pursuit of materialistic happiness will eventually lead to sorrow. So, [[Andal]] performed this vratham desiring the eternal blissful God. She desired and attained Him.

It is not easy for man to know who God is and the means to reach him. Air is not visible to our naked eye. We know the presence of air, because if we  stop breathing, we die. Similarly, according to the poem, we must realize that there is a divine energy which is the cause and controller of our activities, our present form and name. He can be easily attained in His form as an idol or archa murthi. He exists as an archa murthi with the same auspicious qualities as He is in His highest divine abode Paramapadam. Let us worship Him and ask Him whatever we want. He will suitably grant us everything. Kodhai Devi instilled such a faith through her pasurams (poems).

According to the poem God is only one and He appears in various forms for our sake. He accepts our offerings and blessings even when He is worshipped in an idol-form in our house. It is for this reason Kodha Devi performed the vratham near the deity Vatapathrasai. She desired for Lord Sri Ranganatha, she worshipped Lord Sundarabahu, she asked us to reach Sri Venkatachalapathi. This she did to create the faith that God exists in all forms. By whatever name one calls, He is there for us, dwelling on the seven hills as Srinivasa or Lord Balaji in Tirumala, the God of the Kali Yuga, the primeval cause of the creation, the husband of Lakshmi Devi who is Srimannarayana. In order to remind us of this, [[Andal]] prayed, so we might be able to do service in the temple of [[Venkateshwara]].

According to the poem the symbolic undertone behind Andal’s entreaty to her friends to wake up and seek Krishna subsumes the essence of the three basic mantras in the Vaishnava tradition — the Tirumantram, Dvayam and Charama Sloka that signify the truth of the paramatma or the Supreme being who dwells in everything. There is a hidden meaning in the 27th pasuram, for example, where [[Andal]] explains the importance of an acharya whose guidance is mandatory for a disciple to get these trio of mantras. If the meaning is taken literally, it appears that Kodhai Devi is asking for some of the ornaments for the vratham, but in there explains the importance of these three mantras in a symbolic way. Every pasuram has this detailed undertone which must actually be realized.

Tiruppavai is said to be 'Vedam Anaithukkum Vithagum', meaning it is the seed of the vedam. As the entire tree and the trees coming from it are hidden in the subtle seed, so is the entire essence of vedam hidden in Tiruppavai which can be revealed only under the guidance of an acharya or a guru who is well versed in vedic scriptures.

This entire hidden essence is mentioned in the Andal's verses in the form of poetry.

==Pavai Genre==
Thiruppavai belongs to the Pavai genre of songs, a unique Tamil tradition sung in the context of the Pavai vow (Vratham or ritual) observed throughout the month of ''Margazhi''. Sri [[Vaishnava]]s sing these stanzas every day of the year in the temple as well as in their homes. This practice assumes special significance during ''[[Tamil calendar|Margazhi]]'': each day of this month gets its name from one of the thirty verses. There are references to this vow in the late-sangam era Tamil musical anthology ''Paripadal''.&lt;ref name="paavai"&gt;{{cite news| title=''Paavai genre of songs''| work=[http://www.ntyo.org ntyp.org]| url=http://www.ntyo.org/kolangal/thiruppavai.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228234503/http://www.ntyo.org/kolangal/thiruppavai.htm| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-12-28| accessdate=2007-07-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andal]]'s thirty songs contain the cardinal principles of [[Vaishnava]] dharma during the month of ''[[Tamil calendar|Marghazhi]]''. Vaishnavas sing these songs to bring peace, prosperity and Divine Grace. Andal assumes the guise of a cowherd in these 30 verses. Andal appears intent upon performing a particular religious vow to marry the Lord, thereby obtain His everlasting company, and inviting all her girl-friends to join her. Towards the end we learn that she did not actually perform a religious rite; but is simply praying to be granted the service of the Lord for eternity. She yearns for everlasting happiness and service of the Lord.

==Overview==
The first five stanzas provide an introduction to the main theme, its principle and purpose. According to Andal one should give up luxuries during this season. Sincere prayers to the God would bring abundant rain and thus prosperity. Offering Lord Krishna fresh flowers would expiate sins committed earlier and those that may be committed in future.

In the next ten stanzas she describes the importance of community participation. She invites her friends to gather flowers. She essays the ambience at her village, the chirping of birds, colorful blossoms, the musical sound of butter-churning, herds of cattle with tinkling bells, the sounding of the conch from the temple.

She visits each household and awakens all her friends to join her for a bath in a nearby pond. She also praises the incarnations of the Lord. The next five stanzas describe her visit to the temple accompanied by her friends. She desires to render ''Suprabhata'' gently to wake up the Lord. The group appeases the temple guards, enters the temple and recites prayers extolling the parents of  Lord Krishna and begging them to wake up Krishna and Balarama. Then they approach Neela Devi, the consort of the Lord, to have a ''darshan''.

The last nine stanzas are on the glories of the Lord. On receiving his blessings Andal lists her demands; milk for the ''vrata'', white conch, lamps, flowers, and rich costume and jewellery, plenty of ghee and butter. The concluding stanza is an ''envoie'' identifying her as the daughter of Vishnucittar who made this garland of 30 pasurams and says those who recite with devotion will have Lord’s blessings.

==Verses and Explanation==

The Thiruppavai also includes 3 thaniyans (literally, 'singletons' or stand alone verses) composed by later authors to introduce older texts. The first tanniyan, 'Nila tungastana ... ' in Sanskrit was composed by Parasara Pattar, and the next two tanniyans, 'Anna vayal pudhuvai ... '  and "Choodi kodutha..." (translated below) were composed by Sri Uyyakondar.

'''Thaniyan'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/ramachander/Thiruppavai.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a song which is a prelude to Tiruppavai and is generally termed as taniyan or "that which stands separately".

Andal from the swan filled Puduvai,&lt;br /&gt;
Sang she, in her sweet voice,&lt;br /&gt;
Several enchanting sweet odes,&lt;br /&gt;
For being sung during,&lt;br /&gt;
The worship and adulation of Pavai.&lt;br /&gt;
They are but  a garland to him,&lt;br /&gt;
From her who wore them first,&lt;br /&gt;
Before presenting them to Him.

Each Pasuram(ode to Gods) of Thiruppavai is generally named by the first few words of the poem.These are given first and a translation into verse given then:-

==Recital in Thailand==

In Thailand, an annual [[Giant Swing]] ceremony known as ''Triyampavai-Tripavai'' was held in major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=M. E. Manickavasagom Pillai |title=Dravidian Influence in Thai Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soFCAAAAYAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Tamil University |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two Tamil Hindu chants: ''[[Thiruvempavai]]'' (a Shaivite hymn by [[Manikkavacakar]]) and ''Thiruppavai''. It is known that Tamil verses from ''Thiruvempavai'' — ''poet pratu sivalai'' ("opening the portals of Shiva's home") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai king]].&lt;ref name="Upendra_1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Upendra Thakur |title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1986 |publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-207-9 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consider Our Vow: Translation of Tiruppāvai and Tiruvempāvai Into English |author=Norman Cutler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMOAAAAMAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Muttu Patippakam |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*''Thiruppavai'' is also recited in [[Thailand]]. The last two stanzas (of the 30 verses) are recited in Tamil along with Thiruvampavi during coronation of the [[Rama (King of Thailand)]].&lt;ref name="coronation"&gt;{{cite news| title=''Coronation of Thai king''| work=[http://www.ntyo.org ntyp.org]| url=http://www.ntyo.org/kolangal/thiruppavai.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228234503/http://www.ntyo.org/kolangal/thiruppavai.htm| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-12-28| accessdate=2007-07-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Udiya Baba''' (1875 – 1948), ([[Devanagari]]: उड़िया बाबा) was a [[Hindu saint]] and [[guru]]. He was a teacher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and was regarded to be a ''[[Paramahansa]]''. He was a ''Parivrajaka'', i.e. one who does not stay in any one place for too long. He would walk all along the banks of [[Ganges]], moving from one place to another. Udiya means one who hails from [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. Baba means a ''[[Sadhu]]''.  Sometime during 1937-38, he came to [[Vrindavan]] and an ashram named Shri Krishna [[Ashram]] (also known as Oriya Baba [[Ashram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=OXXXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=oriya+baba|title=Temples Of Vrindaban|last=Das|first=R. K.|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Sandeep Prakashan|isbn=9788185067476|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was constructed by his disciples as a place for his permanent stay. He was a contemporary of the very well known Hindu saints - [[Anandamayi Ma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=OfUoAAAAYAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=udiya+baba|title=Bhakti in Religions of the World: With Special Reference to Dr. Ṣri Bānkey Behāriji|last=Lala|first=Chhaganlal|date=1986-01-01|publisher=B.R.

== Birth ==

He was born at [[Jagannath Puri]] in 1875 of ''[[Vikram Samvat]]'', on ''Bhadrapada Krishna Saptami'', on Monday, at noon. That was the day of [[Krishna]] ''[[Janmashtami]]'' for ''[[Smartas]]''. The year was 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n63/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br. Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnanda Trust Samiti.|date=2014-08-16|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's name was Shri Vaidyanath Mishra who was a direct descendant of Shri Kashi Mishra who lived during the time of Chaitanya Maha Prabhu and was an ardent desiciple of the same. His childhood name of was Artatrana, which is one of the names of Lord Vishnu meaning 'protector of those in distress'.

== Education ==

From the age of four to twelve, he learnt to read and write Oriya language, mathematics as well as some knowledge of Sanskrit at home. He was enthusiastic to learn more so one day he left his home without informing anyone and reached a place called Balyabeda, where he studied [[Sanskrit]] for five years and passed a course of ''Kavya-teertha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n73/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br.

== Penance for a social cause ==

[[Orissa, India|Orissa]] had a severe famine. Thousands of people were dying due to starvation. He therefore decided to serve the needy, but soon realized that in spite of his herculean efforts, he could not improve the situation much. He felt deeply saddened by his inability to help people at large. It was then that he thought of obtaining the mythological ''Akshaya Patra''. A bowl which can yield unlimited supply of food and which is inexhaustible. ''Akshaya Patra'' is also called as ''Annapoorna [[Siddhi]]'', which is believed to be bestowed by [[Annapoorna devi]], the Hindu mythological goddess of food and nourishment, and his devotees believed he possessed this mystic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=WWQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=udiya+baba|title=The Splendour of Vrindavan, Saint Ushaji|last=Bhaktivijay|first=Sadhu|last2=Suri|first2=S. N.|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Vraj Nidhi Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One finds the description of such magical bowl in the epic [[Mahabharata]]. [[Krishna]] had gifted it to [[Draupadi]] during her exile with the [[Pandava]]s. To obtain such a bowl he decided to do penance i.e. ''[[tapasya]]''. He left his home on the 5th day of ''[[Chaitra]]'' month, of 1951 ''[[Vikram Samvat]]'' era, towards goddess [[Kamakhya]] temple in [[Guwahati]] in [[Assam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n79/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br. Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnananda Trust Samiti|year=2014|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India..|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay there, he happened to listen to a discourse on a treatise of [[Advaita Vedanta]] called  '[[Viveka Chudamani]]'. Inspired by the knowledge of [[Nondualism]] his views were transformed and he started to question the very motive of his penance. He thought, what will he gain even if the goddess granted him his wish of obtaining the Akshaya Patra. How many people would he be able to benefit, and how long would he, for that matter, going to live on this planet, besides would all the problems of people be solved by finding food alone?? Therefore, he discontinued his penance and traveled to [[Varanasi|Kashi]] and then back home to [[Jagannath Puri]].

== Vow of celibacy ==

After coming home, he met and persuaded [[Swami]] Shri Madhusudan Tirth who was the [[Jagadguru]] and [[Shankaracharya]] of Govardhana Peetham at [[Jagannath Puri]], to give him ''Naishthik'' ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' ''[[Diksha]]'' i.e. initiation into lifelong celibacy. Then he was given a new name of ''Brahmachari'' Vasudeva Swarup. His age was 22 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n85/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br. Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnananda Trust Samiti.|date=2014-08-16|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India.|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pilgrimage ==

Soon he decided to take a pilgrimage for searching an accomplished '''[[siddha]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or [[Guru]]. He wandered and searched out entire India from Benares i.e Kashi to Rameshwaram. During this journey, he experienced many miracles and spiritual wonders, met many ''[[sadhu]]s'', [[mahant]]s and spiritual men. After staying in [[Rameswaram|Rameshwaram]] for 10 days, he visited [[Pandharpur]], [[Pune|Poona]], [[Mumbai]], and then reached [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]]. But no matter where he searched, he could not find any true ''[[siddha]]''. After such a long pilgrimage which he throughout did walking, he returned to Govardhana Math in [[Jagannath Puri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n91/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br.Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnanada Trust Samiti|date=2014-08-16|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India.|pages=65–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vow of renunciation ==

He accepted ''[[Sannyasa]]'' from [[Swami]] Shri Madhusudan Tirth, the [[Jagadguru]] and [[Shankaracharya]] of Govardhana Peetham at [[Jagannath Puri]], at the age of 32, in 1964 of ''[[Vikram Samvat]]''. Then he received a new name as [[Swami]] Purnananda Tirtha, since he was also carrying a staff, he was called ''[[Dandi Swami]]'' Purnananda Tirtha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n125/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br.Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnananda Trust Samiti.|date=2014-08-16|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India.|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==

Udiya Baba would teach people according to their natural inclinations. He would teach a follower of ''[[Bhakti]]'' the secrets of devotion as well as to a follower of ''[[Jnana]]'' by helping him understand the true nature of [[Brahman]]. He would keep the students of these two paths separate, saying that one should proceed in whatever path one is naturally inclined to. He would say it was difficult for common people to understand texts like [[Yoga Vasistha]], therefore for such people, he would make arrangements for [[Ramayana]], [[Bhagvad Gita]], [[Bhagavatam]]. Along with ''[[Vairagya]]'' i.e dispassion, he would stress the importance of practice or [[Sādhanā]]. Regarding practice, he would say, referring to his own experience that what is only the Pure Consciousness appears, to be a hard physical body due to constant wrong thinking. This is the effect of practice! Therefore it is necessary to constantly practice the opposite thinking. He used to say, there are three stages of practice, first understanding oneself to be different from the physical body. When this practice becomes perfect, one develops the identification with the [[subtle body]]. Second, after this, experiencing the detachment from the objects of senses. As a result of this practice, the vision shifts from the [[subtle body]] and abides in the [[causal body]], then thirdly comes the experience of separation from pain and pleasure. With this practice the vision or identification shifts from all the four functions of the mind and abides in the Self. He always said one must accept everyone as he or she is, without any desire to change anyone in the slightest.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pPHeEp06uh4C&amp;pg=PA786&amp;dq=oriya+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvrP8jqvMAhXQcI4KHedKBkoQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=oriya%20baba&amp;f=false|title=Chinmayi|last=Anubhavananda|first=Swami|date=2012-07-11|publisher=Swami Anubhavananda|isbn=9781938843013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

In the afternoon of ''[[Chaitra]]'' ''Krishna Chaturdasi'' of 2005 ''[[Vikram Samvat]]'', the date being 8th May 1948, he was fatally assaulted by a deranged man named Thakur Das.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/HamaareShreeMaharajJi/Hamaare%20Shree%20Maharaj%20Ji#page/n615/mode/2up|title=Hamare Shri Maharaj Ji|last=Swami Sanatanadev|first=Br.Shivanand 'Anjaneya'|publisher=Shri Purnananda Trust Samiti.|date=2014-08-16|isbn=|location=Vrindavan, Mathura, India.|pages=588–589}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mortal body was given a ''Jala [[Samadhi]]'' i.e. immersion in the holy waters of [[Yamuna]].

'''Yaakov Mutzafi''' ([[Hebrew]]:יעקב מוצפי ''Ya'aqov Muṣafi''; 1899 - May 25, 1983) was the [[Av Beth Din]] of the [[Sephardi]] [[Edah HaChareidis|Edah HaHaredith]], a [[Kabbalist]], and the [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] [[rabbi]] of Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. He was the last spiritual leader of the ancient [[Jewish]] community of [[Iraq]], which was airlifted to Israel in 1952.

== Early life and marriage ==
Yaakov Mutzafi was born in [[Baghdad]], [[Ottoman Iraq]], the son of Ezra Mutzafi and Mazal Tov. He received an early [[Torah]] education from his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Mutzafi, and his primary education at [[Midrash Talmud Torah]] alongside his life-long friend and colleague [[Silman Mutzafi]]. For his secondary education, Mutzafi was enrolled at [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]], where he received instruction from [[Ephraim HaCohen]], [[Shimon Agassi]], and [[Sadqa Hussein]], the latter with whom Mutzafi would share a lifetime of collaboration. He was later to be the student of [[Yehuda Fatiyah]].

Mutzafi married the daughter of Rabbi Sasson Dangour, founder of [[Yeshiva]]th Dorshei Torah, where he would subsequently continue his studies alongside [[Silman Hugi Aboudi]].

== Final years in Iraq ==
{{Main|Farhud}}
The winds of war that were blowing in Europe in the late 1930s were about to leave their marks on the faraway [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The British-backed monarchy was coming under increased pressure from pro-German Arab nationalists who were constantly agitating against the royal government, with Jews and other minorities caught in the middle.

The building political pressure boiled over into a bloody [[pogrom]] against the Jews in Baghdad on June 1–2, 1941, which became known as the farhud. Over 180 Jews were killed, with many more injured in the violence. Mutzafi raced to open up the gates of Midrash Bet Zilkha to the surviving Jews who were evicted from their homes, and arranged for their upkeep via donations received from philanthropists in the community.&lt;ref&gt;''Hakhmei Bavel'', Hebrew; Yeshivath Hod Yosef Publishing House, ppg. 229-230&lt;/ref&gt;

== Move to Jerusalem ==
[[File:Shemesh Sedaqa.jpg|thumb|right| Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue in 2016]]
{{Main|Operation Ezra and Nehemiah}}
With the tumultuous years of [[World War II]] over, the final chapter of the [[History of the Jews in Iraq]] was about to be written. With the founding of the new State of Israel, Jewish life in the [[Arab world]] was becoming more precarious by the day. Ever the pragmatist, Mutzafi understood that the wheels of history were turning fast, but without a favorable outcome for the community he so adored. Although he spent countless hours tending to the spiritual needs of a downtrodden people, he reasoned that there would be no viable future for the Jews in Iraq. He had previously spent one month visiting with his former teacher Sadqa Hussein in Jerusalem, and in 1950 he finally moved there. He immediately took up scholarly residence at Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue, where he was to serve as [[hazzan]] and [[Rosh yeshiva]], at first under the wing of his master. Upon the latter's death in 1961, Mutzafi inherited the full mantle of spiritual leadership of the transplanted community in Israel. Mutzafi would be seen in flowing [[jellabiya]] and [[fez]] giving council and administering blessings to Jews of various persuasions in the [[Beit Yisrael]] neighborhood.

== Politics ==
Mutzafi served as [[Av Beth Din]] of the Sephardi [[Edah HaChareidis|Edah HaHaredith]], an organization more closely associated with the [[anti-Zionist]] rabbis of the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Old yishuv]]. Mutzafi shared the same beliefs as his fellows in the Edah regarding their disassociation from the [[Israeli government]], most notably regarding the ban on taking part in elections to the [[Knesset]],&lt;ref&gt;Ifergan, Shimon; [http://www.mako.co.il/news-israel-elections/elections-2015-articles/Article-22c3ce0751adb41006.htm "Worry in the Religious Parties Over Loss of Seats Due To Boycott Of Elections"], Hebrew; Mako.co.il&lt;/ref&gt; even encouraging participation in [[Neturei Karta]] demonstrations.

== Death ==
Yaakov Mutzafi died in 1983, at the age of 83. He was buried at the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.179.112.80/TheMountOfOlives/ObjectCards/frmDeceasedDetails.aspx?Deceased=14985&amp;TabIndex=1 Grave Information for Yaakov Mutzafi], Hebrew&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Mutzafi was a mentor to [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]] [[Mordechai Eliyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harav.org/Torato/ArticleDetail.asp?ID=4209 "Clear the Blockages"], Hebrew; Harav.org&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Jerusalem Municipality]] named a street in the [[Ramat Shlomo]] neighborhood in [[East Jerusalem]] after Mutzafi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.b144.co.il/ Map of Jerusalem מפת-ירושלים/הרב-מוצפי-יעקב]&lt;/ref&gt; as did the city of [[Beitar Illit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.co.il/80191227/27990/ Map of Beitar Illit], Hebrew&lt;/ref&gt;
