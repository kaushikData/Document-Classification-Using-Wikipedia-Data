==History==
[[File:Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant ground-breaking ceremony 07.jpg|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;[[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] (left) and [[Vladimir Putin]] at the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant ground-breaking ceremony on 3 April 2018&lt;center&gt;]]
In May 2010, Russia and Turkey signed an agreement that a subsidiary of [[Rosatom]] — Akkuyu NGS Elektrik Uretim Corp. (APC: Akkuyu Project Company) — would build, own, and operate a power plant at Akkuyu comprising four 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW [[VVER]] units.&lt;ref name=wnn130510&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement was ratified by the Turkish Parliament in July 2010.&lt;ref name=wnn150710&gt;

In 2013, Russian nuclear construction company [[Atomstroyexport]] (ASE) and Turkish construction company Ozdogu signed the site preparation contract for the proposed Akkuyu nuclear power plant. The contract includes excavation work at the site.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!---- ==Earthquake risks ==
[[File:Turkey seismic hazard.jpg|thumb|Turkey [[seismic hazard]] map]] The government chose the Akkuyu site because of the low population density and low risk of [[earthquake]]s.{{citation needed}}  
[[Seismic hazard]] in Mersin Province, in terms of [[peak ground acceleration]] with a 10% chance of being exceeded (or a 90% chance of not being exceeded) within the next 50 years, is a 1.6 %g (percent of [[gravity]]) [[peak ground acceleration|peak acceleration]].{{citation needed}} 
---------------------------&gt;

==Finance==
Financing is provided by Russian investors, with 93% from a [[Rosatom]] subsidiary.  Up to 49% of shares may be sold later to other investors.&lt;ref name=nei-20121203&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurea-case-study-of-a-russian-international-project-turkey-s-akkuyu-project/ |title=A case study of a Russian international project: Turkey's Akkuyu project |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential investors are Turkish companies Park Teknik and [[Elektrik Üretim]].&lt;ref name=wnn250211/&gt;

Turkish Electricity Trade and Contract Corporation (TETAS) has guaranteed the purchase of 70% power generated from the first two units and 30% from the third and fourth units over a 15-year [[power purchase agreement]]. Electricity will be purchased at a price of 12.35 US cents per kW·h and the remaining power will be sold in the open market by the producer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==
The most important objection is that Büyükeceli and the surrounding coastline may lose its touristic potential after the realization of the project.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Büyükeceli residents are also worried that the already low population of the town may further decrease and the town may lose its township status. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} 
However, the president of the township's commercial counsel Alper Gursoy also added that nuclear energy is necessary for Turkey's economy and that the construction of such a large plant may benefit the town economically.&lt;ref&gt; 
https://m.haberler.com/mersin-de-yapilmasi-planlanan-nukleer-santral-2081741-haberi/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2011 a human chain was formed in Mersin to protest the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aktuela.com/gundem/mersinde-nukleere-karsi-insan-zinciri-11016.html |title=Online news |language=tr |access-date=9 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323063317/http://www.aktuela.com/gundem/mersinde-nukleere-karsi-insan-zinciri-11016.html |archive-date=23 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned that there would be 30 locations to form chains along the highway connecting Mersin to Akkuyu. But the participation was higher than the expected and several of these chains were merged with. The east end of the chain was in Mersin midtown and it reached some {{convert|20|km}} west along the highway uninterrupted. Also the settlements at the west including the district centers of [[Silifke]] and [[Erdemli]] as well as [[Büyükeceli]], the town nearest to construction site participated. "''The [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]] proved how dangerous nuclear technology'' is," said Sabahat Aslan, a spokesperson for the Mersin Anti-Nuclear Platform. “''We organized this protest to say ‘no’ to nuclear power plants, which will put future generations in danger''.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=human-chain-against-nuclear-plan-in-akkuyu-2011-04-17 Hürriyet newspaper English edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2015, it was reported that the signatures of specialists on a government-sanctioned environmental impact report had been forged. The specialists had resigned six months prior to its submission, and the contracting company had then made unilateral changes to the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signatures on nuclear power plant environmental impact report forged |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_signatures-on-nuclear-power-plant-environmental-impact-report-forged_369563.html |accessdate=18 January 2015 |work=Today's Zaman |date=12 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117090216/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_signatures-on-nuclear-power-plant-environmental-impact-report-forged_369563.html |archivedate=17 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation sparked protest in [[North Nicosia]]. The construction of the Akkuyu plant is controversial in [[Cyprus]], due to its close proximity to the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lefkoşa’da Nükleer Karşıtı Yürüyüş: 'Akkuyu’da Nükleer En Çok Bizi Etkiler' |url=http://www.gazeddakibris.com/lefkosada-nukleer-karsiti-yuruyus-akkuyuda-nukleer-en-cok-bizi-etkiler/ |accessdate=18 January 2015 |work=Gazeddakıbrıs |date=17 January 2015 |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118162519/http://www.gazeddakibris.com/lefkosada-nukleer-karsiti-yuruyus-akkuyuda-nukleer-en-cok-bizi-etkiler/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction stoppage rumors ==
On 9 December 2015, the news agency [[Reuters]] reported that Rosatom stopped construction work at the power plant and that Turkey was assessing other potential candidates for the project.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; But Rosatom and the Turkish Energy and Natural Resource Ministry promptly refuted the statement.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Despite tensions mounted between Russia and Turkey, due to the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown|Turkish downing of Russian Airplane on November 24 (2015)]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated that the decision to continue is purely a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;

This phenomenon is named after the American physicist [[P. W. Anderson]], who was the first to suggest that electron localization is possible in a lattice potential, provided that the degree of [[Randomness#In the physical sciences|randomness]] (disorder) in the lattice is sufficiently large, as can be realized for example in a semiconductor with [[impurities]] or [[crystallographic defect|defects]].&lt;ref name=a58&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Anderson | first = P.

Anderson localization is a general wave phenomenon that applies to the transport of electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, quantum waves, spin waves, etc. This phenomenon is to be distinguished from [[weak localization]], which is the precursor effect of Anderson localization (see below), and from [[Mott transition|Mott localization]], named after Sir [[Nevill Mott]], where the transition from metallic to insulating behaviour is ''not'' due to disorder, but  to  a strong mutual [[Coulomb repulsion]] of  electrons. It is shown that strong disorder can be employed to obtain high-quality [[wavefront]] due to the Anderson localization phenomenon in a [[doi:10.1364/OL.37.002304|transverse Anderson localizing optical fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abaie|first=Behnam|last2=Peysokhan|first2=Mostafa|last3=Zhao|first3=Jian|last4=Antonio-Lopez|first4=Jose E.|last5=Amezcua-Correa|first5=Rodrigo|last6=Schülzgen|first6=Axel|last7=Mafi|first7=Arash|date=2018-08-20|title=Disorder-induced high-quality wavefront in an Anderson localizing optical fiber|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-8-984|journal=Optica|language=EN|volume=5|issue=8|pages=984–987|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.5.000984|issn=2334-2536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In the original '''Anderson tight-binding model''', the evolution of  the [[wave function]] ''&amp;psi;'' on the ''d''-dimensional lattice '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is given by the [[Schrödinger equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; i \hbar \dot{\psi} = H \psi~, &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] ''H'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; (H \phi)(j) = E_j \phi(j) + \sum_{k \neq j} V(|k-j|) \phi(k)~,  &lt;/math&gt;

with ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; random and independent, and potential ''V''(''r'') falling off as ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at infinity. For example, one may take ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; uniformly distributed in [&amp;minus;''W'', &amp;nbsp; +''W''], and

:&lt;math&gt; V(|r|) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; |r| = 1 \\ 0, &amp;\text{otherwise.} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Starting with ''&amp;psi;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; localised at the origin, one is interested in how fast the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2&lt;/math&gt; diffuses. Anderson's analysis shows the following:

* if ''d'' is 1 or 2 and ''W'' is arbitrary, or if ''d'' &amp;ge; 3 and ''W''/ħ is sufficiently large, then the probability distribution remains localized:

::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^d} |\psi(t,n)|^2 |n| \leq C &lt;/math&gt;

:uniformly in ''t''. This phenomenon is called '''Anderson localization'''.

* if ''d'' &amp;ge; 3 and ''W''/ħ is small,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^d} |\psi(t,n)|^2 |n| \approx D \sqrt{t}~, &lt;/math&gt;

:where ''D'' is the diffusion constant.

==Analysis==
[[File:WF111-Anderson transition-multifractal.jpeg|thumbnail|Example of a multifractal electronic eigenstate at the Anderson localization transition in a system with 1367631 atoms.]]

The phenomenon of Anderson localization, particularly that of weak localization, finds its origin in the [[wave interference]] between multiple-scattering paths. In the strong scattering limit, the severe interferences can completely halt the waves inside the disordered medium.

For non-interacting electrons, a highly successful approach was put forward in 1979 by Abrahams ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=E.|last2=Anderson|first2=P.W.|last3=Licciardello|first3=D.C.|last4=Ramakrishnan|first4=T.V.|title=Scaling Theory of Localization: Absence of Quantum Diffusion in Two Dimensions|year=1979|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=42|issue=10|pages=673&amp;ndash;676|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.673|bibcode = 1979PhRvL..42..673A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scaling hypothesis of localization suggests that a disorder-induced [[metal-insulator transition]] (MIT) exists for non-interacting electrons in three dimensions (3D) at zero magnetic field and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Much further work has subsequently supported these scaling arguments both analytically and numerically (Brandes ''et al.'', 2003; see Further Reading). In 1D and 2D, the same hypothesis shows that there are no extended states and thus no MIT. However, since 2 is the lower critical dimension of the localization problem, the 2D case is in a sense close to 3D: states are only marginally localized for weak disorder and a small [[spin-orbit coupling]] can lead to the existence of extended states and thus an MIT. Consequently, the localization lengths of a 2D system with potential-disorder can be quite large so that in numerical approaches one can always find a localization-delocalization transition when either decreasing system size for fixed disorder or increasing disorder for fixed system size. 


Most numerical approaches to the localization problem use the standard tight-binding Anderson [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] with onsite-potential disorder. Characteristics of the electronic [[eigenstate]]s are then investigated by studies of participation numbers obtained by exact diagonalization, multifractal properties, level statistics and many others. Especially fruitful is the [[transfer-matrix method]] (TMM) which allows a direct computation of the localization lengths and further validates the scaling hypothesis by a numerical proof of the existence of a one-parameter scaling function. Direct numerical solution of Maxwell equations to demonstrate Anderson localization of light has been implemented (Conti and Fratalocchi, 2008).


Recent work has shown that a non-interacting Anderson localized system can become [[Many body localization|many-body localized]] even in the presence of weak interactions. This result has been rigorously proven in 1D, while perturbative arguments exist even for two and three dimensions. 

==Experimental evidence==
Two reports of Anderson localization of light in 3D random media exist up to date (Wiersma ''et al.'', 1997 and Storzer ''et al.'', 2006; see Further Reading), even though absorption complicates interpretation of experimental results (Scheffold ''et al.'', 1999). Anderson localization can also be observed in a perturbed periodic potential where the transverse localization of light is caused by random fluctuations on a photonic lattice. Experimental realizations of transverse localization were reported for a 2D lattice (Schwartz ''et al.'', 2007) and a 1D lattice (Lahini ''et al.'', 2006). Transverse Anderson localization of light has also been demonstrated in an optical fiber medium (Karbasi ''et al.'', 2012) and a biological medium (Choi ''et al.'', 2018), and has also been used to transport images through the fiber (Karbasi ''et al.'', 2014). It has also been observed by localization of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] in a 1D disordered optical potential (Billy ''et al.'', 2008; Roati ''et al.'', 2008). Anderson localization of elastic waves in a 3D disordered medium has been reported (Hu ''et al.'', 2008). The observation of the MIT has been reported in a 3D model with atomic matter waves (Chabé ''et al.'', 2008). The MIT, associated with the nonpropagative electron waves has been reported in a cm sized crystal (Ying ''et al.'', 2016) [[Random laser]]s can operate using this phenomenon.

== Comparison with diffusion ==
Standard diffusion has no localization property, being in disagreement with quantum predictions. However, it turns out that it is based on approximation of the [[principle of maximum entropy]], which says that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy. This approximation is repaired in [[Maximal Entropy Random Walk]], also repairing the disagreement: it turns out to lead to exactly the quantum ground state stationary probability distribution with its strong localization properties.&lt;ref name=prl&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.160602 Z.

Depending of implied standards, this measure may represent different value of energy content.

According to the standard defined by the International Energy Agency, the gas physical volume is used, which is measured at the temperature of {{convert|15|°C}} at atmospheric pressure. According to the Russian standard, the gas volume is measured at {{convert|20|°C}}. That means that 1 billion [[cubic metre]]s of natural gas by the International Energy Agency standard is equivalent to 1.017 billion cubic metres of natural gas by the Russian standard.&lt;ref name=weo2011/&gt;

Some other organizations use an energy equivalent-based standards. [[BP]] uses a standard which is equivalent to {{convert|41.87|PJ}} per billion cubic metres.  [[Cedigaz]] uses a standard which is equivalent to {{convert|40|PJ}} per billion cubic metres.&lt;ref name=weo2011/&gt;

'''Bioinks''' are substances made of living cells that can be used for 3D printing of complex tissue models. Bioinks are materials that mimic an extracellular matrix environment to support the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of living cells. Bioinks distinguish themselves from traditional [[biomaterials]] such as [[hydrogels]], polymer networks, and foam scaffolds due to their ability to be deposited as filaments during an additive manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hospodiuk|first1=Monika|last2=Dey|first2=Madhuri|last3=Ozbolat|first3=Ibrahim|title=The bioink: A comprehensive review on bioprintable materials|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=Jan 3, 2017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, unlike traditional additive manufacturing materials such as thermoplastic polymers, ceramics, and metals which require the use of harsh solvents, cross-linking modalities and high temperatures to be printed, bioinks are processed under much milder conditions. These mild conditions are necessary to preserve compatibility with living cells, and prevent degradation of bioactive molecules and macroproteins. These bioinks are often adopted from existing hydrogel biomaterials and derived from natural polymers such as gelatins, alginates, fibrin, chitosan, and hyaluronic acids that are sensitive to their processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malda|first1=Jos|title=25th Anniversary Article: Engineering Hydrogels for Biofabrication|journal=Advanced Materials|date=2013|volume=25|issue=36|pages=5011–5028|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201302042/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the thermoplastics that are often utilized in traditional [[3D printing]], the chain entanglements and ionic interactions within the hydrogel-like &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Allan|title=Hydrogels for biomedical applications|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date=3 September 2002|volume=64|issue=Supplement|pages=18–23|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X12002700}}&lt;/ref&gt; bioink rather than temperature dominate shape fidelity.  The natural derivation of many bioinks often results in a high water content and sensitivity to harsh processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrow|first1=James|last2=Kerativitayanan|first2=Punyavee|last3=Jaiswal|first3=Manish|last4=Lokhande|first4=Giriraj|last5=Gaharwar|first5=Akhilesh|title=Polymers for Bioprinting|journal=Essentials of 3D Biofabrication and Translation|date=2015|pages=229–248|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Akhilesh_Gaharwar/publication/281108634_Polymers_for_Bioprinting/links/55d5e03708aec156b9a62768.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, bioink filaments are often deposited at or below human body temperature and under mild conditions to preserve bioink printability. Additional considerations must be taken into account when printing bioinks blended with a cell suspension due to the need to preserve cell viability.

Differences from traditional 3D printing materials

* Printed at a much lower temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C or below) 
* Mild cross-linking conditions 
* Natural derivation 
* Bioactive
* Cell manipulatable

== Printability ==
Bioink compositions and chemistries are often inspired and derived from existing hydrogel biomaterials. However, these hydrogel biomaterials were often developed to be easily pipetted and cast into well plates and other molds. Altering the composition of these hydrogels to permit filament formation is necessary for their translation as bioprintable materials. However, the unique properties of bioinks offer new challenges in characterizing material printability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hölzl|first1=Katja|last2=Lin|first2=Shengmao|last3=Tytgat|first3=Liesbeth|last4=Van Vlierberghe|first4=Sandra|last5=Gu|first5=Linxia|last6=Ovsianikov|first6=Aleksandr|title=Bioink properties before, during and after 3D bioprinting|journal=Biofabrication|date=September 23, 2016|volume=8|page=032002|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional 3D printing materials such as thermoplastics that are essentially 'fixed' once they are printed, bioinks are a dynamic system due to their high water contains and often non-crystalline structure. The shape fidelity of the bioink after filament deposition must also be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouyang|first1=Liliang|title=Effect of bioink properties on printability and cell viability for 3D bioplotting of embryonic stem cells|journal=Biofabrication|date=2016|volume=8|issue=3|page=035020|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/035020/meta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the printing pressure and nozzle diameter must be taken into account to minimize the shear stresses placed on the bioink and on any cells within the bioink during the printing process. Too high shear forces may damage or lyse cells, adversely affecting cell viability.

Important considerations in printability include:

* Uniformity in filament diameter
* Angles at the interaction of filaments
* "Bleeding" of filaments together at intersects
* Maintenance of shape fidelity after printing but before cross-linking
* Printing pressure and nozzle diameter

===Alginate-based===

[[Alginate]] is a naturally derived biopolymer from the cell wall of brown algae that  has been widely used as a biomaterial. Alginates are particularly suitable for bioprinting due to their mild cross-linking conditions via incorporation of divalent ions such as calcium. These materials have been adopted as bioinks through increasing their viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jia|first1=Jia|title=Engineering alginate as bioink for bioprinting|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|date=2014|volume=10|issue=10|pages=4323–4331|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706114002906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these alginate-based bioinks can be blended with other materials such as nanocellulose for application in tissues such as cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markstedt|first1=Kajsa|title=3D Bioprinting Human Chondrocytes with Nanocellulose–Alginate Bioink for Cartilage Tissue Engineering Applications|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=2015|volume=16|issue=5|pages=1489–1496|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biomac.5b00188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gelatin-based===

[[Gelatin]] has been widely utilized as a biomaterial for engineered tissues. The formation of gelatin scaffolds is dictated by the physical chain entanglements of the material which forms a gel at low temperatures. However, at physiological temperatures, the viscosity of gelatin drops significantly. Methacrylation of gelatin is a common approach for the fabrication of gelatin scaffolds that can be printed and maintain shape fidelity at physiological temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoch|first1=Eva|title=Chemical tailoring of gelatin to adjust its chemical and physical properties for functional bioprinting|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry B|date=2013|volume=1|pages=5675–5685|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlelanding/2013/tb/c3tb20745e#!divAbstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decellularized ECM-based===

Decellularized [[extracellular matrix]] based bioinks can be derived from nearly any mammalian tissue. However, often organs such as heart, muscle, cartilage, bone, and fat are decellularized, lyophilized, and pulverized, to created a soluble matrix that can then be formed into gels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pati|first1=Falguni|title=Printing three-dimensional tissue analogues with decellularized extracellular matrix bioink.|journal=Nature Communications|date=2014|issue=5|page=3935|pmid=24887553}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bioinks possess several advantages over other materials due to their derivation from mature tissue. These materials consist of a complex mixture of ECM structural and decorating proteins specific to their tissue origin. Therefore, dECM-derived bioinks are particularly tailored to provide tissue-specific cues to cells. Often these bioinks are cross-linked through thermal gelation or chemical cross-linking such as through the use of riboflavin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jang|first1=Jinah|title=Tailoring mechanical properties of decellularized extracellular matrix bioink by vitamin B2-induced photo-crosslinking.|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|date=2016|volume=33|pages=88–95|pmid=26774760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluronics===

[[Poloxamer|Pluronics]] have been utilized in printing application due to their unique gelation properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tirnaksiz|first1=Figen|title=Rheological, mucoadhesive and release properties of pluronic F-127 gel and pluronic F-127/polycarbophil mixed gel systems.|journal=Die Pharmazie|date=2005|volume=60|issue=7|pages=518–23|pmid=16076078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below physiological temperatures, the pluronics exhibit low viscosity. However, at physiological temperatures, the pluronics form a gel. However, the formed gel is dominated by physical interactions. A more permanent pluronic-based network can be formed through the modification of the pluronic chain with acrylate groups that may be chemically cross-linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Michael|title=Nanostructured Pluronic hydrogels as bioinks for 3D bioprinting|journal=Biofabrication|date=2015|volume=7|issue=3|page=035006|pmid=26260872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bisulfide''' (systematically named '''sulfanide''' and '''hydrogen(sulfide)(1−)''') is an [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[ion|anion]] with the [[chemical formula]] HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (also written as SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). It contributes no color to bisulfide salts, and its salts may have a distinctive putrid smell. It is classified as a strong base, bisulfide solutions are corrosive and attack the skin.

Bisulfide is the simplest thiolate. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, mainly used in textiles, synthetic flavors, coloring brasses, and iron control.

== Chemical properties ==

A variety of salts are known, including [[sodium hydrosulfide]] and [[potassium hydrosulfide]]. [[Ammonium hydrosulfide]], a component of "stink bombs" has not been isolated as a pure solid. Some compounds described as salts of the [[sulfide]] dianion contain primarily hydrosulfide. For example, the hydrated form of [[sodium sulfide]], nominally with the formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S{{Hydrate|9}}, is better described as NaSH&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;NaOH{{Hydrate|8}}.

Bisulfide is sometimes confused with the [[disulfide]] dianion, S{{su|b=2|p=2−}}, or &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;S–S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Basicity ===

The sulfanidyl segment (–S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) in thiolates such as bisulfide can assimilate a proton by recombination:
{{NumBlk|:|HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{H+}} → {{H2S|link=yes}}|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
Because of this capture of a [[proton]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), bisulfide has basic character. In aqueous solution, it has a primary [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] value of 6.9. Its [[conjugate acid]] is [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{H2S}}). However, bisulfide's basicity stems from its behavior as an [[Arrhenius base]]. A 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[molarity|M]] solution containing spectator-only counter ions, has a basic [[pH]], indicating that most of the bisulfide is unassociated.
{{NumBlk|:|{{big|HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{H2O}}}} {{EqmL}} {{big|{{H2S}} + {{OH-}}}}|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

=== Chemical reactions ===

Bisulfide undergoes the typical [[chemical reaction]]s of a thiolate. Upon treatment with a standard acid, it converts to [[hydrogen sulfide]] and metal salt. With strong acids, it can be doubly protonated to give {{Chem|H|3|S|+}}. Oxidation of bisulfide gives sulfate. When strongly heated, bisulfide salts decompose to produce [[sulfide]] salts and hydrogen sulfide.
{{NumBlk|:|2&amp;nbsp;HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{H2S}} + S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

=== Biochemistry ===

At physiological pH, hydrogen sulfide is usually fully ionized to bisulfide (HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) so in biochemical settings, "hydrogen sulfide" is often used to mean, bisulfide or hydrosulfide. Hydrosulfide has been identified as the third gasotransmitter along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Its specific role and direct interaction with [[signaling molecules]] is the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Pavlik, B. C. Noll, A. G. Oliver, C. E. Schulz, W. R. Scheidt, “Hydrosulfide (HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) Coordination in Iron Porphyrinates”, Inorganic Chemistry, 2010, vol. 49(3), 1017-1026.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other derivatives ==

SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[HSAB theory|soft]] anionic [[ligand]] that forms complexes with most metal ions. Examples include [Au(SH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(SH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, derived from [[gold(I) chloride]] and [[titanocene dichloride]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Peruzzini, M. |author2=de los Rios, I. |author3=Romerosa, A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Coordination Chemistry of transition metals with hydrogen chalcogenide and hydrogen chalcogenido ligands | journal = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 49 | pages = 169–543 | year = 2001 | doi =10.1002/9780470166512.ch3 | postscript = . | series = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-470-16651-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

Bisulfide salts are [[corrosive]] to skin and must, therefore, be handled with appropriate care, since it can cause skin burns, permanent eye damage, and irritation to the mucous membranes. Latex gloves offer no protection, so specially resistant gloves, such as those made of nitrile rubber, are worn when handling its salts. Due to incompatibilities, it is recommended to keep bisulfide salts away from acids, [[peroxides]], zinc, aluminum, copper and its alloys.

'''Chicago Pile-5''' ('''CP-5''') was the last of the line of Chicago Pile research [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] which started with [[Chicago Pile-1|CP-1]] in 1942.  The first reactor built on the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]-East site, it operated from 1954-1979.&lt;ref name="cp5"&gt;[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/hwr-gr.shtml Heavy Water and Graphite Reactors: CP-5], Argonne National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

CP-5 was a [[thermal-neutron reactor]] using [[enriched uranium]] as fuel and [[heavy water]] as coolant and as a neutron moderator.  It produced neutrons for use in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Wiese | first =Edward C. |author2=Rose, Robert W. | title =Large Scale Demonstration Project At Argonne National Laboratory’s CP-5 Reactor | publisher =University of Chicago as Operator of Argonne National Laboratory | date =June 1998 | url =http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10582-rjNIG2/webviewable/10582.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reactor had an output rating of 5 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Argonne Building 330 Demolition | publisher =FedBizOps.gov | date =August 24, 2009 | url =https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=76ebabb49f9135ed65186019f479b96f&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 | accessdate =2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanup and decommissioning of the site of CP-5 was started in 1991 completed in 2000.  The cleanup process included removal of all contaminated equipment and spent fuel, decontamination of the reactor vessel and associated plumbing, and removal of the spent fuel pool, reactor internals and the hot cell liner.

The '''Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER)''' is a "not-for-profit" organisation in which Europe’s national energy [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] voluntarily cooperate to protect consumer interests and to facilitate the creation of a single, competitive and sustainable internal market for gas and electricity in Europe.

==Foundation and mission==
In March 2000, ten national energy regulatory authorities voluntarily signed a "Memorandum of Understanding" for the establishment of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). The CEER’s objective is to facilitate cooperation among Europe’s energy regulators in promoting a single-EU electricity and gas market. In 2003 the CEER was formally established as a "not-for-profit association" under Belgian law, with its own Brussels-based Secretariat. The CEER represents 36 members - the national energy regulators from the EU Member States, Iceland and Norway as CEER Members, and the regulators of Switzerland, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova    and the Republic of Macedonia as Observers.

The CEER works closely with the [[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators]] (ACER).  ACER is a European Community body with legal personality. ACER became fully operational on 3 March 2011. Its seat is in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

==Objectives and functions==
CEER seeks to facilitate the creation of a single, competitive, efficient and sustainable market for gas and electricity in Europe.

Some other objectives:
*facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation of national regulatory authorities, contributing to a consistent application of legislation in all Member States;
*set up co-operation, information exchange and assistance amongst regulators;
*contribute to the advancement of research on regulatory issues

The CEER acts as a platform for cooperation, information exchange and assistance between national energy regulators and is their interface at European level with the EU Institutions.

The CEER establishes expert views for discussion with the [[European Commission]] (in particular [[Directorate-General for Transport and Energy (European Commission)|DG TREN]], [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|DG Competition]] and [[Directorate-General for Research (European Commission)|DG Research]]) and seeks to provide the necessary elements for the development of regulation in the fields of electricity and gas.

The CEER also strives to share regulatory experience worldwide through its links with similar regional energy regulatory associations. CEER has taken the lead role in developing the International Energy Regulation Network (IERN) web platform to facilitate the global exchange and analysis of information concerning electricity and natural gas market regulation.

==Members==
CEER membership is open to the national energy regulatory authorities of the European Union and the [[European Economic Area|European Economic Area (EEA)]].  The CEER has now 36 members, including energy regulators in the 28 EU-Member States plus Iceland and Norway - as well as 7 observers - the energy regulators from Switzerland, Montenegro, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Georgia and the Republic of Macedonia.

{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Some models}}
In [[physics]], an '''effective field theory''' is a type of approximation, or [[effective theory]], for an underlying physical theory, such as a [[quantum field theory]] or a [[statistical mechanics]] model. An effective field theory includes the appropriate [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] to describe physical phenomena occurring at a chosen [[length scale]] or energy scale, while ignoring substructure and degrees of freedom at shorter distances (or, equivalently, at higher energies). Intuitively, one averages over the behavior of the underlying theory at shorter length scales to derive what is hoped to be a simplified model at longer length scales. Effective field theories typically work best when there is a large separation between length scale of interest and the length scale of the underlying dynamics. Effective field theories have found use in [[particle physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[general relativity]], and [[hydrodynamics]]. They simplify calculations, and allow treatment of [[Dissipative system|dissipation]] and [[radiation]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.174301 |pmid=23679733|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/38643/1/PhysRevLett.110.174301.pdf|title=Classical Mechanics of Nonconservative Systems|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=110|issue=17|pages=174301|year=2013|last1=Galley|first1=Chad R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1402.2610|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|title = Radiation reaction at the level of the action|journal = International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume = 29|issue = 24|pages = 1450132|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 2014|doi = 10.1142/S0217751X14501322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The renormalization group==
Presently, effective field theories are discussed in the context of the [[renormalization group]] (RG) where the process of ''integrating out'' short distance degrees of freedom is made systematic. Although this method is not sufficiently concrete to allow the actual construction of effective field theories, the gross understanding of their usefulness becomes clear through an RG analysis. This method also lends credence to the main technique of constructing effective field theories, through the analysis of [[symmetry|symmetries]]. If there is a single mass scale '''M''' in the ''microscopic'' theory, then the effective field theory can be seen as an expansion in '''1/M'''. The construction of an effective field theory accurate to some power of '''1/M''' requires a new set of free parameters at each order of the expansion in '''1/M'''. This technique is useful for [[scattering]] or other processes where the maximum momentum scale '''k''' satisfies the condition '''k/M≪1'''. Since effective field theories are not valid at small length scales, they need not be [[Renormalization#Renormalizability|renormalizable]]. Indeed, the ever expanding number of parameters at each order in '''1/M''' required for an effective field theory means that they are generally not renormalizable in the same sense as [[quantum electrodynamics]] which requires only the renormalization of two parameters.

==Examples of effective field theories==
===Fermi theory of beta decay===
The best-known example of an effective field theory is the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi theory of beta decay]]. This theory was developed during the early study of weak decays of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] when only the [[hadron]]s and [[lepton]]s undergoing weak decay were known. The typical [[elementary particle reaction|reactions]] studied were:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
n &amp; \to p+e^-+\overline\nu_e \\
\mu^- &amp; \to e^-+\overline\nu_e+\nu_\mu.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This theory posited a pointlike interaction between the four [[fermion]]s involved in these reactions. The theory had great [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] success and was eventually understood to arise from the [[gauge theory]] of [[electroweak interaction]]s, which forms a part of the [[standard model]] of particle physics. In this more fundamental theory, the interactions are mediated by a [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]-changing [[gauge boson]], the W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;. The immense success of the Fermi theory was because the W particle has mass of about 80 [[GeV]], whereas the early experiments were all done at an energy scale of less than 10 [[MeV]]. Such a separation of scales, by over 3 orders of magnitude, has not been met in any other situation as yet.

===BCS theory of superconductivity===
Another famous example is the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]. Here the underlying theory is of [[electron]]s in a [[metal]] interacting with lattice vibrations called [[phonon]]s. The phonons cause attractive interactions between some electrons, causing them to form [[Cooper pair]]s. The length scale of these pairs is much larger than the wavelength of phonons, making it possible to neglect the dynamics of phonons and construct a theory in which two electrons effectively interact at a point. This theory has had remarkable success in describing and predicting the results of experiments on superconductivity.

===Effective Field Theories in Gravity ===
[[General relativity]] itself is expected to be the low energy effective field theory of a full theory of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[string theory]] or [[Loop Quantum Gravity]]. The expansion scale is the [[Planck mass]].
Effective field theories have also been used to simplify problems in General Relativity, in particular in calculating the [[gravitational wave]] signature of inspiralling finite-sized objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = hep-th/0409156|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|title = An Effective Field Theory of Gravity for Extended Objects|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 73|issue = 10|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 2004|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.73.104029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common EFT in GR is "[[Non-Relativistic General Relativity]]" (NRGR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/numrel-m08/buonanno/pdf1/Porto_NumRelData_KITP.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0712.4116|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|title = Non-Relativistic Gravitation: From Newton to Einstein and Back|journal =  Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume = 25|issue = 14|pages = 145011|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 2008|doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/25/14/145011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = gr-qc/0511061|last1 = Porto|first1 = Rafael A|title = Post-Newtonian corrections to the motion of spinning bodies in NRGR|journal =  Physical Review D|volume = 73|issue = 104031|pages = 104031|year = 2006|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.73.104031}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the [[post-Newtonian expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.88.104037|title = Theory of post-Newtonian radiation and reaction|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 88|issue = 10|pages = 104037|year = 2013|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|arxiv = 1305.6930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common GR EFT is the Extreme Mass Ratio (EMR), which in the context of the inspiralling problem is called [[Extreme mass ratio inspiral|EMRI]].

===Other examples===
Presently, effective field theories are written for many situations.
*One major branch of [[nuclear physics]] is [[quantum hadrodynamics]], where the interactions of [[hadron]]s are treated as a field theory, which should be derivable from the underlying theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Quantum hadrodynamics is the theory of the [[nuclear force]], similarly to quantum chromodynamics being the theory of the [[strong interaction]] and quantum electrodynamics being the theory of the [[electromagnetic force]]. Due to the smaller separation of length scales here, this effective theory has some classificatory power, but not the spectacular success of the Fermi theory.
*In [[particle physics]] the effective field theory of [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] called [[chiral perturbation theory]] has had better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = hep-ph/9311274|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|title = On the Foundations of Chiral Perturbation Theory|journal =  Annals of Physics|volume = 235|pages = 165–203|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 1994|doi = 10.1006/aphy.1994.1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory deals with the interactions of [[hadron]]s with [[pion]]s or [[kaon]]s, which are the [[Goldstone boson]]s of [[spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking]]. The expansion parameter is the [[pion]] energy/momentum.
*For [[hadron]]s containing one heavy [[quark]] (such as the [[bottom quark|bottom]] or [[Charm quark|charm]]), an effective field theory which expands in powers of the quark mass, called the [[heavy quark effective theory]] (HQET), has been found useful.
*For [[hadron]]s containing two heavy quarks, an effective field theory which expands in powers of the [[relative velocity]] of the heavy quarks, called [[non-relativistic QCD]] (NRQCD), has been found useful, especially when used in conjunctions with [[lattice QCD]].
*For [[hadron]] reactions with light energetic ([[collinear]]) particles, the interactions with low-energetic (soft) degrees of freedom are described by the [[soft-collinear effective theory]] (SCET).
*Much of [[condensed matter physics]] consists of writing effective field theories for the particular property of matter being studied.
*[[Hydrodynamics]] can also be treated using Effective Field Theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1211.6461|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|title = Dissipation in the effective field theory for hydrodynamics: First order effects|journal =  Physical Review D|volume = 88|issue = 10|pages = 105001|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|last4 = Wang|first4 = Junpu|year = 2013|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.88.105001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Moldova''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Moldova]].

[[Moldova]] lacks domestic sources of [[fossil energy]] and must import substantial amounts of [[petroleum]], [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and other energy resources.

[[Renewable energy]] is used in country primarily for [[electricity generation]] or heating. The projected share of [[renewable energy]] in 2020 in the gross final consumption of energy is 20%.&lt;ref name="sari-energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/3044025.PDF|date=27 December 2013|title=NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY ACTION PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA FOR 2013-2020|author=Moldova|accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moldova imports all of its supplies of [[petroleum]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]], largely from [[Russia]].

Moldova was an observer to the treaty establishing Energy Community from the outset (2006). Following its interest in full membership, the European Commission was mandated to carry out accession negotiations with Moldova in 2007. In December 2009, the Energy Community Ministerial Council decided on the accession, but made it conditional to amendment of Moldova's gas law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy-community.org/portal/page/portal/ENC_HOME/DOCS/488187/Conclusions%20of%20the%207th%20MC%20Meeting.pdf Energy Community Ministerial Council Conclusions, Dec 2009]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova joined the [[Energy Community]] as a full-fledged member in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy-community.org/portal/page/portal/ENC_HOME/DOCS/576178/Protocol%20on%20Accession%20of%20Moldova%20to%20the%20EnC.pdf Accession Protocol of Republic of Moldova to the Energy Community] {{Dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova, together with the other contracting parties, has the following tasks and obligations:
# Extension of the acquis communautaire into their national legislation
# Establishment of mechanism for network energy markets operations
# Creation of a single energy market

The Energy Community acquis communautaire consists of roughly 25 legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.energy-community.org/portal/page/portal/ENC_HOME/AREAS_OF_WORK/Obligations | title=Obligations | access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes key EU legal acts in the area of electricity, gas, oil, environment, energy efficiency, renewable energy resources and statistics. The treaty envisages that the main principles of EU competition policy are also applicable. The timeline for transposition and implementation is laid down by the treaty or by a Ministerial Council decision.

Moldova is a partner country of the [[European Union|EU]] [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], [[Technological convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, supporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting [[investment]] for energy projects of common and regional interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inogate.org|title= INOGATE | access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''environmentally-friendly red-light flare''' was a pyrotechnic (firework) flare which used lithium-based formulations that emitted red light. A [[flare]] is used for signaling, illumination, or defensive countermeasures in civilian or military applications. It is based on a non-hygroscopic (not absorbing air) dilithium nitrogen-rich salt that served as an oxidizer and red colorant. The [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Institution]] were credited as the research facilities for developing this product announced in January 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3134|title=Environmentally-safe red glare rocket changes fireworks, Soldier technology|last=Ellis|first=T'Jae|date=|work=ARL.Army.Mil|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==
As of 2018, this is the first documented red-light flare compound that is based on [[lithium]] and does not contain any [[Perchlorate|perchlorates]], [[Halogenation|halogenated]] materials, or [[strontium]]-based materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.machinedesign.com/materials/rockets-red-glare-just-got-little-cleaner|title=The Rockets’ Red Glare Just Got a Little Cleaner|last=Mraz|first=Stephen|date=January 22, 2018|work=Machine Design|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation was assessed as having high color quality. To achieve the red-light emission from the flare, the authors report a formulation mixture of powdered [[magnesium]] and [[hexamine]] as fuels, [[nitrocellulose]], an epoxy binder system, and lithium-based nitrogen salts as the [[oxidizer]] and color agent. When burned, users could observe a cool burning flame emitting a deep red color.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When the flares are burned, a chemical reaction involving [[strontium chloride]] (SrCl) occurs. SrCl emits the red color after the flare is ignited. This chemical compound is known as a metastable molecular emitter, meaning, it is not stable at low temperatures but stable in excited high-temperature combustion processes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-01-environmentally-safe-red-glare-rocket.html#jCp|title=Environmentally safe red glare rocket changes fireworks, soldier technology|last=US Army Research Laboratory|first=|date=January 3, 2018|work=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Before 2018, the formulations for red-light emitting pyrotechnic formulations included powdered metal fuels like magnesium, [[Aluminium|aluminum]], strontium nitrate and perchlorate oxidizers, as well as carbon-based chlorinated organic materials such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|poly(vinyl) chloride]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] made a decision to develop [[Environmental regulations|regulations]] on the amount of strontium present in [[Drinking water quality in the United States|drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/10/20/2014-24582/announcement-of-preliminary-regulatory-determinations-for-contaminants-on-the-third-drinking-water|title=Announcement of Preliminary Regulatory Determinations for Contaminants on the Third Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List|date=2014-10-20|work=Federal Register|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strontium had been detected in 99% of all public U.S. water systems and at levels of concern in 7%. The agency reported that strontium is potentially harmful to human health. This chemical replaces calcium in the bone, interferes with bone strength, and affects skeletal development. The U.S. military training grounds were not included in the above study; therefore, the presence or percentage of strontium in their water systems were unknown. However, strontium was identified to be present in the red flares and signaling fireworks available in 2014. Due to these finding, the developers of the environmentally friendly red-light flare concluded the development of the environmentally safe flares were a necessity for users.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Eolo''' is the first [[compressed air car]] invented by [[Guy Nègre]] and built by [[Motor Development International]] (MDI) which has licensed the patent for the construction to Eolo International (in Italy to Eolo Italia). It was unveiled during the 2001 [[Bologna Motor Show]] car and bike fair. An attempt to put it into production ran out of steam in 2003.

==How it works==
The car utilizes air expansion as an energy source by releasing compressed air from tanks with an extremely cold internal temperature and [[high pressure]], about 300 Bar. The resulting air expansion is used to move a piston or turbine attached to a transmission.

The Eolo car uses electricity to re-fill the compressed air tanks, taking about 6 hours.

==Facts==
* Not one was ever built by the factory.
* It actually has an exhaust tube from which only cold air (-20° Celsius) comes out.

==Specialities==
It is claimed to be a [[zero-emissions vehicle]]. The only problem is the recharging, but if the energy is produced solely via [[renewable resource]]s such as [[wind power|wind]], [[geothermal power]] or [[solar power]], the emission is zero. On the other hand, most electricity worldwide is made by burning coal, oil or natural gas, or from nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html USA for example&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Production should have begun in 2003 in Broni (Italy), but for unspecified problems MDI company was unable to build or sell it in the Italian-European market, or indeed anywhere. The 90 employees, who were supposed to begin production, were from 2003 to 2005{{when|date=May 2012}} under the "''cassa integrazione''" law (an Italian law which provides, through state benefits, the payroll to employees who, for special reasons due to the employers, are unable to perform their jobs) then fired.

Though the prototype was a complete success (the engine was even sold as a power generator with 0 emissions) the selling of this car is said to be artificially postponed or cancelled due to undeclared reasons.

There have been several attempts to interview and have a declaration from the Eolo Italia president, but up to now{{when|date=May 2012}} no one has been successful.

'''Geodes''' (derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word "γεώδης" meaning "Earth like") are [[Geology|geological]] secondary formation within [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[volcanic rock]]s. Geodes are hollow, vaguely circular rocks, in which masses of [[mineral]] matter (which may include crystals) are secluded. The crystals are formed by the filling of [[Vesicular texture|vesicle]]s in volcanic and [[Subvolcanic rock|sub-volcanic]] rocks by minerals deposited from [[hydrothermal fluid]]s; or by the dissolution of syn-genetic concretions and partial filling by the same, or other minerals precipitated from genetic water, [[groundwater]] or hydrothermal fluids.  

[[File:WLANL - Urville Djasim - Geode amethist - Amethyst geode (2).jpg|thumb|The inside of a large geode lined by [[amethyst]] crystals]]

== Formation ==
Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks. They can form in gas bubbles in [[igneous rock]]s, such as vesicles in basaltic [[lava]]; or, as in the American [[Midwest]], in rounded cavities in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolved [[silicate]]s and/or [[carbonate]]s are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow feed of mineral constituents from groundwater or hydrothermal solutions allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing geodes eventually weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of resistant material such as quartz.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geology.com/articles/geodes/|title=Geodes: The rocks with a crystal surprise inside!|website=geology.com|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When cut in half, visible bands corresponding to varied stages of precipitation may at times show patterns that reveal points of fluid entry into the cavity and/or varied colors corresponding to changes in chemistry.

== Coloration ==
[[Image:Terra Mineralia...2H1A6825ОВ.jpg|thumb]]
Geode banding and coloration is the result of variable impurities. [[Iron oxide]]s will impart rust hues to siliceous solutions, such as the commonly observed iron-stained quartz. Most geodes contain clear quartz crystals, while others have purple amethyst crystals. Still others can have agate, chalcedony, or jasper banding or crystals such as calcite, dolomite, celestite, etc. There is no easy way of telling what the inside of a geode holds until it is cut open or broken apart. However, geodes from a particular area are usually similar in appearance.

Geodes and geode slices are sometimes dyed with artificial colors. Samples of geodes with unusual colors or highly unlikely formations have usually been synthetically altered.

== Prevalence ==
[[Image:Calcite-Fluorite-Quartz-ind07a.jpg|thumb|Fluorite and calcite on quartz stalactites, in geode]]
Geodes are common in some formations in the [[United States]] (mainly in [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], western [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Utah]]). They also are common in [[Brazil]], [[Namibia]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Geodes are also abundant in the [[Mendip Hills]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], where they are known locally as "Potato Stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dulcote.com/the-quarries.html|title=The Quarries|website=Dulcote,   Somerset|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vugs and crystal caves==
In 2000 a team of geologists found a cave filled with giant gypsum crystals in an abandoned silver mine near [[Almería]], [[Spain]]. The cavity, which measures 1.8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1.7 meters and is 8 meters in length, would be the largest crystal cave ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Giant Crystal Cave Discovered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/787776.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 September 2011|date=12 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance of the cave has been blocked by five tons of rocks, and is under police protection (to prevent looters from entering). According to geological models, the cave was formed during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] 6 million years ago, when the Mediterranean sea evaporated and left thick layers of salt sediment). The cave is currently not accessible to tourists.

The world's largest known crystal cave or [[vug]] is Crystal Cave, a celestine geode 35 feet (10.7 m) in diameter at its widest point, located near the village of [[Put-in-Bay, Ohio]], on South Bass Island in Lake Erie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Gibraltar Electricity Authority''' is an agency under the [[Government of Gibraltar]] responsible for regulating the Gibraltar electricity market. The authority was created on 28 March 2003 under the Gibraltar Electricity Authority Act 2003. Its responsibility is to generate, distribute and supply electricity to the civilian population of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibelec.gi/about-us.php |title=Gibraltar Electricity Authority &amp;ndash; About Us |publisher=Gibelec.gi.

==History==
In 1890, the Colonial Government of Gibraltar commissioned [[Wales|Welsh]] [[electrical engineer]] [[William Henry Preece]] (1834 – 1913) to "enquire into the propriety of introducing electric light" into the territory. On 15 September 1896, construction of the King’s Bastion Power Station, based in the old [[King's Bastion]], was started with the help of a loan raised under the Electric Light Ordinance of 1892. The first demonstration of electric lighting in Gibraltar was conducted in April 1897. The Electric Light department was established on 9 March 1898.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibelec.gi/about-history.php |title=Gibraltar Electricity Authority &amp;ndash; History |publisher=Gibelec.gi.

The Government of Gibraltar passed an act in the [[Gibraltar House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] on 28 March 2003 to establish the Gibraltar Electricity Authority to regulate electricity supply for the civilian population.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Act2003"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/2003-02o.pdf | title=Gibraltar Electricity Authority Act 2003 &amp;ndash; Establishment and Constitution of the Authority | publisher=gibraltarlaws.gov.gi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">A hybrid [[switchgear]] is one that combines the components of traditional air-insulated switchgear (AIS) and [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) technologies. It is characterized by a compact and modular design, which encompasses several different functions in one module.

==Concept==
[[File:145 kV Hybrid Module 2.jpg|thumb|150px|145 kV Hybrid Switchgear Module]][[High-voltage switchgear]]s have been traditionally distinguished according to the medium used to extinguish the arc. In the case of the hybrid switchgear modules, this device developed during last 90’s uses two different types of technologies: one to extinguish the arc and the other to connect to the other equipment of the high voltage [[electrical substation|substation]], for pursuing the goal of maximizing the advantages of the already existing technologies.  The hybrid module typically utilizes [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|gas-insulated switchgear]] components and conventional air-insulated [[bushing (electrical)|bushing]]s for connecting to the [[busbar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abb.it/cawp/seitp202/7e75ffdb74406fb8c1257111003ca46c.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
The term module refers to the fact that the equipment itself is a combination of different standard substation components in a single assembly. The integration allows to reduce the overall substation footprint from 50% to more than 70% when compared to substation realized using conventional air insulated equipment.
&lt;br /&gt;An hybrid module can incorporate:
* One (or more) [[circuit breaker]] 
* One (or more) [[disconnector]] and [[earthing|earthing switch]]
* Gas-insulated [[voltage transformer]]s
* [[Transformer types#Cast resin transformer|Cast-resin]] [[current transformer]]s
* Air- or gas-insulated [[surge arrester]]s

The high voltage live parts (circuit breaker, disconnector and earthing switch) are encapsulated in a grounded aluminum tank, filled with pressurized [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) gas, which means that the disconnector contacts will likely not require any maintenance during the product life, thus increasing the [[availability]] of the substation and the safety of the operators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voltimum.com.au/articles/abb-enhances-substation-switchgear-module-design-improve-safety-mining-and-industrial&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substation applications==
[[File:AISvsHybrid Comparison.JPG|thumb|Footprint comparison of 145 kV AIS substation and Hybrid substation.]]This modular approach to the construction of the substations is based on flexibility and customizability. The hybrid module can be used for extension or substitution in any traditional substation which uses an air-insulated busbar. This allows to configure the module with the components that are required by substation’s architecture and scope of supply. Vice versa, it is also possible to install traditional air-insulated equipment in a hybrid substation.

'''Iran Air Flight 291''' was a flight that crashed on January 21, 1980. The flight, carried on a [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-86]], was making a domestic flight from [[Mashhad International Airport|Mashad Airport]] to [[Mehrabad Airport|Tehran-Mehrabad Airport]] in Iran. At 1911h local time, the aircraft, registered as EP-IRD, collided with the [[Alborz Mountains]], {{convert|29|km}} north of [[Tehran]], during its approach to Tehran-Mehrabad runway 29 in foggy and snowy weather conditions.&lt;ref name=asn&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19800121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 8 crew members and 120 passengers died in the incident, and the plane was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x9JWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c0INAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6244,740316&amp;dq=iran+air+crash&amp;hl=en 128 feared dead in Iran Air Crash]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Iran Air Flight 291 was the deadliest aircraft disaster in Iranian history.

'''Karura Hydroelectric Power Station''', commonly referred to as '''Karura Power Station''', also '''Karura Dam''', is a planned  {{convert|67|MW}} hydropower station in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=6 February 2018 | url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/KenGen-set-to-build-67MW-power-plant-on-Tana-River/3946234-4292772-11exg7j/index.html |title=KenGen set to build 67MW power plant on Tana River |date=5 February 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |first=Neville |last=Otuki |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station would be located across [[Tana River (Kenya)|River Tana]], in [[Embu County]], sandwiched between [[Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station]] upstream and [[Kiambere Hydroelectric Power Station]] downstream. Karura Power Station, is about {{convert|15|km|0}} downstream of Kindaruma Power Station.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; This location is approximately {{convert|190|km|0}}, by road, north-east of [[Nairobi]], the capital and largest city of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Globefeed.com | author=Globefeed.com |access-date=6 February 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Kenya_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Nairobi%2C%20Nairobi%20County%2C%20Kenya&amp;toplace=Kiambere%20Dam&amp;dt1=ChIJp0lN2HIRLxgRTJKXslQCz_c&amp;dt2=ChIJPffHwZ5eJhgR7n27fyx1VJw |title=Distance between Nairobi, Nairobi County, Kenya and Kiambere Dam  |date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The power station is a [[run of river]], hydropower installation, with capacity of 67 Megawatts. The design calls for the waters of River Tana to be diverted through a "dug-out channel" and then delivered to the power-generation site, thereby reducing the "displacement of communities". [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company]] (KenGen), a company, owned 70 percent by the [[government of Kenya]], is the developer and owner of this power station.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

[[File:Logosol-moulder.jpg|thumb|''Detail how the cutter moulds the beam'']]
A '''log house moulder''' is a machine to prepare logs to be suitable for building a [[log home]]. In general, the logs are first sawn to a square beam, then the moulder makes the groove. Often fitted to a [[portable sawmill]] that enables direct profiling of round or squared logs. The log house moulder is usually powered by electricity, but for portable sawmills they are sometimes using a [[chainsaw]] as power head. One of the more common, especially in Europe, is the
[https://web.archive.org/web/20060510144002/http://www.logosol.com/webb/sawmills/2005a-saw_alternatives_loghouse_moulder.php Logosol log house moulder].

Other type of log house moulder is a log through-pass machine. Through-pass log home moulders are highly productive and mighty machines able to turn truck load of logs into house logs during a work shift. Barked or debarked green or dry logs are fed into such machine one after other on one side and the machine processes logs, turning them into profiled roundish or squarish house logs, taken from outfeed of the machine. Such log home milling machine can shape logs into different profiles: Swedish cope, Tongue&amp;groove, D-log, bevel-edged logs, etc.
One of moulders of through-pass type are [https://web.archive.org/web/20091021164209/http://www.woodlandia.ca/machines/rlm-log-pass-trough-machines Woodlandia' Rotary Log Moulders] (USA, Canada, Russia)

In [[materials science]], a '''Lomer–Cottrell junction''' is a particular configuration of [[dislocation]]s.

When two perfect dislocations encounter along a slip plane, each perfect dislocation can split into two [[Partial dislocations|Shockley partial dislocations]]: a leading dislocation and a trailing dislocation. When the two leading [[Partial dislocations|Shockley partials]] combine, they form a separate dislocation with a burgers vector that is not in the slip plane. This is the Lomer–Cottrell dislocation. It is sessile and immobile in the slip plane, acting as a barrier against other dislocations in the plane. The trailing dislocations pile up behind the Lomer–Cottrell dislocation, and an ever greater force is required to push additional dislocations into the pile-up.

ex. FCC lattice along {111} slip planes

              |leading| |trailing|
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2}[\text{0 1 1}] \rightarrow \frac{a}{6}[\text{1 1 2}] + \frac{a}{6}[\text{-1 2 1}]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2}[\text{1 0 -1}] \rightarrow \frac{a}{6}[\text{1 1 -2}] + \frac{a}{6}[\text{2 -1 -1}]&lt;/math&gt;

Combination of leading dislocations:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{6}[\text{1 1 2}] + \frac{a}{6}[\text{1 1 -2}] \rightarrow \frac{a}{3}[\text{1 1 0}]&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting dislocation is along the crystal face, which is not a slip plane in FCC at room temperature.

The '''Mabey Group''' is a British-based group of engineering companies, which specialises in [[bridge|bridging]], steel fabrication, [[plant hire]] and [[construction]] products. In 2008, the company was listed in the [[Sunday Times Top Track 250|''Sunday Times'' Top Track 250]] list of Britain's top 250 mid-market private companies by turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationaltrade.co.uk/articles.php?CID=1&amp;SCID=44&amp;AID=1148&amp;Title=Mabey+Group|title=Mabey Group|last=www.mizudesign.com|first=Mizu|website=www.internationaltrade.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by Bevil Mabey in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=49546324|title=Mabey Group|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; he expanded the company quickly after [[World War II]] by buying up spare [[Bailey bridges]] from the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=GuardCorIrq/&gt;

Expanded through acquisition, parts of the group were founded over 150 years ago. The group is still wholly family owned. With an administrative headquarters in [[Twyford, Berkshire]], the group employs over 1,000 people in 40 locations and has an annualised turnover of £100 million. In excess of 90% of the company's production is exported to over 115 countries for use either in permanent or temporary bridging solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldlondonbridge.com/mby.shtml|title=Mabey Group|publisher=oldlondonbridge.com|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mabey Group has made regular donations to the local [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]] in [[Wokingham]]. [[John Redwood]], the Wokingham MP, was chairman of an associated investment company until March 2008.&lt;ref name=GuardCorIrq/&gt;

==Group companies==
*Mabey Bridge - based in [[Chepstow]], [[Monmouthshire]] Mabey Bridge is the largest member of the Mabey Group. The company supplies fabricated steel bridging, structural steelwork and associated construction services internationally.
*Mabey Hire Services - based in Ravensthorpe, [[Dewsbury]]. Formed on 1 October 2009 through the amalgamation of Mabey Hire, Murrayplant and Mabey Support Systems

==Corruption==
In its 2008 results, Mabey Group admitted publicly that it may have paid bribes to the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] in order to win business in [[Iraq]], under the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]]. In a retrospective [[United Nations]] report, it was alleged that Mabey paid a $202,000 (£101,000) [[bribery|kickback]] between 2001 and 2003, and was handed a $3.6m contract.&lt;ref name=GuardCorIrq&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/construction.iraq|title=Building firm says it may have breached Saddam sanctions|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2010-01-28 | location=London | first=Rob | last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in a case brought by the SFO, the company plead guilty to the charge of "sought to influence decision makers in public contracts in [[Jamaica]] and [[Ghana]] between 1993 and 2001" at [[Westminster]] [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/business/mabey-and-johnson-prosecuted-for-corruption/5204942.article|title=Mabey &amp; Johnson prosecuted for corruption|publisher=New Civil Engineer|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Mabey Bridge became the first organisation in the UK to pass an independent audit to become accredited to BS 10500: 2011 Specification for an Anti-bribery Management System - a management standard developed by the [[BSI Group]] in response to the [[Bribery Act 2010]]. In 2012 the director of the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] described Mabey Bridge as "leading the way in implementing controls and procedures to ensure it is able to trade ethically in high risk jurisdictions"{{cn|date=April 2013}}.

==Awards and recognition==
On 5 October 2012, Mabey Bridge won both "Company of the Year" and "Company Showing Exceptional Growth" categories at the Monmouthshire Business Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monbizawards.co.uk/testimonials/|title=Testimonials – Monmouth Business Awards|website=www.monbizawards.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2012, Mabey Bridge won the "Manufacturer of the Year" award at the Insider Media "Made in Wales" awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/wales/78769-winners-show-what-wales-made|title=Made in Wales Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by [[Barclays Bank]], one unnamed judge is quoted as saying the company had "Great story, great products, of which Wales should be proud." The other companies shortlisted were SPTS Technologies, The [[Royal Mint]] and [[Sony]] UK Technology Centre.

==History==

=== 1970s ===
Mike Rainville first came to [[woodworking]] as a [[hobby]] when he was 11. At that time, his mother, Pat, told him that, “he needed to find something to do.” Rainville’s grandparents had a history of working with their hands, specifically woodworking and farming, so there were always materials around to utilize. Rainville made his first items, spools and [[bobbin]] holders, in his parents’ [[basement]] in [[Lincoln, Vermont|Lincoln]], [[Vermont]], using some spare wood, a [[coping saw]], and a [[sanding block]]. As time progressed, he started making [[cribbage]] boards which are still being made today. Local [[craft fairs]] provided him with income to purchase new equipment and materials. By 1979, Rainville had established his first [[wholesale]] relationship.

=== 1980s ===
Rainville continued making product as he worked his way through [[Clarkson University]], frequently returning to Lincoln on weekends. After graduating in 1984, he set about constructing a new woodshop of sufficient size for his now-full-time business. The name “Maple Landmark Woodcraft” was also adopted. This name was an extension of Maple Landmark Homestead, the family [[maple sugaring]] business and [[Dairy farming|dairy farm]].

In 1987, Maple Landmark acquired Troll’s Toy Workshop of [[Barnet, Vermont]]. This addition brought in many [[alphabet]]-themed products, including letter cars, blocks, and signage letters. The company quickly grew to warrant more full-time employees.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:NameTrains logo.png|thumb|right|NameTrains logo]]
The product line evolved over the following decade, adding items such as [[trivet]]s, [[Christmas ornament|ornaments]], and the first NameTrains, a derivative line of the Troll’s Toy Workshop line alphabet letter car line. Originally finished with a clear coat, the NameTrains rapidly increased in popularity. As more retailers expressed interest in having colored letters, a non-toxic color dye [[stain]] was developed and the first colored NameTrains appeared on the market in 1994.

Production of these new products made space tight in the Lincoln facility by late 1994. With no room to expand, the decision was made to build a new shop in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] that would have easier access to raw materials and a retail space for visitors to shop for products year-round. Maple Landmark moved into the new shop on Exchange Street in Middlebury in 1996. The original woodshop still exists in Lincoln, though mostly used for storage, and is usually referred to as “the Old Shop.”

With the need to keep up with product demand, both in quantity and quality, investments were made in lasers and additional [[Numerical control|CNC]] [[Router (woodworking)|routers]]. These machines allowed for more production in less labor-intensive manners. The lasers also gave Maple Landmark the ability to add graphic designs to products, creating the option to do custom work alongside regular production work.

More products and more machines required the enlargement of the Middlebury factory to {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} in 1999.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Montgomery Schoolhouse logo.png|thumb|Montgomery Schoolhouse logo]]
In 2001, Maple Landmark purchased Montgomery Schoolhouse of [[Montgomery, Vermont]], another long-established Vermont-based wooden toy producer. The acquisition was inspired by Rainville’s desire to not see the Montgomery Schoolhouse name, products, and history lost and forgotten. All operations were consolidated in Middlebury and, moving forward, products were redesigned to be more efficiently produced. Through the changes, the names and integrity of the products lines were maintained.

The [[Early 2000s recession|economic downturn in the early-2000s]] impacted business as toys, games, and gifts were often bought with discretionary income. Low growth continued until the summer of 2007 when [[2007 Chinese export recalls|products from other countries and manufacturers were being recalled]] for child health and safety reasons. These recalls boosted Maple Landmark's business in late 2007 and 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/us/23toys.html|title=You Think Santa Is Busy?

This product line was popular among consumers that were particularly concerned about chemicals.

In January 2009, Maple Landmark created a wooden [[souvenir]] [[train]] for the United States presidential [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] following the [[United States presidential election, 2008|election of Barack Obama in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wcax.com/story/20652922/a-toy-picked-for-inauguration|title=Vt. toy picked for inauguration|last=News|first=WCAX|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
In an effort to stay flexible and innovative, Maple Landmark purchased several printers that allow for full color printing on wood. These additions allowed for more colorful and intricate designs, both in standard and custom product.

In January 2013, Maple Landmark created a wooden souvenir [[limousine]] for the United States presidential [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] following the [[United States presidential election, 2012|reelection of Barack Obama in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.addisonindependent.com/201301maple-landmark-produces-presidential-toy-limousine-inauguration-0|title=Maple Landmark produces toy limousine for Obama inauguration {{!}} Addison County Independent|website=www.addisonindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Adam Rainville, Mike's older son, returned to the business after studying at Clarkson University.

In 2016, a {{Convert|11000|sqft|m2}} addition was completed on the Middlebury factory, bringing the total to {{Convert|28,000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://addisoncountyedc.org/about/news/maple-landmark-expansion|title=Maple Landmark Expansion|website=Addison County Economic Development Corporation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessvermont.com/maple-landmarks-growth-leads-to-expansion/|title=Maple Landmark’s growth leads to expansion|work=Business Vermont|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-year project allowed for more production and packing and [[shipping]] space.

The Vermont [[Small Business Administration]] named Mike Rainville the Vermont Small Business Person of the Year for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vermontbiz.com/news/march/michael-rainville-maple-landmark-named-vermont-small-business-person-year|title=Michael Rainville of Maple Landmark named Vermont Small Business Person of the Year {{!}} Vermont Business Magazine|website=vermontbiz.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, Andrew Rainville, Mike's younger son, returned to the business after studying at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.rpi.edu/content/2017/05/08/commencement-2017-importance-creativity-and-critical-thinking-business|title=Commencement 2017: The Importance of Creativity and Critical Thinking in Business and Management|last=Tracy|first=Julie|date=2017-05-08|website=RPI News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6989">The '''JCM800''' series (Models 1959, 1987, 2203, 2204, 2210 and 2205) is a line of [[guitar amplifier]]s made by [[Marshall Amplification]]. The series was introduced in 1981. Although models 1959 and 1987 had been in production since 1965 and the 2203 and 2204 had been in production since 1975, they were redesigned and introduced as JCM800 amplifiers in '81. The JCM800 amplifiers became a staple of 1980s hard rock and heavy metal bands.

==History==
In 1981, Marshall finally reached the end of its 15-year distribution deal with [[Rose-Morris]], which had severely limited its potential to sell amplifiers outside England; Rose-Morris tagged 55% onto the sticker price for exported models. The JCM800 was the first series produced after the contract expired. The name comes from [[Jim Marshall (businessman)|Jim Marshall]]'s initials, "J.C.M.", coupled with the meaningless "800" from the [[Vehicle registration plate|number plate]] on his car. It was later noted that "800" stood for the decade. For example, the JCM900 was released in 1990 and the JCM2000 was released in 2000.&lt;ref name=maloof&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloof|first=Rich|title=Jim Marshall, father of loud: the story of the man behind the worlds most famous guitar amplifiers|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-803-2|pages=211–14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLmpGbR_n0AC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series included head amplifiers with matching cabinets, as well as combos, and was produced until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=maloof/&gt; It quickly became a very successful amplifier, and ubiquitous amongst [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands.&lt;ref name=pittman&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittman|first=Aspen|title=The Tube Amp Book|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-767-7|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1I7Ld76YsC&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These were the second series of Marshalls equipped with a master volume, which allowed for more distortion at lower volumes. Compared to the earlier "Master Volume" series, they offered some advantages, including the possibility to be patched internally and linked with other amplifiers.&lt;ref name=boehnlein/&gt; The first JCM800s were in fact Master Volume amplifiers (Models 2203 and 2204, at 100 and 50 watts respectively), repackaged in new boxes with new panels. Soon, however, the Model 2210 appeared on the market.&lt;ref name=fliegler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fliegler|first=Ritchie|title=Amps!: the other half of rock 'n' roll|year=1993|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-7935-2411-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgG8bmBayLwC&amp;pg=PA47|author2=Jon F. Eiche|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were equipped with two channels, which could be activated via a foot switch, allowing for separate lead and rhythm sounds. They also had an [[Effect unit|effects loop]] and [[reverb]], also a first for Marshall.&lt;ref name=pittman/&gt;

Initially, users complained that the amplifiers (used with the standard Marshall cabinets) sounded flat compared to the older Marshalls, until it was discovered (by accident) that the fault was with the speakers: The new cabs had been equipped with a new kind of [[Celestion]] speakers. Marshall quickly reverted to the older Celestions.&lt;ref name=pittman/&gt; Still, some users prefer the pre-JCM800 amplifiers, claiming that those have a warmer, less "brittle" sound.&lt;ref name=boehnlein&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehnlein|first=John|title=The High Performance Marshall Handbook: A Guide to Great Marshall Amplifier Sounds|year=1998|publisher=Bold Strummer|isbn=978-0-933224-80-3|pages=10–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm00dXNS30IC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amplifier was equipped with [[EL34]] [[Vacuum tube|valves (tubes)]] for amps sold in the UK and [[6550]] tubes for amps exported to the United States.&lt;ref name=boehnlein/&gt; The JCM800 is considered a "hot" amplifier because it has more [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] stages than comparable amplifiers, and in "lead" mode (in the "high" input), an extra [[triode]] provides extra gain to the pre-amplifier, which "made for one hot rock amp".&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=The guitar amp handbook: understanding tube amplifiers and getting great sounds|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-863-6|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He replied that he was "American first" and that "we have become way too polarized," indicating a desire for compromise with Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;FoxNews.com, [http://video.foxnews.com/v/4485122/hannitys-freshmen-focus-group/ Hannity's Freshman Focus Group], January 4, 2011, at 5:30 mark&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm did not join the [[Tea Party Caucus]] in the House, instead joining the more moderate [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freedlander |first=David |url=http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/ny-tea-partiers-join-moderate-gop-caucus |title=NY Tea Partiers Join 'Moderate' G.O.P.

=====Fiscal issues=====
Grimm was appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]], which the ''Staten Island Advance'' considered a major opportunity for Grimm to influence the debate on financial reform. Roughly 70,000 of his constituents were involved in financial services, making this a vital issue for his political profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/12/staten_islands_grimm_lands_spo.html |title=Staten Island's Grimm lands spot on House Financial Services Committee |publisher=Staten Island Advance |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimm introduced legislation that would prohibit potential whistle-blowers from receiving a cash reward from the Securities and Exchange Commission unless they report wrongdoing to their employers before reporting it to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/republicans-take-aim-at-whistleblower-rule-2011-05-11?link=MW_latest_news|title= Republicans take aim at whistleblower rule|author= Kate Shepherd|date= May 11, 2011 |work= MarketWatch|publisher= Medill News Service|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gun control=====
After the 2011 [[2011 Tucson shooting|shooting of Gabrielle Giffords]], Grimm voiced support for "security-based situational awareness training", including how to spot suspicious people, when to run for an exit, and how to keep guards at close range. Grimm also said congressmen should consider carrying firearms. House Leader [[John Boehner]] called his suggestions an "excellent idea" and indicated that security would be a major focus for Congress in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Natalie |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/3/br_grimmsecurity_2011_1_21_bk.html?comm=1 |title=Grimm: House members should pack heat if they want |publisher=The Brooklyn Paper |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Syria=====
Grimm opposed a military strike on the Assad regime in Syria, stating, "I am no longer convinced that a U.S. strike on Syria will yield a benefit to the United States that will not be greatly outweighed by the extreme cost of war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Republican congressman withdraws support for Syria strike|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/05/republican-congressman-withdraws-support-for-syria-strike/?wprss=rss_politics&amp;clsrd|accessdate=September 2, 2014|publisher=Washington Post|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fundraising allegations by Rabbi Pinto=====
According to a January 27, 2012, ''[[New York Times]] ''article, several followers of Orthodox Rabbi [[Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto]] said Grimm's campaign had accepted questionable donations. Three of Pinto's followers reportedly said that Grimm or Ofer Biton, a top aide of Pinto's, had told them that the campaign would find a way to accept donations that were over the legal limit. Grimm stated, "Any suggestion that I was involved in any activities that may run afoul of the campaign finance laws is categorically false and belied by my life of public service protecting and enforcing the laws of this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cowan |first1=Alison Leigh |last2=Rashbaum |first2=William K. |title=Rabbi's Followers Cast Doubt on Congressman's Fundraising |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |publisher=N.Y.

=====Hurricane Sandy aid=====
In June 2013, Grimm stated that he believed water fees should be waived for survivors of [[Hurricane Sandy]] who had been displaced from their homes. Under New York City's Department of Environmental Protection rules, all homeowners are subject to a minimum charge of $1.19 per day, even if a home uses no water during a given period. Residents who had been displaced from their homes for long periods of time received water bills over $500 for damaged, vacant properties. Grimm called the bills "ridiculous," saying, "That's $500 these people could use to replace a washer or dryer or refrigerator swept out to sea during Sandy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vigliotti|first1=Jonathan|title=Staten Island Sandy Victims Charged for Water in Vacant Homes|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Water-Bills-Sandy-Staten-Island-Rep-Michael-Grimm-212630241.html|accessdate=July 24, 2014|publisher=NBC News|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep.

=====Confrontation with reporter=====
On January 28, 2014, [[NY1]]-TV political reporter Michael Scotto was interviewing Grimm in a balcony hallway of the U.S. Capitol building about the recently concluded [[2014 State of the Union Address]]. He then tried to question Grimm about a campaign finance investigation. Grimm said he would not discuss the investigation. As Scotto started to mention the investigation again, Grimm walked off. Scotto then turned to the camera and implied that Grimm did not want to face the issue on camera. Grimm then threatened Scotto, saying that he would "break [Scotto] in half," as well as threatening to throw Scotto over the balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/29/us-usa-politics-grimm-idUSBREA0S0WM20140129|title=U.S. congressman apologizes for threatening to throw reporter over balcony|publisher=Reuters|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2014|author=Thomas Ferraro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimm issued a statement defending his behavior, saying that he was annoyed by what he called a "disrespectful cheap shot" from Scotto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/pages/202672/rep--grimm-threatens-ny1-reporter-following-state-of-the-union|title=Rep.

=====Flood insurance reform=====
In early 2014, Grimm and [[Bill Cassidy]] cosponsored the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. In March 2014, the bill was passed by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by President Obama. The law repealed exponential increases in flood-insurance rates for homeowners in flood-prone areas, preventing "skyrocketing" flood insurance premiums for 5.5 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Durrett|first1=Clint|title=Obama signs bill into law preventing flood insurance rate hikes|url=http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/obama-signs-bill-into-law-preventing-flood-insurance-rate-hikes/25093406#!bkSDCP|accessdate=July 24, 2014|publisher=WDSU|date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wrobleski|first1=Tom|title=Senate passes flood insurance bill from Staten Island Rep.

=====Environmental views=====
According to ''[[Politico]]'', in April 2014, Grimm became "the first sitting House Republican to stop denying the science that humans cause climate change."

The investigation, which originally focused on Grimm's 2010 fundraising, branched out to include Grimm's prior business dealings. On April 25, 2014, Grimm's attorney was advised by the U.S. Attorney's office that his client would be indicted on criminal charges related to Healthalicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/nyregion/indictment-expected-for-representative-michael-grimm.html|title=Indictment Expected for Grimm, Staten Island Congressman|last=Rashbaum|first=William|publisher=New York Times|date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/25/politics/congress-grimm/index.html|title=Feds close to filing charges against Rep.

On December 23, 2014, less than two months after winning reelection, Grimm pleaded guilty to one charge of felony tax evasion. He admitted to under-reporting Healthalicious's revenues by over $900,000 over four years and to filing false tax returns based on that under-reported income. He also admitted to using the under-reported receipts to pay restaurant expenses, as well as to make under-the-table cash payments to employees. As part of the plea bargain, the other charges were dropped, but Grimm admitted to two of the offenses in the original indictment: knowingly employing people ineligible to work in the United States and lying in a 2013 deposition. The crimes to which he pleaded guilty carried a prison sentence of up to 30 months.&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nydailynews.com/news/politics/rep-michael-grimm-pleads-guilty-felony-count-tax-evas-article-1.2054723|title=Rep.

At first Grimm admitted making mistakes, but told a reporter he would "absolutely not" resign.&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlea/&gt; But on December 29, 2014, it was reported that after discussing the matter with House Speaker [[John Boehner]], Grimm had changed his mind and would decline to take his seat for a third term. He resigned from Congress on January 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michael-grimm-reportedly-decided-resign-congress-article-1.2060152 |title=Michael Grimm to resign from Congress: sources |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York's 11th congressional district special election, 2015|special election]] to replace him was held on May 5, 2015, and Staten Island District Attorney [[Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.|Daniel Donovan]], a Republican, was elected to the seat.

On July 17, 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Pamela K. Chen]] suggested that Grimm's moral compass "needs some reorientation" and sentenced him to eight months in prison. He surrendered on September 22, 2015, after a brief delay for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=NYDN20150922 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis O'Brien|first1=Rebecca|title=Former U.S. Rep.

Had Grimm not resigned, his role in Congress would have likely been very limited. Longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] reviews the matter. Although there is no constitutional rule barring a convicted felon from voting, Boehner and the Republican leadership would have strongly discouraged Grimm from doing so, and the House Ethics Committee has indicated in the past that convicted felons can be disciplined if they do take part in committee or floor votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33229.pdf|title=Status of a Member of the House Who Has Been Indicted For or Convicted of A Felony|author=[[United States House of Representatives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mixed acid fermentation''' is the biological process by which a six-carbon sugar e.g. [[glucose]] is converted into a complex and variable mixture of acids. It is an [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[fermentation]] reaction that is common in bacteria. It is characteristic for members of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]], a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that includes ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name=" Madigan&amp;Martinko2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=M.Magidan &amp; J. Martinko | title=Brock's Biology of Microorganisms, NJ, Pearson Prentice Hall | volume=11 | year=2006 | page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixture of end products produced by mixed acid fermentation includes [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[acetate]], [[succinate]], [[formate]], [[ethanol]] and the gases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The formation of these end products depends on the presence of certain key [[enzyme]]s in the bacterium. The proportion in which they are formed varies between different bacterial species.&lt;ref name=" Sharma2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Sharma, P.D. | title=Microbiology | year=2007 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed acid fermentation pathway differs from other fermentation pathways, which produce fewer end products in fixed amounts. The end products of mixed acid fermentation can have many useful applications in [[biotechnology]] and [[industrial fermentation|industry]]. For instance, ethanol is widely used as a [[biofuel]].&lt;ref name="Farrell2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Farrell, Alexander E. | title=Ethanol can contribute to energy and environmental goals |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=311 | issue=5760 | year = 2006 | pages=506–508 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 |display-authors=etal | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, multiple bacterial strains have been [[metabolic engineering|metabolically engineered]] in the laboratory to increase the individual [[yield (chemistry)|yields]] of certain end products.&lt;ref name="Förster2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Förster, Andreas H. |author2=Johannes Gescher  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of mixed-acid fermentation end products | journal=[[Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology]] | volume=2 | year=2014 | pages=506–508 | doi=10.3389/fbioe.2014.00016|pmid=25152889  |pmc=4126452  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has been carried out primarily in ''E. coli'' and is ongoing.

==Mixed Acid Fermentation in ''E. coli''==
''E. coli'' use fermentation pathways as a final option for energy metabolism, as they produce very little energy in comparison to respiration.&lt;ref name="Sawers2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Sawers, R. Gary, Melanie Blokesch, and August Böck | title=Anaerobic formate and hydrogen metabolism | journal=[[EcoSal Plus]] | volume=1.1 | issue=1 | year=2004 | doi=10.1128/ecosalplus.3.5.4| pmid=26443350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mixed acid fermentation in ''E. coli'' occurs in two stages. These stages are outlined by the biological database for ''E. coli'', [[EcoCyc]].&lt;ref name="Keseler2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Keseler, Ingrid M. | title=EcoCyc: a comprehensive database of Escherichia coli biology | journal=[[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume= 39| issue=Database issue | year=2011 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1143|display-authors=etal | pmid=21097882 | pmc=3013716 | pages=D583–D590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these two stages is a [[glycolysis reaction]]. Under anaerobic conditions, a glycolysis reaction takes place where glucose is converted into [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]]:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; glucose → 2 pyruvate

There is a net production of 2 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and 2 [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] molecules per molecule of glucose converted. ATP is generated by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]]. NADH is formed from the [[Redox|reduction]] of NAD.

In the second stage, pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to one or more end products via the following reactions. In each case, both of the NADH molecules generated by glycolysis are [[wikt:reoxidize|reoxidized]] to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Each alternative pathway requires a different key enzyme in ''E. coli''. After the variable amounts of different end products are formed by these pathways, they are secreted from the cell.&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;

[[File:Reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase.png|thumb|300px|The conversion of pyruvate to lactate is catalysed by the enzyme '''[[lactate dehydrogenase]]'''.]]

===Lactate Formation===
Pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to [[lactic acid|lactate]]. This reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the enzyme '''[[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDHA)'''.&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; pyruvate + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → '''lactate''' + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

===Acetate Formation===
Pyruvate is converted into [[acetyl-CoA|acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)]] by the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. This acetyl-CoA is then converted into [[acetate]] in ''E. coli'', whilst producing ATP by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]]. Acetate formation requires two enzymes: '''phosphate acetyltransferase''' and '''acetate kinase'''.&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;   
[[File:EscherichiaColi NIAID.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mixed Acid Fermentation pathway is characteristic of the '''[[Enterobacteriaceae]]''' family that includes ''E. coli'']]

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; acetyl-CoA + phosphate → acetyl-phosphate + CoA		

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; acetyl-phosphate + ADP → '''acetate''' + ATP

===Ethanol Formation===
[[Ethanol]] is formed in ''E. coli'' by the reduction of acetyl coenzyme A using NADH. This two-step reaction requires the enzyme '''[[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADHE).'''&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; acetyl-CoA + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → acetaldehyde + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CoA

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; acetaldehyde + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → '''ethanol''' + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

===Formate Formation===
[[Formate]] is produced by the [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]] of pyruvate. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme '''[[Formate C-acetyltransferase|pyruvate-formate lyase]] (PFL)''', which plays an important role in regulating anaerobic fermentation in ''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="Knappe1990"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Knappe, Joachim |author2=Gary Sawers  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=A radical-chemical route to acetyl-CoA: the anaerobically induced pyruvate formate-lyase system of Escherichia coli | journal=[[FEMS microbiology reviews]] | volume=6.4 |issue=4  | year=1990 | pages = 383–398 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb04108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; pyruvate + CoA → acetyl-CoA + '''formate'''

===Succinate Formation===
[[File:Bernsteinsäure2.svg|thumb|300px|Skeletal structure of [[succinate]]]]
[[Succinate]] is formed in ''E. coli'' in several steps.

[[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|Phosphoenolpyruvate]] (PEP), a glycolysis pathway [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]], is [[Carboxylation|carboxylated]] by the enzyme [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase|PEP carboxylase]] to form [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]].&lt;ref name="Kai2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Kai, Yasushi, Hiroyoshi Matsumura, and Katsura Izui | title=Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase: three-dimensional structure and molecular mechanisms | journal=[[Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics]] | volume= 414| issue=2 | year=2003 | pages = 170–179 | doi=10.1016/S0003-9861(03)00170-X | pmid=12781768}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
This is followed by the conversion of oxaloacetate to [[Malic acid|malate]] by the enzyme [[malate dehydrogenase]]. [[Fumarase|Fumarate hydratase]] then catalyses the dehydration of malate to produce [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]].&lt;ref name="Thakker2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Thakker, Chandresh | title=Succinate production in Escherichia coli | journal=[[Biotechnology journal]] | volume=7.2 | issue=2 | year=2012 | pages = 213–224 | doi=10.1002/biot.201100061| pmid=21932253 |display-authors=etal| pmc=3517001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; phosphoenolpyruvate + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → oxaloacetate + phosphate

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; oxaloacetate + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → malate + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; malate → fumarate + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0

The final reaction in the formation of succinate is the reduction of fumarate. It is catalysed by the enzyme '''[[fumarate reductase]]'''.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fumarate + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → '''succinate''' + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

This reduction is an anaerobic respiration reaction in ''E. coli'', as it uses electrons associated with NADH dehydrogenase and the [[electron transport chain]]. ATP is generated by using an [[electrochemical gradient]] and [[ATP synthase]]. This is the only case in the mixed acid fermentation pathway where ATP is not produced via substrate-level phosphorylation.&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Förster2014" /&gt;

[[Vitamin K|Vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], also known as menaquinone, is very important for electron transport to fumarate in ''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="Guest1977"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Guest, JOHN R | title=Menaquinone biosynthesis: mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 requiring 2-succinylbenzoate | journal=[[Journal of Bacteriology]] | volume=130.3 | year=1977 | pages = 1038–1046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide Formation===
Formate can be converted to hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide in ''E. coli''. This reaction requires the enzyme '''[http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=ENZYME&amp;object=FHLMULTI-CPLX formate-hydrogen lyase]'''. It can be used to prevent the conditions inside the cell becoming too acidic.&lt;ref name="Keseler2011" /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; formate → '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''

==Methyl Red Test==
[[File:Methylrot Probe methyl red test.jpg|thumb|200px|'''[[Methyl Red]] Test''': The test tube on the left shows a positive result as acidic end products are formed by mixed acid fermentation in ''E. coli''. The test tube on the right shows a negative result as no acidic products are formed by fermentation.]]

The '''[[methyl red]] (MR)''' test can detect whether the mixed acid fermentation pathway occurs in microbes when given glucose. A [[pH indicator]] is used that turns the test solution red if the pH drops below 4.4.&lt;ref name="Clarke1922"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=H. T. Clarke |author2=W. R. Kirner | title=Methyl Red | journal=[[Org. Synth.]] | volume=2 | year=1922 | pages = 47 | doi=10.15227/orgsyn.002.0047}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the fermentation pathway has taken place, the mixture of acids it has produced will make the solution very acidic and cause a red colour change.

The Methyl red test belongs to a group known as the [[IMViC]] tests.

==Metabolic Engineering==
Multiple bacterial strains have been [[Metabolic engineering|metabolically engineered]] to increase the individual yields of end products formed by mixed acid fermentation. For instance, strains for the increased production of ethanol, lactate, succinate and acetate have been developed due to the usefulness of these products in [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Förster2014" /&gt;  
The major limiting factor for this engineering is the need to maintain a [[redox]] balance in the mixture of acids produced by the fermentation pathway.&lt;ref name="vanHoek2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=van Hoek |author2=Milan JA |author3=Roeland MH Merks  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Redox balance is key to explaining full vs. partial switching to low-yield metabolism | journal=[[BMC Systems Biology]] | volume=6.1 | year=2012 | page = 22 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-22|pmid=22443685 |pmc=3384451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For ethanol production===
Ethanol is the most commonly used [[biofuel]] and can be produced on large scale via fermentation. The maximum theoretical [[yield (chemistry)|yield]] for the production of ethanol was achieved around 20 years.&lt;ref name="Ingram1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Ingram, L. O. | title= Genetic engineering of ethanol production in Escherichia coli | journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] | volume=53:10 | year=1987 | pages = 2420–2425|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohta1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Ohta, Kazuyoshi | title= Genetic improvement of Escherichia coli for ethanol production: chromosomal integration of Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II | journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] | volume=57.4 | year=1991 | pages = 893–900|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plasmid that carried the pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes from the bacteria ''[[Zymomonas mobilis|Z.mobilis]]'' was used by scientists. This was inserted into ''E. coli'' and resulted in an increased yield of ethanol. The genome of this ''E. coli'' strain, KO11, has more recently been sequenced and mapped.&lt;ref name="Turner2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Turner, Peter C. | title=Optical mapping and sequencing of the Escherichia coli KO11 genome reveal extensive chromosomal rearrangements, and multiple tandem copies of the Zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhB genes | journal=[[Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology]] | volume=39.4 | issue=4 | year=2012 | pages = 629–639|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1007/s10295-011-1052-2| pmid=22075923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teebeutel Polylactid 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|Teabags made from Polylactic acid (PLA)]]

===For acetate production===
The ''E. coli'' strain W3110 was [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to generate 2 moles of acetate for every 1 mole of glucose that undergoes fermentation. This is known as a homoacetate pathway.&lt;ref name="Causey2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Causey, T. B. | title=Engineering the metabolism of Escherichia coli W3110 for the conversion of sugar to redox-neutral and oxidized products: homoacetate production | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume= 100| issue=3 | year=2003 | pages = 825–832 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0337684100|display-authors=etal | pmid=12556564 | pmc=298686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For lactate production===
Lactate can be used to produce a [[bioplastic]] called [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA). The properties of PLA depend on the ratio of the two '''[[isomer|optical isomers]]''' of lactate (D-lactate and L-lactate). D-lactate is produced by mixed acid fermentation in ''E. coli.''&lt;ref name="Clark1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Clark, David P | title= The fermentation pathways of Escherichia coli | journal=[[FEMS Microbiology Reviews]] | volume=5.3 | issue= 3 | year=1989 | pages = 223–234 | doi= 10.1111/j.1574-6968.1989.tb03398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early experiments engineered the E.coli strain RR1 to produce either one of the two optical isomers of lactate.&lt;ref name="Chang1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Chang, Dong-Eun | title=Homofermentative production of d-orl-lactate in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli RR1 | journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] | volume=65.4 | year=1999 | pages = 1384–1389 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later experiments modified the ''E. coli strain'' KO11, originally developed to enhance ethanol production. Scientists were able to increase the yield of D-lactate from fermentation by performing several [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]].&lt;ref name="Zhou2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Zhou, S. | title= Fermentation of 10%(w/v) sugar to D (−)-lactate by engineered Escherichia coli B | journal=[[Biotechnology letters]] | volume=27 | issue= 23–24 | year=2005 | pages = 1891–1896 | doi= 10.1007/s10529-005-3899-7 | pmid= 16328986 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For succinate production===
Increasing the yield of succinate from mixed acid fermentation was first done by [[wikt:overexpression|overexpressing]] the enzyme [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase|PEP carboxylase]].&lt;ref name="Millard1996"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Millard, Cynthia Sanville | title= Enhanced production of succinic acid by overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in Escherichia coli | journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] | volume=62.5 | year=1996 | pages = 1808–1810|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a succinate yield that was approximately 3 times greater than normal. Several experiments using a similar approach have followed.

Alternative approaches have altered the redox and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] balance to optimize the succinate yield.&lt;ref name="Singh2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Singh, Amarjeet | title=Manipulating redox and ATP balancing for improved production of succinate in E. coli | journal=[[Metabolic engineering]] | volume=13.1 | issue=1 | year=2011 | pages = 76–81 | doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2010.10.006| pmid=21040799 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fermentation pathways==

In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], '''monatomic''' is a combination of the words "mono" and "atomic", and means "single [[atom]]". It is usually applied to [[gas]]es: a '''monatomic gas''' is one in which atoms are not bound to each other. All [[chemical elements]] will be monatomic in the gas phase at sufficiently high temperatures. The thermodynamic behavior of monatomic gas is extremely simple when compared to polyatomic gases because it is free of any rotational or vibrational energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=monatomic gas|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/monatomic-gas|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble gases==
The only chemical elements that are stable single [[atom]] [[molecules]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP) are the [[noble gas]]es.  These are [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]] and [[radon]].  Noble gases have a full outer valence shell making them rather non-reactive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laszlo|first=Pierre|last2=Schrobilgen|first2=Gary J.|date=1988-04-01|title=Ein Pionier oder mehrere Pioniere? Die Entdeckung der Edelgas-Verbindungen|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.19881000406/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie|language=en|volume=100|issue=4|pages=495–506|doi=10.1002/ange.19881000406|issn=1521-3757}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these elements have been described historically as completely inert, chemical compounds have been synthesized with all but neon and helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christe|first=Karl O.|date=2001-04-17|title=A Renaissance in Noble Gas Chemistry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3773(20010417)40:83.0.CO;2-J/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1419–1421|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20010417)40:8%3C1419::aid-anie1419%3E3.0.co;2-j|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When grouped together with the [[homonuclear]] [[diatomic]] gases such as [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the noble gases are called "elemental gases" or "molecular gases" to distinguish them from molecules that are also [[chemical compounds]].

The motion of a monatomic gas is translation (electronic excitation is not important at room temperature). Thus in an [[adiabatic process]], monatomic gases have an idealised [[Heat capacity ratio|''γ''-factor]] (''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''/''C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'') of 5/3, as opposed to 7/5 for ideal [[diatomic]] gases where rotation (but not vibration at room temperature) also contributes. Also, for ideal monatomic gases:&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/211-sp06/class-thermodynamics/heatcap_volume.html Heat Capacity of an Ideal Gas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Heat_Capacity_Ideal_Gases.html Heat Capacity of Ideal Gases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/chemcrs/bulkdisk/chem152A_aut10/notes_Lecture_03_100610_revised.pdf Lecture 3: Thermodynamics of Ideal Gases &amp; Calorimetry]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Mount Storm Wind Farm''' is located 120 miles west of [[Washington, D.C.]] in [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant County]], [[West Virginia]]. The [[wind farm]] includes 132 [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica|Gamesa]] G80 [[wind turbines]] each with a two [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] (MW) capacity along 12 miles of the [[Allegheny Front]]. Construction of the wind farm began in 2006 and the project is now fully operational, generating up to 264 MW of electricity for the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] power grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=54272 Dominion &amp; Shell Complete 264-MW Mount Storm Wind Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nedpower Mount Storm, LLC is a [[joint venture]] between  Shell and [[Dominion Resources]], founded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=39149508], "Company Overview of Nedpower Mount Storm, LLC","[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dom.com/about/stations/renewable/wind-power.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714000522/https://www.dom.com/about/stations/renewable/wind-power.jsp |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plans for the farm were first announced in 2001, when U.S. Wind Force filed for a permit with the [[West Virginia Public Service Commission]] to build a 166 turbine wind farm, which would have been the largest wind farm east of the [[Mississippi River]]. The project's backers hoped that the first turbines would be operational by late 2002 with the rest of the facility coming online in 2003, but opponents quickly raised objections, arguing that the project would threaten birds and diminish home values in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Grant Wind Farm Will be Largest in East|first = Paul | last = Nyden | work = The Charleston Gazette | date = December 28, 2001 | page = 1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the Public Service Commission approved U.S. Wind Force's permit application without any significant opposition.  The company also reached an agreement with the [[AFL-CIO]] to use union labor in the construction of the facility.  At the hearings for the permit, speakers in favor of the project included [[Walt Helmick]], a member of the [[West Virginia Senate]], Jeff Barger, the County Commissioner of Grant County, and Steve White a union leader.  A study by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] concluded that the project posed little danger to local birds, clearing the way for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Grant wind farm developers reach agreement with union | work = The Charleston Gazette | first = Rick | last = Steelhammer | date = May 30, 2002 | page = 5A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nature Iraq''' (Arabic, طبيعة العراق) is [[Iraq|Iraq's]] first and only environmental conservation group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,709866,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Iraq]]i [[non-governmental organization]], accredited to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]  (UNEP) and affiliated to [[BirdLife International]]. They seek to protect, restore, and preserve Iraq’s natural environment and the rich cultural heritage that depends upon it.  They conduct major work in [http://www.natureiraq.org/site/en/ni_projects_current sustainable development, biodiversity, and water resources]. Nature Iraq was founded in 2003 by [[Azzam Alwash]], an Iraqi refugee and engineer in the United States who returned to Iraq following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

== Programs ==

'''The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) Program''' was initiated by Nature Iraq in partnership with the Iraqi Ministry of Environment and BirdLife International and other international advisory groups and included extensive field survey work from 2004 to 2010 to identify areas of the country that are globally important for their biological diversity.  Eighty-two sites have been identified as KBAs in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natureiraq.org/draft-inventory-of-sites.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adobe House''' was built to demonstrate alternative, low-cost and sustainable building methods that could be applied to alternative housing in the marshland areas.

'''The Darwin Project''' conducts plants and birds’ surveys, creates biodiversity and land use maps, facilitate practical field training courses and an online course for developing professionals, conducts educational activities with school children, creates field guides and other educational resources for conservation managers. 

'''Wetlands Restoration''' has been ongoing. Nature Iraq has successfully re-created some of Iraq's freshwater marshes in the central part of the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/13/restoring-iraqs-lostmarshes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blue Horizons Laboratories''' is a private lab offering environmental lab services that was initially started by Nature Iraq. &lt;ref&gt;http://bluehltd.com/env/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waterkeepers Iraq''' was a program originally started by Nature Iraq but registered as an independent non-governmental organization in 2014.  It advocates and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways of Iraq and supports local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. Waterkeepers Iraq is affiliated with the international Waterkeeper Alliance. And is the first waterkeeper organization in the Middle East. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterkeepersiraq.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://waterkeeper.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuclear Decommissioning Authority''' ('''NDA''') is a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], formed by the [[Energy Act 2004]]. It evolved from the Coal and Nuclear Liabilities Unit of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. It came into existence during late 2004, and took on its main functions on 1 April 2005. Its purpose is to deliver the [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] and clean-up of the [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|UK’s civil nuclear]] legacy in a safe and cost-effective manner, and where possible to accelerate programmes of work that reduce hazard. The NDA does not directly manage the UK's nuclear sites. It oversees the work through contracts with specially designed companies known as Site Licence Companies. The NDA determines the overall strategy and priorities for managing decommissioning.

Although the NDA itself only employs 300 staff, its annual budget is £3.2 billion. The vast majority of the NDA budget is spent through contracts with Site Licence Companies, who also sub contract to other companies which provide special services. The NDA aims to do this by introducing innovation and contractor expertise through a series of competitions similar to the model that has been used in the United States.

In April 2017, the NDA lost a legal case in the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] regarding the [[Public procurement|procurement]] of a sizeable contract for the decommissioning of 12 different Magnox nuclear facilities when EnergySolutions EU Ltd. (now called ATK Energy EU Ltd.) challenged a decision in connection with ATK’s unsuccessful bid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0006-press-summary.pdf Press Summary: Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (Appellant) v EnergySolutions EU Ltd (now called ATK Energy EU Ltd) (Respondent) [2017] UKSC 34 on appeal from: [2015] EWCA Civ 1262], 11 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 the UK parliament's [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] (PAC) concluded that the NDA had "dramatically under-estimated" costs and "completely failed" in the procurement and management of the [[Magnox Ltd]] contract, which was one of the highest value contracts let by the government. An independent inquiry into the deal was set up.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180703&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-NDA-to-take-over-management-of-Magnox-sites-0307185.html |title=NDA to take over management of Magnox sites |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=3 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pac-20180227&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubacc/461/46102.htm |title=The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's Magnox contract |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Public Accounts Committee |date=27 February 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

=== Objectives===
The main objectives of NDA are to:

*eliminate site hazards and develop waste solutions;
*ensure the highest standards in safety, security and environmental management;
*build an effective world class industry;
*gain full approval and support from stakeholders (employees, contractors, government, local communities and general public); and
*make best use of assets and maximise value-for-money.

===Structure===
[[File:Aerial view Sellafield, Cumbria - geograph.org.uk - 50827.jpg|thumb|[[Sellafield]], NDA's largest site]]
Responsibility for operating the sites has been restructured into five Site Licence Companies (SLCs). The management of the SLCs is contracted out to different Parent Body Organisations (PBOs), which are owned by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/news/slc-names.cfm NDA Confirms Names of New Site Licence Companies], Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (14 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Sellafield Ltd]]''' was previously [[BNFL]]'s '''British Nuclear Group''' subsidiary. It comprises [[Sellafield]] nuclear chemical facility, [[Calder Hall]] and [[Windscale]]. It also previously managed the [[Capenhurst]] [[uranium]] enrichment plant, which is now owned by [[Urenco Group|Urenco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Urenco_takes_on_Capenhurst_site-3011125.html |title=Urenco takes on Capenhurst site |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its PBO was formerly Nuclear Management Partners Ltd, a consortium of [[URS Corporation|URS]], [[Amec Foster Wheeler]] and [[Areva]].

Its PBO is Cavendish Fluor Partnership Ltd, a consortium of [[Babcock International]] and [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]]. 
*'''Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd''' comprises the [[Dounreay]] site. Its PBO is Cavendish Dounreay Partnership Ltd, a consortium of [[Babcock International]], [[CH2M HILL]] and [[URS Corporation|URS]].
*'''LLW Repository Ltd''' comprises the [[Low Level Waste Repository]] near [[Drigg]] in Cumbria. Its PBO is UK Nuclear Waste Management Ltd, a consortium of [[URS Corporation|URS]], [[Studsvik]], [[Areva]] and [[Serco]].
*'''Springfields Fuels Ltd''' comprises the [[Springfields]] nuclear fuel production facility near Preston, Lancashire. Its PBO is [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], a subsidiary of [[Toshiba]].

On its creation, the NDA also took over ownership of [[Direct Rail Services]], the rail [[freight operating company]] set up by [[BNFL]] in 1995 to transport nuclear materials.

The NDA is also the owner of [[International Nuclear Services]], which operates services on behalf of the NDA for the management and transportation of nuclear fuels.

The NDA is also the owner of Radioactive Waste Management Ltd (RWM), which is responsible for implementing a geological disposal facility in the UK and provide radioactive waste management solutions.

In February 2017 a national archive for the UK civil nuclear industry, named Nucleus, was opened in [[Wick, Caithness]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170214&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38855127 |title=National archive for nuclear industry opens in Wick |work=BBC News |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Nuclear Laboratory==
In 2006, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced his support for a [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] (NNL) to be based on the British Technology Centre at Sellafield and Nexia Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/stakeholders/newsletter/nnl-announced-sos.cfm Alistair Darling announces the formation of the National Nuclear Laboratory], Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (30/06/06).&lt;/ref&gt; The NDA, as the owner of Sellafield site and the funder of majority of research required across the nuclear estate, was involved establishing the NNL in 2009. The NNL complements other initiatives to develop a sustainable workforce such as the National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN) network, including the development of Energus in West Cumbria, alongside complementary research and development facilities such as the [http://www.dalton.manchester.ac.uk/ Dalton Nuclear Institute].

The '''Paleozoic''' (or '''Palaeozoic''') '''Era''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|p|eɪ|l|i|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ɪ|k|,_|ˌ|p|æ|-}};{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Paleozoic}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Paleozoic}}}} from the Greek ''palaios'' (παλαιός), "old" and ''zoe'' (ζωή), "life", meaning "ancient life"&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleozoic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Paleozoic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term "Palaeozoic" was coined by the British geologist [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785–1873) in: {{cite journal |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Adam |title=A synopsis of the English series of stratified rocks inferior to the Old Red Sandstone – with an attempt to determine the successive natural groups and formations |journal=Proceedings of the Geological Society of London |date=1838 |volume=2 |issue=58 |pages=675–685 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015031294112;view=1up;seq=601}} ; see p. 685.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest of three [[era (geology)|geologic eras]] of the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon. It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras, lasting from {{Ma|Paleozoic|Mesozoic}}, and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]] (from oldest to youngest): the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]], and [[Permian]]. The Paleozoic comes after the [[Neoproterozoic]] Era of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon and is followed by the [[Mesozoic]] Era.

The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological, climatic, and evolutionary change. The [[Cambrian]] witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth's history, known as the [[Cambrian explosion]], in which most modern [[phylum|phyla]] first appeared. [[Arthropod]]s, [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[synapsid]]s and [[diapsid]]s all evolved during the Paleozoic. Life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land, and by the late Paleozoic, it was dominated by various forms of organisms. Great [[forest]]s of primitive plants covered the continents, many of which formed the [[coal]] beds of [[Europe]] and eastern [[North America]]. Towards the end of the era, large, sophisticated diapsids and synapsids were dominant and the first modern plants ([[Pinophyta|conifers]]) appeared.

The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest [[extinction event]] in the [[history of Earth]], the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic Era to recover.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf | author=Sahney, S. | author2=Benton, M.J. | last-author-amp=yes|date=2008|title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275|pages = 759–65|format=PDF|pmid=18198148|issue=1636|pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

The Paleozoic era began and ended with supercontinents and in between were the rise of mountains along the continental margins, and flooding and draining of shallow seas between.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} At its start, the supercontinent [[Pannotia]] broke up. [[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatic]] studies and evidence of [[glacier]]s indicate that [[central Africa]] was most likely in the polar regions during the early Paleozoic. During the early Paleozoic, the huge continent [[Gondwana]] ({{Ma|510}}) formed or was forming. By mid-Paleozoic, the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and a subduction plate uplifted eastern [[Australia]]. By the late Paleozoic, continental collisions formed the supercontinent of [[Pangaea]] and resulted in some of the great mountain chains, including the Appalachians, [[Ural Mountains]], and mountains of [[Tasmania]].

===Periods of the Paleozoic Era===
There are six periods in the Paleozoic Era: [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] (alternatively subdivided into the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian Period]] and the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian Period]]), and the [[Permian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/paleozoic/paleozoic.php|title=The Paleozoic Era|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|date=2011|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambrian Period====
{{main|Cambrian}}
[[File:Trilobite Heinrich Harder.jpg|thumb|[[Trilobite]]s]]The Cambrian spans from 541 million years to 485 million years and is the first period of the Paleozoic era of the Phanerozoic. The Cambrian marked a boom in evolution in an event known as the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which the largest number of creatures evolved in any single period of the history of the Earth. Creatures like algae evolved, but the most ubiquitous of that period were the armored arthropods, like [[trilobite]]s. Almost all marine phyla evolved in this period. During this time, the supercontinent [[Pannotia]] begins to break up, most of which later became the supercontinent Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cambrian/cambrian.php|title=Cambrian|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ordovician Period====
{{main|Ordovician}}

[[File:Ostracoderm digital recreation..jpg|thumb|[[Cephalaspis]] (a jawless fish)]]The Ordovician spanned from approximately 485 million years to approximately 443 million years ago. The Ordovician was a time in Earth's history in which many of the [[Class (biology)|biological class]]es still prevalent today evolved, such as primitive fish, cephalopods, and coral. The most common forms of life, however, were trilobites, snails and shellfish. More importantly, the first arthropods went ashore to colonize the empty continent of [[Gondwana]]. By the end of the Ordovician, Gondwana was at the south pole, early North America had collided with Europe, closing the Atlantic Ocean. Glaciation of Africa resulted in a major drop in sea level, killing off all life that had established along coastal Gondwana. Glaciation may have caused the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]], in which 60% of marine invertebrates and 25% of families became extinct, and is considered the first mass extinction event and the second deadliest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/ordovician/ordovician.php|title=Ordovician|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silurian Period====
{{main|Silurian}}

The Silurian spanned from 443 to 416 million years ago. The Silurian saw the rejuvenation of life as the  Earth recovered from the previous glaciation. This period saw the mass evolution of fish, as jawless fish became more numerous, jawed fish evolved, and the first freshwater fish evolved, though arthropods, such as [[Eurypterida|sea scorpions]], were still [[apex predator]]s. Fully terrestrial life evolved, including early arachnids, fungi, and centipedes. The evolution of [[vascular plants]] ([[Cooksonia]]) allowed plants to gain a foothold on land. These early plants are the forerunners of all plant life on land. During this time, there were four continents: Gondwana (Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica, Siberia), Laurentia (North America), Baltica (Northern Europe), and Avalonia (Western Europe). The recent rise in sea levels allowed many new species to thrive in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/silurian/silurian.php|author=University of California|title=Silurian|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Devonian Period====
{{main|Devonian }}

[[File:Eogyrinus BW.jpg|thumb|[[Eogyrinus]] (an amphibian) of the Carboniferous]]The Devonian spanned from 416 million years to 359 million years ago. Also known as "The Age of the Fish", the Devonian featured a huge diversification of fish, including armored fish like ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' and lobe-finned fish which eventually evolved into the first [[tetrapod]]s. On land, plant groups diversified incredibly in an event known as the [[Devonian Explosion]] when plants made lignin allowing taller growth and vascular tissue: the first trees evolved, as well as seeds. This event also diversified arthropod life, by providing them new habitats. The first amphibians also evolved, and the fish were now at the top of the food chain. Near the end of the Devonian, 70% of all species became extinct in an event known as the [[Late Devonian extinction]], which was the Earth's second mass extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/devonian/devonian.php|title=Devonian|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carboniferous Period====
{{main|Carboniferous}}

The Carboniferous spanned from 359 million to 299 million years ago. During this time, average global temperatures were exceedingly high; the early Carboniferous averaged at about 20 degrees Celsius (but cooled to 10&amp;nbsp;°C during the Middle Carboniferous).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html|title=Carboniferous Era|author=Monte Hieb|work=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical swamps dominated the Earth, and the lignin stiffened trees grew to greater heights and number. As the bacteria and fungi capable of eating the lignin had not yet evolved, their remains were left buried, which created much of the carbon that became the coal deposits of today (hence the name "Carboniferous"). Perhaps the most important evolutionary development of the time was the evolution of [[Amniote|amniotic eggs]], which allowed amphibians to move farther inland and remain the dominant vertebrates for the duration of this period. Also, the first reptiles and [[synapsid]]s evolved in the swamps. Throughout the Carboniferous, there was a cooling trend, which led to the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation or the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]]. [[Gondwana]] was glaciated as much of it was situated around the south pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/carboniferous/carboniferous.php|title=Carboniferous|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permian Period====
{{main|Permian}}

[[File:DimetrodonKnight.jpg|thumb|Synapsid: [[Dimetrodon]]]]

The Permian spanned from 299 to 252 million years ago and was the last period of the Paleozoic Era. At the beginning of this period, all continents joined together to form the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], which was encircled by one ocean called [[Panthalassa]]. The land mass was very dry during this time, with harsh seasons, as the climate of the interior of Pangaea was not regulated by large bodies of water. [[Diapsid]]s and [[synapsid]]s flourished in the new dry climate. Creatures such as [[Dimetrodon]] and [[Edaphosaurus]] ruled the new continent. The first conifers evolved, and dominated the terrestrial landscape. Near the end of the Permian, however, Pangaea grew drier. The interior was desert, and new species such as [[Scutosaurus]] and [[Gorgonopsia|Gorgonopsids]] filled it. Eventually they disappeared, along with 95% of all life on Earth, in a cataclysm known as "[[Permian&amp;ndash;Triassic extinction event|The Great Dying]]", the third and most severe mass extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/dinosaurs-other-extinct-creatures/mass-extinctions/end-permian-mass-extinction/|title=The Great Dying|author=Natural History Museum|work=Natural History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permian.php|title=Permian Era|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic activity==
Geologically, the Paleozoic started shortly after the breakup of the [[supercontinent]]  [[Pannotia]]. Throughout the early Paleozoic, that landmass was broken into a substantial number of continents. Towards the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==Climate==
The earliest two periods, the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]], were warm greenhouse periods, with the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic (200&amp;nbsp;m above today's); the warm climate was interrupted only by a {{Ma|30|million year}} cool period, the [[Early Palaeozoic Icehouse]], culminating in the Huronian glaciation, {{Ma|445}} at the end of the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Munnecke | first1 = A.| last2 = Calner | first2 = M.| last3 = Harper | first3 = D.

The early [[Cambrian]] climate was probably moderate at first, becoming warmer over the course of the Cambrian, as the second-greatest sustained [[sea level rise]] in the [[Phanerozoic]] got underway. However, as if to offset this trend, [[Gondwana]] moved south, so that, in Ordovician time, most of West Gondwana (Africa and South America) lay directly over the [[South Pole]]. The early Paleozoic climate was also strongly zonal, with the result that the "climate", in an abstract sense, became warmer, but the living space of most organisms of the time—the continental shelf marine environment—became steadily colder. However, [[Baltica]] (Northern Europe and Russia) and [[Laurentia]] (eastern North America and Greenland) remained in the tropical zone, while China and Australia lay in waters which were at least temperate. The early Paleozoic ended, rather abruptly, with the short, but apparently severe, late Ordovician ice age. This cold spell caused the second-greatest mass extinction of Phanerozoic time. Over time, the warmer weather moved into the Paleozoic Era.

The middle Paleozoic was a time of considerable stability. Sea levels had dropped coincident with the ice age, but slowly recovered over the course of the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]]. The slow merger of [[Baltica]] and [[Laurentia]], and the northward movement of bits and pieces of Gondwana created numerous new regions of relatively warm, shallow sea floor. As plants took hold on the continental margins, [[oxygen]] levels increased and [[carbon dioxide]] dropped, although much less dramatically. The north–south temperature gradient also seems to have moderated, or metazoan life simply became hardier, or both. At any event, the far southern continental margins of [[Antarctica]] and West [[Gondwana]] became increasingly less barren. The Devonian ended with a series of [[Turnover-pulse hypothesis|turnover pulses]] which killed off much of middle Paleozoic vertebrate life, without noticeably reducing species diversity overall.

There are many unanswered questions about the late Paleozoic. The [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] (early Carboniferous Period) began with a spike in atmospheric oxygen, while carbon dioxide plummeted to new lows. This destabilized the climate and led to one, and perhaps two, ice ages during the [[Carboniferous]]. These were far more severe than the brief Late Ordovician ice age; but, this time, the effects on world biota were inconsequential. By the [[Cisuralian]] Epoch, both oxygen and carbon dioxide had recovered to more normal levels. On the other hand, the assembly of [[Pangaea]] created huge arid inland areas subject to temperature extremes. The [[Lopingian]] Epoch is associated with falling sea levels, increased carbon dioxide and general climatic deterioration, culminating in the devastation of the [[Permian extinction]].

==Flora==
[[File:Devonianscene-green.jpg|thumb|An artist's impression of early land plants]]
While macroscopic plant life appeared early in the Paleozoic Era and possibly late in the Neoproterozoic Era of the earlier eon. Plants mostly remained aquatic until sometime in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] Periods, about 420 million years ago, when they began to transition onto dry land. Terrestrial flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, when towering [[lycopsid]] rainforests dominated the tropical belt of [[Euramerica]]. Climate change caused the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] which fragmented this habitat, diminishing the diversity of plant life in the late Carboniferous and Permian.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse" /&gt;

==Fauna==
A noteworthy feature of Paleozoic life is the sudden appearance of nearly all of the [[invertebrate]] animal phyla in great abundance at the beginning of the Cambrian. The first vertebrates appeared in the form of primitive fish, which greatly diversified in the Silurian and Devonian Periods. The first animals to venture onto dry land were the arthropods. Some fish had lungs, and powerful bony fins that in the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago, allowed them to crawl onto land. The bones in their fins eventually evolved into legs and they became the first [[tetrapods]], {{Ma|390}}, and began to develop lungs. Amphibians were the dominant tetrapods until the mid-Carboniferous, when climate change greatly reduced their diversity. Later, reptiles prospered and continued to increase in number and variety by the late Permian.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079|author= Sahney, S.|author2= Benton, M.J.|author3= Falcon-Lang, H.J.|last-author-amp= yes|date=2010|title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica|journal=Geology|volume=38|pages=1079–1082|format=PDF|doi=10.1130/G31182.1|issue=12|bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pedro Cubero Sebastián''' ([[El Frasno]], [[Spain]], 1645 – p.1700)&lt;ref name="Alba"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alba Sanz|first=Ramón|date=2006|title=Viajes y circunstancias de Pedro Cubero Sebastián|journal=Isimu|issue=9|pages=89-105|url=https://revistas.uam.es/isimu/article/viewFile/3304/3521}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Spanish priest, best known for his travel [[Circumnavigation|around the world]] from 1670 to 1679. Taking in account his world circumnavigation and his journeys across Europe he was undoubtedly one of the most widely traveled men in his time.

Pedro Cubero was born in the village of  El Frasno, near to [[Calatayud]], in the Spanish region of [[Aragón]]. He studied in [[Zaragoza]] and [[Salamanca]], up to his ordination as a priest in Zaragoza, and soon afterwards went to [[Rome]], where he joined the [[Propaganda Fide]] congregation.

==Around the world==
[[Image:Peregrinacion del mundo 1682.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Peregrinación del mundo'' (1682)]]
In accordance with his [[missionary]] work, he undertook in 1670 a journey to [[East Asia]], that eventually led him to complete an eastwards around the world trip. The journey is specially memorable as for the first time in History a considerable part of the way was done overland, through [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Western Asia|Western]] and [[Central Asia]] and [[North America]]. So, he preceded [[Gemelli Careri]] who undertook a similar voyage twenty years later.

Actually, he visited [[Paris]], [[Venice]], [[Istanbul]], [[Warsaw]] (he attended there the [[enthronement]] of [[John III Sobieski]]), [[Vilna]], [[Moscow]] (where he met [[Nicolae Milescu]], who acted as Cubero's [[interpreter]]), [[Astrakhan]], [[Isfahan]], [[Bandar Abbass]], [[Surat]], [[Goa]], [[Colombo]], [[Mylapore]], [[Malacca Town|Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Moluccas]], [[Acapulco]], [[Veracruz]], [[Havana]] and eventually [[Cádiz]], among many other places.

===Vicissitudes in Far East===
While sailing from Colombo to Mylapore Cubero was captured by [[Malabars|Malabar]] [[pirates]] and [[Slavery|enslaved]] in the [[Maldive Islands]] for a few months. In Malacca, he was put in jail by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Governor, accused of publicly preaching [[Catholicism]]. 

Once in the [[Philippines]], a Spanish colony, he realized that he was not very welcomed, as he did not belong to any of the [[Catholic religious order|Religious Orders]] that monopolized the missionary work. While in [[Manila]] he suffered the big [[earthquake]] of November 29, 1677. He went for a while to [[Tidore]], despite the recent withdrawal of the Spanish forces there, and it is not clear if he actually entered [[China]] although anyway he dedicated three very detailed chapters of his ''Peregrinación del Mundo'' to China, [[Tartary]] and the Chinese-Tartarian wars.

===Aboard the Manila galleon===
As he felt somehow passed over in the Philippines, he eventually decided to proceed to [[New Spain]]. He crossed the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the 1678 sailing of the [[Manila galleon]], that time a [[carrack]] named ''San Antonio de Padua'' commanded by Don Felipe Montemayor y Prado. The navigation started in [[Cavite]] on 24 June, they caught sight of the American land on 5 December in [[latitude]] North of 29 degrees and docked in Acapulco on 8 January 1679. Only 192 people were alive, several of them dying, out of more than 400 that had begun the voyage.
 
===Back in the Spanish court===
In New Spain he again did not feel himself useful, and decided to return to Spain, this time crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
He finally reached [[Madrid]] in  January 1680, just in time to attend the celebrations of the arrival of [[Marie Louise d'Orléans (1662–1689)|Maria Luisa of Orléans]], recently married to King [[Charles II of Spain]].

He wrote the account of his adventures around the world in a very objective, detailed and interesting book, '''''Peregrinación del mundo''''' (''World's peregrination''), first published in Madrid in 1680. An extended second edition was brought out in 1682 in [[Naples]], by then a Spanish possession.

==Across Europe again==
Later on Cubero went again to Rome, and was appointed by the [[Holy See]] ''Apostolic confessor'' of the Army of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Hungary]], in the [[Great Turkish War]]. There he witnessed the 1686 [[Battle of Buda (1686)|siege of Buda]]. He then traveled to other European countries, and in 1697 published a second book, ''Segunda Peregrinación ...'', that gathered together his European experiences.

A '''pressure vessel''' is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a [[pressure]] substantially different from the ambient pressure.

Pressure vessels can be dangerous, and fatal accidents have occurred in the history of their development and operation. Consequently, pressure vessel design, manufacture, and operation are regulated by engineering authorities backed by legislation. For these reasons, the definition of a pressure vessel varies from country to country.

Design involves parameters such as maximum safe operating pressure and temperature, [[safety factor]], corrosion allowance and minimum design temperature (for brittle fracture). Construction is tested using [[nondestructive testing]], such as [[ultrasonic testing]], [[radiography]], and pressure tests. Hydrostatic tests use water, but pneumatic tests use air or another gas.  Hydrostatic testing is preferred, because it is a safer method, as much less energy is released if a fracture occurs during the test (water does not rapidly increase its volume when rapid depressurization occurs, unlike gases like air, which fail explosively).

In most countries, vessels over a certain size and pressure must be built to a formal code. In the United States that code is the [[ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)]]. These vessels also require an authorized inspector to sign off on every new vessel constructed and each vessel has a nameplate with pertinent information about the vessel, such as maximum allowable working pressure, maximum temperature, minimum design metal temperature, what company manufactured it, the date, its registration number (through the National Board), and [[ASME]]'s official stamp for pressure vessels (U-stamp). The nameplate makes the vessel traceable and officially an [[ASME]] Code vessel.

== History of pressure vessels ==
[[File:Popular Science Jan 1919 p27 - 10,000psi wrapped fuel tank.JPG|right|thumb|A {{convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} pressure vessel from 1919, wrapped with high tensile steel banding and steel rods to secure the end caps.]]
The earliest documented design of pressure vessels was described in 1495 in the book by Leonardo da Vinci, the Codex Madrid I, in which containers of pressurized air were theorized to lift heavy weights underwater.&lt;ref name="Nilsen"&gt;Nilsen, Kyle. (2011) [http://hdl.handle.net/10057/3997 "Development of low pressure filter testing vessel and analysis of electrospun nanofiber membranes for water treatment"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, vessels resembling those used today did not come about until the 1800s, when steam was generated in boilers helping to spur the [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name="Nilsen" /&gt;  However, with poor material quality and manufacturing techniques along with improper knowledge of design, operation and maintenance there was a large number of damaging and often fatal explosions associated with these boilers and pressure vessels, with a death occurring on a nearly daily basis in the United States.&lt;ref name="Nilsen" /&gt;  Local providences and states in the US began enacting rules for constructing these vessels after some particularly devastating vessel failures occurred killing dozens of people at a time, which made it difficult for manufacturers to keep up with the varied rules from one location to another and the first pressure vessel code was developed starting in 1911 and released in 1914, starting the [[ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)]].&lt;ref name="Nilsen" /&gt;  In an early effort to design a tank capable of withstanding pressures up to {{convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} diameter tank was developed in 1919 that was spirally-wound with two layers of high tensile strength steel wire to prevent sidewall rupture, and the end caps longitudinally reinforced with lengthwise high-tensile rods.&lt;ref&gt;''Ingenious Coal-Gas Motor Tank'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, January 1919, page 27, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=HykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&lt;/ref&gt;  The need for high pressure and temperature vessels for petroleum refineries and chemical plants gave rise to vessels joined with welding instead of rivets (which were unsuitable for the pressures and temperatures required) and in the 1920s and 1930s the BPVC included welding as an acceptable means of construction, and welding is the main means of joining metal vessels today.&lt;ref name="Nilsen" /&gt;

There have been many advancements in the field of pressure vessel engineering such as advanced non-destructive examination, phased array ultrasonic testing and radiography, new material grades with increased corrosion resistance and stronger materials, and new ways to join materials such as explosion welding (to attach one metal sheet to another, usually a thin corrosion resistant metal like stainless steel to a stronger metal like carbon steel), friction stir welding (which attaches the metals together without melting the metal), advanced theories and means of more accurately assessing the stresses encountered in vessels such as with the use of Finite Element Analysis, allowing the vessels to be built safer and more efficiently.  Today vessels in the USA require BPVC stamping but the BPVC is not just a domestic code, many other countries have adopted the BPVC as their official code.  There are, however, other official codes in some countries (some of which rely on portions of and reference the BPVC), Japan, Australia, Canada, Britain, and Europe have their own codes. Regardless of the country nearly all recognize the inherent potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes regulating their design and construction.

==Pressure vessel features==

===Shape of a pressure vessel===
Pressure vessels can theoretically be almost any shape, but shapes made of sections of spheres, cylinders, and cones are usually employed. A common design is a cylinder with end caps called [[head (vessel)|heads]]. Head shapes are frequently either hemispherical or dished (torispherical). More complicated shapes have historically been much harder to analyze for safe operation and are usually far more difficult to construct.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:ABC Fire Extinguisher.jpg|Fire Extinguisher with rounded rectangle pressure vessel
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Theoretically, a spherical pressure vessel has approximately twice the strength of a cylindrical pressure vessel with the same wall thickness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearn|first=E.J.|title=Mechanics of Materials 1. An Introduction to the Mechanics of Elastic and Plastic Deformation of Solids and Structural Materials - Third Edition|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Chapter 9|isbn=0-7506-3265-8|pages=199–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the ideal shape to hold internal pressure.&lt;ref name="Nilsen" /&gt; However, a spherical shape is difficult to manufacture, and therefore more expensive, so most pressure vessels are cylindrical with 2:1 semi-elliptical heads or end caps on each end. Smaller pressure vessels are assembled from a pipe and two covers. For cylindrical vessels with a diameter up to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (NPS of 24 in), it is possible to use seamless pipe for the shell, thus avoiding many inspection and testing issues, mainly the nondestructive examination of radiography for the long seam if required. A disadvantage of these vessels is that greater diameters are more expensive, so that for example the most economic shape of a {{convert|1000|l|cuft}}, {{convert|250|bar|psi|lk=on}} pressure vessel might be a diameter of {{convert|91.44|cm|in|0}} and a length of {{convert|1.7018|m|in|0}} including the 2:1 semi-elliptical domed end caps.

===Construction materials===
[[File:Dawn xenon tank.jpg|thumb|200px|Composite overwrapped pressure vessel with titanium liner.]]

Many pressure vessels are made of steel. To manufacture a cylindrical or spherical pressure vessel, rolled and possibly forged parts would have to be welded together. Some mechanical properties of steel, achieved by rolling or forging, could be adversely affected by welding, unless special precautions are taken. In addition to adequate mechanical strength, current standards dictate the use of steel with a high impact resistance, especially for vessels used in low temperatures. In applications where carbon steel would suffer corrosion, special corrosion resistant material should also be used.

Some pressure vessels are made of [[composite material]]s, such as [[filament winding|filament wound composite]] using [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] held in place with a polymer. Due to the very high tensile strength of carbon fibre these vessels can be very light, but are much more difficult to manufacture.  The composite material may be wound around a metal liner, forming a [[composite overwrapped pressure vessel]].

Other very common materials include [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] in carbonated beverage containers and [[copper]] in plumbing.

Pressure vessels may be lined with various metals, ceramics, or polymers to prevent leaking and protect the structure of the vessel from the contained medium.  This liner may also carry a significant portion of the pressure load.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Tech Briefs, [http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/747 "Making a Metal-Lined Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel"], 1 Mar 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frietas, O., "Maintenance and Repair of Glass-Lined Equipment", Chemical Engineering, 1 Jul 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure Vessels may also be constructed from concrete (PCV) or other materials which are weak in tension. Cabling, wrapped around the vessel or within the wall or the vessel itself, provides the necessary tension to resist the internal pressure. A "leakproof steel thin membrane" lines the internal wall of the vessel. Such vessels can be assembled from modular pieces and so have "no inherent size limitations".&lt;ref&gt;"High Pressure Vessels",D. Freyer and J. Harvey, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a high order of redundancy thanks to the large number of individual cables resisting the internal pressure.

The very small cylindrical vessel making the body of a (cigarette) lighter filled with liquid butane (about 2 bar pressure, according to temperature) are often oval (1 x 2 cm ... 1.3 x 2.5 cm) in cross section, but sometimes circular. The oval versions are hold in form by one or two tension struts that seem to be incomplete lengthwise separation walls.

==== Working pressure ====

The typical circular-cylindrical high pressure gas cylinders for permanent gases (that do not liquify at storing pressure, like air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, helium) have been manufactured by hot forging by pressing and rolling to get a seamless steel vessel.

Working pressure of cylinders for use in industry, skilled craft, diving and medicine had a standardized working pressure (WP) of only 150 bars in Europe until about 1950. Since about 1975 until now the standard pressure is 200 bar. Firemen need slim (and lightweight) cylinders to move in confined spaces, about 1995 cylinders for 300 bar WP came up – first in pure steel.

The push to lighter weight lead to different generations of composite (fiber and matrix, over a liner) cylinders that are more easily damageable by a hit from outside. Wall thickness helps to resist. Therefore composite cylinders – fire fighting is an important market – usually are built for 300 bar.

Hydraulic (filled with water) testing pressure is – since ever – usually 50 % higher than the working pressure.

==== Vessel thread ====

Until 1990 all high pressure cylinders produced had a conical (tapered) thread to fit the accordingly manufactured cylinder valves. Two types dominate until now the full metal cylinders in industrial use from 0.2 to 50 litre volume. To screw in the valve a hight torque of typically 200 [[Newtonmeter|Nm]] is necessary for the bigger (23 mm?) thread has to be applied and 100 Nm for the smaller (17 mm?) one. Until round 1950 still hemp has been used as sealant, later a thin sheet of lead pressed to a hat with a hole on top. To avoid lead since about 2005/2010 [[PTFE]]-band is used.

A conical thread is simple construction but it needs a high torque and leads to high radial forces in the neck. All Cylinders built for 300 bar WP, all diving cylinders and all composite cylinders use cylindrical threads. Either 25 x 1.5 mm or – rather for smaller cylinders – the smaller 18 x 1,5 mm. These connections are sealed by an elastomer O-ring pressed by the gas, have a bed-stop and need only about 20 Nm torque compatible with all 3 types of composite cylinders.

==== Development of composite vessels ====

To classify the different making principles of composite cylinders 4 types are defined.

* Type 1 – Full Metal: Cylinder is fully made from metal.
* Type 2 – Hoop Wrap: Metal cylinder, reinforced by a belt-like hoop wrap with fibre-material. The spherical bottom and head of a cylindrical cylinder withstand by geometrical reasons twice the pressure as the cylindrical shell (uniform metal wall thickness assumed).
* Type 3 – Fully Wrapped, over Metal Liner: Diagonally wrapped fibres build up the pressure resisting wall even at the bottom and around the metal neck. The metal liner is thin and makes the vessel gas tight.
* Type 4 – Fully Wrapped, over Non-Metal Liner: A typical lightweight thermoplast liner builds up the (very) gas tight barrier, and (somewhat inflated) the bobbin to wrap fibres and matrix (polyester or epoxi resin) around. Only the neck and its anchor fitting to the liner is still made of metal, lightweight aluminium or sturdy stainless steel.

Type 2 and 3 cylinders came up around 1995. Type 4 cylinders are commercially available at least from 2016 on.

===Safety features===

====Leak before burst====
Leak before burst describes a pressure vessel designed such that a crack in the vessel will grow through the wall, allowing the contained fluid to escape and reducing the pressure, prior to growing so large as to cause [[fracture]] at the operating pressure.

Many pressure vessel standards, including the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aero Engine Combustor Casing: Experimental Design and Fatigue Studies|last=Sashi Kanta Panigrahi, Niranjan Sarangi|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=9781351642835|location=|pages=4-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AIAA metallic pressure vessel standard, either require pressure vessel designs to be leak before burst, or require pressure vessels to meet more stringent requirements for [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and fracture if they are not shown to be leak before burst.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/AIAA S-080-1998, Space Systems - Metallic Pressure Vessels, Pressurized Structures, and Pressure Components, §5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety valves====
[[File:Gasfüllventil.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of a valve used for gas cylinders.]]

As the pressure vessel is designed to a pressure, there is typically a [[safety valve]] or [[relief valve]] to ensure that this pressure is not exceeded in operation.

===Maintenance features===

==== Pressure vessel closures ====
Pressure vessel closures are pressure retaining structures designed to provide quick access to pipelines, pressure vessels, pig traps, filters and filtration systems. Typically pressure vessel closures allow maintenance personnel.

==Uses==
[[File:Methanier aspher LNGRIVERS.jpg|thumb|300px|An LNG carrier ship with four pressure vessels for [[liquefied natural gas]].]]
Pressure vessels are used in a variety of applications in both industry and the private sector. They appear in these sectors as industrial [[compressed air]] receivers and [[domestic hot water storage tank]]s. Other examples of pressure vessels are [[diving cylinder]]s, [[recompression chamber]]s, [[fractional distillation|distillation towers]], [[pressure reactor]]s, [[autoclave]]s, and many other vessels in [[mining]] operations, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[petrochemical]] plants, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, [[submarine]] and [[space ship]] habitats, [[pneumatic]] reservoirs, [[hydraulic]] reservoirs under pressure, [[air brake (rail)|rail vehicle airbrake reservoir]]s, [[air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle airbrake reservoir]]s, and storage vessels for liquified gases such as [[ammonia]], [[chlorine]], and [[liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] ([[propane]], [[butane]]).

A unique application of a pressure vessel is the passenger cabin of an airliner: the outer skin carries both the aircraft maneuvering loads and the [[cabin pressurization]] loads.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Alternatives to pressure vessels==
*[[Natural gas storage]]
*[[Gas holder]]
Depending on the application and local circumstances, alternatives to pressure vessels exist. Examples can be seen in domestic water collection systems, where the following may be used:
*Gravity-controlled systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Doug |last=Pushard |url=http://www.harvesth2o.com/faq.shtml |title=Domestic water collection systems also sometimes able to function on gravity |publisher=Harvesth2o.com |year=2005 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}{{Verify source|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which typically consist of an unpressurized [[water tank]] at an elevation higher than the point of use. Pressure at the point of use is the result of the hydrostatic pressure caused by the elevation difference. Gravity systems produce {{convert|0.43|psi|kPa}} per foot of water head (elevation difference). A municipal water supply or pumped water is typically around {{convert|90|psi|kPa}}.
*[[Inline pump controller]]s or [[pressure sensor|pressure-sensitive]] pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Doug |last=Pushard |url=http://www.harvesth2o.com/pumps_or_tanks.shtml |title=Alternatives to pressure vessels in domestic water systems |publisher=Harvesth2o.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Scaling===
No matter what shape it takes, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel scales with the pressure and volume it contains and is inversely proportional to the [[strength to weight ratio]] of the construction material (minimum mass decreases as strength increases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Puskarich|url=http://www.gmic.org/Student%20Contest%20Entries/2007%20Contest%20Entries/26-Paul%20Puskarich%20-%20Glass%20for%20Pipeline%20Systems.pdf|title=Strengthened Glass for Pipeline Systems|date=2009-05-01|format=PDF|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2009-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315184643/http://www.gmic.org/Student%20Contest%20Entries/2007%20Contest%20Entries/26-Paul%20Puskarich%20-%20Glass%20for%20Pipeline%20Systems.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Scaling of stress in walls of vessel====

Pressure vessels are held together against the gas pressure due to tensile forces within the walls of the container. The normal (tensile) [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the walls of the container is proportional to the pressure and radius of the vessel and inversely proportional to the thickness of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanics of Materials |first1=Ferdinand P. |last1=Beer |first2=E. Russel |last2=Johnston, Jr. |first3=John T. |last3=DeWolf |edition=fourth |chapter=7.9 |page=463 |isbn=9780073659350 |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, pressure vessels are designed to have a thickness proportional to the radius of tank and the pressure of the tank and inversely proportional to the maximum allowed normal stress of the particular material used in the walls of the container.

Because (for a given pressure) the thickness of the walls scales with the radius of the tank, the mass of a tank (which scales as the length times radius times thickness of the wall for a cylindrical tank) scales with the volume of the gas held (which scales as length times radius squared). The exact formula varies with the tank shape but depends on the density, ρ, and maximum allowable stress σ of the material in addition to the pressure P and volume V of the vessel. (See below for the exact equations for the stress in the walls.)

====Spherical vessel====
For a [[sphere]], the minimum mass of a pressure vessel is

:&lt;math&gt;M = {3 \over 2} P V {\rho \over \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;,

where:
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is mass, (kg)
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure difference from ambient (the [[gauge pressure]]), (Pa)
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume,
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the pressure vessel material, (kg/m^3)
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum working [[stress (physics)|stress]] that material can tolerate. (Pa)&lt;ref&gt;For a sphere the thickness d = rP/2σ, where r is the radius of the tank. The volume of the spherical surface then is 4πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d = 4πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P/2σ. The mass is determined by multiplying by the density of the material that makes up the walls of the spherical vessel. Further the volume of the gas is (4πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)/3. Combining these equations give the above results. The equations for the other geometries are derived in a similar manner&lt;/ref&gt;

Other shapes besides a sphere have constants larger than 3/2 (infinite cylinders take 2), although some tanks, such as non-spherical wound composite tanks can approach this.

====Cylindrical vessel with hemispherical ends====
This is sometimes called a "bullet"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} for its shape, although in geometric terms it is a [[Capsule (geometry)|capsule]].

For a cylinder with hemispherical ends,
:&lt;math&gt;M = 2 \pi R^2 (R + W) P {\rho \over \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;,
where
*R is the radius (m)
*W is the middle cylinder width only, and the overall width is W + 2R (m)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/Mass+of+pressure+Cylindrical+vessel+with+hemispherical+ends(+capsule)|title=Mass of pressure Cylindrical vessel with hemispherical ends( capsule) - calculator - fxSolver|website=www.fxsolver.com|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cylindrical vessel with semi-elliptical ends====
In a vessel with an [[aspect ratio]] of middle cylinder width to radius of 2:1,
:&lt;math&gt;M = 6 \pi R^3 P {\rho \over \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Gas storage====
In looking at the first equation, the factor PV, in SI units, is in units of (pressurization) energy.  For a stored gas, PV is proportional to the mass of gas at a given temperature, thus
:&lt;math&gt;M = {3 \over 2} nRT {\rho \over \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;. (see [[gas law]])

The other factors are constant for a given vessel shape and material.  So we can see that there is no theoretical "efficiency of scale", in terms of the ratio of pressure vessel mass to pressurization energy, or of pressure vessel mass to stored gas mass.  For storing gases, "tankage efficiency" is independent of pressure, at least for the same temperature.

So, for example, a typical design for a minimum mass tank to hold [[helium]] (as a pressurant gas) on a rocket would use a spherical chamber for a minimum shape constant, carbon fiber for best possible &lt;math&gt;\rho / \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and very cold helium for best possible &lt;math&gt;M / {pV}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stress in thin-walled pressure vessels===
Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a sphere is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \sigma_{\rm long} = \frac{pr}{2t}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta&lt;/math&gt; is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{long}&lt;/math&gt; is stress in the longitudinal direction, ''p'' is internal gauge pressure, ''r'' is the inner radius of the sphere, and ''t'' is thickness of the sphere wall.  A vessel can be considered "shallow-walled" if the diameter is at least 10 times (sometimes cited as 20 times) greater than the wall depth.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Budynas, J. Nisbett, Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design, 8th ed., New York:McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|978-0-07-312193-2}}, pg 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reservoir cylindrique sous pression contrainte.svg|thumb|300px|Stress in the cylinder body of a pressure vessel.]]
Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a cylinder is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \frac{pr}{t}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\rm long} = \frac{pr}{2t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta&lt;/math&gt; is [[hoop stress]], or stress in the circumferential direction
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{long}&lt;/math&gt; is stress in the longitudinal direction
* ''p'' is internal gauge pressure
* ''r'' is the inner radius of the cylinder
* ''t'' is thickness of the cylinder wall.

Almost all pressure vessel design standards contain variations of these two formulas with additional empirical terms to account for variation of stresses across thickness, quality control of [[welding|welds]] and in-service [[corrosion]] allowances.
All formulae mentioned above assume uniform distribution of membrane stresses across thickness of shell but in reality, that is not the case. Deeper analysis is given by Lame's theory. The formulae of pressure vessel design standards are extension of Lame's theory by putting some limit on ratio of inner radius and thickness.

For example, the [[ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)]] (UG-27) formulas are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An International Code 2007 ASME Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code|year=2007|publisher=The Americal Society of Mechanical Engineers|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/standards/bpvc-resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Spherical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.356 times inner radius
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \sigma_{\rm long} = \frac{p(r + 0.2t)}{2tE}&lt;/math&gt;

Cylindrical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.5 times inner radius
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \frac{p(r + 0.6t)}{tE}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\rm long} = \frac{p(r - 0.4t)}{2tE}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the joint efficient, and all others variables as stated above.

The [[factor of safety]] is often included in these formulas as well, in the case of the ASME BPVC this term is included in the material stress value when solving for pressure or thickness.

===Winding angle of carbon fibre vessels===
Wound infinite cylindrical shapes optimally take a winding angle of 54.7 degrees, as this gives the necessary twice the strength in the circumferential direction to the longitudinal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/pv.pdf MIT pressure vessel lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation standards ===

Pressure vessels are designed to operate safely at a specific pressure and temperature, technically referred to as the "Design Pressure" and "Design Temperature". A vessel that is inadequately designed to handle a high pressure constitutes a very significant safety hazard. Because of that, the design and certification of pressure vessels is governed by design codes such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers#ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)|ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]] in North America, the [[Pressure Equipment Directive]] of the [[European Union|EU]] (PED), [[Japanese Industrial Standard]] (JIS), [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] B51 in [[Canada]], [[Australian Standards]] in Australia and other [[international standard]]s like [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]], [[Germanischer Lloyd]], [[Det Norske Veritas]], Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS S.A.), [http://www.lr.org/nl/energy/stoomwezen/ Lloyd’s Register Energy Nederland (formerly known as Stoomwezen)] etc.

Note that where the pressure-volume product is part of a safety standard, any incompressible liquid in the vessel can be excluded as it does not contribute to the potential energy stored in the vessel, so only the volume of the compressible part such as gas is used.

'''Propane refrigeration''' is a type of [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|compression refrigeration]]. Propane (R290) has been used successfully in industrial refrigeration for many years, and is emerging as an increasingly viable alternative for homes and businesses. Propane's operating pressures and temperatures are well suited for use in air conditioning equipment, but because of propane’s flammability, great care is required in the manufacture, installation and servicing of equipment that uses it as a refrigerant.

Propane that is supplied for general use – such as in barbeques and patio heaters – is not suitable for use in refrigeration systems because it can contain high levels of contaminants, including moisture and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Only propane produced specifically for use in refrigeration systems – with a purity of at least 98.5% and moisture content below 10ppm (by weight) – should be used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cibsejournal.com/cpd/modules/2016-09-fgas/ ICIBSE Journal Propane as a refrigerant for use in chillers for air conditioning applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a global warming potential (GWP) of 3 and an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0, R-290 is of very little threat to the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed R-290 as an acceptable refrigerant substitute under its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), and recently exempted it from the venting prohibition in Section 608 of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/snap/substitutes-household-refrigerators-and-freezers United States Environmental Protection Agency, Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), Substitutes in Household Refrigerators and Freezers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pseudospark switch''', also known as a [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[thyratron]] due to the similarities with regular thyratrons, is a [[gas-filled tube]] capable of high speed [[switch]]ing. Advantages of pseudospark switches include the ability to carry reverse currents (up to 100%), low pulse, high lifetime, and a high current rise of about 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[Ampere|A]]/sec. In addition, since the cathode is not heated prior to switching, the [[standby power]] is approximately one [[order of magnitude]] lower than in thyratrons. However, pseudospark switches have undesired plasma phenomena at low peak currents. Issues such as current quenching, chopping, and [[electrical impedance|impedance]] fluctuations occur at currents less than 2-3 kA while at very high peak currents (20-30 kA) a transition to a metal vapor arc occurs which leads to [[erosion]] of the [[electrode]]s.&lt;ref name=urban&gt;{{Cite book | pages = 217–220| last = Urban| first = Jurgen |author2=Klaus Frank  | title = Cold Cathode Thyratron Development for Pulsed Power Applications | journal = Power Modulator Symposium, 2002 and 2002 High-Voltage Workshop.

== Construction ==
A pseudospark switch's electrodes (cathode and anode) have central holes approximately 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. Behind the cathode and anode lie a [[Hollow cathode effect|hollow cathode]] and hollow anode, respectively. The electrodes are separated by an insulator. A low pressure (less than 50&amp;nbsp;Pa) "working gas" (typically [[hydrogen]]) is contained between the electrodes.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;

While a pseudospark switch is generally fairly simple in construction, engineering a switch for higher lifetimes is more difficult. One method of extending the lifetime is to create a multichannel pseudospark switch to distribute the current and as a result, decrease the erosion. Another method is to simply use cathode materials more resistant to erosion.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;

Typical electrode materials include [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]]/[[rhenium]], [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], and [[ceramic]] materials. Tantalum, however, cannot be used with hydrogen due to chemical erosion affecting the lifetime adversely.&lt;ref name=prucker&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1109/DEIV.1998.740653 | pages = 398–401| last = Prucker| first = U. | title = Electrode Erosion of High-Current Pseudospark Switches | journal = Discharges and Electrical Insulation in Vacuum, 1998.

== Pseudospark discharge ==
[[File:Pseudospark Switch.jpg|thumb|650px|center|The various phases of a pseudospark switch discharge.]]
In a pseudospark discharge a breakdown is first triggered between the electrodes by applying a voltage. The gas then breaks down as a function of the pressure, distance, and voltage. An "[[electron avalanche|ionization avalanche]]" then occurs producing a homogeneous discharge [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] confined to the central regions of the electrodes.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;

In the figure above, the various stages of the pseudospark discharge can be seen. Stage (I) is the triggering or low current phase. The discharges in both stage (II), the hollow cathode phase, and stage (III), the borehole phase, are capable of carrying currents of several hundred [[Ampere|amps]]. The transition from the borehole phase to the high current phase (IV) is very fast, characterized by a sudden jump in switch impedance. The last phase (V) only occurs for currents of several 10&amp;nbsp;kA and is unwelcome as it results in high erosion rates.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7796">A '''pyrotechnic initiator''' (also '''initiator''' or '''igniter''') is a device containing a [[pyrotechnic composition]] used primarily to ignite other, more difficult-to-ignite materials, e.g. [[thermite]]s, [[gas generator]]s, and [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. The name is often used also for the compositions themselves.

Pyrotechnic initiators are often controlled electrically (called '''electro-pyrotechnic initiators'''), e.g. using a heated [[bridgewire]] or a ''bridge resistor''. They are somewhat similar to [[blasting cap]]s or other [[detonator]]s, but they differ in that there is no intention to produce a shock wave. An example of such pyrotechnic initiator is an [[electric match]].

==Composition==
The energetic material used, often called '''pyrogen''', is usually a [[pyrotechnic composition]] made of a fuel and oxidizer, where the fuel produces a significant amount of hot particles that cause/promote the ignition of the desired material.

Initiator compositions are similar to [[flash powder]]s, but they differ in burning speed, as [[explosion]] is not intended, and have intentionally high production of hot particles. They also tend to be easier to ignite than [[thermite]]s, with which they also share similarities.

Common oxidizers used are [[potassium perchlorate]] and [[potassium nitrate]]. Common fuels used are [[titanium]], [[titanium(II) hydride]], [[zirconium]], [[zirconium hydride]], and [[boron]]. The size of the fuel particles is determined to produce hot particles with the required burning time. 

More exotic materials can be used, e.g. [[carborane]]s. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008051653/http://www.patentopedia.us/baton/carborane-containing_airbag_inflator.html]

For special applications, [[pyrophoric]] igniters can be used which burst into flame in contact with air. [[Triethylborane]] was used as an igniter for the [[Lockheed SR-71]] jet engines.

==Common compositions==

===Metal-oxidizer===

====ZPP====
One of the most common initiators is '''ZPP''', or '''zirconium – potassium perchlorate''' – a mixture of metallic zirconium and potassium perchlorate. It is also known as the '''NASA Standard Initiator'''. It yields rapid pressure rise, generates little gas, emits hot particles when ignited, is thermally stable, has long shelf life, and is stable under vacuum. It is sensitive to [[static electricity]].

====BPN====
Another common igniter formula is '''BPN''', '''BKNO3''', or '''boron – potassium nitrate''', a mixture of 25% [[boron]] and 75% [[potassium nitrate]] by weight. It is used e.g. by [[NASA]]. It is thermally stable, stable in vacuum, and its burn rate is independent of pressure.

In comparison with black powder, BPN burns significantly hotter and leaves more of solid residues, therefore black powder is favored for multiple-use systems.

BPN's high temperature makes it suitable for uses where rapid and reproducible initiation is critical, e.g. for [[airbag]]s, rocket engines, and [[decoy flare]]s. It is however relatively expensive. 

BPN can be also used as an ingredient of [[solid rocket propellant]]s. [http://msds.ihs.com/partinfo.aspx?partid=8864]

BPN can be ignited by a laser. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110612195047/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4892037/description.html] A semiconductor laser of at least 0.4 watts output can be used for ignition in vacuum. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004402/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200704/000020070407A0071092.php]

====Others====
Other mixtures encountered are [[aluminium]]-[[potassium perchlorate]] and [[titanium]]-aluminium-potassium perchlorate. [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4391196.html]

===Metal hydride-oxidizer===
[[Metal hydride]]-oxidizer mixtures replace the metal with its corresponding [[hydride]]. They are generally safer to handle than the corresponding metal-oxidizer compositions. During burning they also release [[hydrogen]], which can act as a secondary fuel. Zirconium hydride, titanium hydride, and boron hydride are commonly used.

====ZHPP====
'''ZHPP''' ('''zirconium hydride – potassium perchlorate''') is a variant of ZPP that uses [[zirconium hydride]] instead of pure zirconium. It is significantly safer to handle than ZPP. [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6117254.html]

====THPP====
'''THPP''' (titanium hydride potassium perchlorate) is a mixture of [[titanium(II) hydride]] and potassium perchlorate. It is similar to ZHPP. Like ZHPP, it is safer to handle than titanium-potassium perchlorate. [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6117254.html]

===Intermetallics===
Formation of an [[intermetallic]] compound can be a strongly exothermic reaction, usable as an initiator.

====Titanium-boron====
[[Titanium]]-[[boron]] composition is one of the hottest pyrotechnic reactions in common usage. It is solid-state, gasless. It can be used as a pyrotechnic initiator or for heating confined gas to perform mechanical work. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090329111954/http://www.energystorm.us/Titanium_boron_Mixtures_As_Variable_Heat_Sources-r97826.html]

====Nickel-aluminium====
[[Nickel]]-[[aluminium]] [[laminate]]s can be used as electrically initiated pyrotechnic initiators. [[NanoFoil]] is such material, commercially available.

====Palladium-aluminium====
[[Palladium]]-clad [[aluminium]] wires can be used as a [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]] wire, known as '''Pyrofuze'''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070538/http://www.sigmundcohn.com/pdf/EN/pyrofuze.pdf] The reaction is initiated by heat, typically supplied by electric current pulse. The reaction begins at 600 °C, the melting point of aluminium, and proceeds violently to temperature of 2200–2800 °C. The reaction does not need presence of oxygen, and the wire is consumed. [http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00354289.pdf]

Pyrofuze comes as a solid wire of different diameters (from 0.002" to 0.02"), braided wire, ribbon, foil, and granules. Palladium, [[platinum]], or palladium alloyed with 5% [[ruthenium]] can be used together with aluminium. [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4208967.html][http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5036769.html] Pyrofuze [[bridgewire]]s can be used in [[Squib (explosive)|squib]]s and [[electric match]]es. Pyrofuze foils can be used for e.g. sealing of various dispensers or fire extinguishing systems. [http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADD009057] Palladium-magnesium composition can also be used, but is not commercially available or not at least as common. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718132603/http://xrint.com/patents/us/3889755]

===Others===

====BNCP====
'''BNCP''', ('''''cis''-bis-(5-nitrotetrazolato)tetraminecobalt(III) perchlorate''') is another common initiator material. It is relatively insensitive. It undergoes [[deflagration]] to [[detonation]] transition in a relatively short distance, allowing its use in [[detonator]]s. Its burning byproducts are of relatively little harm to environment. [http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/6672215.html] It can be ignited by a [[laser diode]].

====Lead azide====
[[Lead azide]] (Pb(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or PbN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is occasionally used in pyrotechnic initiators.

====Others====
Other materials sensitive to heat can be used as well, e.g. [[HMTD]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyronfo.com/high-explosives/how-to-create-an-annm-detonator.html HMTD as initiator]&lt;/ref&gt; [[tetrazene explosive]], lead mononitro-resorcinates, lead dinitro-resorcinates, and lead trinitro-resorcinates.

'''Racing Green Endurance''' ('''RGE''') is a student-led project at '''[[Imperial College London]]''' to demonstrate the potential of [[zero emission]] cars. The team drove 26,000&amp;nbsp;km down the [[Pan-American Highway]] starting from north Alaska in July 2010, this was filmed by the documentary maker [[Claudio Von Planta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportevolved.com/transportevolvedarchive/transport-evolved-episode-31-we-made-it.html Interview with [[Claudio von Planta]] by ''Transport evolved'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
'''Sustainability''' - Electric vehicles have the potential to realise a [[sustainable transport]] future, without depleting valuable resources for future generations. The RGE project aims to demonstrate this while pushing the boundaries of electric vehicle (EV) technology. 
&lt;br /&gt;'''Education''' - The team want to help encourage the next generation of scientists and engineers through the outreach program. They plan to use the RGE project as an exhilarating example of where maths and science can take you. 
&lt;br /&gt;'''Adventure''' - The Radical SR''Zero'' aims to be the world’s most focused, fun-to-drive alternative propulsion vehicle. By taking on this epic journey, they hope to add a sense of excitement and get people interested in electric vehicles.

==RGE’s vehicle==
[[Image:RGETeam.jpg|thumb]]
RGE was sponsored an SR8 rolling chassis by [[Radical Sportscars]] to convert into a road legal electric sportscar. The electric SR8, dubbed the SR''Zero'', was designed and built in just 7 months with components donated by many other companies. 
&lt;br /&gt;On May 21, 2010, the car drove for the first time, but subsequent problems with electromagnetic interference (EMI) put the car back in the garage for several days work to rectify the problem. However, by the end of April the car had been successfully track tested up to a limited speed of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h).
On April 29, 2010 the car passed the Individual Vehicle Assessment (IVA), and so is road legal in the UK and abroad. The SR''Zero'' now has the largest battery pack by energy storage out of any known road legalised vehicle in the UK.

==The trip==
In July 2010 the team took the 400&amp;nbsp;bhp SR''Zero'' all 26,000&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Pan-American Highway]], educating and raising awareness along the way. Part of the mission is to dispel any worries about the range of electric cars. On the days of full driving the batteries will be drained 2/3, charged 1/3 and then depleted ready for an overnight charge. 
The journey lasted roughly three months, stopping at all major cities along the route to showcase the car and technology.

==Public engagement==
The public were encouraged to get involved wherever possible. Suggestions regarding places to visit on the trip, places to showcase the car, useful contacts, or even personal favours were all greatly appreciated via [[Twitter]] or email.

==Origins==
Racing Green Endurance was born as a spin-off from '''Imperial Racing Green''' in late 2008. Imperial Racing Green is an undergraduate teaching project to design and build fuel cell/electric hybrid racing cars, involving around 100 students from 8 departments within the university. The students are now designing and building the third generation of fuel cell powered racers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/media/podcasts Imperial Magazine monthly Podcast on Racing Green and Racing Green Endurance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/media/podcasts/maytranscript1#rg Transcript of Imperial Magazine monthly Podcast on Racing Green and Racing Green Endurance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar shingles''', also called '''photovoltaic shingles''', are [[solar panel]]s designed to look like and function as conventional roofing materials, such as [[asphalt shingle]] or slate, while also producing electricity. Solar shingles are a type of solar energy solution known as [[building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV).

There are several varieties of solar shingles, including shingle-sized solid panels that take the place of a number of conventional shingles in a strip, semi-rigid designs containing several silicon solar cells that are sized more like conventional shingles, and newer systems using various [[Solar cell#Thin-film processing|thin-film solar cell]] technologies that match conventional shingles both in size and flexibility. There are also products using a more traditional number of silicon solar cells per panel reaching as much as 100 [[watt]]s [[Direct current|DC]] rating per shingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SunTegra Solar Shingle 100W |url=http://www.suntegrasolar.com/suntegra-shingles |website=SunTegra Solar |accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar shingles are manufactured by several companies&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idAFN0536825520091005?rpc=44 |title=Dow to sell solar shingle, sees huge market |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2009-10-08 |last=Goldstein |first=Matthew |work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the three main manufacturers of solar roof shingles are [[RGS Energy]], [[SolarCity]], and [[CertainTeed]].&lt;ref&gt;List of [http://roofpedia.com/solar-roof-shingles/#manufacturers Solar Roof Shingle Manufacturers].&lt;/ref&gt; Other active companies in the US include SunTegra Solar Roof Systems,&lt;ref name="suntegrasolar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntegrasolar.com|title=Long Island Solar Panel Installation - Find Solar Installers|author=|date=|website=www.suntegrasolar.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Atlantis Energy Systems (asphalt and slate systems).&lt;ref name="Atlantis Energy Systems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantisenergy.com|title=Atlantis Energy Systems|author=|date=|website=atlantisenergy.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Solar shingles became commercially available in 2005.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun Roof: Solar Panel Shingles Come Down in Price, Gain in Popularity |url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/im-getting-my-roof-redone-and-heard-about-solar-shingles/ |website=Scientific American|accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview with Reuters, a spokesperson for the [[Dow Chemical Company]] estimated that their entry into the solar shingle market would generate [[US|$]]5 billion in revenue by 2015 and $10 billion by 2020. Dow solar shingles, known as the POWERHOUSE Solar System, first became available in [[Solar power in Colorado|Colorado]], in October 2011. The POWERHOUSE Solar System continues to live on in its 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; generation iteration, and has exclusively been licensed to RGS Energy for commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/real-goods-solar-inc-rgse-155428529.html|title=Real Goods Solar, Inc. (RGSE) Stock Skyrockets on Dow Deal|author=|date=4 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2018|via=www.finance.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Tesla entered the solar shingle space in a joint venture with [[SolarCity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-31/no-one-saw-tesla-s-solar-roof-coming|title=No One Saw Tesla’s Solar Roof Coming|author=|date=31 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Solar shingles are photovoltaic modules, capturing sunlight and transforming it into electricity. Most solar shingles are {{convert|12|x|86|in|abbr=on}} and can be stapled directly to the roofing cloth. When applied they have a {{convert|5|x|86|in|abbr=on}} strip of exposed surface. Different models of shingles have different mounting requirements. Some can be applied directly onto roofing felt intermixed with regular asphalt shingles while others may need special installation.

Some early manufacturers used solar thin-film technologies, such as [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS]] to produce electricity, which are less common in the solar industry than silicon-based cells. Current manufacturers, such as RGS Energy, CertainTeed, and SunTegra, have chosen to use the industry-standard monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar cells in their POWERHOUSE 3.0, Apollo II, and SunTegra Shingle, respectively. The installation methods for some solar shingle solutions can be easier than traditional panel installations because they avoid the need to locate rafters and install with a process much more similar to asphalt shingles than standard solar panels.

Solar shingled roofs tend to have a deep, dark, purplish-blue or black color, and therefore look similar to other roofs in most situations. Tesla Solar has developed shingles in several styles to better match traditional roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/solar|title=Tesla Solar Roof|author=|date=|website=www.tesla.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeowners may prefer solar shingles because they avoid having large panels on their roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,1205726,00.html|title=Solar Shingles|author=|date=19 June 2006|website=thisoldhouse.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in 2018 Tesla will offer shingles in slate and Tuscan styles, these are the first of the solar shingles which look the same as a slate or Tuscan style roof but still provide solar power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/solarroof|title=Tesla Solar Roof|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have been "Test video for the highest (class 4) hail rating, filmed at 2,500 frames per second. Each 2" hailstone is travelling 100 mph on impact." which shows how these new options are also safer in disasters than tradition materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cost==
The cost of solar shingles can range from $3.75 per watt up to $12.00 per watt installed depending on the manufacturer, technology used, and system size.  As of Q3 of 2015, the average cost of a traditional, roof-mounted residential solar panel installation in the United States was just above $3.50 per watt, according to the [[Solar Energy Industry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEIA Market Insight Report Q3 2015 |url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-2015-q3 |website=SEIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solar shingles are typically more expensive to install than traditional solar panels, some companies in recent years since 2014 have made strides to lessen the gap between the installed cost of going solar with panels versus going solar with shingles.

According to Dow Chemical Company reports, a typical residential install consisting of 350 solar shingles can cost at least $20,000; however, federal and state incentives depending on the location might significantly bring down the cost.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Solar contractors typically offer homeowners a full-service price for solar installation, which includes equipment purchasing, permit preparation and filing, registration with the local utility company, workmanship warranties, and complete on-site installation. Because photovoltaic solutions produce power in the form of [[Direct current|direct current (DC)]] and the standard in homes is [[Alternating current|alternating current (AC)]], all grid-connected solar installations include an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] to convert DC to AC.

==Availability==
As of 2015, companies offering solar shingles in the United States included CertainTeed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.certainteed.com/roofing/solar|title=Solar Home Page|author=|date=2 March 2016|website=certainteed.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forward Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forwardsolarroofing.com/|title=Forward Solar Roofing - Solar Energy as Elegant as It Is Essential|author=|date=|website=www.forwardsolarroofing.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SunTegra Solar Roof Systems,&lt;ref name="suntegrasolar.com" /&gt; and Atlantis Energy Systems (asphalt and slate systems).&lt;ref name="Atlantis Energy Systems"/&gt; 

In January 2018, Tesla announced, after testing on employees' roofs, that it would begin installing the [[Tesla Solar Roof]] on commercial customers' homes "within the next few months".&lt;ref&gt;Eckhouse, Brian.

'''Sprung mass''' (or '''sprung weight'''), in a [[vehicle]] with a [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], such as an [[automobile]], [[motorcycle]], or a [[tank]], is the portion of the vehicle's total mass that is supported by the suspension, including in most applications approximately half of the weight of the suspension itself. The sprung mass typically includes the body, frame, the internal components, passengers, and [[cargo]], but does not include the mass of the components at the other end of the suspension components (including the [[wheel]]s, wheel bearings, brake rotors, calipers, and/or [[continuous track]]s (also called caterpillar tracks), if any), which are part of the vehicle's [[unsprung mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprung mass and Unsprung mass|url=http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/auto-insight/sprung-mass-and-unsprung-mass/9188/1|publisher=ZigWheels|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger the ratio of sprung mass to unsprung mass, the less the body and vehicle occupants are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large sprung mass to unsprung mass ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
