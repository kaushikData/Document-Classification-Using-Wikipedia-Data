'''Andrey Yevgenyevich Lichko''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Евге́ньевич Личко}}; 1926–1994) was a Russian [[psychiatrist]], an honored science worker of the [[Russian Federation]], [[Doctor of Medicine]], and vice principal of [[Saint-Petersburg]] Psychoneurological Institute n.a. [[Vladimir Bekhterev|V.M. Bekhterev]].&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt; His main directions of scientific research were [[diagnostics]] and [[therapy|treatment]] of [[mental disorders]] of [[adolescence|adolescents]].

== Contributions ==
Lichko created his own [[Personality type|personality typology]] on the basis of works by [[Pyotr Gannushkin]] and [[Karl Leonhard]]. He has written several [[psychiatry]] [[book]]s: "Adolescent Psychiatry", "[[Psychopathy]] and Accentuations of Character at Teenagers", "[[Schizophrenia]] in Teenagers", and "Adolescent Narcology". He is also known as the author of a book called "History as Viewed by a Psychiatrist: Ivan the Terrible, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Nikolai Gogol, and Others".&lt;ref&gt;Lichko, Andrey &amp; M. Y. Ivanov. “The Pathocharacterological Diagnostic Questionnaire for Teenagers and the Experience in Application of This Method”. Moscow: Folium, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties Lichko spearheaded an effort to revive the ''[[Bekhterev Review of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Личко Андрей Евгеньевич (1926-1994). Предисловие к кн.: [http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000405565 ''Личко А.Е.'' Психопатии и акцентуации характера у подростков]. СПб.: «Речь», 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-9268-0828-2}} — С. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the journal had been reestablished, he became its [[deputy editor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |journal=[[The Bekhterev Review of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology]]|year=1992|pages=| publisher = [[American Psychiatric Press]] |title=Masthead|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=trNqj34bYDQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=21 June 2012|isbn=0-88048-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accentuations of character ==
His [[monograph]] entitled "Psychopathy and Accentuations of Character of Teenagers" (1977) has become an indispensable [[textbook]] for many [[generation]]s of Russian [[psychiatrist]]s and [[psychologist]]s. For writing this book, Andrey Lichko was awarded the Honorary Certificate n.a. V.M. Bekhterev by [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]]. In this monograph, Andrey Lichko has enriched the [[theory]] of  psychopathy (what is known today as [[personality disorders]]) by demonstrating that along with psychopathy it is necessary to distinguish the so-called accentuations of [[character structure|character]]. Lichko's typology has parallels with those of 
[[Karl Leonhard]] and [[Pyotr Gannushkin]].

Persons with accentuations of character are placed somewhere between mentally sane persons and psychopaths (those who suffer from different personality disorders). Referring to the famous monograph by the German psychiatrist Karl Leonhard, "Accentuated Persons", Andrey Lichko emphasized that it is more correct to use the term "accentuations of character" instead of the term "accentuated personality" because personality appears to be a wider notion, which includes [[IQ]], [[skill]]s, [[worldview]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Lichko, Andrey. “Psychopathy and Accentuations of Character at Teenagers”. Saint Petersburg: Rech, 2010. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his theory of accentuations of character, Andrey Lichko has contributed to the understanding of [[etiology]] of [[neurosis|neuroses]] by proposing the [[concept]] of the so-called "locus of the least resistance" (locus resistantiae minoris) within the character structure.

{{blockquote|Introducing the notion of the "locus of the least resistance" ("weak unit") within the character, as well as the description of these loci in relation to each type of accentuation of character is a most important contribution to [[characterology]]. It also appears to be an invaluable tool in practice. It is urgent to know the vulnerable areas of every person in order to avoid inappropriate steps, overwork, accidents, and complications.&lt;ref&gt;Gippenreyter, Yulia. “Introduction to General Psychology”. Moscow: Chero, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This conception emerged as the result of elaboration of the idea of the "individual sensibility" to psychic traumas proposed by the eminent Russian [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]], [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Myasishchev]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrov, A. A. “The Contemporary Psychotherapy”. Saint Petersburg: Academic Project, 1997, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; By improving and elaborating the conception of "situativity" and "individual hypersensibility" to outside influence, Andrey Lichko has developed the theory stating that each type of accentuation of character has its own different "[[Achilles' Heel]]". On the assumption of these observations, Andrey Lichko supposed that neurosis is mostly linked with the juxtaposition of a pathogenic situation and the individual peculiarities of character.

{{quote| If however a psychic trauma, even hard, does not address the locus of the least resistance and does not touch this Achilles' heel, i.e. the situation does not require too much in this relation, then everything is usually limited to the adequate reaction of personality.&lt;ref&gt;Lichko, Andrey. “Psychopathy and Accentuations of Character at Teenagers”. Saint Petersburg: Rech, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22152">A '''clinical trials registry''' is an official platform and catalog for registering a [[clinical trial]]. Some countries require clinical trials being conducted in that country to be registered; others do not require it, but often strongly encourage it. [[ClinicalTrials.gov]], run by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) was the first online registry for clinical trials and is the largest and most widely used today.

[[Clinical trial]]s are conducted to allow safety and efficacy data to be collected for health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). The goal of a clinical trials registry is to provide increased transparency and access to clinical trials, made available to the public. Clinical trials registries are often searchable (for example, trials can be searchable by disease/indication, drug, location, etc.). Trials are registered by the pharmaceutical, biotech or medical device company (Sponsor) or by the hospital or foundation which is sponsoring the study, or by another organization, such as a [[contract research organization]] (CRO) which is running the study.

There has been a push from governments and international organizations, especially since 2005, to make clinical trial information more widely available and to standardize registries and processes of registering. The [[World Health Organization]] is working toward "achieving consensus on both the minimal and the optimal operating standards for trial registration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/bpg/en/index.html|title=WHO - Working Group on Best Practice for Clinical Trials Registers (BPG)|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and development==
For many years, scientists and others have worried about reporting biases such that negative or null results from initiated clinical trials may be less likely to be published than positive results, thus skewing the literature and our understanding of how well interventions work.&lt;ref name=Dickersin&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Dickersin| first1=K| last2=Rennie| first2=D| date=2009| title=Registering clinical trials| journal=JAMA| volume=290| issue=4| pages=516–523| pmid=12876095| doi=10.1001/jama.290.4.516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worry has been international and written about for over 50 years.&lt;ref name=Sterling&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Sterling| first1=TD|date=1959| title=Publication decisions and their possible effects on inferences drawn from tests of significances – or vice versa| journal=J Am Stat Assoc| volume=54| issue=285| pages=30–34| doi=10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497| jstor=2282137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the proposals to address this potential bias was a comprehensive register of initiated clinical trials that would inform the public which trials had been started.&lt;ref name=Adhoc&gt;{{cite journal| author=International Collaborative Group on Clinical Trial Registries|date=1993| title=Position paper and consensus recommendations on clinical trial registries. Ad Hoc Working Party of the International Collaborative Group on Clinical Trials Registries,| journal=Clin Trials Metaanal| volume=28| issue=4–5| pages=255–266| pmid=10146333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical issues were those that seemed to interest the public most, as trialists (including those with potential commercial gain) benefited from those who enrolled in trials, but were not required to “give back,” telling the public what they had learned.

Those who were particularly concerned by the double standard were systematic reviewers, those who summarize what is known from clinical trials.  If the literature is skewed, then the results of a systematic review are also likely to be skewed, possibly favoring the test intervention when in fact the accumulated data do not show this, if all data were made public.

[[ClinicalTrials.gov]] was originally developed largely as a result of breast cancer consumer lobbying, which led to authorizing language in the [[FDA Modernization Act of 1997]] (Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997.  Pub L No. 105-115, §113 Stat 2296), but the law provided neither funding nor a mechanism of enforcement.  In addition, the law required that ClinicalTrials.gov only include trials of serious and life-threatening diseases.

Then, two events occurred in 2004 that increased public awareness of the problems of reporting bias.  First, the then-New York State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] sued [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) because they had failed to reveal results from trials showing that certain antidepressants might be harmful.&lt;ref name=Dickersin2&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Dickersin| first1=K| last2=Rennie| first2=D| date=2012| title=The evolution of trial registries and their use to assess the clinical trial enterprise| journal=JAMA| volume=307| issue=17| pages=186101864| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1150078| pmid=22550202| doi=10.1001/jama.2012.4230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]] (ICMJE) announced that their journals would not publish reports of trials unless they had been registered.  The ICMJE action was probably the most important motivator for trial registration, as investigators wanted to reserve the possibility that they could publish their results in prestigious journals, should they want to.

In 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]] (FDAAA) clarified the requirements for registration and also set penalties for non-compliance (Public Law 110-85. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007  [http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FoodandDrugAdministrationAmendmentsActof2007/FullTextofFDAAALaw/default.htm].

==International participation==
The [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals#International Committee of Medical Journal Editors|International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]] (ICMJE) decided that from July 1, 2005 no trials will be considered for publication unless they are included on a clinical trials registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctr.gov.za/|title=SANCTR &gt; Home|first=|last=SANCTR|website=www.sanctr.gov.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706183418/http://www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Health Organization]] has begun the push for clinical trial registration with the initiation of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. There has also been action from the pharmaceutical industry, which released plans to make clinical trial data more transparent and publicly available. Released in October 2008, the revised [[Declaration of Helsinki]], states that "Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzctr.org.au/Default.aspx|title=ANZCTR|website=www.anzctr.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization maintains an international registry portal at [http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/].&lt;ref name= Gülmezoglu &gt;{{cite journal| last1= Gülmezoglu | first1=AM| last2=Pang| first2=T| last3=Horton| first3=R| last4=Dickersin| first4=K| date=2005| title=WHO facilitates international collaboration in setting standards for clinical trial registration| journal=Lancet| volume=365| issue=9474| pages=1829–1831| url=  http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)66589-0/abstract | pmid= 15924966| doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)66589-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO states that the international registry's mission is "to ensure that a complete view of research is accessible to all those involved in health care decision making. This will improve research transparency and will ultimately strengthen the validity and value of the scientific evidence base."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/|title=International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [http://www.isrctn.com/ ISRCTN registry] was launched in 2000. Originally ISRCTN stood for 'International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number'; however, the scope of the registry has now widened beyond randomized controlled trials to include any study designed to assess the efficacy of health interventions in a human population. It registers both observational and interventional trials and content is curated by a team of expert editors.

===United States===
{{main article|clinicaltrials.gov}}
{{update|section|date=September 2016|source=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/hhs-take-steps-provide-more-information-about-clinical-trials-public}}
Clinical trials in the [[United States|US]] are registered on [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ clinicaltrials.gov].

Clinicaltrials.gov is the largest clinical trials registry. Clinical trials conducted in the United States are required to be registered in the registry. As of January 2, 2015, CliicalTrials.gov lists 181,612 studies with locations in 50 US states and in 187 countries. Its registrations represent about 75% of what is available through the WHO Portal (ICTRP). Despite the fact that important progress has been made, the efforts of those overseeing ClinicalTrials.gov and the other, smaller, registries do not ensure that the public has an unbiased knowledge base accessible to all.  For example, problems of the concordance between the ClinicalTrials.gov record and the published record have been identified for many protocol and results items.&lt;ref name=Hartung&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hartung| first1=DM| last2=Zarin| first2=DA| last3=Guise| first3=JM| last4=McDonagh| first4=M| last5=Paynter| first5=R| last6=Helfand| first6=M| date=2014| title=Reporting discrepancies between the ClinicalTrials.gov results database and peer-reviewed publications| journal=Ann Intern Med| volume=160| issue=7| pages=477–483| url= http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=160&amp;issue=7&amp;page=477| pmid=24687070| doi=10.7326/m13-0480| pmc=4617780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registry traces back to the Health Omnibus Programs Extension Act of 1988 (HOPE or [https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2889 Public Law 100-607]) which mandated the development of a database of AIDS Clinical Trials Information System. It would later be expanded under the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA or [http://www.fda.gov/CDER/guidance/105-115.htm Public Act 105-115]). The registry is run by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM).

==Other registries==
Clinical trial registries are also set up and managed by governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, universities, as well as commercial and nonprofit entities. This includes pharmaceutical companies, international organizations, and health organizations. A list is available at [http://www.circare.org/registries.htm http://www.circare.org/registries.htm].

===Pharmaceutical industry initiative===
{{main article|IFPMA Clinical Trials Portal}}
The [[IFPMA Clinical Trials Portal]] is a major pharmaceutical industry initiative designed to increase the transparency of clinical trials by providing a convenient "one-stop-shop" for published clinical trial information. It helps to fulfill the commitment made by the research-based pharmaceutical industry in its [[Joint Position on the Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information via Clinical Trial Registries and Databases]]. It is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20100906104606/http://clinicaltrials.ifpma.org/clinicaltrials/no_cache/en/myportal/index.htm here].

The '''Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' ('''CEDAW''') is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].
Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it was instituted on 3 September 1981 and has been ratified by 189 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|author=|date=|website=un.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty countries that have ratified the Convention have done so subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections, including 38 countries who rejected the enforcement article 29, which addresses means of settlement for disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222104936/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's declaration noted the limitations on central government power resulting from its federal constitutional system. The [[United States]] and [[Palau]] have signed, but not ratified the treaty. The [[Holy See]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] are not signatories to CEDAW.

The CEDAW Chairperson position is currently held by Dalia Leinarte.

==CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820==
[[File:Map5.1Discrepant Behavior compressed.jpg|right|400px|thumb| A world map showing countries by CEDAW enforcement, 2010.]]
'''Resolutions 1325 10th anniversary events highlight use of CEDAW mechanisms&lt;ref name="gnwp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501140626/http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-01 |title=Ensuring Accountability to UNSCR 1325 and 1820 using CEDAW reporting mechanisms |date=November 2010 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders |accessdate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The 10th anniversary of Resolution 1325 in October 2010 highlighted the increasing demand for accountability to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Many expressed concern about the fact that only 22 Member States out of 192 have adopted national action plans. Women are still underrepresented, if not totally absent, in most official peace negotiations and sexual violence in peacetime and in conflict continue to increase.

These realities emphasized the need to use external legal mechanisms to strengthen the implementation of SCR 1325, particularly CEDAW. The well-established mechanisms of CEDAW – the Member States compliance report and the civil society shadow reporting process were cited as possible instruments to ensure accountability.

Several regional and international meetings including the High Level Seminar "1325 in 2020: Looking Forward…Looking Back," organized by the African Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes, and the "Stockholm International Conference 10 years with 1325 – What now?" called for the use of CEDAW to improve 1325 implementation.

'''Intersection between SCR 1325 and CEDAW
'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130833/http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2011 |title=Written Statement submitted to CEDAW on the occasion of the General Discussion on Women in Conflict and Post-conflict Situations |author=GNWP-ICAN |date=18 July 2011 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders (GNWP) – International Civil society Action Network (ICAN) |accessdate=25 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While CEDAW and UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on Women, Peace and Security are important international instruments on their own, there is also an intersection among the three standards that can be used to enhance their implementation and impact.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820 broaden the scope of CEDAW application by clarifying its relevance to all parties in conflict, whereas CEDAW provides concrete strategic guidance for actions to be taken on the broad commitments outlined in the two Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UNIFEM |title=CEDAW and Security Council Resolution 1325: A Quick Guide |url=http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |journal=Women, Peace &amp; Security |location= |publisher= |date=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120303/http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDAW is a global human rights treaty that should be incorporated into national law as the highest standard for women's rights. It requires the UN Member States that have ratified it (185 to date) to set in place mechanisms to fully realize [[women's rights]].

Resolution 1325 is an international law unanimously adopted by the Security Council that mandates the UN Member States to engage women in all aspects of peacebuilding including ensuring women's participation on all levels of decision–making on peace and security issues.

Resolution 1820 links sexual violence as a tactic of war with the maintenance of international peace and security. It also demands a comprehensive report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation and strategies for improving information flow to the Security Council; and the adoption of concrete protection and prevention measures to end sexual violence.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820, and CEDAW share the following agenda on women's human rights and [[gender equality]]:&lt;ref name="gnwp" /&gt;

# Demand women’s participation in [[decision-making]] at all levels
# Rejection of violence against women as it impedes the advancement of women and maintains their subordinate status
# Equality of women and men under the law; protection of women and girls through the [[rule of law]]
# Demand security forces and systems to protect women and girls from [[gender-based violence]]
# Recognition of the fact that distinct experiences and burdens of women and girls come from systemic discrimination
# Ensure that women’s experiences, needs and perspectives are incorporated into the political, legal and social decisions that determine the achievement of just and lasting peace

A General Comment from the CEDAW committee could strengthen women’s advocacy for the full implementation of Resolutions 1325 and 1820 at the country and community levels. Conversely, CEDAW’s relevance to conflict-affected areas will be underscored further by the two Resolutions.  In other words, all three international instruments will reinforce each other and be much more effective if used together in leveraging women’s human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820 « Global Network of Women Peacebuilders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414214651/http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and ratification==
{{Main|List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
The six UN member states that have not ratified or acceded to the convention are [[Iran]], [[Palau]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title='Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women' |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823144158/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Non-member states|UN non-member state]] that had not acceded to the convention is the [[Holy See]]/[[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Note:'' See New Zealand No 47 Declarations and Reservations New Zealand has signed this treaty on behalf of Niue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) in 2007 has also ratified the treaty in its legislature, but is unrecognized by the United Nations and is a party to the treaty only unofficially.&lt;ref&gt;Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan). "Taiwan Aims to Sign Up Against Discrimination." 8 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest state to have acceded the convention was [[South Sudan]] on 30 April 2015.&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women" /&gt;

Within the United States, over 40 cities and local governments have adopted CEDAW ordinances or resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citiesforcedaw.org/background/|title=Background, Cities for CEDAW|work=Cities for CEDAW|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Reservations ==
Many [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] have been entered against certain articles of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Reservations to CEDAW: An Analysis for UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |website=www.unicef.org |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004104944/http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some reservations that are not specific to an article within the Convention but rather a general reservation to all aspects of the Convention that would violate a stated principle. For example, [[Mauritania]] made a reservation stating it approved the Convention "in each and every one of its parts which are not contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A number these reservations, especially those entered by Islamic states parties, are subject to much debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of the Convention states that "a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] incompatible with the object and purpose of the present Convention shall not be permitted."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, many states parties have entered objections to the reservations of other states parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, many Nordic states parties were concerned that some of the reservations were "undermining the integrity of the text."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=The Vienna Convention Reservations Regime and the Convention on the Discrimination Against Women |last=Clark |first=Belinda |date=1991 |journal=The American Journal of International Law |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some states parties have withdrawn their reservations.

As of May 2015, sixty-two states parties have entered reservations against some part of the Convention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Declarations and Reservations |date=2015 |accessdate= |website=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four states parties have entered objections to at least one of these reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most reserved article is Article 29, concerning dispute resolution and interpretation of the Convention, with thirty-nine reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because reservations to Article 29 are expressly allowed by the Convention itself, these reservations were not very controversial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Article 16, concerning the equality of women in marriage and family life is subject to twenty-three reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Committee, in General Recommendation No. 28, specifically stated that reservations to Article 2, concerning general non-discrimination, are impermissible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Article 2 has seventeen reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women==
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is the United Nations (U.N.) treaty body that oversees the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The formation of this committee was outlined in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article17 Article 17] of the CEDAW, which also established the rules, purpose, and operating procedures of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |last=U.N.

Over time the practices of the committee have evolved due to an increased focus on [[women's rights]] issues.

===History of the committee===
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was formed on 3 September 1981 after the CEDAW received the 20 [[ratification]]s required for it to enter into force. Article 17 of the CEDAW established the committee in order to ensure that the provisions of the CEDAW were followed by the countries that had signed and agreed to be bound by it.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The first regular session of the committee was held from 18–22 October 1982. In this session the first officers of the committee were elected by simple majority, with Ms. L. Ider of [[Mongolia]] becoming chairperson.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW"&gt;{{cite book |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=The Work of CEDAW: Reports of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against  Women |year=1989 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=9211301327 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other officers elected were three vice-chairpersons: M.&amp;nbsp;Caron of Canada, Z.&amp;nbsp;Ilic of [[Yugoslavia]] and L.&amp;nbsp;Mukayiranga of [[Rwanda]]. The final officer elected was D.&amp;nbsp;P. Bernard of [[Guyana]] as [[rapporteur]] of the committee. During this session, the committee also unanimously approved to adopt its [[rules of procedure]].&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

Under [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article18 article 18] of the CEDAW states must report to the committee on the progress they have made in implementing the CEDAW within their state.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; As most of the information the committee works with comes from these reports, guidelines have been developed to help states prepare accurate and useful reports.&lt;ref name=Methods&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=Overview of the current working methods of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022084310/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports discussing the current picture of discrimination against women in the reporting states are required to specifically deal with each article of the CEDAW, and consist of no more than one-hundred pages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States are required to prepare and present these initial reports within one year of ratifying the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Periodic reports detailing the state's progress in adhering to the articles of the CEDAW should be no more than seventy-five pages in length and should focus on the specific period of time since the state's last report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States party to the CEDAW are typically required to provide periodic reports every four years, but if the committee is concerned about the situation in that state they can request a report at any time.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The committee chooses which reports addressing by considering factors such as the amount of time the report has been pending, whether the report is initial or periodic (with more priority given to initial reports), and from which region the report originates.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Eight states are invited to give their reports during each session and it is required a representative from the state is in attendance when the report is presented.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The committee focuses on constructive dialogue when a report is presented and appreciates careful time management on the part of the state presenting its report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Due to the high backlog of overdue reports the committee has encouraged states to combine all of their outstanding reports into one document and sends reminders to states who have reports that are five years overdue.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The CEDAW also requires that the committee provide an annual report that includes its activities, comments relating to the reports provided by states, information relating to the Optional Protocol of the CEDAW, and any other general suggestions or recommendations the committee has made.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; This report is given to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] through the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All reports, agendas and other official documents pertaining to the committee, including the reports provided by the states, are provided to the public unless otherwise decided by the committee.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

===General Recommendations===

Along with issuing its annual report and offering advice to reporting states, the committee has the ability to issue general recommendations that elaborate on its views of the obligations imposed by CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; To date, the committee has issued thirty-two general recommendations, the latest dealing with the gender related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |title=General recommendation No. 32 on the gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women |url=https://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |website=undocs.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017 |date=14 November 2014 |id=CEDAW/C/GC/32 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014914/http://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations issued by the committee in its first decade were short and dealt mainly with the content of states’ reports and reservations to the convention.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; Since 1991, however, recommendations have been focused on guiding states’ application of the CEDAW in specific situations.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The formulation of a general recommendation begins with dialogue between the committee on the topic in the recommendation with various non-governmental organizations and other U.N. bodies.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The recommendation is then drafted by a member of the committee and discussed and revised in the next session, and finally adopted in the following session.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt;

Currently the Committee is working on the '''General Recommendation''' Trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.

===Changes in the committee===

For the first ten years the committee operated significantly differently from now. The only form of [[censure]] given to the committee by the CEDAW was their general recommendations and concluding comments following a report.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Niamh |title=Women's human rights : seeking gender justice in a globalizing age |year=2009 |publisher=[[Polity Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780745637006 |pages=62 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the emergence of the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights in 1991 more attention was given to the CEDAW, reviving the committee.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee made changes to the CEDAW that allowed it to meet more than once a year, and have taken advantage of this by meeting at least twice a year since 1997.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee originally only met for two weeks in its annual sessions, but that has now been changed to meeting multiple times a year in eighteen-day sessions.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt; CEDAW also gained new complaint and inquiry proceedings allowing the committee to initiate inquiry proceedings if it believes a state is in severe violation of the articles of the CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt;

===Recommendations for improvement===
Despite evolving since the committee was first formed, members believe there are ways in which the committee can better meet the goals outlined in the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; One of the committee's main goals moving forward is expanding its information base, allowing it to more effectively deal with issues that arise concerning the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The committee is authorized in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article22 Article 22] of the CEDAW to invite specialized U.N. agencies such as the [[United Nations Development Programme]] to deliver reports discussing women's rights issues in the state under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Another method for gathering information is requesting reports from non-governmental organizations dealing with discrimination against women that are operating in the country under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; This is recommended to insure that the committee is receiving the full, unbiased picture of affairs within the reporting state.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Another recommendation for improvement involves interpreting and clarifying the language used in the CEDAW in order to make the document as useful as it can be.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A third improvement that has been suggested is improving the efficiency of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Due to the backlog in reports faced by the committee it has been suggested that the government officials who prepare reports presented to the committee should be trained, in order to make all reports uniform and more easily processed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A final suggestion for improvement is the implementation of a right of petition in the CEDAW, allowing the committee to hear complaints from citizens of a state against the state, increasing the committee's strength and direct impact on the problem of discrimination against women.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

===Languages===
The official languages of the committee are [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with any statement made in one of the official languages translated into the other four.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; A speaker who does not speak one of the official languages provides a translator.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All formal decisions and documents issued by the committee are provided in each of the official languages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The original rules of procedure adopted by the committee did not include Arabic as an official language, but the rule was amended in the committees second session to include Arabic.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Members and Officers of the Committee===
Twenty-three members serve on the committee, described as experts for their experience and expertise in women's issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Merry |first=Sally Engle |title=Human rights and gender violence : translating international law into local justice |year=2006 |publisher=[[Univ. of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago [u.a.] |isbn=0226520730 |pages=82 |edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members are nominated by their national governments and elected through a secret ballot by states party to the convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Upon winning the election and taking up their responsibilities the members of the committee recite the following statement, known as the solemn declaration, "I solemnly declare that I shall perform my duties and exercise powers as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously".&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The members come from a wide range of occupations including doctors, lawyers, diplomats and educators, providing various viewpoints to the committee due to their diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Many members continue to hold full-time jobs outside the committee and receive little monetary payment for their work on the committee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

To insure that the nationality of members encompasses all the diverse states who have signed the CEDAW, members are elected according to regions divided into [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The members of the committee differ from those of other treaty bodies of the United Nations in that they have all been women with only one exception.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; In the event a member of the committee is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term is up the state that had nominated the resigning member shall nominate another expert from their country to fill in her seat.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Committee members and experts also attend an annual luncheon, hosted by the [[NGO Committee on the Status of Women, New York|NGO Committee on the Status of Women, NY]] (NGO CSW/NY), where key issues are discusses and the efforts of the committee are honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |title=NGO CSW, NY / About / How We Work |publisher=Ngocsw.org |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010921/http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the chairperson fails to designate a vice-chairperson prior to her absence then the vice-chairperson with the first name in English alphabetical order takes over.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; In the event an officer is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term expires a new officer from the same region as the original officer shall be nominated, elected and will take over the vacated office.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509170959/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html |date=9 May 2008 }}, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 and entered into force on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |title=Optional Protocol to Women's Convention Comes into Force |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907212930/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has 80 signatories and 109 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520040105/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy around CEDAW comes from two opposite directions: social and religious [[conservative]]s which claim that CEDAW is seeking to impose a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[Feminism|feminist]] standard on countries, in detriment of [[traditional values]]; and [[radical feminists]], who are skeptical of the power, or even desire, of CEDAW to radically transform societies and truly liberate women, and claim that CEDAW adheres to a form of weak [[liberal feminism]] similar to other mainstream organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/10/2/512/666068/Gender-and-democratic-citizenship-the-impact-of&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511154106/http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015119/http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Charles Hahn''' (October 30, 1976 – September 27, 2016&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Charles Hahn|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/David-Charles-Hahn-103989982|website=Tributes.com|publisher=Tributes, Inc.|date=26 September 2016|access-date=4 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), sometimes called the '''''Radioactive Boy Scout''''' or the '''''Nuclear Boy Scout''''', was an American who in 1994, at age 17, attempted to build a homemade [[breeder reactor]]. A [[Scout (Scout Movement)|scout]] in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Hahn conducted his experiments in secret in a backyard shed at his mother's house in [[Commerce Township, Michigan]]. While his reactor never reached [[criticality (status)|criticality]], Hahn attracted the attention of local police when he was stopped on another matter and they found material in his vehicle that troubled them, and he warned that it was radioactive. His mother's property was cleaned up by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) ten months later as a [[Superfund]] cleanup site. Hahn attained [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] rank shortly after his lab was dismantled.&lt;ref name=silversteinbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverstein|first1=Ken|title=The Radioactive Boy Scout: The Frightening True Story of a Whiz Kid and His Homemade Nuclear Reactor|date=2004|publisher=Villard|isbn=978-0812966602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the incident was not widely publicized initially, it became better known following a 1998 ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' article by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]]. Hahn was also the subject of Silverstein's 2004 book, ''The Radioactive Boy Scout''.&lt;ref name="silversteinbook" /&gt;  It is likely Hahn received substantial doses of radiation. As an adult, Hahn served in the [[US Navy]] and the [[US Marine Corps]].  He was subsequently treated for mental illness, and his death at age thirty-nine was related to alcohol use.

==Creation of the reactor==

Hahn was a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] fascinated by chemistry, and spent years conducting amateur [[chemistry]] experiments, which sometimes caused small explosions and other mishaps. He was inspired in part by reading ''[[The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments]]'', and tried to collect samples of every element in the [[periodic table]], including the radioactive ones. He later received a [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badge]] in Atomic Energy and became fascinated with the idea of creating a [[breeder reactor]] in his home. Hahn diligently amassed [[radioactive]] material by collecting small amounts from household products, such as [[americium]] from [[smoke detector]]s, [[thorium]] from camping lantern [[gas mantle|mantles]], [[radium]] from clocks, and [[tritium]] (a [[neutron moderator]]) from gunsights. His "reactor" was a bored-out block of [[lead]], and he used [[lithium]] from $1,000 worth of purchased batteries to purify the thorium ash using a [[Bunsen burner]].&lt;ref name=silversteinharpers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverstein|first1=Ken|title=The Radioactive Boy Scout|url=http://harpers.org/archive/1998/11/the-radioactive-boy-scout/?single=1|accessdate=September 10, 2014|work=Harper's Magazine|date= November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0316/p16s03-bogn.html |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Tim |last=Rauschenberger |date=2004-03-16 |accessdate=2016-02-03 |title=The Nuclear Merit Badge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahn posed as an adult scientist or high school teacher to gain the trust of many professionals in letters—and succeeded, despite misspellings and obvious errors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Hahn ultimately hoped to create a breeder reactor, using low-level [[isotope]]s to transform samples of thorium and [[uranium]] into [[Nuclear fission|fissionable]] isotopes.&lt;ref name="spoon"&gt;{{cite book |first= Sam |last= Kean |title= The Disappearing Spoon |publisher= Little, Brown and Co |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His homemade reactor never came anywhere near reaching critical mass—but it ended up emitting dangerous levels of radiation, likely well over 1,000 times normal [[background radiation]]. Alarmed, Hahn began to dismantle his experiments—but in a chance encounter, police discovered his activities, which triggered a Federal Radiological Emergency Response involving the [[FBI]] and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. On June 26, 1995 the EPA, having designated Hahn's mother's property a [[Superfund]] hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and its contents and buried them as low-level [[radioactive waste]] in [[Utah]]. Unknown to officials, his mother, fearful that she would lose her house if the full extent of the radiation were known, had already collected the majority of the radioactive material and thrown it away in the conventional garbage. Hahn refused medical evaluation for [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]]. EPA scientists believe that Hahn's life expectancy may have been greatly shortened by his exposure to radioactivity, particularly since he spent long periods of time in the small, enclosed shed with large amounts of radioactive material and only minimal safety precautions, but he refused their 1995 recommendation that he be examined at the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]].&lt;ref name=silversteinharpers/&gt;

==Career==

Hahn became depressed after the scandal, a problem exacerbated by the breakup with his girlfriend and the suicide of his mother in early 1996.&lt;ref name="silversteinbook"/&gt;{{rp|189}} While he did graduate from high school, he lacked any direction or plans thereafter. His father and stepmother first encouraged him to attend [[Macomb Community College]]. He enrolled in a metallurgy program there but frequently skipped classes.&lt;ref name="silversteinbook"/&gt;{{rp|190}} He was then encouraged to join the military, so he enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], assigned to the nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} as an undesignated [[seaman]].&lt;ref name=silversteinharpers/&gt; After a four-year tour, he achieved interior communications specialist with a rank of petty officer, third class.&lt;ref name="silversteinbook"/&gt;{{rp|196}}

Hahn had hoped to pursue a nuclear specialist career.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

After his time on USS ''Enterprise,'' Hahn enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and was stationed in Japan. After a few years, he was [[honorably discharged]] on medical grounds and returned to Michigan.

==FBI Investigation==

On April 23, 2007, The FBI received a lead regarding Hahn's alleged possession of a second breeder reactor in his freezer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view |title=David Hahn Part 01 of 01 |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2018-10-15 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After contacting Hahn via telephone, Hahn insisted he was not in possession of radioactive material. The FBI decided there was no imminent terrorist threat but agreed to attempt a personal interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view |title=David Hahn Part 01 of 01 |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2018-10-15 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2007, Hahn was interviewed at an FBI office, where discussed were flyers that Hahn had distributed promoting his book and upcoming film, theft of tires and rims from a vehicle prior to his Navy service, diagnosis of [[Paranoid Schizophrenia]], and a few less significant topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view |title=David Hahn Part 01 of 01 |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2018-10-15 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI agents then interviewed an individual (Identity not released) who stated that Hahn was using [[cocaine]] heavily, was not taking his prescribed medication, and that Hahn was paranoid of people that he claimed "had the ability to 'shock' his genitals with their minds", and possible visits of prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view |title=David Hahn Part 01 of 01 |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2018-10-15 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual also stated that he believes that Hahn was still trying to build a reactor, and was collecting [[radium]]. He stated that he did not believe Hahn had any intentions of hurting anyone, but was concerned for his mental state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view |title=David Hahn Part 01 of 01 |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2018-10-15 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This investigation is likely what led to Hahn's arrest regarding larceny of smoke alarms.

==Larceny of smoke detectors==
On August 1, 2007, Hahn was charged with [[larceny]] in [[Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan|Clinton Township, Michigan]] for allegedly removing a number of [[smoke detector]]s from the halls of his apartment building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam |last=Taylor |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-nuclear-reactor-angelholm-2011-8?IR=T |title=The Weird Story Of The Swedish Man Who Tried To Build A Nuclear Reactor In His Kitchen |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070827/BUSINESS05/70827091 |title=Man dubbed 'Radioactive Boy Scout' pleads guilty |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2016-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095926/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070827%2FBUSINESS05%2F70827091 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was to obtain [[americium]] from them.

==Death==
Hahn died on Tuesday, September 27, 2016, at the age of 39 accidentally due to intoxication from the combined effects of alcohol, [[diphenhydramine]], and [[fentanyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3517279-1-Page-Fax-From-15616828151.html|title=County Coroner Findings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was a resident of [[Shelby Charter Township, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legacy.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/david-hahn-obituary?pid=1000000181698524 |title=David Hahn Obituary - Shelby Township, Michigan |website=www.legacy.com|date=2016-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture ==
The incident received scant media attention at the time, but was widely disseminated after writer [[Ken Silverstein]] published an article about the incident in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=silversteinharpers/&gt; In 2004 he expanded it into a book, ''The Radioactive Boy Scout'', which was optioned for a feature film in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/radioactive-boy-scout-movie-about-real-teen-nuke-builder-in-the-works-exclusive/ |title='Radioactive Boy Scout' Movie About Real Teen Nuke Builder in the Works |publisher=The Wrap |date=2016-09-28 |first=Matt |last=Pressburg |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[University of Chicago]] physics majors Justin Kasper and Fred Niell, as part of a [[University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt|scavenger hunt]] that had as one of its items, "a breeder reactor built in a shed," successfully built a similar nuclear reactor that produced trace amounts of [[plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicago.edu/features/20110501_scav |title=Ready, set...

In the ''[[CSI: NY]]'' episode [[CSI: NY (season 5)|"Page Turner"]], the character Lawrence Wagner is based on David Hahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gail|first=Nancy|title=TV Review: CSI: NY, 'Page Turner'|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/tv-review-csi-ny-page-turner/|publisher=Blog Critics|accessdate=January 29, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020232028/http://blogcritics.org/video/article/tv-review-csi-ny-page-turner/|archivedate=October 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television documentary, ''The Nuclear Boyscout'', aired on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom in 2003. In it, Hahn reenacted some of his methods for the camera.

Hahn's experiments inspired others to attempt similar feats, particularly [[Taylor Wilson]], who at age 14 became the youngest person to produce [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/boy-who-played-fusion|title=The Boy Who Played With Fusion|website=Popular Science|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Nursing]] is the largest healthcare profession, with more than 3.1 million registered nurses.&lt;ref&gt;“Nursing Fact Sheet,” 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2012 and 2022, employment for nurses is projected to grow by 19 percent, which is more than any other profession.&lt;ref&gt;“Registered Nurses”, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses make up the largest component of staff in hospitals but are also able to provide care in clinic settings, patient’s homes, schools, nursing homes, public health agencies, and mental health centers. In addition, nurses can be found in the military, in industry, nursing education, and do health care research.&lt;ref&gt;“Nursing Fact Sheet,” 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses in these various roles and settings can provide direct patient care and case management, but also develop and establish nursing practice and quality standards within complex healthcare systems. As each degree can provide a different level of care for patients and function in vastly different roles, it is important to differentiate between them. The levels of nursing degrees have different educational requirements, licensure, and credentialing that can vary state to state.

==Licensed Practical Nurse==
The education required for a [[Licensed Practical Nurse]]/[[Licensed Vocational Nurse]] is the completion of a 12-18 month program, typically at a technical college. The program focuses on task activities and prepares the nurse for the National Council Licensure Examination for Licensed Practical Nurses ([[NCLEX]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ebel, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements for taking the NCLEX-PN include having a high school diploma or equivalent and successful completion of an accredited practical/vocational nursing program. LPN/LVNs work in a variety of settings including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, schools, and individual or group homes.&lt;ref&gt;Ebel, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Scope of practice for LPN/LVNs is defined by individual states, but each organization may narrow the scope of the LPN/LVN.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospital-Based Diploma Nurse==
Hospital-based diplomas were historically the primary form of nursing education, first appearing in the early 20th century.  The number of facilities offering this degree as well as the number of nurses obtaining their education through them have declined since the 1970s due to the growth of [[Associate Degree in Nursing]] and [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] programs at colleges and universities, as well as increasing financial constraints on hospitals and the healthcare systems.  Diploma programs were the most abundant in the 1950s and 1960s, with nearly 1,300 diploma programs active nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;NursingExplorer, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently, less than 10 percent of nursing degree programs are diploma programs,&lt;ref&gt;AACN, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; which produce less than 6 percent of registered nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Allnurses, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the remaining diploma programs in the United States are concentrated in the Midwest and on the East Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Allnurses, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Programs for hospital diplomas are traditionally sponsored and run by hospitals in the community, as their name implies.  Courses are taught proximal to and in conjunction with the hospital, where students have practical application of their skills on the units and wards in the sponsoring facility.  Diploma programs typically have a strong focus on practical application of skills, with a larger percentage of time spent on the “hands-on” component of learning.  Students attend classes for two to three years, at the completion of which they take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) certifying exam, a standard exam for all practicing registered nurses.  Students graduate with a diploma in nursing, and passing of the NCLEX-RN allows for certification and state licensure, which permits the graduate to practice as a full registered nurse within his or her state’s statutes.  Coursework taken in a diploma nursing program can frequently be used for credits toward nursing degrees such as a BSN or ADN.&lt;ref&gt;Allnurses, 2009; NursingExplorer, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associate Degree in Nursing==
An [[Associate Degree in Nursing]] (ADN) is the minimum educational requirement to become a registered nurse in the United States. All ADN prepared nurses are credentialed through individual state nursing boards after passing the NCLEX-RN. In order to be eligible to take the NCLEX-RN exam, candidates must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and a degree from a board of nursing approved nursing program. ADN nursing programs typically take two years to complete but courses required differ by state.&lt;ref&gt;“NCLEX &amp; Other Exams”, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard course requirement includes anatomy, physiology, microbiology, chemistry, nutrition, psychology.&lt;ref&gt;“Registered Nurses”, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Background checks are also performed on all candidates prior to granting licensure. Associate degree nurses are able to work in both outpatient and inpatient settings.&lt;ref&gt;“NCLEX &amp; Other Exams”, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the almost 3.1 million registered nurses in the United States, 36.1 percent of them have an associate degrees in nursing.&lt;ref&gt;“NP fact sheet,” 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing==
[[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN) degrees prepare nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study within nursing. It is typically acquired through a four-year program at a college or university. Baccalaureate programs include a variety of liberal arts courses and professional education and training in the nursing field. It contains additional education beyond that of an ADN that often includes physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;“Registered Nurses”, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; There are 674 BSN programs in the United States. BSN programs are approved by each state’s individual board of nursing that allows students to sit for the NCLEX-RN examination to obtain a license as a registered nurse &lt;ref&gt;Amos, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have accelerated programs called “RN-to-BSN” or “BSN completion” for registered nurses with associate degrees wanting to obtain their bachelor's degree in nursing. In 2010, the [[Institute of Medicine]] called for 80 percent of nurses in the U.S. to be baccalaureate trained by the year 2020, and this has created a push for healthcare organizations to make a BSN a hiring requirement for registered nurses and instituting education assistance programs for those with associate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;“The Future of Nursing”, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master of Science Degree in Nursing==
The [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN) is an advanced degree that allows for a more specialized role in nursing. The master’s prepared nurse has a wide array of careers that he or she might aspire to fill. Career paths include certified nurse practitioner (CNP), certified [[nurse anesthetist]] (CRNA), [[clinical nurse specialist]] (CNS) or [[certified nurse midwife]] (CNM). Some other areas the MSN prepared nurse might focus are in public health, business administration or health administration. Education curriculum may vary between 18 and 24 months of full-time graduate level studies, with program length determined by the specified field.&lt;ref&gt;Dracup, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The certification exams for a master’s prepared nurse are dependent upon the role being pursued. For example, the CNM takes the American Midwifery Certification Board exam and nurse administrators may receive their certification from the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] (ANCC). Master’s prepared nurses are trained in advanced assessment, counseling of patients, management, leadership, research and education.&lt;ref&gt;Dracup, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They may work in both inpatient and outpatient settings as well as educational institutions, and scope of practice may vary state-by-state.

==Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree==
The scope of practice for a [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP) includes assessing, diagnosing, prescribing, consulting, screening, educating, initiating referrals and the coordination of patient care. There are numerous specialties DNPs may pursue including [[Acute Care Nurse Practitioner]], [[Adult Nurse Practitioner]], [[Adult-gerontology nurse practitioner]] (acute or primary care), Adult Psychiatric- [[Mental Health Nurse Practitioner]], [[Family Nurse Practitioner]], Gerontological Nurse Practitioner, [[Pediatric Nurse Practitioner]] (acute or primary care), and School Nurse Practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;‘ANCC certification center’, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Specific practice guidelines can vary by state and area of practice. In order to become a DNP, one would need to obtain his or her doctorate in nursing practice. Specific program requirements vary with each program. After completing the doctorate program, one must pass the specific certification exam that corresponds to his or her specialty prior to initiating practice.  In 2014 there were 3,065 DNP graduates.&lt;ref&gt;“DNP Fact Sheet,” 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing==
Nurses who hold a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] Degree in Nursing (PhD), are less about hands-on patient care and more about the abstract thinking that helps move the profession forward. A nurse with a PhD has the training needed to conduct research aimed at changing nursing science or practice. The education for a PhD in nursing includes courses in scientific research methodologies and statistics and philosophy of science. Either a BSN or MSN degree are required for entry into a PhD program.&lt;ref&gt;“PhD and DNP comparison”, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Credit requirements vary by program and state and typically take anywhere from three to five years to complete. PhD programs do not have clinical practice hour requirements like DNP programs. PhD prepared nurses teach as academic faculty, conduct research, evaluate programs, hold academic and leadership positions, write books, and lead health care organizations.&lt;ref&gt;“PhD in Nursing”, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dewvaporation''' is a novel [[desalination]] technology developed at [[Arizona State University]] (Tempe) as an [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] tool for freshwater procurement and saline waste stream management. The system has relative low installment costs and low operation and maintenance requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/water/newsletter/Water/2000spr.html Research results] from 2000 by the [[US Bureau of Reclamation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process uses air as a [[Coolant|carrier gas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TFX-44RRB1R-S&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=11/20/2001&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=bf28367fdcbfabccd1c1cef386aa2b66&amp;searchtype=a Brackish and seawater desalination using a 20 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dewvaporation tower] 200] article published by Arizona State University] on the [[Science Direct]] webesite&lt;/ref&gt; that transfers water [[vapor]] from ascending evaporative channels to adjacent, descending [[dew]]-forming channels. Heat flowing through the barrier allows the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|evaporative energy requirement]] to be fully satisfied by the  heat released by condensation on the dew forming side. A small pressure difference&lt;ref&gt;Less than 1 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]] according to the patent application from 2008&lt;/ref&gt; is held so that the condensing cooler air is kept on the cool side.

Near [[Atmospheric pressure|atmospheric]] operation permits [[corrosion]] free and [[fouling|scale]]-resistant [[polypropylene]] construction, and also allows the use of low-grade heat to drive the process. 

The process is proprietary, developed by Dr. James R. Beckman.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Beckman [[USPTO]] [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=7,431,805.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,431,805&amp;RS=PN/7,431,805 Patent application number: 7,431,805] James R. Beckman 2008 ''Method and apparatus for simultaneous heat and mass transfer utilizing a carrier-gas at various absolute pressures''. As listed in the patent, the invention was a follow up on an earlier filing from 2003, and earlier work from 1989 published in conjunction with Walter F. Albers. The development was partially funded by the US government.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Altela Inc. (Albuquerque, NM) is manufacturing this technology under the AltelaRain trade name.

== Detailed process ==
According to the [[Bureau of Reclamation]], a branch of the [[US Department of Interior]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov USBR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215021833/http://www.usbr.gov/ |date=2009-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this process uses simple corrugated plastic tanks with many "DewVaporation columns" inserted in each tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/water/publications/reportpdfs/report120.pdf Figure 5. Top View of Tower]&lt;/ref&gt; Each column is made of corrugated plastic and is divided into two compartments. The wall in the middle serves for receiving and evaporating sea-water into a hot air stream, and on the other side for condensing freshwater. The cooling from the evaporation helps water [[Condensation|condense]] on the dividing wall, while the energy from the condensing vapor, now turned to droplets, passes back to the [[evaporation]] side, and is absorbed in the evaporating sea water. This way, much of the energy (as heat) is left in the process, and is not removed with the air leaving the DewVaporation column.

Various improvements have been proposed, among those reusing the output brine and adding external heat in a stacked way, so that the pressure and humidity gap between the two sides of the column are optimal and constant.

{{Culture of Djibouti}}
'''Djiboutian cuisine''' is a mixture of [[Somali cuisine|Somali]], [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Yemeni cuisine|Yemeni]], and [[French cuisine]], with some additional [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] (especially [[Indian cuisine|Indian]]) culinary influences. Local dishes are commonly prepared using a variety of Middle Eastern spices, ranging from [[saffron]] to [[cinnamon]]. Grilled Yemeni fish, opened in half and often cooked in tandoori-style ovens, are a local delicacy. Spicy dishes come in many variations, from the traditional ''fah-fah'' or ''soupe djiboutienne'' (spicy boiled beef soup), to the ''yetakelt wet'' (spicy mixed vegetable stew). ''Xalwo'' (pronounced "halwo") or [[halva]] is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions. Halva is made from sugar, [[corn starch]], [[cardamom]] powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. Peanuts are sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[incense]] (''cuunsi'') or [[frankincense]] (''lubaan''), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

The '''Doctors Reform Society of Australia''' (DRS), set up in 1973, is a medico-political [[thinktank]] and a medical association of [[medical practitioner]]s and [[medical student]]s that has advocated a range of alternative views to those of the [[Australian Medical Association]]. 

Their initial focus was on [[universal health care]] or [[health insurance]] leading up to the establishment of the then "Medibank", now [[Medicare Australia]]. The DRS publishes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080626191528/http://www.drs.org.au/newdoc.htm New Doctor] journal.

'''Eau de Paris''' (Paris Water) is the publicly owned company responsible for the public [[water supply]] and [[wastewater|waste water]] collection for the city of [[Paris]].

==History==

The company was created in 2008 after a ballot initiative from then Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]]. The city's water was then substantially managed by two private companies ([[Veolia]] and [[Suez (company)|Suez]]) which the municipal government bought out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Brien |first1=Hettie |title=Our privatised water system has failed - it’s time to look for alternatives|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/privatised-water-system-failed-time-look-alternatives/ |website=Open Democracy |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

The company distributes 563,000 m³ of drinking water a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homepage |url=http://www.eaudeparis.fr/ |website=Eau de Paris |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the company began installing drinking fountains dispensing [[carbonated water|fizzy water]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fenwick Elliott |first1=Annabel |title=Paris is installing free fizzy water fountains across the city |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/articles/paris-introduces-free-sparkling-water-drinking-taps/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An epidemic of '''[[Ebola virus disease]] in [[Guinea]]''' represents the first ever outbreak of Ebola in a [[West Africa|West African country]]. Previous outbreaks have been confined to several countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web | title = Ebola virus disease Fact sheet No. 103|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/|work=World Health Organization | date = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The epidemic, which began with the death of a two-year-old boy in 2013, is now part of a larger [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] which has spread through Guinea and the neighboring countries of [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], with minor outbreaks occurring in [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Mali]]. In 2015, Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission by the U.N. World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52913#.VoPY3PkrIgs |title=UN declares end to Ebola virus transmission in Guinea; first time all three host countries free |author=no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=UN News Center |publisher=United Nations |access-date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|West African Ebola virus epidemic}}
{{Ebola virus disease epidemic}}
Researchers from the [[Robert Koch Institute]] believe that the [[index case]] was a two-year-old boy who lived in the remote village of [[Meliandou]], [[Guéckédou Prefecture|Guéckédou]] located in the [[Nzérékoré Region]] of [[Guinea]]. Researchers believe that the boy was said to have contracted the virus while he was playing near a tree that was a roosting place for [[Myopterus|free-tail bats]] infected with the virus. Dr. Fabian Leendertz, an epidemiologist who was part of the investigative team, said Ebola virus is transmitted to humans either through contact with larger wildlife or by direct contact with bats. The boy, later identified as Emile Ouamouno, fell ill on 2 December 2013 and died four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/28/health/ebola-patient-zero/index.html|title=Ebola: Patient zero was a toddler in Guinea - CNN.com|date=28 October 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-patient-zero-emile-ouamouno-guinea-first-contract-disease-1714698|title=Ebola Patient Zero: Emile Ouamouno Of Guinea First To Contract Disease|date=28 October 2014|work=International Business Times|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy's sister fell ill next, followed by his mother and grandmother.&lt;ref name="Baize-2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1404505|title=Emergence of Zaire Ebola Virus Disease in Guinea&amp;nbsp;— Preliminary Report|date=16 April 2014 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1404505 |last=Baize |first=Sylvain |last2=Pannetier |first2=Delphine |last3=Oestereich|first3=Lisa|last4=Rieger|first4=Toni|journal=New England Journal of Medicine |pmid=24738640 |volume=371 |issue=15 |pages=1418–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian migrating fruit bats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/23/ebola-outbreak-blamed-on-fruit-bats-africa|title=Ebola: research team says migrating fruit bats responsible for outbreak|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed the Ebola virus later spread to the villages of Dandou Pombo and Dawa, both in Guéckédou, by the midwife who attended the boy. From Dawa village the virus spread to Guéckédou Baladou District and Guéckédou Farako District, and on to [[Macenta]] and [[Kissidougou]].&lt;ref name="Baize-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian migrating fruit bats" /&gt;

Although Ebola represents a major public health issue in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], no cases had ever been reported in West Africa and the early cases were diagnosed as other diseases more common to the area such as  [[Lassa fever]], another [[hemorrhagic fever]] similar to Ebola. Thus, it was not until March 2014 that the outbreak was recognized as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]]. The Ministry of Health of Guinea notified the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and on 23 March the WHO announced an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea with a total of 49 cases as of that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/10/04/how-ebola-sped-out-of-control/|title=How Ebola sped out of control|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/previous-updates.html|title=Previous Updates: 2014 West Africa Outbreak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msf.org.uk/article/guinea-ebola-epidemic-declared|title=Guinea: Ebola epidemic declared|work=MSF UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4065-ebola-virus-disease-in-guinea-25-march-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease in Guinea (Situation as of 25 March 2014)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By late May, the outbreak had spread to [[Conakry]], Guinea's capital, a city of about two million inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Previous_Updates_2014_West_Africa_Outbreak&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/recent_updates.html |title=Previous Updates: 2014 West Africa Outbreak |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containment efforts==

===Quarantines and travel restrictions===

In March, Guinea's President [[Alpha Conde]] declared a national health emergency due to the  outbreak. He stated efforts to control the spread of the Ebola virus would include forbidding Ebola patients from leaving their homes, border control, travel restrictions, and hospitalization for individuals suspected to be infected until cleared by laboratory results. He also banned the transporting of the dead between towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/13018/20140814/ebola-update-guinea-president-declares-virus-outbreak-as-national-health-emergency.htm|title=Ebola update: Guinea president declares virus outbreak as national health emergency|work=Tech Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good disease tracing is important to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Previous Ebola outbreaks have occurred in remote areas making containment easier; the current outbreak struck in an area that lies at the centre of both a highly-mobile and densely populated region which has made tracking more difficult:  "This time, the virus is traveling effortlessly across borders by plane, car and foot, shifting from forests to cities and springing up in clusters far from any previously known infections. Border closures, flight bans and mass quarantines have been ineffective."  [[Peter Piot]], who co-discovered Ebola, said Ebola "isn't striking in a 'linear fashion' this time. It's hopping around, especially in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/09/08/ebola-resurgence-in-guinea-liberia-highlights-west-africas-containment-concerns|title=Ebola Resurgence in Guinea, Liberia Highlights West Africa's Containment Concerns – US News|author=Andrew Soergel|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/09/08/ebola-is-surging-in-places-it-had-been-beaten-back.|title=Ebola surging|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear of healthcare workers and clinics===
[[File:Preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit (3).jpg|thumb|250px|Médecins Sans Frontières staff dressed in protective clothing]]

Containment has also been difficult due to fear of healthcare workers.  Infected people and those that they have been in contact with  have evaded surveillance, moving at will and hiding their illnesses while they infect others in turn. Entire villages, stricken by fear, have closed themselves off, giving the disease an opportunity to strike in another area.  It has been reported that  in some areas it is believed that health workers are purposely spreading the disease to the people, while others believe that the disease does not exist. Riots broke out in the regional capital, Nzérékoré, when rumors were spread that people were being contaminated when health workers were spraying a market area to decontaminate it.&lt;ref name="Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443 |title=Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed |publisher=BBC News |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, the number of Ebola cases appeared to be decreasing and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) closed a treatment facility in the Macenta region because the outbreak of Ebola there appeared to have been resolved.  At the time it was thought that the new cases were caused by people returning from Liberia or from Sierra Leone, however it was later suggested that villagers had become fearful and were hiding cases rather than reporting them.  Seeing workers wearing the required protection outfits worn by health workers and taking those suspected of having Ebola or of being contacts to the treatment center (perhaps never to be seen again), refusing the usual burial rituals when a patient died, and other actions taken by the unfamiliar individuals that had come to their remote areas, had led to rumors of organ harvesting and government and tribal plots.  According to a September  news report, "Many Guineans say local and foreign healthcare workers are part of a conspiracy which either deliberately introduced the outbreak, or invented it as a means of luring Africans to clinics to harvest their blood and organs."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/09/guinea-residents-refusing-ebola-treatment-201492751955453636.html|title=Guinea residents 'refusing' Ebola treatment|author=Agencies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described in another news article, "The health workers don’t look like any people you’ve ever seen. They perform stiffly and slowly, and then they disappear into the tent where your mother or brother may be, and everything that happens inside is left to your imagination. Villagers began to whisper to one another—''They’re harvesting our organs; they’re taking our limbs''".&lt;ref name="Hell in the Hot Zone"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2014/10/ebola-virus-epidemic-containment# | title=Hell in the Hot Zone | publisher=Vanity Fair | date=October 2014 | accessdate=25 November 2014 | author=Stern, Jeffery E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, due to fear, many people are avoiding hospital treatment for any ailment and are self-treating with [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] drugs from a pharmacy.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

On 18 September, eight members of a health care team were murdered by local villagers in the town of [[Womey]] near [[Nzérékoré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/arrests-made-in-killings-of-guinea-ebola-education-team-1411144837|title=Arrests Made in Killings of Guinea Ebola Education Team|work=Wall Street Journal|date=September 19, 2014|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team consisted of Guinean health and government officials accompanied by journalists, who had been distributing Ebola information and doing disinfection work. They were attacked with machetes and clubs, and their bodies were found in a septic tank. The dead included three journalists and four volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/18/missing-health-workers-in-guinea-were-educating-villagers-about-ebola-when-they-were-attacked/|title=Eight dead in attack on Ebola team in Guinea. ‘Killed in cold blood.’ |publisher= The Washington Post| date= 18 September 2014|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443 |title=Ebola outbreak: Guinea health team killed|publisher=BBC | date=19 September 2014 |accessdate= 5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2014/09/19/health-workers-killed-in-guinea-for-distributing-information-about-ebola|title=Health workers killed in Guinea for distributing information about Ebola |publisher=The Advisory Board Company | date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak progression==

===October 2014===

In the WHO Situation Report of 8 October, it was reported, that the transmission of Ebola was persistently high with approximately 100 new confirmed cases in the first week of October. The first cases were reported in the district of Lola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/|title=WHO: Ebola Responses Roadmap Situation Report 8 October 2014 |publisher=WHO | date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] reported a massive spike in the number of new cases in the capital city of Conakry. One facility admitted 22 patients in a single day (October 6), 18 of them coming from [[Coyah Prefecture|Coyah region]], 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Conakry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msf.ca/en/article/ebola-new-spike-cases-guinea-pushes-conakry-treatment-centre-limit|title=Ebola: A new spike in cases in Guinea pushes Conakry treatment centre to the limit|publisher=MSF CANADA|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October, Guinea reported two new districts with Ebola cases. The [[Kankan]] district, on the border with the [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and a major trade route to [[Mali]], confirmed one case. Kankan also borders the district of [[Kerouane]] in this country, one of the areas with the most intense virus transmissions. The [[Faranah]] district to the north of the border area of [[Koinadugu]] in Sierra Leone  also reported a confirmed case. [[Koinadugu]] was one of the last Ebola-free regions in that country. According to a WHO report, this new development highlights the need for increased surveillance of cross border traffic in an effort to contain the disease to the three most affected countries.&lt;ref name="Ebola_WHO_22_oct"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137091/1/roadmapsitrep22Oct2014_eng.pdf |accessdate=22 Oct 2014 |title=Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report |date=22 Oct 2014 |author=WHO |work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October, Saccoba Keita, the head of Guinea's Ebola mission, announced the government has started compensating the families of health care workers who died after contracting the virus. At that time, 42 health care workers had died, including doctors, nurses, drivers, and porters. The compensation totals $10,000 (£6,200) and is to be paid as a lump sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29745026|title=BBC News – Ebola crisis: Guinea begins compensation payments|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 2014===

In mid-November, the WHO reported that while intense transmission persists and cases and deaths continue to be under-reported, there is some evidence that case incidence is no longer increasing nationally in Guinea.  They report that case numbers in some districts have been fluctuating, but they remain consistently high.  
New case numbers have been declining in the outbreak’s epicentre of Gueckedou, but transmission continues to be high in Macenta.  Of a total of 34 districts in Guinea, 10 remain unaffected by Ebola, contrasting with Liberia and Sierra Leone, where every district has been affected.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/?m=20141112&amp;file=sitreps/20141112/20141112.html | title=Ebola response roadmap – Situation report | publisher=WHO | date=12 November 2014 | accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November, the local [[Red Cross]] in Kankan Prefecture sent  blood samples via a courier when the taxi he was traveling in was stopped by robbers. The bandits made off with the cooler bag containing the blood samples. The Guinea authorities made a public appeal for the return of the blood samples. The robbery occurred near the town of Kissidougou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/bandits-guinea-steal-blood-samples-suspected-ebola-infection-105900372.html|title=Bandits in Guinea steal blood samples believed to be infected with Ebola|date=21 November 2014|work=Yahoo News Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2014===

On 14 December the WHO stated that 17 districts reported new confirmed or suspected cases in this week. Guinea reported 2,416 cases with 1,525 deaths on this date. Only 10 out of the 34 districts have not reported cases. Conakry reported 18 new cases in this week. The northern district of Siguiri is of particular concern, as it borders Mali and reported 4 new probable cases.&lt;ref name="WHO2014_12_17a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/145679/1/roadmapsitrep_17Dec2014_eng.pdf?ua=1 |title=EBOLA RESPONSE ROADMAPSITUATION REPORT-17 DECEMBER 2014 |publisher=World Health organization|date=17 December 2014|accessdate =18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free of Ebola transmission===
The country was declared free of Ebola transmission on 29 December, 42 days after the last Ebola patient tested negative for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-guinea-1.3382945 |title=Ebola gone from Guinea |author=Thomson Reuters |date=29 December 2015 |website=CBC News - Health |publisher=CBC/Radio Canada |access-date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea was subsequently in a 90-day period of heightened surveillance according to the U.N. World Health Organization which also offered assistance&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; - with funding from the agency's donors.

==New cases March 2016==
On 17 March 2016, the government of Guinea reported 2 people had tested positive for Ebola virus in [[Korokpara]].&lt;ref name="Reuters2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-guinea-idUSKCN0WJ2UQ|title=Guinea says two people tested positive for Ebola|publisher=Reuters|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that they are from the village where members of one family died recently from vomiting (and diarrhea).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4263806/two-people-test-positive-ebola-guinea/|title=2 Test Positive for Ebola in Guinea|last=Reilly|first=Katie|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March, it was reported that another individual died due to the virus, at the treatment centre in Nzerekore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-20/ebola-fourth-person-dies-in-guinea/7261234|title=Fourth person dies of Ebola in Guinea|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's government has quarantined an area around the home where the cases took place.

On 5 April it was reported that there were nine new cases of Ebola since the virus resurfaced. Of these nine cases eight have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ebola-claims-another-victim-guinea-vaccinations-ramped-192323781.html|title=Ebola claims another victim in Guinea as vaccinations ramped up|date=2016-04-05|website=Yahoo News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 42-day waiting period, the WHO declared the country free of Ebola on 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/8676-end-of-ebola-transmission-in-guinea.html|title=End of Ebola transmission in Guinea|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vaccines ==
After a trial run of an experimental Ebola vaccine involving 11,000 people in Guinea, Merck, the vaccine’s manufacturer, announced it was found to be “highly protective” against the virus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-23/ebola-vaccine-made-by-merck-protects-against-deadly-virus|title=Ebola Vaccine Protects Against Deadly Virus|date=2016-12-23|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmed the results of a study published in 2015 that awarded the vaccine 100 percent effectiveness after tests on 4000 people in Guinea who had been in close contact with Ebola patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and conducted by researchers from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, called the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing Ebola infections into question.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/vaunted-ebola-vaccine-faces-questions-1493072473|title=Vaunted Ebola Vaccine Faces Questions|last=Burton|first=Thomas M.|date=2017-04-24|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-07-13|last2=Hackman|first2=Michelle|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the authors criticized the methodology of the patient trail, and argued that the protection provided by the vaccine may be lower than officially announced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The WHO approved the vaccine for use in the ongoing Ebola outbreak on May 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxmen|first=Amy|title=Ebola vaccine approved for use in ongoing outbreak|url=https://www.nature.com/news/ebola-vaccine-approved-for-use-in-ongoing-outbreak-1.22024|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/democratic-republic-of-congo-approves-experimental-ebola-vaccine-use/a-39030346|title=Democratic Republic of Congo approves experimental Ebola vaccine use {{!}} News {{!}} DW {{!}} 29.05.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in May 2017 that the Gamaleya Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia would deliver 1000 doses of an independently produced vaccine to Guinea for testing. According to a Xinhua report, it is the only officially authorized and approved Ebola vaccine for clinical use to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/18/c_136293017.htm|title=Russia to deliver Ebola vaccines to Guinea by end of June: Health Ministry - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=news.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been widely cited (e.g. by commentators at [[FiveThirtyEight]]) as a major reason for [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-saying-trumps-win-had-nothing-to-do-with-economics/ |title=Stop Saying Trump’s Win Had Nothing To Do With Economics |last=Casselman |first=Ben |date=2017-01-09 |website=FiveThirtyEight |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-was-stronger-where-the-economy-is-weaker/ |title=Trump Was Stronger Where The Economy Is Weaker |last=Kolko |first=Jed |date=2016-11-10 |website=FiveThirtyEight |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, however, argue that economic anxiety was less of an important factor in predicting support for Trump than "cultural anxiety," or the feeling that one is a stranger in America and that illegal immigrants should be deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/ |title=It Was Cultural Anxiety That Drove White, Working-Class Voters to Trump |last=Green |first=Emma |date=2017-05-09 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used sarcastically in response to racist statements by Trump's supporters, to mock the attempts by centrist commentators to argue that support for Trump is due to concern about their economic prospects, not to racial attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/136081/started-economic-anxiety-joke-trump-and-its-gone-far-now |title=I Started the “Economic Anxiety” Joke about Trump—and It’s Gone Too Far Now |last=Beutler |first=Brian |date=2016-08-16 |website=New Republic |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/donald-trump-and-economic-anxiety/496385/ |title=Does 'Economic Anxiety' Explain Donald Trump? |last=Thompson |first=Derek |date=2016-08-18 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: This table measures "undernourishment", as defined by [[FAO]], and represents the number of people consuming (on average for years 2010 to 2012) less than the minimum amount of food energy (measured in kilocalories per capita per day) necessary for the average person to stay in good health while performing light physical activity. It is a conservative indicator that does not take into account the extra needs of people performing extraneous physical activity, nor seasonal variations in food consumption or other sources of variability such as inter-individual differences in energy requirements. Malnutrition and undernourishment are cumulative or average situations, and not the work of a single day's food intake (or lack thereof). This table does not represent the number of people who "went to bed hungry today."

The below is a list of countries by percentage of population with [[undernourishment]], as defined by the [[United Nations]] [[World Food Programme]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in its "The State of Food Insecurity in the World" 2009 report.

==Middle East==
Malnutrition rates in [[Iraq]] had risen from 19% before the US-led invasion to a national average of 28% four years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/carintern/9e9e54eac735cfcd9b98b3a8e031cfa4.htmThird of Iraqi children now malnourished four years after US invasion] Reuters. 16 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, only 8% were malnourished. (See data above.)

==South Asia ==
According to the [[Global Hunger Index]], [[South Asia]] (also known as the [[Indian Subcontinent]]) has the highest child malnutrition rate of world's regions.&lt;ref name="ghi2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/challenge-hunger-2008-global-hunger-index |title=Global Hunger Index Key Findings &amp; Facts|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], a largely vegetarian country and second largest country in the world by population, contributes most number in malnutrition in the region.The 2006 report mentioned that "the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region" and was concerned that South Asia has "inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children".&lt;ref name="southasiahunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6046718.stm|title='Hunger critical' in South Asia|publisher=BBC| date=2006-10-13 | accessdate=2010-05-12|first=Geeta|last=Pandey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

30% children of [[India]] are underweight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survey Says Nearly Half of India's Children Are Malnourished |newspaper=CBS News |date=2007-02-10 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/10/ap/health/mainD8N6H7RG0.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308120740/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/10/ap/health/mainD8N6H7RG0.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the highest rates in the world and nearly double the rate of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="underweight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20916955~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html|title=India: Undernourished Children: A Call for Reform and Action|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on overcoming persistent under-nutrition published by the [[Institute of Development Studies]], argues that the co-existence of India as an 'economic powerhouse' and home to one-third of the world's under-nourished children reflects a failure of the governance of nutrition: "A poor capacity to deliver the right services at the right time to the right populations, an inability to respond to citizens' needs and weak accountability are all features of weak nutrition governance."&lt;ref name=curse&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/idspublication/lifting-the-curse-overcoming-persistent-undernutrition-in-india|title= Lifting the Curse: Overcoming Persistent Undernutrition in India |work= IDS Bulletin|volume=40 |issue=4 |date=2009-07-02|author1=Haddad, L.  |author2=Zeitlyn, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research suggests that to make under-nutrition history in India the governance of nutrition needs to be strengthened and new research needs to focus on the politics and governance of nutrition. At the current rate of progress the MDG1 target for nutrition will only be reached in 2042 with severe consequences for human wellbeing and economic growth.&lt;ref name=curse /&gt;

Although the United States Department of Agriculture reported in 2012 that an estimated 85.5 percent of households in the country are food secure, millions of people in America struggle with the threat of hunger or experience hunger on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="USDA Report 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coleman-Jensen|first1=A|last2=Nord|first2=M|last3=Singh|first3=A|title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2012|date=2013|journal=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA defines [[food security]] as the economic condition of a household wherein which there is reliable access to a sufficient amount of food so all household members can lead a healthy productive life.&lt;ref name="Hunger in America 2014: Executive Summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borger|first1=C|last2=Gearing|first2=M|last3=Macaluso|first3=T|last4=Mills|first4=G|last5=Montaquila|first5=J|last6=Weinfield|first6=N|last7=Zedlewski|first7=S|title=Hunger in America 2014: Executive Summary|date=2014|journal=Feeding America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunger is most commonly related to poverty since a lack of food helps perpetuate the [[cycle of poverty]]. Most obviously, when individuals live in poverty they lack the financial resources to purchase food or pay for unexpected events, such as a medical emergency. When such emergencies arise, families are forced to cut back on food spending so they can meet the financial demands of the unexpected emergency.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valentine|first1=Vikki|title=Q &amp; A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America|url=https://www.npr.org/2005/11/22/5021812/q-a-the-causes-behind-hunger-in-america|website=NPR|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not one single cause of hunger but rather a complex interconnected web of various factors. Some of the most vulnerable populations to hunger are the elderly, children, people from a low socioeconomic status, and minority groups; however, hunger's impact is not limited to these individuals.

The largest nonprofit food relief organization in the United States, [[Feeding America]], feeds 46.5 million citizens a year to address the nation's food insecurity issue.&lt;ref name="Hunger in America 2014: Executive Summary" /&gt; This equates to one in seven Americans requiring their aid in a given year. An organization that focuses on providing food for the elderly population is [[Meals on Wheels]], which is a nonprofit that delivers meals to seniors' homes. The government also works towards providing relief through programs such as the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) which was formerly known to the public as Food Stamps. Another well known government program is the [[National School Lunch Program]] (NSLP) which provides free or reduced lunches to students who qualify for the program.

The number of Americans suffering from hunger rose after the 2008 financial crisis, with children and working adults now making up a large proportion of those affected. In 2012, ''Gleaners Indiana Food bank'' reported that there were now 50 million Americans struggling with food insecurity (about 1 in 6 of the population), and that the number of folks seeking help from food banks had increased by 46% since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gleaners.org/ Gleaners Indiana Food bank] Retrieved 18 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2012 study by [[UCLA School of Public Health#Research centers|UCLA Center for Health Policy Research]], even married couples who both work but have low incomes sometimes require the aid of food banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loansafe.org/thousands-more-in-solano-napa-counties-are-turning-to-food-banks  |title=Thousands More in Solano, Napa Counties are Turning to Food Banks  |author=Alex Ferreras  |date=11 July 2012  |accessdate=11 July 2012  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717045016/http://www.loansafe.org/thousands-more-in-solano-napa-counties-are-turning-to-food-banks  |archivedate=17 July 2012  |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/poverty-hunger-america|title= Poverty and hunger in America|publisher= [[The Guardian]]|author= John Turner|date = 20 September 2012|accessdate= 1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Childhood malnutrition is generally thought of as being limited to developing countries, but although most malnutrition occurs there, it is also an ongoing presence in developed nations. For example, in the United States of America, one out of every six children is at risk of hunger.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A study, based on 2005–2007 data from the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture Department]], shows that an estimated 3.5 million children under the age of five are at risk of [[hunger in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=3.5M Kids Under 5 On Verge Of Going Hungry&lt;br /&gt;Study: 11 Percent Of U.S. Households Lack Food For Healthy Lifestyle |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/07/health/main4998190.shtml | work=Health |publisher=CBS NEWS | date=2009-05-07 | accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, this persistent hunger problem is not due to lack of food or food programs, but is largely due to an underutilization of existing programs designed to address the issue, such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] or [[school meal]]s. Many citizens of rich countries such as the United States of America attach stigmas to food programs or otherwise discourage their use. In the USA, only 60% of those eligible for the food stamp program actually receive benefits.&lt;ref name="plan_to_end_childhood_hunger_in_america"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strength.org/childhood_hunger/our_plan |title=Plan to End Childhood Hunger in America |publisher=Share Our Strength |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729002514/http://strength.org/childhood_hunger/our_plan/ |archivedate=2011-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that in 2003, only 1 out of 200 U.S. households with children became so severely food insecure that any of the children went hungry even once during the year. A substantially larger proportion of these same households (3.8 percent) had adult members who were hungry at least one day during the year because of their households' inability to afford enough food.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2005-april/data-feature.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Focal infection theory''' is the historical concept that many chronic diseases, including [[systemic disease|systemic]] and common diseases, are caused by focal infections, that is, a localized infection that causes disease elsewhere in the host. But focal infections themselves are fairly infrequent, often asymptomatic, and limited to fairly uncommon diseases.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, David Schlossberg, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=meFwBwAAQBAJ&amp;q=focal ''Clinical Infectious Disease''], 2nd edn (Cambridge University Press, 2015), and Yomamoto T, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tjWbHw0Ufb4C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=focal "Triggering role of focal infection..."], in Harabuchi Y et al, eds, ''Recent Advances in Tonsils and Mucosal Barriers of the Upper Airways'' ([[Karger Publishers|Karger]], 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;    The key principle of focal infection theory is injury (infection) at a distance, where the mode of infection in ordinary infectious disease is systemic, as in [[measles]]; or, the initially infected site is readily identifiable and invasion progresses contiguously from the point of infection, as in [[gangrene]].&lt;ref name="Jacobson-Silverman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"&gt;J Craig Baumgartner, José F Siqueira Jr, Christine M Sedgley &amp; Anil Kishen, ch 7 "Microbiology of endodontic disease", in John I Ingle, Leif K Bakland &amp; J Craig Baumgartner, eds, ''Ingle's Endodontics'', 6th edn (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aV1kEf7mlckC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Rosenow+Price p 221–24].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, rather than singular diseases presenting with  specific progressions of an original infection, focal infection theory has historically explained virtually all diseases—including arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and mental illnesses— as secondary infections caused by a distant (and often obscure) source.&lt;ref name="Stillman-McCall"&gt;Paul R Stillman &amp; John O McCall, ''[https://archive.org/details/atextbookclinic00stilgoog A Textbook of Clinical Periodontia]'', (New York: Macmillan Co, 1922), "[https://archive.org/stream/atextbookclinic00stilgoog#page/n145/mode/2up/search/focal ch 18 Focal infection]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20318466 |year=1931 |author=Graham D |title=Focal infection |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=422–4 |pmc=382689 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11326533 |year=2000 |vauthors=Pallasch TJ, Wahl MJ |lastauthoramp=y|title=The focal infection theory: Appraisal and reappraisal |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=194–200 |journal=Journal of the California Dental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"&gt;Nils Skaug &amp; Vidar Bakken, ch 8 "4Systemic complications of endodontic infections", subch "Chronic periapical infections as the origin of metastatic infections", in Gunnar Bergenholtz, Preben Hørsted-Bindslev &amp; Claes Reit, eds, ''Textbook of Endodontology'', 2nd ed.

An ancient concept that took modern form around 1900, focal infection theory was widely accepted in medicine by the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunter1921/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18739726 |year=1925 |author=Wisner FP |title=Focal infection, a medico-dental problem |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=977–80 |pmc=1654829 |journal=California and Western Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the theory, the ''focus of infection'' might lead to secondary infections at sites particularly susceptible to such microbial species or toxin.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Commonly alleged foci were diverse—appendix, urinary bladder, gall bladder, kidney, liver, prostate, and [[nasal sinuses]]—but most commonly were oral.  Besides dental decay and infected [[tonsils]], both [[dental restoration]]s and especially [[root canal therapy|endodontically treated teeth]] were blamed as foci.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;  The putative ''oral [[sepsis]]'' was countered by tonsillectomies and tooth extractions, including of endodontically treated teeth and even of apparently healthy teeth, newly popular approaches—sometimes leaving individuals toothless—to treat or prevent diverse diseases.&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;

Drawing severe criticism in the 1930s, focal infection theory—whose popularity zealously exceeded consensus evidence—was discredited in the 1940s by research attacks that drew overwhelming consensus of this sweeping theory's falsity.  Thereupon, dental restorations and endodontic therapy became again favored.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;  Untreated endodontic ''disease'' retained mainstream recognition as fostering systemic disease.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunning&gt;James M Dunning, ''Principles of Dental Public Health'', 4th edn (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1986), ch 13 "Dental needs and resources", § "Systemic infection of dental origin", [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8ElWjsy8ukC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=Systemic p 272–73].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavett G, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/tragic-results-when-dental-care-is-out-of-reach "Tragic results when dental care is out of reach"4], [[PBS]] ''Frontline'' website, 26 Jun 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  But only [[alternative medicine]] and later [[holistic dentistry|biological dentistry]] continued highlighting sites of dental treatment—still endodontic therapy, but, more recently, also [[dental implant]], and even tooth extraction, too—as foci of infection causing chronic and systemic diseases.&lt;ref name=UninformedConsent&gt;Hal A Huggins &amp; Thomas E Levy, ''Uninformed Consent: The Hidden Dangers in Dental Care'' (Charlottesvi4lle VA: Hampton Roads Publishing, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ePkelycnYAEC&amp;pg=PT113&amp;dq=cavitation ch 12 "The cavitation"] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ePkelycnYAEC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;dq= ch 13 "Focal infection]".&lt;/ref&gt;  In mainstream dentistry and medicine, the primary recognition of focal infection is [[endocarditis]], if oral bacteria [[bacteremia|enter blood]] and infect the heart, perhaps its [[heart valve|valve]]s.&lt;ref name="Jacobson-Silverman"/&gt;

Entering the 21st century, scientific evidence supporting general relevance of focal infections remained slim, yet evolved [[pathophysiology|understandings of disease mechanisms]] had established a third possible mechanism—altogether, [[metastasis]] of infection, metastatic toxic injury, and, as recently revealed, metastatic [[immunologic]] injury—that might occur simultaneously and even interact.&lt;ref name="Jacobson-Silverman"&gt;Jed J Jacobson &amp; Sol Silverman Jr, ch 17 "Bacterial infections", in Sol Silverman, Lewis R Eversole &amp; Edmond L Truelove, eds, ''Essentials of Oral Medicine'' (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CgWKyeniwskC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=focal+infection+metastatic+immuno-logic+injury+toxic pp 159–62].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaitanya-Gomes"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0973-029X.84477 |title=Systemic manifestations of oral diseases |year=2011 |author1=Nchaitanya Babu|author2= Andreajoan Gomes  |lastauthoramp=y|journal=Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=144–7 |pmid=22529571 |pmc=3329699}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, focal infection theory has gained renewed attention, as dental infections apparently are widespread and significant contributors to systemic diseases, although mainstream attention is on ordinary [[periodontal disease]], not on hypotheses of stealth infections via dental ''treatment''.&lt;ref name="Goymerac-Woolard"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15366304 |year=2004 |vauthors=Goymerac B, Woollard G |lastauthoramp=y|title=Focal infection: A new perspective on an old theory |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=357–61 |journal=General Dentistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;Shantipriya Reddy, ''Essentials of Clinical Periodontology and Periodontics'', 2nd edn (New Delhi: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, 2008), ch 13 "Periodontal medicine", esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WM67jyzXrAUC&amp;pg=PA115 pp 115–16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pizzo-etal"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21111933 |year=2010 |vauthors=Pizzo G, Guiglia R, Lo Russo L, Campisi G |lastauthoramp=y |title=Dentistry and internal medicine: From the focal infection theory to the periodontal medicine concept |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=496–502 |doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2010.07.011 |journal=European Journal of Internal Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some doubts renewed in the 1990s by conventional dentistry's critics, dentistry scholars maintain that endodontic therapy can be performed without creating focal infections.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;

==Rise and popularity (1890s–1930s)==

===Roots and dawn===

In ancient Greece, [[Hippocrates]] reported cure of an arthritis case by tooth extraction.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Yet modern focal infection theory awaited [[Robert Koch]]'s establishment of [[medical microbiology|medical bacteriology]] in the late 1870s to early 1880s.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/514705 |title=Germs, Dr. Billings, and the theory of focal infection |year=1998 |author=Gibbons RV |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=627–33 |pmid=9770165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1890, [[Willoughby D Miller]] attributed a set of oral diseases to infections, and a set of general diseases—as of [[pulmonary diseases|lung]], stomach, [[brain abscess]]es, and other conditions—to those infectious oral diseases.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17012729 |year=2006 |author=Barnett ML |title=The oral-systemic disease connection: An update for the practicing dentist |volume=137 Suppl |pages=5S–6S |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association |doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)01387-9 |title=The human mouth as a focus of infection |year=1891 |author=Miller WD |journal=The Lancet |volume=138 |issue=3546 |pages=340–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willoughby D Miller, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2zPeF6hAWIIC The Micro-Organisms of the Human Mouth: The Local and General Diseases Which Are Caused by Them]'' (Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Thieme, 1892).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894, Miller became the first to reveal existence of bacteria in samples of [[dental pulp]].&lt;ref name="Patel-Barnes"&gt;Shanon Patel &amp; Justin J Barnes, "Introduction: How has endodontics developed?", in Shanon Patel &amp; Justin J Barnes, eds, ''The Principles of Endodontics'', 2nd edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e-mPUiGbj9oC&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=developed+focal pp 4–5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller WD |title=An introduction to the study of the bacteriopathology of the dental pulp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BygxAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA505|journal=Dental Cosmos |year=1894 |volume=36 |pages=505–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller advised [[root canal therapy]].&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  Yet focal infection theory met a cultural climate where ancient and folk ideas, long entrenched via [[Galen]]ic [[four humors|humoral medicine]], found new outlets through bacteriology—a pillar of the new "scientific medicine".&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt;

Emigrating from Russia in 1886, international scientific celebrity [[Elie Metchnikoff]]—discoverer of [[phagocyte]]s, mediating [[innate immunity]]—was embraced in Paris by [[Louis Pasteur]], who granted him an entire floor for research once the [[Pasteur Institute]], the globe's first [[biomedicine|biomedical]] institute, opened in 1888.&lt;ref name="Tauber-Chernyak"&gt;Alfred I Tauber &amp; Leon Chernyak, ''Metchnikoff and the Origins of Immunology: From Metaphor to Theory'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=nfhpJ2Ri6KsC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=Ehrlich+Pasteur+Metchnikoff viii], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nfhpJ2Ri6KsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Pasteur+warmly 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the [[Pasteur Institute|Institute]]'s director and 1908 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobelist]], Metchnikoff believed, as did his rival [[Paul Ehrlich]]—theorist on [[antibody]], mediating [[acquired immunity]]—and as did Pasteur, that nutrition influenced immunity.&lt;ref name="Tauber-Chernyak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As later elucidated, antibody molecules, which are secreted by [[plasma B cell|activated B cell]]s, mediate but [[humoral immunity|one arm]] of [[acquired immunity]], whose [[cellular immunity|other arm]] is mediated by [[killer T cell]]s.  As acquired immunity's two principal mediators, [[B cell]]s and [[T cell]]s are subsets of [[lymphocytes]]—themselves a subset of white blood cells, aka [[leukocytes]]—as their base of residence is peripheral [[lymphoid tissue]]s.  On the other hand, innate immunity is mediated not only by [[phagocytes]] but also by a third subset of lymphocytes: [[natural killer cells]].  Further, innate immunity also includes soluble components—[[complement system|complement proteins]] and, more recently identified, ''innate antibody'' secreted by B cells—while still other lymphocytes, specifically [[helper T cells]], bridge innate immunity to adaptive immunity, and vice versa.  Thus, the seeming division between innate immunity and acquired immunity is more practical than natural.  Immunology's early feuds over whether immunity is innate or is acquired reflected limited perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharing Pasteur's view of science as a [[applied science|means]] to suppress the problems plaguing humankind, Metchnikoff brought into France its first cultures of yogurt for [[probiotic]] microorganisms to foster health and longevity by suppressing the colon's [[putrefaction|putrefactive]] microorganisms alleged to foster the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]'s toxic seepage, ''[[autointoxication]]''.&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tauber-Chernyak"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;

In 1900, British surgeon [[William Hunter (surgeon)|William Hunter]] blamed many disease cases on ''oral sepsis''.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20759127 |last1=Hunter |first1=W |title=Oral sepsis as a cause of disease |volume=2 |issue=2065 |pages=215–6 |pmc=2462945 |journal=British Medical Journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2065.215|date=28 July 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hunter, ''[https://archive.org/details/oralsepsisascaus00huntiala Oral Sepsis as a Cause of Septic Gastritis, Toxic Neuritis, and Other Septic Conditions]'' (London: Cassell &amp; Co, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1910, lecturing in Montreal at [[McGill University]], he claimed, "The worst cases of anemia, [[gastritis]], [[colitis]], obscure fevers, nervous disturbances of all kinds from mental depression to actual lesions of the [[spinal cord|cord]], chronic [[rheumatic fever|rheumatic infection]]s, [[kidney diseases]] are those which owe their origin to or are gravely complicated by the oral [[sepsis]] produced by these gold traps of sepsis."&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  He apparently indicted [[dental restoration]]s.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;  Incriminating their execution, rather, his American critics [[lobbying|lobbied]] for stricter dental licensing requirements.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  Still, Hunter's lecture—as later recalled—"ignited the fires of focal infection".&lt;ref name=Ingle&gt;John I Ingle, ''PDQ Endodontics'', 2nd edn (Shelton CT: People's Medical Publishing House, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_ocJ00rh1EC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=Billings+Cecil+Hunter+lecture+Rosenow p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, he proudly accepted that credit.&lt;ref name=Hunter1921&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20770334 |year=1921 |author=Hunter W |title=The coming of age of oral sepsis |volume=1 |issue=3154 |pages=859 |pmc=2415200 |journal=British Medical Journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3154.859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet, read carefully, his lecture asserts a sole cause of the sepsis: dentists who instruct patients to ''never remove'' partial dentures.&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reimann-Havens"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1940.02810010003001 |title=Focal infection and systemic disease: A critical appraisal |year=1940 |author1= Hobart A Reimann|author2= Paul Havens|lastauthoramp=y |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focal infection theory's modern era really began with physician [[Frank Billings]], based in Chicago, and his [[case report]]s of [[tonsillectomy|tonsillectomies]] and tooth extractions claimed to have cured infections of distant organs.&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;  Replacing Hunter's term ''oral sepsis'' with ''focal infection'',&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt; Billings in November 1911 lectured at the Chicago Medical Society, and published it in 1912 as an article for the American medical community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.1912.00060160087007 |title=Chronic focal infections and their etiologic relations to arthritis and nephritis |year=1912 |author=Frank Billings |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |issue=4 |pages=484–498 |volume=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916, Billings lectured in California at [[Stanford University]] Medical School, this time printed in book format.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Billings, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F0ZIAAAAMAAJ Focal Infection: The Lane Lectures]'' (New York &amp; London: D Appleton &amp; Co, 1918).&lt;/ref&gt;  Billings thus popularized intervention by tonsillectomy and tooth extraction.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  A pupil of Billings, [[Edward C Rosenow Sr|Edward Rosenow]] held that extraction alone was often insufficient, and urged teamwork by dentistry and medicine.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;  Rosenow developed the principle ''elective localization'', whereby microorganisms have affinities for particular organs, and also espoused extreme [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]].&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/infdis/22.4.345 |jstor=30080461 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHFNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345 |title=Agglutination of the pleomorphic Streptococcus isolated from epidemic poliomyelitis by immune serum |year=1918 |author1=Edward C Rosenow |author2=Hazel Gray |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=345–378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward C Rosenow, [https://archive.org/stream/newerknowledgeof00jord#page/576/mode/2up ch 43 "Elective localization of bacteria in the animal body"], in Edwin O Jordan &amp; I S Falk, eds ''[https://archive.org/details/newerknowledgeof00jord The Newer Knowledge of Bacteriology and Immunology]'' (Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, 1928), pp 576–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s medical school, launched in 1894 as America's first to teach "scientific medicine", the eminent [[Sir William Osler]] was succeeded as professor of medicine by [[Llewellys Franklin Barker|Llewellys Barker]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/papers/barker.html The Lewellys Franklin Barker Collection]", ''Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives'', Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Website access: 23 Sep 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; who became a prominent proponent of focal infection theory.&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt;  Although many of Hopkins' medical faculty remained skeptics, Barker's colleague [[William Sydney Thayer|William Thayer]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/sgml/thayer.html The William S Thayer Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922110930/http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/sgml/thayer.html |date=2013-09-22 }}", ''Repository Guide to the Personal Papers Collections of Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives'', Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Website access: 21 Sep 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; cast support.&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt;  As Hopkins' chief physician, Barker was a pivotal convert propelling the theory to the center of American routine medical practice.&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt;  [[Russell L Cecil|Russell Cecil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Copeman WSC |pmc=1031019 |title=Russell L Cecil |journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases |date=Sep 1965 |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=502 |doi=10.1136/ard.24.5.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  famed author of ''Cecil's Essentials of Medicine'', too, lent support.&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;  In 1921, British surgeon [[William Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] announced that oral sepsis was "coming of age".&lt;ref name=Hunter1921/&gt;

Although physicians had already interpreted pus within a bodily compartment as a systemic threat, pus from infected tooth roots often drained into the mouth and thereby was viewed as systemically inconsequential.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;  Amid focal infection theory, it was concluded that that was often the case—while immune response prevented dissemination from the focus—but that immunity could fail to contain the infection, that dissemination from the focus could ensue, and that systemic disease, often [[neurological]], could result.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1914.02570230037013 |title=Peridental infection as a causative factor in nervous diseases |year=1914 |author=Craig CB |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=63 |issue=23 |pages=2027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, excision of focal infections was considered a "rational form of therapy" undoubtedly resolving many cases of chronic diseases.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;  Its inconsistent effectiveness was attributed to unrecognized foci—perhaps inside internal organs—that the [[clinician]]s had missed.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;

===Reception by dentistry===

In 1923, upon some 25 years of researches, dentist [[Weston Andrew Price]] of Cleveland, Ohio, published a landmark book,&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weston A Price, ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'', [https://archive.org/details/dentalin01pric Vol 1] &amp; [https://archive.org/details/dentalin02pric Vol 2] (Cleveland: Penton Publishing, 1923).&lt;/ref&gt; then a related article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1925.02660300012006 |title=Dental infections and related degenerative diseases |year=1925 |author=Price WA |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Price concluded that after [[root canal therapy]], teeth routinely host bacteria producing potent toxins.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Transplanting the teeth into healthy rabbits, Price and his researchers duplicated heart and arthritic diseases.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Although Price noted often seeing patients "suffering more from the inconvenience and difficulties of mastication and nourishment than they did from the lesions from which their physician or dentist had sought to give them relief",&lt;ref&gt;Weston A Price, ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'', Vol 1 (Cleveland: Penton Publishing, 1923), [https://archive.org/stream/dentalin01pric#page/488/mode/2up/search/warning p 488].&lt;/ref&gt; his 1925 debate with John P Buckley was decided in favor of Price's position: "practically all infected pulpless teeth should be extracted".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner ''et al'', ''Ingle's Endodontics'', 6th edn (Hamilton: BC Decker, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aV1kEf7mlckC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=Buckley-Price+debate p 286], not giving that precise summary, cite [https://books.google.com/books?id=2W0hAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Weston+A+Price+John+P+Buckley Buckley–Price debate] on the subject: {{cite journal |vauthors=Price Weston A, Buckley John P | year = 1925 | title = 'Resolved: that practically all infected pulpless teeth should be extracted' | url = https://books.google.com/books?ei=9_c6Usq4Jpa34APEiIH4Cg&amp;id=2W0hAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=resolved+that+practically+all+infected+pulpless | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 1468–524 | doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1925.0307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As chairman of the [[American Dental Association]]'s research section, Price was the individual who, perhaps beyond any other, shaped the dentistry profession's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''British Journal of Dental Science'', 1928;'''72''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=BwO3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Weston+Price 101].&lt;/ref&gt;  Textbook authors relied on Price's 1923 treatise into the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: William H O McGehee, ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002069550 A Text-book of Operative Dentistry]'', 2nd edn (Philadelphia: Blackiston's Son &amp; Co, 1936), pp 39 &amp; 110; Louis V Hayes, ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002068229 Clinical Diagnosis of Diseases of the Mouth: A Guide for Students and Practitioners of Dentistry and Medicine]'' (Brooklyn NY: Dental Items of Interest Publishing, 1935), p 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsuspected [[periapical periodontitis|periapical disease]] was first revealed by dental X-ray in 1911, the year that Frank Billings lectured on focal infection to the Chicago Medical Society.&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;  Introduced by [[C Edmund Kells]],&lt;ref name=Kracher&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11794365 |year=2000 |author=Kracher CM |title=C.

===Psychiatric promulgation===

Besides heredity, focal infection and autointoxication was psychiatry's predominant explanation of schizophrenia near the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Noll2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noll Richard | date = Apr 2004 | title = Historical review: Autointoxication and focal infection theories of dementia praecox | url = | journal = World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 66–72 | pmid = 15179665 | doi=10.1080/15622970410029914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In American state New Jersey, the director of the psychiatric asylum at [[Trenton State Hospital]] since 1907 was [[Henry Andrews Cotton|Henry Cotton]].&lt;ref name=Wessely&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19797603 |date=October 2009 |author=Wessely S |title=Surgery for the treatment of psychiatric illness: The need to test untested theories |volume=102 |issue=10 |pages=445–51 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2009.09k038 |pmc=2755332 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing influence from the medical popularity of focal infection theory,&lt;ref name="Scull-p33"/&gt; Cotton identified focal infections as the main causes of dementia praecox (now [[schizophrenia]]) and manic depression (now [[bipolar disorder]]).&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  Cotton routinely prescribed surgery to clean the [[nasal sinuses]] and to extract the tonsils and [[dentition]].&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  Yet, seeking to clean the entire body of focal infections, Cotton frequently prescribed surgical removal of the appendix, gall bladder, spleen, stomach, colon, cervix, ovaries, testicles, and thereby claimed up to 85% cure rate.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;

Despite the death rate of some 30%, Cotton's fame rapidly spread through America and Europe, and the asylum drew influx of paying patients.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised his accomplishments and heralded "high hope".&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  Cotton made a European lecture tour,&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt; and Princeton University Press and Oxford University Press simultaneously published his book in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Henry A Cotton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XDowAAAAYAAJ The Defective, Delinquent, and Insane: The Relation of Focal Infections to their Causation, Treatment and Prevention]'' (Princeton/London: Princeton University Press/Oxford University Press, 1922).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite scepticism within his profession, psychiatrists were under pressure to match Cotton's treatments, as patients would ask why they were being denied successful intervention.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  Other patients, ostensibly for their own good, were pressured or compelled into treatment without their own consent.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Fennell, ''Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People since 1845'' (London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpmJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 120].&lt;/ref&gt;  Cotton had his two sons' teeth extracted as preventive healthcare—although each later committed suicide.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;  By the 1930s, however, focal infection fell from psychiatry as an explanation.&lt;ref name=Noll2004/&gt;

==Criticism and decline (1930s–1950s)==

===Early skepticism===

Addressing the Eastern Medical Society in December 1918, New York City physician Robert Morris explained that focal infection theory had drawn much interest while factual understanding of it was incomplete, and while application of the theory was earning disrepute through the overzealousness of some advocates.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Robert T Morris: "The matter of focal infections is one of the very new subjects of the day which men are taking up with a great deal of interest but are going ahead perhaps with incomplete knowledge and not comprehending the range and scope of the entire subject; consequently this subject is falling into disrepute in certain fields because of the over-enthusiasm of some of the advocates of focal infection theory in relation to distant demonstration—endocarditis, rheumatism, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, various forms of neuritis, ''etc''.  The [[scientist|philosopher]], taking all evidence judicially, will eventually give the medical profession the basic facts and what is valuable in the subject.  Right now one might utter a warning to the general medical profession against taking too active an interest in the subject." ["Address on medicine and surgery", ''American Medicine'', 1919 Jan;'''25'''(1):17–23, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U9E0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=focal+infections pp 18–19]].&lt;/ref&gt; Morris called for facts and explanation from scientists before physicians continued to invest so steeply in a theory that even so was triggering acrimonious disputes and division among clinicians and uncertainty among patients.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

In 1919, in New Orleans, at the annual meeting of the [[National Dental Association]] (forerunner of the [[American Dental Association]]), dental X-ray originator and pioneer [[C Edmund Kells]]&lt;ref name=Kracher/&gt; delivered a lecture, published in 1920 in the Association's journal,&lt;ref&gt;C Edmund Kells, "X-ray in dental practice", ''Journal of the National Dental Association'', 1920 Mar;'''7'''(3):241–72 [''[[Journal of the American Dental Association|JADA]]'' provides the article free in two parts ([http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/Kells_1920_part_one.pdf 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927231040/http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/Kells_1920_part_one.pdf |date=2013-09-27 }} &amp; [http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/Kells_1920_part_two.pdf 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927231030/http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/Kells_1920_part_two.pdf |date=2013-09-27 }})].&lt;/ref&gt; largely discussing focal infection theory, which Kells condemned as a "crime".&lt;ref name=ADA/&gt;  Kells stressed that X-ray technology is to improve dentistry, not to enhance the "mania of extracting devitalized teeth".&lt;ref name=ADA&gt;[[American Dental Association|ADA]]: "C Edmund Kells was a dental pioneer who championed the use of X-rays in dentistry during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Much of the paper discusses focal infection theory, which Dr Kells argued was leading to the unnecessary extraction of teeth.  He also made it clear that dental X-rays should be used to enhance dentistry, and not to encourage the 'mania for extracting devitalized teeth' " ["[http://www.ada.org/7951.aspx ''JADA'' Centennial]: [http://www.ada.org/7951.aspx#february-1 From the February 2013 issue of ''JADA'']", American Dental Association, Website access: 21 Sep 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;  Kells urged dentists to reject physicians' prescriptions of tooth extractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23372129 |year=2013 |vauthors=Jacobsohn PH, Kantor ML, Pihlstrom BL |lastauthoramp=y|title=The X-ray in dentistry, and the legacy of C.

In two [[controlled clinical trial]]s with alternate allocation of patients, Kopeloff, Cheney, and [[George Hughes Kirby|Kirby]] found no effectiveness of [[Henry Andrews Cotton|Cotton]]'s psychiatric surgeries, as patients who improved already had that prognosis and others did so without surgeries.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shorter&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21507275 |year=2011 |author=Shorter E |title=A brief history of placebos and clinical trials in psychiatry |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=193–7 |pmc=3714297 |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |doi=10.1177/070674371105600402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They presented their findings at the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s 1922 and 1923 annual meetings, and published two papers.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kopeloff Nicolas, Cheney Clarence O | date = Oct 1922 | title = Studies in focal infection: Its presence and elimination in the functional psychoses | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=139770 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 79 | issue = 2| pages = 139–56 | doi=10.1176/ajp.79.2.139}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kopeloff Nicolas, Kirby George H | date = Oct 1923 | title = Focal infection and mental disease | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=139833 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 80 | issue = 2| pages = 149–91 | doi=10.1176/ajp.80.2.149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of Cotton's data were questioned at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by [[Phyllis Greenacre]], who later helped steer American psychiatry into [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt; [[Colectomy]] for psychosis vanished except in Trenton until Cotton—who used publicity and word of mouth, kept the 30% death rate unpublicized, and passed a 1925 investigation by New Jersey Senate—died by heart attack in 1933.&lt;ref name=Wessely/&gt;

As early as 1927, [[Weston Andrew Price|Weston Price]]'s researches were criticized for "faulty bacterial technique".&lt;ref&gt;Henry W Crowe &amp; Herbert G Franking, "Aetiology continued: Dental infections and degenerative diseases—a review and commentary", pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oeuxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Etiology+continued:+Dental+infections+degenerative+diseases 23]–32, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14750710 Bacteriology and Surgery of Chronic Arthritis and Rheumatism with End-Results of Treatment]'' (New York/London: Humphrey Milford/Oxford University Press, 1927), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oeuxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=faulty p 32].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s and 1940s, researchers and editors dismissed the studies of [[Edward C Rosenow Sr|Edward Rosenow]] and of Price as flawed by insufficient controls, massive doses of bacteria, and contamination of [[root canal therapy|endontically treated]] teeth during extraction.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  In 1938, [[Russell L Cecil|Cecil]] and Angevine reported 200 cases of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], but no consistent cures by tonsillectomies or tooth extractions.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-12-5-577 |title=Clinical and experimental observations on focal infection, with an analysis of 200 cases of rheumatoid arthritis |year=1938 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=577}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They noted that, "Focal infection is a splendid example of a plausible medical theory which is in danger of being converted by its enthusiastic supporters into the status of an accepted fact."&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  Newly a critic, Cecil alleged that foci were "anything readily accessible to surgery".&lt;ref name=Ingle/&gt;

In 1939, E W Fish implanted bacteria into guinea pigs' jaws and reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fish E Wilfred | year = 1939 | title = Bone infection | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 691–712 | doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1939.0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; that four zones develop.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  The first zone was the zone of infection, whereas the other three zones—surrounding the zone of infection—revealed immune cells or other host cells but no bacteria.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Fish theorized that by removing the infectious nidus, dentists would permit recovery from the infection, and Fish's reasoning and conclusion became the basis for successful root canal treatment.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Still, endodontic therapy of the era indeed posed substantial risk of failure, and fear of focal infection crucially motivated endontologists to develop new and improved technology and techniques.&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;

===End of the focal era===

The review and "critical appraisal" by Hobart A Reimann and W Paul Havens, published in January 1940,&lt;ref name="Reimann-Havens"/&gt; was perhaps the most influential criticism of focal infection theory.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;  Recasting [[William Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]]'s views of 30 years earlier as widely misinterpreted, they summarized that "the removal of infectious dental focal infections in the hope of influencing remote or general symptoms of disease must still be regarded as an experimental procedure not devoid of hazard".&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt;  By 1940, Louis I Grossman's textbook ''Root Canal Therapy'' flatly rejected the methods and conclusions made earlier by Price and especially by Rosenow.&lt;ref&gt;Louis I Grossman, ''Root Canal Therapy'' (Philadelphia: Lea &amp; Febiger, 1940), ch 2, reprinted in ''Journal of Endodontics'', 1982 Jan;'''8'''(Suppl):S18-S24, available at Robert Kaufmann's ''EndoExperience.com'' under "The endo file cabinet: Textbook excerpts: [http://www.endoexperience.com/documents/Grossmanarticleonfocalinfection.pdf ''Grossman's Endodontics'': Chapter on focal infection"], Accessed online 17 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amid improvements in endodontics and medicine, including release of [[sulfa drugs]] and [[antibiotics]], a backlash to the "orgy" of tooth extractions and tonsillectomies ensued.&lt;ref name="CDA"/&gt;

Easlick's 1951 review in the ''[[Journal of the American Dental Association]]'' notes, "Many authorities who formerly felt that focal infection was an important etiologic factor in systemic disease have become skeptical and now recommend less radical procedures in the treatment of such disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14831976 |year=1951 |author=Easlick KA |title=An evaluation of the effect of dental foci of infection on health |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=615–97 |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1952 editorial in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' tolled the era's end by stating that "many patients with diseases presumably caused by foci of infection have not been relieved of their symptoms by removal of the foci, many patients with these same systemic diseases have no evidence focus of infection, foci of infection are as common in apparently healthy persons as in those with disease".&lt;ref name=Carranza&gt;Philip M Preshaw &amp; John J Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BspTzxVK6-kC&amp;pg=PT998 ch 21 "Periodontal pathogenesis"], in Michael G Newman, Henry Takei, Perry R Klokkevold &amp; Fermin A Carranza, ''Carranza's Clinical Periodontology'', 11th edn (St Louis: Saunders/Elsevier, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMA1952&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1952.03680050056016 |title=Focal Infection |year=1952 |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=150 |issue=5 |pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some support extended into the late 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M Dougherty &amp; Anthony J Lamberti, ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009111062 Textbook of Bacteriology]'', 3rd edn (St Louis: Mosby, 1954), p 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1957.02970420001001 |title=Relation of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy to poliomyelitis |year=1957 |author=Thomas C Galloway |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=163 |issue=7 |pages=519–21 |pmid=13398294}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet focal infection vanished as the primary explanation of chronic, systemic diseases,&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; and was generally abandoned in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=PerMedSysBio/&gt;

==Revival and evolution (1990s–2010s)==

Despite the general theory's demise, focal infection remained a formal, if rare, diagnosis, as in [[idiopathic scrotal gangrene]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald T Lewis, ch 25 "Soft tissue infection and loss of abdominal wall substance", in Robert Bendavid, ed, ''Abdominal Wall Hernias: Principles and Management'' (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ai6fOllPH44C&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=focal+infection p 192].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[angioneurotic edema]].&lt;ref&gt;Technical Manual #8-225: ''Dental Specialist'' (Washington DC: Department of the Army Headquarters, 20 Sep 1971), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=focal+infection Glossary-7] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=SA5-PA14&amp;dq=focal+infection 5-14].&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, by way of continuing [[case report]]s claiming cures of chronic diseases like arthritis after extraction of infected or root-filled teeth, and despite lack of scientific evidence, "dental focal infection theory never died".&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;  In fact, severe [[endodontic]] disease resembles classic focal infection theory.&lt;ref name="Skaug-Bakken"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMA1952/&gt;  In 1986, it was noted that, "in spite of a decline in recognition of the focal-infection theory, the association of decayed teeth with systemic disease is taken very seriously".&lt;ref name=Dunning/&gt;  Eventually, the theory of focal infection drew reconsideration.&lt;ref name=PerMedSysBio&gt;Nikos Donos &amp; Francesco D'Aiuto, ch 3 "Periodontitis: A modern clinical perspective", in Brian Henderson, Michael Curtis, Robert Seymour &amp; Nikolaos Donos, eds, ''Periodontal Medicine and Systems Biology'' (West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcRAI7NdALgC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=autoimmunity+biological+dietary+distant+extractions+focal+inflammation+oral+reconsidering+sepsis+systemic+tonsillectomy+1950s pp 33–34].&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, attribution of [[endocarditis]] to dentistry has entered doubt via [[case-control]] study, as the species usually involved is present throughout the human body.&lt;ref name="Ingle-2"&gt;John I Ingle, ''PDQ Endodontics'',  2nd edn (Shelton CT: People's Medical Publishing House, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_ocJ00rh1EC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=Cecil+Kells+focal+endocarditis+abscess+prosthetic p xv].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stealth pathogens===
With the 1950s introduction of antibiotics, attempts to explain unexplained diseases via bacterial etiology seemed all the more unlikely.&lt;ref name=Wilson-etal-2002&gt;Michael Wilson, Rod McNab &amp; Brian Henderson, ''Bacterial Disease Mechanisms: An Introduction to Cellular Microbiology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDMnfbZ3CCkC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;dq=L+forms+focal+infection+mycoplasmas p 597].&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1970s, however, it was established that antibiotics could trigger bacteria's switch to their [[L-form bacteria|L phase]].&lt;ref name=Hunter-1977&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hunter N | date = Oct 1977 | title = Focal infection in perspective | url = | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, and Oral Pathology | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 626–7 | pmid = 269356 | doi=10.1016/0030-4220(77)90308-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eluding detection by traditional methods of [[medical microbiology]], bacterial L forms and the similar [[mycoplasma]]—and, later, [[viruses]]—became the entities expected in the theory of focal infection.&lt;ref name=Wilson-etal-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunter-1977/&gt;  Yet until the 1980s, such researchers were scarce, largely via scarce funding for such investigations.&lt;ref name=Wilson-etal-2002/&gt;

===Periodontal medicine===

At the 1990s' emergence of [[epidemiological]] associations between dental infections and systemic diseases, American dentistry scholars have been cautious,&lt;ref name=PerMedSysBio/&gt; some seeking successful intervention to confirm causality.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otomo-Corgel-etal"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23040337 |year=2012 |vauthors=Otomo-Corgel J, Pucher JJ, Rethman MP, Reynolds MA|lastauthoramp=y |title=State of the science: Chronic periodontitis and systemic health |volume=12 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=20–8 |doi=10.1016/S1532-3382(12)70006-4 |journal=Journal of Evidence-based Dental Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American sources emphasized epidemiology's inability to determine causality, categorized the phenomena as progressive invasion of local tissues, and distinguished that from focal infection theory—which they assert was evaluated and disproved by the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Ingle-p222"/&gt;  Others have found focal infection theory's scientific evidence still slim, but have conceded that evolving science might establish it.&lt;ref name="Jacobson-Silverman"/&gt;  Yet select American authors affirm the return of a modest theory of focal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Atanasova Kalina R, Yilmaz Özlem | date = Jul 2015 | title = Prelude to oral microbes and chronic diseases: Past, present and future | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 17 | issue = 7| pages = 473–83 | pmid = 25813714 | doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2015.03.007 | pmc=4485946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett Michael L | date = Oct 2006 | title = The oral-systemic disease connection: An update for the practicing dentist | url = http://www.purebrush.com/featured_articles_NewFiles/5S.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 5S–6S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European sources find it more certain that dental infections drive systemic diseases, at least by driving systemic inflammation, and probably, among other immunologic mechanisms, by [[molecular mimicry]] resulting in [[antigenic]] crossreaction with host biomolecules,&lt;ref name="Pizzo-etal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seymour-etal"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17716290 |year=2007 |vauthors=Seymour GJ, Ford PJ, Cullinan MP, Leishman S, Yamazaki K |lastauthoramp=y|title=Relationship between periodontal infections and systemic disease |volume=13 Suppl 4 |pages=3–10 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2007.01798.x |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Somma-etal"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21375141 |year=2010 |vauthors=Somma F, Castagnola R, Bollino D, Marigo L |title=Oral inflammatory process and general health.

===Dental controversies===

During the 1980s, dentist [[Hal Huggins]], sparking severe controversy, spawned [[holistic dentistry|biological dentistry]], which claims that conventional tooth extraction routinely leaves within the tooth socket the [[periodontal ligament]] that often becomes [[gangrenous]], then, forming a jawbone [[osteonecrosis|''cavitation'']] seeping infectious and toxic material.&lt;ref name=UninformedConsent/&gt;  Sometimes forming elsewhere in bones after injury or [[ischemia]],&lt;ref name=Chaitow&gt;Leon Chaitow, ''Cranial Manipulation: Theory and Practice'', 2nd edn (Edinburgh, London, New York, elsewhere: Elsevier, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=d-xWWv1W4YYC&amp;q=cavitation pp 348–49].&lt;/ref&gt; jawbone cavitations are recognized as foci also in [[osteopathy]]&lt;ref name=Chaitow/&gt; and in alternative medicine,&lt;ref&gt;Examples: Ellen Hodgson Brown, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FQDuwxjGSNEC&amp;pg=PT203&amp;dq=Huggins Healing Joint Pain Naturally: Safe and Effective Ways to Treat Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and Other Joint Diseases]'' (New York: Broadway Books, 2001); Shirley MacLaine, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JxIW1CPeaxkC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=cavitation Sage-ing While Age-ing]'' (New York: Atria Books, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; but conventional dentists generally conclude them to be nonexistent.&lt;ref name=Chaitow/&gt;  Although the [[International Academy of Oral Medicine &amp; Toxicology]] claims that the scientific evidence establishing the existence of jawbone cavitations is overwhelming, and even published in textbooks, the diagnosis and related treatment remain controversial,&lt;ref&gt;IAOMT, [https://iaomt.org/iaomt-position-paper-jawbone-osteonecrosis "IAOMT position paper on jawbone osteonecrosis"], International Academy of Oral Medicine &amp; Toxicology, 27 Jul 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and allegations of quackery persist.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Barrett, [https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cavitation.html "A critical look at cavitational osteopathosis, NICO, and 'biological dentistry'"], Quackwatch, 4 Apr 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those remaining from the original microbiota would need to have maintained viability throughout treatment procedures, including exposure to disinfectants, and thereafter adapted to a root canal environment in which the availability of a variety of nutrients is more limited because of lack of pulp tissue.  This might occur as a result of an inability of chemomechanical instrumentation procedures to completely debride the root canal system in a single visit and because of the inaccessible locations of bacteria in isthmuses, accessory canals, and apical regions of canals.

==Early military service and medical school==

This work made him notable among European scientists.&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt; His dissertation followed the article, "A Case of Extensive Scabby Ulcerations, Cured by Vaccination" that he wrote and was published in the ''[[London Medical and Surgical Journal]]'' in 1833.&lt;ref name="NovoaLevine p. 31" /&gt;

==Career==

===Medicine===
Muñiz, upon becoming a doctor in 1821, worked as a military doctor under [[Juan Lavalle]] at [[Carmen de Patagones]] during the campaign to secure land from indigenous people. He began to study the customs of native people at this time.&lt;ref name="Lockyer1917"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Norman Lockyer|title=Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LA7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA305|year=1917|publisher=Macmillan Journals Limited|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1824 he was transferred to the fort at [[Chascomús]],&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt; and began his study of [[paleontology]].&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt; General [[Carlos María de Alvear]] ordered that he accompany Lavalle and his troops during the 1826 [[Cisplatine War|war with Brazil]]. He was promoted to Army Surgeon Major that year and transferred to [[Luján, Buenos Aires Province|Luján]] in 1828 to be a physician to police and military troops.&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt;

Muñiz served the military and became a colonel. During the [[Paraguayan War]], he became director of [[Corrientes Province]] area hospitals.&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine p. 90" /&gt;

In 1848, Muñiz moved to Buenos Aires to become a professor of the School of Medicine where he taught in the fields of [[forensic medicine]], [[gynecology]] and [[obstetrics]].&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine p. 90"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Levine|author2=Adriana Novoa|title=¡Darwinistas!

===Paleontology===
Muñiz was a [[paleontologist]], particularly interested in variances among fossils.&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt; Working as a physician at Lujan was of particular paleontological interest because of a famous find in 1788 of the ''[[Megatherium]]'', an immense [[ground sloth]]. He developed a collection that he intended to be used to create a [[natural history museum]]. The artifacts were sent (donated or possibly donated by force) to [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]],&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt;&lt;ref name=barquezdiaz2014/&gt; the dictator of the [[Argentine Federation]], whose support was required to establish a museum.&lt;ref name="NovoaLevine p. 32"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adriana Novoa|author2=Alex Levine|title=From Man to Ape: Darwinism in Argentina, 1870–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeAGIipEQEC&amp;pg=PA32|date=1 December 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-59616-7|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosas, in an attempt to build alliances overseas, sent collected fossils to [[Jean Dupotet|Jean Henri Dupotet]], Rear Admiral of the French Navy. Dupotet then sent them to Paris.&lt;ref name="NovoaLevine p. 32" /&gt; In France Muñiz collection ended up in the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] where they were studied by [[Paul Gervais]].&lt;ref name=barquezdiaz2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Barquez |first=Rubén M. |last2=Díaz |first2=M.

''Apuntes Toggraficos'', published in 1847 by Muñiz, contained his [[topographical]] notes that discussed the study of fossils in the relative ages of [[stratum|sedimentary strata]] in areas south of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] by [[naturalist]]s, including [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85" /&gt; Darwin began corresponding with Muñiz after reading his work on ñata cattle, indicative of the reputation that he was gaining as a naturalist. [[Domingo Sarmiento]], who researched Muñiz's papers, commented on his influence to Darwin's theory of the origin of species.&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85-87"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Levine|author2=Adriana Novoa|title=¡Darwinistas! The Construction of Evolutionary Thought in Nineteenth Century Argentina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IH2XG-BwvUC&amp;pg=PA85|date=5 January 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22136-9|pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leila Gómez|title=Darwinism in Argentina: Major Texts (1845–1909)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2APUjG_IUCYC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-61148-386-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|This inquiry into the existence and later extinction of a variety of cattle raised on the ranches of Buenos Aires would be of little intellectual interest today, were it not thus linked with the celebrated theory of evolution, and the appears of Dr. Muñiz would be of lesser interest, too, except for the observations cited by Darwin in the ''[[Journal of Researches]] (commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle).''{{#tag:ref|Darwin wrote: "A niata bull with a common cow, or the reverse cross, produces offspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata characters strongly displayed: according to Senor Muñiz, there is the clearest evidence, contrary to the common believe of agriculturalists in analogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when crossed with a common cow."&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85-87" /&gt;|group="nb"}}|Domingo Sarmiento&lt;ref name="Levine p. 85-87" /&gt;}}

He described a [[Saber-toothed cat|sabertooth]], which he named ''Muni-felus Bonaerensis'', in ''Gaceta Mercantil'' in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Levine|author2=Adriana Novoa|title=¡Darwinistas!

Darwin encouraged him to send specimens to France, which were received in Paris, apparently sent by Rosas.&lt;ref name="Levine p. 87-88"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Levine|author2=Adriana Novoa|title=¡Darwinistas!

In their book, ''From Man to Ape: Darwinism in Argentina,'' Novoa and Levine identify Muniz as the first important naturalist from Argentina,&lt;ref name="NovoaLevine p. 31" /&gt; who donated his later collection of fossils to the Museum of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Lockyer1917" /&gt;

===Politics===
He was a [[legislator]], elected first as a representative and then a senator.&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Sepulcro Javier Muñiz Recoleta.jpg|thumb|Monument to Francisco Javier Muñiz, [[Cementerio de la Recoleta]], Buenos Aires]]
After having treated people with [[yellow fever]] during the [[Yellow fever in Buenos Aires|great Buenos Aires epidemic]], Muñiz succumbed to the illness and died on 8 April 1871. He was buried in the [[Cementerio de la Recoleta]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine p. 90" /&gt; A monument was created in his honor by the city of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Lockyer1917" /&gt;

==Legacy==
* Of his importance to Argentina, President Sarmiento wrote:
{{Quotation|His profession was medicine and surgery; but at the University, he introduced and taught classes in obstetrics and [[pediatric pathology]], exhibiting the highest feelings of respect for women, respect that in other countries had already led to calls for the civil [[gender equality|equity of the sexes]], and will soon lead also to political [[suffrage]]. Muñiz led the way along this path. In the army, he introduced vegetable rations and militated for [[mobile hospital]]s, such as now become the order of the day in all modern armies. In the [[natural science]]s he followed in Darwin's footsteps, continuing his work and collecting the materials that [[Hermann Burmeister|Burmeister]], with his greater technical skill, would later classify.|[[Domingo Sarmiento]]&lt;ref name="Levine p. 90" /&gt;}}

* The Museo de Historia Natural "Francisco Javier Muñiz" de Moreno was inaugurated in [[Moreno Partido]] in 1999 in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moreno.gob.ar/noticia.aspx?id=6553 | title=Apertura de las actividades en el Museo Javier Muñiz | publisher=Moreno Municipio | date=20 August 2013 | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a series commemorating scientists, Argentina issued a stamp with a portrait of Francisco Javier Muñiz in 1966.&lt;ref name="Mayo article" /&gt;
* [[Hospital Muñiz]], the oldest Infectious Diseases Hospital in [[Latin America]], is named in his honor.

'''Hand pumps''' are manually operated [[pump]]s; they use human power and mechanical advantage to move fluids or air from one place to another. They are widely used in every country in the world for a variety of industrial, marine, irrigation and leisure activities. There are many different types of hand pump available, mainly operating on a piston, diaphragm or rotary vane principle with a check valve on the entry and exit ports to the chamber operating in opposing directions. Most hand pumps are either [[piston pump]]s or [[plunger pump]]s, and are [[Pump#Positive displacement pump|positive displacement]].&lt;ref name="wateraid.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wateraid.org/international/what_we_do/sustainable_technologies/technology_notes/2061.asp |title=Handpumps |publisher=WaterAid |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand pumps are commonly used in [[developing countries]] for both community supply and [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|self-supply of water]] and can be installed on [[borehole]]s or hand-dug [[Water well|wells]].

== History ==
[[File:Taccola first piston.jpg|thumb|First European depiction of a [[piston]] pump, by [[Taccola]], c.1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hill | first = Donald Routledge | title = A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1996 | page = 143 | isbn = 0-415-15291-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MqSXc5sGZJUC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=Taccola+first+piston}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Pump-enabled Riverside Irrigation in Comilla, Bangladesh, 25 April 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Irrigation]] is underway by pump-enabled extraction directly from [[Gumti River (Tripura)|the Gumti]], seen in the background, in [[Comilla District|Comilla]], [[Bangladesh]].]]

One sort of pump once common worldwide was a hand-powered water pump, or 'pitcher pump'. It was commonly installed over community [[water well]]s in the days before piped water supplies.

In parts of the British Isles, it was often called ''the parish pump''. Though such community pumps are no longer common, people still used the expression ''parish pump'' to describe a place or forum where matters of local interest are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/parish+pump|title=Online Dictionary – Parish Pump|accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because water from pitcher pumps is drawn directly from the soil, it is more prone to contamination.  If such water is not filtered and purified, consumption of it might lead to gastrointestinal or other water-borne diseases. A notorious case is the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. At the time it was not known how cholera was transmitted, but physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] suspected contaminated water and had the handle of the public pump he suspected removed; the outbreak then subsided.

Modern hand-operated community pumps are considered the most sustainable low-cost option for safe water supply in resource-poor settings, often in rural areas in developing countries. A hand pump opens access to deeper groundwater that is often not polluted and also improves the safety of a well by protecting the water source from contaminated buckets. Pumps such as the Afridev pump are designed to be cheap to build and install, and easy to maintain with simple parts. However, scarcity of spare parts for these type of pumps in some regions of Africa has diminished their utility for these areas.

==Types==

===Suction and lift hand pumps===
Suction and lift are important considerations when pumping fluids. Suction is the vertical distance between the fluid to be pumped and the centre of the pump, while lift is the vertical distance between the pump and the delivery point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenhill|first1=Alfred G.|title=A Treatise on Hydrostatics|date=1894|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|page=363|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924101157836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth from which a hand pump will suck is limited by atmospheric pressure to an operating depth of less than 7 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E04.htm |title=Water lifting devices |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height to which a hand pump will lift is governed by the ability of the pump and the operator to lift the weight in the delivery pipe. Thus the same pump and operator will be able to achieve a greater lift with a smaller diameter pipe than they could with a larger diameter pipe.

In addition to their use in drawing water from shallow groundwater sources for water supplies, another version of the hand-powered suction pump, with low lift and high delivery, was developed in the later 19th century for use as a ship's bilge pump (for smaller coastal vessels) and as a building site contractor's pump. It was known as a deluge pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oertling|first1=Thomas J.|title=Ships' bilge pumps: a history of their development, 1500-1900|date=1996|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=College Station, TX|isbn=9780890967225|page=74|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; One manufacturer who illustrated this product from the late 1880s onwards into the early 20th century was Goulds Manufacturing Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue 'A' of Pumps and Hydraulic Machinery|date=1900|publisher=The Goulds Manufacturing Co.|location=Seneca, NY|page=146|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066398425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Force Pump===
Where it is necessary to raise water to a height above that to which a suction or lift pump will operate effectively (about 7 metres), or to raise the pressure so that it will exit a nozzle with a strong force, such as through a fire hose, a force pump may be used. As with a suction pump, in its manual form it relies on an operator to pump a handle. The difference is however that after the water is sucked through the lower valve (as a result of raising the piston that is attached to the handle), its means of exit is via a pipe or nozzle in the side of the main cylinder. The water, once it has been drawn up above the lower valve and trapped there, is forced out the exit when the piston or plunger is pushed down again on the next stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merchant|first1=F.W.|last2=Chant|first2=C.A.|title=The Ontario High School Physics|date=1911|publisher=Copp, Clark Co. Ltd|location=Toronto|page=127|url=https://archive.org/details/ontariohighschool00merc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siphon===
A siphon (or syphon) at its simplest is a bent tube, with one end placed in the water to be moved, and the other end into the vessel to receive the water. The receiving vessel must be at a lower level than the supplying vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bale|first1=M. Powis|title=Pumps and Pumping|date=1901|publisher=Crosby, Lockwood &amp; Son|location=London|page=46|edition= 4th|url=https://archive.org/details/pumpspumpinghand00balerich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water will always try to find its lowest level. Using this principle, very simple pumps with plastic or rubber bulb with flap valve at each end are used for emptying fuel or water cans into tanks. Once the bulb is full, the fluid will flow without further effort from the higher to the lower container. Many hand pumps will allow the passage of fluid through them in the direction of flow and diaphragm pumps are particularly good at this. Thus where the levels are correct large volumes of liquid such as swimming pools can be emptied with very little effort and no expensive energy use.

===Chain pump===
A chain pump is made of an endless chain carrying a series of discs that descend into the water, and then ascend inside a tube, carrying with them a large quantity of water. They are a simply made,
old hand-powered pumping technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bale|first1=M. Powis|title=Pumps and Pumping|date=1901|publisher=Crosby, Lockwood &amp; Son|location=London|page=45|edition= 4th|url=https://archive.org/details/pumpspumpinghand00balerich}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century they were used as ship's bilge pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oertling|first1=Thomas J.|title=The chain pump: an 18th century example|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=1982|volume=11|issue=2|pages=113–124|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-9270.1982.tb00066.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct action ===
Direct action hand pumps have a pumping rod that is moved up and down, directly by the user, discharging water. Direct action handpumps are easy to install and maintain but are limited to the
maximum column of water a person can physically lift of up to 15 m.  Examples of direct action pumps include the canzee pump &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/implementation/proprietary-handpumps/canzee-pump&lt;/ref&gt; and the EMAS pump.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/implementation/public-domain-handpumps/emas-flexi-pump&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep wells===
Deep well hand pumps are used for high lifts of more than 15 m. The weight of the column of water is too great to be lifted directly and some form of mechanical advantage system such as a lever or flywheel is used.
High lift pumps need to be stronger and sturdier to cope with the extra stresses. The installation, maintenance and repair of deep well hand pumps is more complicated than with other hand pumps.

A deep well hand pump theoretically has no limit to which it can extract water. In practice, the depth is limited by the physical power a human being can exert in lifting the column of water, which is around 80 m.

===Diaphragm===

Diaphragm pumps have the advantage that they pump relatively lightly due to the lack of pulling rods and are corrosion resistant. Their disadvantage is that they need a specific length of tubing and high quality rubber diaphragms, which are costly and are relatively inefficient due to the extra work needed to deform the diaphragm.

Rubber diaphragms will eventually leak and need to be replaced. Because this is usually complicated and costly, diaphragm pumps operating in poor rural areas are often abandoned once the diaphragm wears out.

===Progressive cavity===
[[Progressive cavity pump]]s consist of a single helix rotor inserted into a double helix stator. As the rotor is turned, the voids in the stator are screwed upwards along the axis of rotation. Progressive cavity pumps can have complicated gearing mechanisms and are difficult for local
pump technicians to maintain and repair.

A rope and washer pump is a type of progressive cavity hand pump.

===Range of lift ===

The range of lift of different types of hand pumps is given below:&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wateraid.org/uk/~/media/Publications/Handpumps.pdf?la=en-GB&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hand pumps and access to clean water==
[[File:Providing clean water and flood-resistant shelter (5950788649).jpg|alt=A young woman pumps water from a handpump in her village.|thumb|A village pump can provide safe drinking water.  If it is conveniently located, it can reduce the amount of time that girls and women spend carrying water.]]

In November 2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights asserted that access to clean, safe water goes beyond the classification of water as an economic commodity. The committee stressed the fundamental right of sufficient access to clean water for both domestic and personal use. “The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:uq3Xv_98mpcJ:www.un.org/events/water/TheRighttoWater.pdf+United+Nations+right+of+water&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi8CCrex7jDoQ-X1mTn3sgL1mxHzy1SH-_zWvJwWosNjlErCBeUfjcmhXb-XO_6v9sI7cIja92QFPOcl-O28FFip--L7D_D9_KtQ3PYQleMgyXkVuEa5LgSOTrJTw6wwXqacu6_&amp;sig=AFQjCNE6SwFCTV4IBWRcLkfBtrPhcPG_0Q |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, manufacturers of water pumps, like those produced by GOAZ Development in Malaysia, have a wide range of potential customers: governments, non- governmental organizations, women’s groups, community groups and other organizations of various types interested to developing access to groundwater.&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-26970-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=The PVC Handpump: International Development Research Centre |publisher=Idrc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201032621/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-26970-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |archivedate=1 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Village level operation and maintenance===
VLOM, meaning [[Village Level Operation and Maintenance]], is a term first used during the UNDP and World Bank Rural Water Supply Hand Pumps Project. This project lasted from 1981 to 1991, and studied the availability and maintenance of hand pump systems. 40 kinds of hand pumps were analyzed in laboratories, and the performance of 2700 hand pumps was analyzed in the field. The study established that centralized maintenance structure was a cause of many problems in hand pump programs, and that maintenance at the village level is best.&lt;ref name="wateraid.org"/&gt;

The VLOM concept was initially applied to hardware, with the following aims: the possibility of maintenance by village workers, having spare parts manufactured within the country to make sure spare parts are available, endurance in the field, and cost effectiveness. With time, more emphasis was placed on maintenance management. Thus, the “M” came to represent “management of maintenance.” Therefore, greater community choice of service, who will service, and financial accountability by the community to the caretakers of the pump have gained more importance within the VLOM concept.&lt;ref name="wateraid.org"/&gt;

The Swiss Centre Resource Centre and Consultancies for Development, Skat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skat.ch/ skat.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; continues to work on design and support structure for hand pump development as the host of Secretariat of the Rural Water Supply Network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rural-water-supply.net rural-water-supply.net]&lt;/ref&gt; (RWSN).

===Hand pump development projects===
An example of a Bank funded project that highlights many issues of hand pumps is the 1992 Mali Rural Supply Project. The project brought approximately 230 rural villages inclined towards periods of drought, and 228,000 people access to safe water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;World Bank, Operations Evaluation Department:[http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/b57456d58aba40e585256ad400736404/bfac563424aad2e7852567f5005d8fe2/$FILE/154precis.pdf Sustaining Rural Water Systems:The Case of Mali], Autumn 1997, Retrieved on 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project is notable in its attempt to bring responsibility for the upkeep of the pumps to the villages themselves. The complexity of the pumps is a fundamental problem for all programs of this kind, as well as the quality of the pumps given the heavy demands of a village.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A 1994 study, also Bank funded, of the endurance of hand pumps in Africa showed that only 41 to 51 percent of hand pumps were still functioning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Mali Rural Supply Project did positively affect the longevity of hand pumps by doing the following: establishing local depots of spare parts, training individuals to maintain pumps, scheduling inspections from officials of the project, forming local committees and recruiting volunteers.

Much attention has been given to the benefits of the use of hand pumps in developing nations, as opposed to more traditional methods. In communities reliant on groundwater, through a borehole or well, the utilization of a bucket and rope system has hygienic issues. The bucket and rope system is not compatible with the use of a cover slab, which can prevent pollution of groundwater. In addition, unwashed hands can contaminate the bucket and rope. Hand pumps avoid these issues and are therefore preferable.&lt;ref name="wateraid.org"/&gt;

However, villagers did not stop using traditional means of gathering water during this project. This was especially true when rain provided villagers with shallow water sources. These shallow wells were often easier to access than the wells with hand pumps. When faced with the option of using near surface water or traveling to the hand pumps, many villagers chose the former.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition, animal contamination and the mixing of groundwater and surface water were factors in sub- par sanitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another issue that faced the project was the fact that the pumps could only provide a maximum of 20 liters of water per person day, which required an unrealistic staggering of water retrieval.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition, many depots withdrew support after the donated inventory ran out, the contracts given to consultants eventually closed, and maintenance was not kept up to a high standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A June 2008 study, conducted by the World Bank, Review of Effectiveness of Rural Water Supply Schemes in India, showed that approximately 45 percent of rural piped water projects focused on breakdown maintenance instead of scheduled maintenance. In addition, about 20% were reported to be in “serious or somewhat serious neglect of maintenance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Bank Group |url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:ckXd2b_LDmMJ:www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/23/000334955_20080723040732/Rendered/PDF/447930PP0P09411413B01PUBLIC10PAPER4.pdf+www-wds.worldbank.org/.../447930PP0P09411413B01PUBLIC10PAPER4.pdf&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a |title=World Bank Document |publisher=google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715212731/http://google.com/search?q=cache:ckXd2b_LDmMJ:www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/23/000334955_20080723040732/Rendered/PDF/447930PP0P09411413B01PUBLIC10PAPER4.pdf+www-wds.worldbank.org/.../447930PP0P09411413B01PUBLIC10PAPER4.pdf&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a |archivedate=15 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hand pump affordability in rural developing areas===
Whether or not a project to use hand pumps in a developing country is an affordable alternative certainly depends on who or what organization pays the bill. However, the example of a 1992 Ethiopia aid project illustrates what the cost would be for the locals who benefit from the project.&lt;ref name="handpump.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handpump.org/handpump_option_in_afrika/index.htm |title=Handpumps |publisher=Handpump.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910232435/http://www.handpump.org/handpump_option_in_afrika/index.htm |archivedate=10 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example relates to isolated, rural communities in the rural South.

165 Afridevs hand pumps were imported from India. Each cost approximately US$700, including clearing, transportation and installation. These pumps serve around 55 households each. At that time, the World Bank established that the average per capita income in Ethiopia was $120. A hand pump, first produced by researchers at the [[University of Waterloo]] and then refined at the University of Malaya, has been designed with local access to parts in mind. Materials readily available, like a rope covered in chicken fat or leather belt, can be used to ensure maintenance. GOAZ Development sells these pumps from $160 to $300. Therefore, 11% of one’s annual income would go towards accessing clean water. This is over twice as much as the 5% that the World Bank stated should be the maximum amount paid by a family.&lt;ref name="handpump.org"/&gt;

'''Harry M. Tiebout M.D. ''' (2 January 1896 – 2 April 1966) was an [[United States|American]] psychiatrist who promoted the [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] approach to the public, patients and fellow professionals. He served on the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous from 1957–1966 and was president of the National Council on Alcoholism from 1951-1953.&lt;ref name="Hazelden1999"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tiebout |first=Harry |title=Harry Tiebout: The Collected Writings |year=1999  |isbn=1-56838-345-2 |pages= vii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Harry Tiebout was raised in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He earned his bachelor's degree at [[Wesleyan University]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=36j09FX4Ho0C&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=%22Harry+Tiebout%22+and+%22wesleyan+university%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wVIttvfABe&amp;sig=pbji7QE62it_7MOqMPaN3s8iOXE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0remTI20G8H7lwfygLEX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Harry%20Tiebout%22%20and%20%22wesleyan%20university%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; then went  to  [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], where he also completed an internship with a specialization in psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Hazelden1999"/&gt; The psychiatry service at Hopkins was led by [[Adolph Meyer]], who had an eclectic approach in which [[Freudian]] theory was contributory but not dominant. [[John B. Watson]] was also at Hopkins during the time Tiebout was there, conducting research in [[behaviorism]] which would have substantial influence on the field of child development during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Pickren"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pickren |first=Wade |title=Evolving Perspectives in the History of Psychology |year=2002 |isbn=1-55787-882-X |pages=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical work==
Tiebout was on the staff of [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital]], Westchester Division from 1922-24. He then began work in child guidance clinics in New York City, joining the Institute for Child Guidance as staff psychiatrist shortly after it was founded in 1927.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton |first=John |title=Guidance Laboratory |journal=Teachers College Record |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was a well-funded center for training and research, dominated by psychoanalysis and specializing in "exhaustive case histories 75 pages long."&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers |first=Carl |title=A Way Of Being |pages=33–35|isbn=0-395-29915-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these years Tiebout was also on the staff of [[Cornell Medical School]] and the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]].&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;

In 1935 he became medical director of Blythewood Sanitarium in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. Privately owned, Blythewood was situated on a beautiful, rustic {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate once owned by [[Boss Tweed]]. At its peak, it had eight main buildings, eight cottages, a chapel, a building for occupational therapy, and a small golf course. There were no bars on the windows. Artistic and cultural pursuits were encouraged as part of the therapeutic program. Although the sanitarium was primarily for care of the mentally ill, it also provided care for alcoholics.&lt;ref name="Brown2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown |first=Sally |title=Mrs. Marty Mann:The First Lady of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=2001 |isbn=1-59285-307-2 |pages=97–99, p105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Tiebout received a pre-publication copy of the book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous''.  After looking it over, he gave it to one of his patients, [[Marty Mann]]. She had been at Blythewood for over a year but seemed no closer to conquering her alcohol problem than when she arrived, so he considered her a good test of whether the book had value. At first she read the book eagerly, delighted to know for the first time that there was a name (alcoholism) for what ailed her.  However, she was soon repelled by the overbearingly religious message and told Tiebout that she could never accept it. Tiebout, according to Mann's biographers Sally and David Brown, quietly encouraged her to keep reading. Eventually taking the book to heart, she had an epiphany during a crisis of resentment and fury and was converted.&lt;ref name="Brown2001"/&gt;

Other references, also based on Mann's recollections, portray Tiebout's role a little differently.  They describe an ongoing verbal battle lasting several months, in which Tiebout refused to accept Marty's rejection of the book.&lt;ref name="AAWS1984"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pass It On: The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached the world |year=1984 |isbn=0-916856-12-7 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hafner"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hafner |first=Sarah |title=Nice Girls Don't Drink: Stories of Recovery |year=1992 |pages= 222–223 |isbn=0-89789-247-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Mann did become an active member of AA and within a few years made education about alcoholism, and promotion of alcohol-abuse treatment, her second career. With Tiebout's support, she founded the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|National Council on Alcoholism]] (NCA).

Tiebout also became a friend and supporter of AA founder Bill Wilson, providing personal psychiatric care when Wilson developed depression in the 1940s. It was largely through Tiebout's influence that Bill Wilson was invited to speak at a New York state medical society meeting and then at a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, and had his talk published in the ''American Journal of Psychiatry.''&lt;ref name="White1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=White |first=William L. |title=Slaying the Dragon: The History of Addiction Treatment and Recovery in America |year=1998 |isbn=0-938475-07-X |pages=142, 178–187, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcoholism: Approach to the patient==
Tiebout had many years of training and experience in the management of alcohol problems before his first exposure to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, his earliest detailed article concerning  alcoholism&lt;ref name="Tiebout1944"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=H.M. |title=Therapeutic Mechanisms of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=1944 |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |pages=468–73| doi=10.1176/ajp.100.4.468}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1944, 5 years into his relationship with AA, and is primarily a description of AA itself. Over the next 10 years he published a number of articles outlining his theories about alcoholism, the psychodynamic causes of the disorder and his reasons for endorsing AA as the definitive solution.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1945"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry M. |title=The Syndrome of Alcohol Addiction |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |date=March 1945 |pages=533–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiebout1946"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry M. |title=Psychology and Treatment of Alcoholism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |date=September 1946 |pages=214–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiebout1947a"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tiebout |first=Harry M. |title="Alcoholism," in Social Work Yearbook |year=1947 |pages=45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiebout1947b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry M. |title=The Problem of Gaining Cooperation from the Alcoholic Patient |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |date=June 1947 |pages= 47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Clinebell|Howard J. Clinebell]], in a book for clergy on alcoholism counseling, recalled that Tiebout "likened the 'runaway symptom' of alcoholism to the dangerously high fever of pneumonia. The fever is a ''symptom'' of the underlying infection, but unless it can be lowered, the person may die of the 'symptom"."&lt;ref name="Clinebell"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clinebell |first=Howard |title=Understanding and Counseling the Alcoholic |year=1956  |lccn=68-11710 |pages=242, 59|isbn=0-687-42803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists, Tiebout felt, had been ineffectual because they ignored the deadly symptom in an attempt to treat a (theoretical) underlying disease. He credited AA with an ability to target the symptom directly. Tiebout's understanding of the alcoholic mind cannot be entirely separated from his understanding of the 12-step approach, but the primary themes in his writings can be summed up under several points.

===The alcoholic personality===
In one of his early papers&lt;ref name="Tiebout1945"/&gt; Tiebout discounted the idea, common among psychoanalytically-inclined doctors, that there was a classic type of pre-alcoholic personality. In his view all of the personality characteristics associated with early alcoholism were manifestations of the tension state accompanying intermittent alcohol binges. These features included:

# An unconscious need or drive to dominate
# A prevailing negative, hostile feeling-tone
# A capacity for ecstatic peaks
# A sense of loneliness and isolation
# Feelings of inferiority and superiority which exist simultaneously in the individual
# A striving for perfection

Howard Clinebell understood Tiebout to mean that there was, in fact, a pre-alcoholic personality but that "the distinctive factors have not yet been isolated".&lt;ref name="Clinebell"/&gt; In a 1947 lecture, Tiebout located the roots of alcoholism in poor parenting, either excessive strictness which caused the child to suffer "perpetual frustration and blocking of his desires and expectations," or over-indulgence. Either way, "Since the alcoholic's sense of self-discipline has not been developed at this point, his natural reaction is to reject all discipline. He now cannot face the realities of his existence. This would indicate that the whole point of treatment is to get the alcoholic to face and accept his limitations and capacities."&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse Herald Journal, 25 February 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

===The disease model===
The concept of alcoholism which dominated treatment approaches in the second half of the 20th century, and is still influential today, defined alcoholism as a [[disease theory of alcoholism|disease]]. The idea that alcohol problems constituted a disease was not new, but the particular synthesis associated initially with the [[Center of Alcohol Studies|Yale Center of Alcohol Studies]] (now at [[Rutgers]]) and the National Committee for Education on Alcoholism had unique features not found in earlier theories.&lt;ref name="White1998"/&gt; The NCEA was one of Marty Mann's projects, and thus influenced by Tiebout. A 1990 [[Hazelden]] pamphlet cites Tiebout, Dr. [[William Duncan Silkworth|William Silkworth]] and [[E. Morton Jellinek|E.M. Jellinek]] as formative influences.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller |first=Norman |title=The Disease Concept of Alcoholism and Other Drug Addiction |year=1990 |isbn=0-89486-691-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiebout seems to have been somewhat ambivalent about the disease model, however. In 1955, speaking of the scientific underpinnings of the alcoholism movement in general, he said "I cannot help but feel that the whole field of alcoholism is way out on a limb which any minute will crack and drop us all in a frightful mess."&lt;ref name="White1998"/&gt; He was consistent in his belief that the acceptance of alcoholism as a disease was essential, but this belief was partially pragmatic. In his experience, chronic alcoholics did not take the steps necessary to recover unless they became conscious of themselves as people with a disease.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1947b"/&gt; He emphasized a different aspect of the model in public lectures, however. Family members, friends and employers of alcoholics were encouraged to keep in mind that the condition was an illness and not a moral failing.

===Role of the ego===
In a 1954 article&lt;ref name="Tiebout1954"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry M. |title=Ego Factors in Surrender in Alcoholism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |date=December 1954 |pages= 610–621}} Reprinted in  ''Harry Teibout: The Collected Writings''&lt;/ref&gt; Tiebout introduced a definition of the term "ego" which was to become important in his later writings, particularly those for AA audiences. Although his use of the term was new, the concept behind it had been developed by Tiebout during the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1946"/&gt; In these early articles he was addressing a professional readership,  and use of the term might have created confusion between the psychoanalytic meaning of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and the colloquial "[[ego (spirituality)|ego]]" which was Tiebout's essential meaning.

Based on work with 250 alcoholics during his first 10 years at Blythewood, Tiebout developed the following conception of the alcoholic mind:

:In the normal individual there is  a tendency to  create some privacy for his inner life, for his motivations, reflections and emotions, so that they are not completely accessible to the environment. Normally this attempt interferes only slightly with the freedom of movement of outgoing and incoming stimuli and impulses. The boundary which the normal individual sets up between himself and the environment may be called a floating or diffuse boundary. In incipient alcoholism, however, it appears that the boundary is drawn somewhat tighter than is usual, and that with each stage of further development of the alcoholism more and more gaps are closed until the alcoholic seems to have erected what may be called a barrier which permits only a minimum of interplay between the inner self and the environment.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1946"/&gt;

Using examples from [[dream interpretation|dreams]] of patients he had [[psychoanalysis|analyzed]], Tiebout presented evidence for the existence of this rigid barrier. As long as the barrier remained, "As long as the self feels protected in a deep unconscious sense, it cannot be and is not disturbed by the warnings of reality, which characteristically roll like water off a duck's back."&lt;ref name="Tiebout1946"/&gt; For the analyst,

:Tactics are governed not only by strategy; they are also guided by three basic principles in technique. These are, briefly, that the patient must suffer or feel [[anxiety]] about himself and his condition; second, that it is the impersonal pressures of reality which activate suffering; and third, that it is the first and most immediate task of the psychiatrist to overcome the patient's refusal, unwillingness or inability to sense or feel these pressures of reality.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1946"/&gt;

In his 1954 article, 'The Ego Factors in Surrender in Alcoholism,'&lt;ref name="Tiebout1954"/&gt; Tiebout began using the term "ego" to describe this concept of a self barricaded by defenses. He related it to [[Freud]]'s "His Majesty the Baby" and to a similar concept introduced by Sandor Rado in 1933.&lt;ref name="Rado"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rado |first=Sandor |title='The Psychoanalysis of Pharmacothymia', reprinted in Essential Papers on Addiction |editor=Yalisove |isbn=0-8147-9672-9 |pages= 52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rado hypothesized that the elation induced by alcohol produced a reaction in the form of a "tense depression", which then reactivated the childish [[megalomania]] normally outgrown by adulthood. The result was a type of magical thinking in which "the ego secretly compares its current helplessness with its original narcissistic stature . . and aspires to leave its tribulations and regain its old magnitude."&lt;ref name="Rado"/&gt; Tiebout acknowledged his indebtedness to Rado's conception, while eliminating much of the psychoanalytic complexity of the original. He also felt that Rado was incorrect in advising only the "reduction" of the ego. Tiebout's view was that "reduction" represented a compromise and that there should be no compromise with the ego. The old ego should be eliminated entirely and replaced with a new one through "surrender".&lt;ref name="Tiebout1954"/&gt;

===Surrender and conversion===
The hallmark of Tiebout's work was his ability to explain [[12 step]] ideas in psychoanalytic terms. The primary source for the steps was a religious movement popularized by [[Frank Buchman]], with elements of the [[Higher Life movement]] tradition combined with the personal-evangelism techniques developed within the [[YMCA]] movement in the early 20th century. The [[Oxford Group]] had a successful program involving public and private meetings for witness and confession, as well as individual work. Their concept of "surrender" was the traditional Christian one, as a contemporary observer noted:

:Surrender means the complete surrender of the will to Christ. They make no claim that this is easy. It may mean an entire change in one's whole life plan. It has meant just that for many of the Groupers. But it is necessary. So long as there are reserved areas in a man's life, they assert, he cannot expect to enter into a wholly satisfying experience of God.&lt;ref name="Braden"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Braden |first=Charles |title=These Also Believe |year=1949 |page=417|isbn=0-02-514360-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[religious conversion|Conversion]], [[Surrender (spirituality and psychology)|surrender]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[restitution (theology)|restitution]] and the necessity of evangelizing others were ideas brought from the Oxford Group to Alcoholics Anonymous by members who had found that the intense religious devotion they inspired was the key to a changed life. Tiebout understood the concepts in a more secular way, and approved of them.&lt;ref name="Tiebout1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiebout1949"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry |title=The Act of Surrender in the Therapeutic Process, with Special Reference to Alcoholism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |year=1949 |pages=48–58}} Reprinted in ''Harry Tiebout: The Collected Writings''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiebout1953"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout |first=Harry |title=Surrender versus Compliance in Therapy, with Special Reference to Alcoholism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |year=1953 |pages=58–68}} Reprinted in ''Harry Tiebout: The Collected Writings''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiebout had found that superficial [[compliance (medicine)|compliance]] in therapy often correlated with lack of real change, and he saw in the AA concept of surrender an antidote to this phenomenon. An act of surrender was the only cure, or practically the only one, to the problem of "compliance", or partial surrender to the psychiatrist's authority and the authority of the [[reality principle]]. Tiebout described true surrender as "an unconscious event, not willed by the patient even if he or she should desire to do so. It can occur only when an individual with certain traits in his or her [[subconscious|unconscious]] mind becomes involved in a certain set of circumstances,"  essentially the circumstances of "hitting bottom".&lt;ref name="Tiebout1949"/&gt;

Conversion, for Tiebout, was a spiritual awakening made possible by the person's recognition of his own egocentricity. The central effect of Alcoholics Anonymous was "to develop in the person a spiritual state which will serve as a direct neutralizing force upon the [[egocentric]] elements in the character of the alcoholic." A "vague, groping, skeptical intellectual belief" would not accomplish this but only a true emotional religious feeling, for "unless the individual attains in the course of time a sense of the reality and the nearness of a Greater Power, his egocentric nature will reassert itself with undiminished intensity, and drinking will again enter into the picture."&lt;ref name="Tiebout1944"/&gt;

==Later life==
Tiebout retired as medical director of Blythewood in 1950. The sanitarium was gradually changing into a long-term care facility for the elderly, with fewer psychiatric patients. He continued to see patients privately and kept up an active speaking schedule, as well as serving on the boards of  various alcohol-related organizations. He died in Greenwich in 1966 of cardiac causes. He was the husband of the former Ethel Mills and father of Harry Tiebout, Jr., a philosophy professor; [[Charles Tiebout]], an economics professor; and Sarah T. Worn.

'''Hyperandrogenism''', also known as '''androgen excess''', is a [[medical condition]] characterized by excessive levels of [[androgen]]s (male sex hormones such as testosterone) in the female body and the associated effects of the elevated androgen levels. It is an [[endocrine disease|endocrinological]] disorder similar to [[hyperestrogenism]].

The most common conditions associated with hyperandrogenism are [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] or PCOS, a set of symptoms caused by androgen excess in females, and various cancers that can cause androgen excess. In females, the conditions usually present are some combination of [[acne]], [[seborrhea]] (inflamed skin), hair loss on the scalp, increased body and/or facial hair ([[hirsutism]]), and an elevated sex drive or [[libido]]. The symptoms of hyperandrogenism are usually most effectively treated with [[antiandrogens]]. There is some controversy over whether hyperandrogenism provides an unfair advantage in athletics.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:CushingsBody.jpg|thumb|254x254px|A person with [[hirsutism]] from increased androgen exposure]]

Due to the fact that hyperandrogenism is characterized by the elevation of male sex hormone levels, symptoms of hyperandrogenism in men are often negligible. Hyperandrogenism in females is typically diagnosed in late [[adolescence]] with a medical evaluation. The medical evaluation tends to consist of a [[pelvic]] exam, observation of external symptoms, and a blood test measuring androgen levels.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American association of clinical endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperandrogenic disorders|last=Goodman |first=Neil|publisher=|date=March 2001|isbn=|location=|pages=121|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

Hyperandrogenism, especially high levels of testosterone, can cause serious adverse effects on women's bodies if left untreated.  High [[testosterone]] levels have been seen to be associated with [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[Amenorrhoea|amenorrhea]] (cessation of menstrual cycles), and ovulatory dysfunction, which can lead to [[infertility]]. The more prominent signs of hyperandrogenism are [[hirsutism]] (unwanted growth of hair especially in the abdominal region and places on the back), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] after adolescence, deepening of voice, and [[Hair loss|alopecia]] (balding).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthywomen.org/condition/androgen|title=Androgen|last=Simon|first=James|date=22 June 2015|website=Health Women|publisher=National Women's Health Resource Center|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperandrogenism has also been seen to cause individuals to have a high tolerance to [[insulin]], which can lead to [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type two diabetes]], and [[dyslipidemia]], such as [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]]. These effects have also been seen to have a large psychological impact on the individual, sometimes often leading to societal [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], especially in adolescent girls and young women. Paired with [[obesity]] and [[hirsutism]], it can cause the individual to have low self-esteem, and a poor view of oneself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jc.2003-031737|title=Effect of the Insulin Sensitizer Pioglitazone on Insulin Resistance, Hyperandrogenism, and Ovulatory Dysfunction in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|last=Brettenthaler|first=Nora|last2=De Geyter|first2=Christian|date=21 April 2004|publication-date=28 April 2011|access-date=2016-11-14|last3=R.

===Men===

Even though hyperandrogenism is not common in men, there have been studies done to look at the effects of high levels of testosterone in male bodies. A study has shown that even though many of the male participants did not have behavior changes{{clarify|"have a behavior changes"?|date=April 2017}} due to the increased levels of [[testosterone]], there were cases where the participants had instances of uncharacteristic aggression. High levels of testosterone in males have not been seen to have a direct impact on their personality, but within those studies, there have been cases of sudden [[aggression]] within the male participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/481565|title=Effects of Supraphysiologic Doses of Testosterone on Mood and Aggression in Normal Men|last=G.

== Causes ==

While hyperandrogenism in women is caused by external factors, it can also appear from natural causes.

=== Polycystic ovary syndrome ===
[[File:Echographie pelvienne, aplio toshiba ssa 700 5 2004 03 detail.jpg|thumb|182x182px|Ultrasound of a polycystic ovary]]
[[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder characterized by an excess of androgens produced by the [[ovaries]]. It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of women with PCOS demonstrate hypersecretion of these hormones.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A concrete cause for this condition is currently unknown. Speculations include [[genetic predisposition]], although the gene or genes in particular have yet to be identified.&lt;ref&gt;"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)." Causes. Mayo Clinic, n.d. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the condition may have a [[hereditary]] basis. Other possible causes include the effects from an increase in [[insulin]] production. Insulin itself has been observed capable of inducing excess testosterone levels in the [[ovaries]].&lt;ref&gt;"Defining PCOS." - The University of Chicago Medicine. The University of Chicago Medical Center, n.d. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elevated insulin concentration in the body leads to lower production of [[Sex hormone binding globulin|sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)]], a regulatory [[glycoprotein]] that suppresses the function of androgens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hammond GL, Bocchinfuso WP | year = 1996 | title = Sex hormone-binding globulin: gene organization and structure/function analyses | url = | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 45 | issue = 3–5| pages = 197–201 | doi=10.1159/000184787 | pmid=8964583}}&lt;/ref&gt; High blood levels of insulin also work in conjunction with ovarian sensitivity to insulin to cause hyperandrogenemia, the primary symptom of PCOS. Obese individuals may be more biologically inclined to display PCOS due to markedly higher amounts of insulin in their bodies. This hormonal imbalance can lead to chronic [[anovulation]], in which the ovaries experience difficulty releasing mature eggs. These cases of ovulatory dysfunction are [[Infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome|linked to infertility]] and to menstrual disturbances.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Franks, Stephen. "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome — NEJM." New England Journal of Medicine. N Engl J Med, 28 September 1995. Web. 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burd, Irina, David Zieve, and Isla Ogilvie.

===Hyperthecosis and hyperinsulinemia===

[[Hyperthecosis]] occurs when the cells of the ovarian stroma transition from [[interstitial cell]]s, which are cells located in between other cells, into luteinized [[theca cells]]. Theca cells are located in the [[ovarian follicle]]s and become luteinized when the ovarian follicle breaks and a new [[corpus luteum]] is formed. The dispersal of luteinized theca cells throughout the ovarian stroma, in contrast to PCOS where the luteinized theca cells are only around cystic follicles, causes women with hyperthecosis to have higher [[testosterone]] levels and male-attributed characteristics ([[virilization]]) than women with PCOS. Excess levels of [[insulin]] in the blood, known as [[hyperinsulinemia]], is also a characteristic of hyperthecosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/739208_10|title=Research in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Today and Tomorrow|last=Pasquali|first=Renato|date=April 2011|website=Medscape|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperthecosis is mostly seen in [[Menopause|postmenopausal]] women and is linked to acne, [[hirsutism]], growth of the clitoris, baldness, and voice deepening.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atmaca|first=Murat|date=16 December 2014|title=An Interesting Cause of Hyperandrogenemic Hirsutism|journal=Case Reports in Endocrinology|volume=2014|pmc=4280803|pmid=25580312|doi=10.1155/2014/987272|pages=987272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low levels of insulin can also lead to hyperandrogenism. When the body's insulin levels drop too low, it can force itself to produce too much in an effort to make up for the loss. The result of such an overproduction is a disorder called hyperinsulinemia. An effect of hyperinsulinemia is the body's increased production of androgens in the ovaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbieri|last2=Hornstein MD|title="Hyperinsulinemia and Ovarian Hyperandrogenism. Cause and Effect."|journal=Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America|volume=17.4|pages=685–703}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is all part of [[HAIR-AN syndrome]], a multisystem disorder that involves increased insulin levels that prompt increased androgen levels.&lt;ref&gt;James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

===Cushing’s syndrome===

[[Cushing's syndrome|Cushing syndrome]] develops due to long-term exposure to the hormone [[cortisol]]. Cushing's syndrome can either be exogenous or endogenous, depending on whether it is caused by an external or internal source, respectively. The intake of [[glucocorticoid]]s, which are a type of [[steroid]] hormone, is a common cause for the development of exogenous Cushing's syndrome. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome can occur when the body produces excessive amounts of cortisol. This occurs when the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain transmits [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) to the [[pituitary gland]], which in turn secretes [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotropin hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol into the blood. Signs of Cushing's syndrome include muscle weakness, easy bruising, weight gain, male-pattern hair growth ([[hirsutism]]), colored stretch marks, and an excessively reddish complexion in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/cushings-syndrome/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx|title=Cushing's Syndrome|date=April 2012|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing's syndrome has been shown to cause [[androgen]] excess, which directly links it to the signs and symptoms seen in hyperandrogenism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Congenital adrenal hyperplasia===

[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia]] consists of a group of [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] disorders that cause a lack of an [[enzyme]] needed for producing cortisol and/or [[aldosterone]], both of which are steroid hormones. Most cases of CAH are due to [[21-Hydroxylase|21-hydroxylase]] deficiencies, an enzyme used by the body to produce cortisol and aldosterone. In females, CAH causes uncertainty in the genitals at birth and later on in adolescence excessive pubic hair, enlargement of the clitoris, hirsutism, and rapid growth of the body. Symptoms in males include early showings of pubic hair, enlargement of the penis, and rapid body and skeletal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/919218-overview|title=Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2016|website=Medscape|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tumors  ===

==== Adrenocortical carcinoma and  tumors ====
A highly uncommon disease with incidence of 1–2 per million annually. This disease causes [[cancer]]ous cells to form in the [[Adrenal cortex|cortex]] of one or both of the [[adrenal glands]]. Adrenocortical tumors produce an additional number of hormones, often leading patients with steroid hormone-producing tumors to develop [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Primary aldosteronism|Conn syndrome]] and Hyperandrogenism.&lt;ref&gt;"Adrenocortical Carcinoma." National Cancer Institute. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== Adenoma of the adrenal gland ====
Adrenal Adenomas are benign tumors on the [[adrenal gland]]. In most cases the tumors display no symptoms and require no treatment. In rare cases, however, some Adrenal Adenomas may become activated, in that they begin to produce hormones in much larger quantities than what adrenal glands tend to produce leading to a number of health complications including [[Primary aldosteronism]] and Hyperandrogenism.&lt;ref&gt;"Adenoma of the Adrenal Gland | Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center(GARD) – an NCATS Program." U.S National Library of Medicine. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arrhenoblastoma ====

An [[arrhenoblastoma]] is an uncommon tumor of the ovary.  It is often composed of sterol cells, leydig cells or some combination of the two. The tumor can produce male or female hormones in the patient and may cause masculinization. In a prepubescent child, a tumor may cause precocious puberty. Malignant Arrhenoblastoma accounts for 30% of all cases of Arrhenoblastoma, the other 70% being largely benign and curable with surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Elizabeth. Arrhenoblastoma N. Arrhenoblastoma. n.p.: Oxford University Press, 2015. Oxford Reference. Web. 10 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hilar cell tumor ====

An ovarian, Androgen producing tumor afflicting older women in most cases and often leading to the development of [[virilization]]. This tumor tends to occur around the region of the ovary where the blood vessels enter the organ otherwise known as the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]]. This type of tumor tends to be rather small in size and in most cases could be entirely removed and its symptoms reversed through surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Elizabeth. "hilar cell tumour." Concise Medical Dictionary. : Oxford University Press, 2015. Oxford Reference. 2015. Date Accessed 10 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Krukenberg tumor ====

A quickly developing malignant tumor that is normally found in one of or both ovaries. The tumor is caused by the transcoelomic spread. It primarily grows in the stomach and intestinal regions.&lt;ref&gt;Uyeturk, Ummugul, Serife Hulya Arslan, Oznur Bal, Ulku Yalcintas Arslan, and Omur Berna Cakmak Oksuzoglu. "Isolated Ovarian Metastasis of Gastric Cancer: Krukenberg Tumor." Contemporary Oncology. Termedia Publishing House, 19 December 2013. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menopause ===
One such cause is the end of [[ovulation]] and the beginning of [[menopause]]. When the body transitions from ovulation to menopause, it stops releasing estrogen at faster rate than it stops releasing androgens. In some cases, estrogen levels can drop enough that there are substantially higher androgen levels leading to hyperandrogenism. A decrease in sex hormone levels while the free androgen index increases helps to aid this process, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=R. H. Fogle, F. Z. Stanczyk, X. Zhang, and R. J. Paulson, "Ovarian androgen production in postmenopausal women"|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume= 92| issue =  8, pp. 3040– 3043, 2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug-induced hyperandrogenism ===
Symptoms generally considered hyperandrogenic can also manifest as results of consuming certain drugs. This can happen according to one of five major mechanisms, namely the direct introduction of androgens to the body, the binding of the drug to androgen receptors and subsequent participation in androgenic action (as is the case with anabolic-androgenic steroids), the reduction of sex hormone-binding globulin plasma concentration that leads to a resulting increase in free testosterone, the interference with and alteration of the [[HPO axis|hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian]] (HPO) axis, or the increase in release of adrenal androgens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Endocrinology: Androgen Excess Disorders in Women: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Other Disorders, Second Edition|last=Neraud|first=Barbara|last2=Dewailly|first2=Didier|publisher=Edited by: R. Azziz et al. © Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heredity ===
Because hyperandrogenism can appear as a symptom of numerous different genetic and medical conditions, it is difficult to make a general statement on whether hyperandrogenic symptoms can be passed from parent to offspring. However, a collection of the conditions with hyperandrogenic symptoms, including polycystic ovary syndrome, have been observed as hereditary in certain cases. One potential cause of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] is maternal hyperandrogenism, where the hormonal irregularities of the mother can affect the development of the child during gestation, resulting in the passing of polycystic ovary syndrome from mother to child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Puttabyatappa Muraly, Cardoso Rodolfo C., Padmanabhan Vasantha. In Special issue: Impact of maternal metabolism on newborn health|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|date=5 November 2016 |volume=435|pages=29–39|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2015.11.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Female patients may show symptoms of hyperandrogenism in their early life, but physicians become more concerned when the patient is in her late teens or older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hyperandrogenism is most often diagnosed by checking for signs of [[hirsutism]] according to a standardized method that scores the range of excess hair growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Checking medical history and a physical examination of symptoms are used for an initial diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patient history assessed includes age at [[thelarche]], [[adrenarche]], and [[menarche]]; patterns of [[menstruation]]; [[obesity]]; reproductive history; and the start and advancement of hyperandrogenism symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patterns of [[menstruation]] are examined since irregular patterns may appear with [[hirsutism]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Family history is also assessed for occurrences of hyperandrogenism symptoms or [[obesity]] in other family members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A laboratory test can also be done on the patient to evaluate levels of [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], [[luteinizing hormone|LH]], [[DHEAS]], [[prolactin]], [[17OHP]], and total and free [[testosterone]] in the patient's blood.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Abnormally high levels of any of these hormones help in diagnosing hyperandrogenism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Since risk factors are not known and vary among individuals with hyperandrogenism, there is no sure method to prevent this medical condition.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Therefore, more longterm studies are needed first to find a cause for the condition before being able to find a sufficient method of prevention.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Apter D | year = 1998 | title = How Possible Is The Prevention Of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Development In Adolescent Patients With Early Onset Of Hyperandrogenism | url = | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]] | volume = 21 | issue = 9| pages = 613–617 | doi=10.1007/bf03350786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are a few things that can help avoid long-term medical issues related to hyperandrogenism like [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS]]. Getting checked by a medical professional for hyperandrogenism; especially if one has a family history of the condition, irregular periods, or [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]; can be beneficial.&lt;ref name="pmid23642453"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nader S |title=Hyperandrogenism during puberty in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=39–42 |year=2013 |pmid=23642453 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.013 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching your weight and diet is also important in decreasing your chances, especially in obese females, since continued exercise and maintaining a healthy diet leads to an improved menstrual cycle as well as to decreased insulin levels and androgen concentrations.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Treatment==

Treatment of hyperandrogenism varies with the underlying condition that causes it. As a hormonal symptom of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], [[menopause]], and other endocrine disorders, it is primarily treated as a symptom of these disorders. Systemically, it is treated with [[antiandrogens]] such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]] and [[spironolactone]] to control the androgen levels in the patient's body. For Hyperandrogenism caused by [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)]], treatment is primarily focused on providing the patient with Glucocorticoids to combat the low cortisol production and the corresponding increase in androgens caused by the swelling of the Adrenal Glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hughes I. A. | year = 1988 | title = Management of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia | url = | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1399–1404 | doi=10.1136/adc.63.11.1399| pmc = 1779155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Merke D., Bornstein S.

These hormonal treatments have been found to reduce the androgen excess and suppress adrenal androgen production and cause a significant decrease in hirsutism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burkman R.T. Jr | year = 1995 | title = The Role of Oral Contraceptives in the Treatment of Hyperandrogenic Disorders | url = | journal = Am J Med | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 130S–136S | doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(99)80071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=George Mastorakos |author2=Carolina Koliopoulos |author3=George Creatsas | year = 2002 | title = Androgen and lipid profiles in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome who were treated with two forms of combined oral contraceptives | url = | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 77 | issue = 5| pages = 919–927 | doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(02)02993-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperandrogenism is often managed symptomatically. [[Hirsutism]] and [[acne]] both respond well to the hormonal treatments described above, with 60-100% reporting an improvement in hirsutism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Androgenic alopecia]] however, does not show a significant improvement with hormonal treatments and requires other treatments, such as [[hair transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinclair R, Wewerinke M, Jolley D | date = Mar 2005 | title = Treatment of female pattern hair loss with oral antiandrogens | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 152 | issue = 3| pages = 466–73 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06218.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and society ==
Because androgen excess is manifested in noticeable physical features (ex. [[hirsutism]]), a certain social stigma is associated with it. In the athletic world, multiple cases of female athletes being banned for their testosterone levels being too high have been recorded. Such social and cultural redefinitions of hyperandrogenism are important to consider outside of the clinical usage.

[[File:Caster Semenya 2010 Memorial Van Damme.jpg|thumb|Caster Semenya, a female athlete displaying the condition hyperandrogenism.]]
Following the case of South African athlete [[Caster Semenya]], the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) introduced a now suspended policy to exclude women athletes from competing as women if they have hyperandrogenism, on the ground that the condition could confer an unfair advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=94015|title=STANDARD OPERATIVE PROCEDURE  to identify Circumstances (Female Hyperandrogenism) in Which A Particular Sports Person will not be eligible to participate in Competitions in the Female Category|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2013/mar/d2013032001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The rules state that women may compete in the male category if their performance qualifies.&lt;ref name="ioc2015"&gt;{{Citation| last = International Olympic Committee| title = IOC Consensus Meeting on Sex Reassignment and Hyperandrogenism | date = November 2015| url = http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAAF states that testosterone is linked to [[lean body mass]](LBM), so it influences athletes' strength, speed and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/rio-olympics-caster-semenya-how-does-testosterone-affect-athletic-performance|title=The biggest issue in women’s sports is about to come to a head|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study of endocrine profiles in 693 elite athletes published in 2014 found that 13.7% of women athletes had high levels of testosterone, and 16.5% of men had low levels of testosterone levels.

=== Social definition ===
Cultural variation can define hyperandrogenism socially—aside from clinical and chemical definitions—to make some hair growth unacceptable even if it is considered clinically normal based on metrics like the [[Ferriman–Gallwey score|Ferriman-Gallwey score]]. For example, only pubic and axillary hair in North American women is tolerated, while other androgen-dependent hair such as growth on the upper lip, over the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]], over the thighs, and any periareolar hair is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8hcC17D154C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22hyperandrogenism%22+cultural+-sports&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7En5nj7_X&amp;sig=l51flIYb_Kb0CTenJTgaQbPXp0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi40aDugZrQAhVJjFQKHYRxBBMQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hyperandrogenism%22%20cultural%20-sports&amp;f=false|title=Adolescent Gynecology (pb)|last=Krishna|last2=R|first2=Usha|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125017936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndromes are a spectrum of diseases characteriezed by slowly progressive abnormalities of the corneal endothelium and features including corneal edema, iris distortion, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. [1,2,4] ICE syndromes are predominantly unilateral and nonhereditary  [1,2,4]. The condition occurs in predominantly middle-aged women [1,3,4].

== Signs and Symptoms == 
Many cases are asymptomatic, however patients many have decreased vision, glare, monocular diplopia or polyopia, and noticeable iris changes [2,6]. On exam patients have normal to decreased visual acuity, and a “beaten metal appearance” of the corneal endothelium, corneal edema, increased intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae, and iris changes [1,2,6].

== Mechanism ==
The exact mechanism is unknown, however there appears to be a component of abnormal corneal endothelium that proliferates onto the iris forming a membrane that then obstructs the trabecular meshwork, leading to iris distortion [1,2]. Nodule formation can also occur when the abnormal corneal endothelium causes contractions around the iris stroma [1]. Herpesvirus DNA has been identified in some patients following keratoplasty, suggesting the possibility that herpes simplex virus may induce the abnormal endotheliazation in the anterior chamber angle and on the surface of the iris [2,3,5].

=== Variations ===
The Chandler variant of ICE is characterized by pathology on the inner surface of the cornea leading to abnormal endothelial pump function [2,6]. Other features include possible mild iris changes, corneal edema, and normal to slight elevations in intraocular pressure [1,6].

Cogan-Reese variant is characterized by multiple pigmented iris nodules [2,6]. This variant is most commonly unilateral and seen in middle-aged females [2].

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=September 2017}}

== Treatment ==
Penetrating karatoplasty and endothelial keratoplasty can be used as treatments for severe cases of ICE [2,8]. Because glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure are often present in ICE patients, long term follow up may be needed to ensure adequate intraocular pressures are maintained [2,7]

== Prognosis ==
The disease is chronic and often progresses slowly. Prognosis is generally poor when associated with glaucoma [1,2].

The '''Jatigede Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Cimanuk River]] in [[Sumedang Regency]], [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]]. It is located {{Convert|19|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of the town of [[Sumedang]]. Construction on the dam began in 2008 and it was completed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLTA Jatigede will Finish by 2014|url=http://www.esdm.go.id/index-en/83-energy/5306-plta-jatigede-will-finish-by-2014.html|publisher=Department of Energy, Indonesia|accessdate=20 January 2012|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station is expected to be commissioned in 2019. The primary purpose of the dam is irrigation but it will also provide for flood control, water supply and [[hydroelectric]] power generation. Water in the reservoir will be used to help irrigate {{Convert|90000|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} of farmland and the power station is expected to have a 110 MW capacity. The project has been become controversial, primarily due to the relocation of people in the future reservoir zone.&lt;ref&gt;Arya Dipa, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/01/24/jokowi-s-social-impact-policy-jatigede-dam-rejected.html Jokowi's social impact policy on Jatigede dam rejected'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 24 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The dam was first proposed in 1963 after a study of the Cimanuk was carried out by [[Coyne et Bellier]]. Further planning and designs commenced thereafter. An [[environmental impact assessment]] was completed in 1986 and land acquisition study in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jatigede dam campaign gains momentum|url=http://www.downtoearth-indonesia.org/story/jatigede-dam-campaign-gains-momentum|publisher=Down to Earth|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After decades of planning and protests, the Indonesian Government announced firm plans to proceed with the dam in 2004.&lt;ref name=Jakarta&gt;{{cite web|title=INDONESIA: Government to go ahead with Jatigede dam project|url=http://www.waterconserve.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=34154&amp;keybold=water%20AND%20%20forum%20AND%20%20protest|publisher=Jakarta Post (via Water Conserve)|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=9 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been surrounded with controversy over the years, particularly as its reservoir would flood {{Convert|4896|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} of land. This includes five districts and 30 villages which include approximately 70,000 people to be relocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction of Jatigede Dam|url=http://www.sumedangkab.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=104&amp;Itemid=60|publisher=Government of Sumedang District|accessdate=20 January 2012|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected residents claim that compensation for their land is too low and that the government intimidated them to accept offers in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residents lose court battle over Jatigede dam project |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2007/07/26/residents-lose-court-battle-over-jatigede-dam-project.html-0 |publisher=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=20 January 2012 |date=26 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127054535/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2007/07/26/residents-lose-court-battle-over-jatigede-dam-project.html-0 |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a 2011 study by Indonesia's Ministry of Public Works estimated that the reservoir would become ineffective in 50 years due to high [[sedimentation]] of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Sedimentation Threatens Jatigede Reservoir |url=http://www.indii.co.id/news_daily_detail.php?id=1225 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023324/http://www.indii.co.id/news_daily_detail.php?id=1225 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 August 2012 |publisher=Investor Daily (via Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative) |accessdate=20 January 2012 |date=5 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy, the government stated in 2004 that an agreement had been reached.&lt;ref name=Jakarta/&gt; The contract to build the dam and power plant was awarded to China's [[Sinohydro Corporation]] in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese firm signed to build Indonesia's 110-MW Jatigede|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display/articles/hrhrw/News/Chinese_firm_signed_to_build_Indonesias_110-MW_Jatigede.html|publisher=Hydro World|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the dam's diversion tunnel began in October 2008 and was completed in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jatigede Dam Tunnel Complete |url=http://www.bumn.go.id/waskita/publikasi/terowongan-di-bendungan-jatigede-selesai/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722050721/http://www.bumn.go.id/waskita/publikasi/terowongan-di-bendungan-jatigede-selesai/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |publisher=TV One |accessdate=20 January 2012 |date=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government announced in late 2011 that that dam was 60% complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jatigede Dam Construction 60 Percent Completed |url=http://emu.co.id/news_daily_detail.php?id=1767 |publisher=Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative |accessdate=20 January 2012 |date=4 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221161818/http://emu.co.id/news_daily_detail.php?id=1767 |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, it was announced that [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] would oversee the construction and operation of the 110 MW power plant.&lt;ref name=ppower&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Year, PLN will be Ready to Develop PLTA Jatigede and Merangin|url=http://www.esdm.go.id/news-archives/electricity/46-electricity/4699-next-year-pln-will-be-ready-to-develop-plta-jatigede-and-merangin.html|publisher=Department of Energy, Indonesia|accessdate=20 January 2012|language=Indonesian|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam and power plant is expected to cost US$224 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLN ready to build Jatigede hydro power plant|url=http://cempaka-sam.blogspot.com/2011/12/pln-ready-to-build-jatigede-hydro-power.html|publisher=Antara News|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 the government announced that the total cost would be around $400 million and that the dam was 70% complete.&lt;ref&gt;Nurfika Osman, 'Jatigede Dam to be operational by 2014', ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the dam was expected to start impounding its reservoir in early 2015.

In December 2014, a contract was signed with [[Sinohydro]] to construct the power station. It should be operational in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pembangunan PLTA Jati Gede Mulai Januari 2015|url=http://www.jpnn.com/read/2014/12/20/276713/Pembangunan-PLTA-Jati-Gede-Mulai-Januari-2015-|accessdate=7 January 2015|date=20 December 2014|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August 2015, the dam began to impound its reservoir, 30 days behind the most recent schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt Starts Flooding Jatigede Dam|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/govt-starts-flooding-jatigede-dam/|agency=Investor Daily|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Jatigede Dam will be a {{Convert|110|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|1715|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long rock-fill embankment dam. Its crest will be {{Convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide and the body will contain {{Convert|6700000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of fill. The dam's [[spillway]] will be a chute-type on the center of the downstream face. It will be controlled by four [[radial gate]]s and have a discharge capacity of {{Convert|4468|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}}. The irrigation intake will be located below the spillway. The dam will withhold a reservoir with a {{Convert|980000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}} storage capacity of which {{Convert|877000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}} is active (or 'usable') for water supply and power generation. The reservoir's [[drainage basin|catchment area]] encompasses {{Convert|1462|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} while the man-made lake will have a surface area of {{Convert|41.22|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. The dam's crest elevation will be {{Convert|265|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the normal reservoir elevation {{Convert|260|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The intake for the power plant will be on the right abutment and will place water into a {{Convert|3050|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long head-race tunnel before reaching the power plant downstream. The power plant will contain two 55 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators (total capacity 110 MW) with a design [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|170|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Debby/&gt;

The '''John Dau Foundation''' (JDF), also known as '''John Dau Sudan Foundation''' (JDSF)&lt;ref&gt;https://hme-business.com/articles/2009/03/13/sequal-donates-pocs-to-sudan-clinic.aspx?admgarea=oxygen&lt;/ref&gt; is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that was established in July 2007 to develop health facilities that currently do not exist for most of the populations of Duk, Twic East and Bor South Counties in the State of Jonglei in [[South Sudan]]. Its mission is to "transform healthcare in South Sudan." Currently, the organization’s primary focus is on funding and overseeing the Duk Lost Boys Clinic. The Duk Lost Boys Clinic specializes in the treatment of diseases such as [[guinea worm disease]], [[malaria]], [[chicken pox]], [[diarrhea]], [[malnourishment]], [[bilharzia]]s, [[h-worm]], [[kalazar]]; the immunization of other diseases; and the provision of maternity services. The Foundation is headquartered in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="John Dau Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.johndaufoundation.org |title = John Dau Foundation  |publisher=John Dau Foundation Website| accessdate = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Dau==
[[John Dau]] also known as Dhieu Deng Leek is the founder and president of the John Dau Foundation. Dau is a survivor of the civil war in South Sudan and part of the exodus of the [[Lost Boys of Sudan]] who were forced to flee their families and homeland.&lt;ref name="John Dau Foundation" /&gt; Dau was featured in the award-winning documentary ''[[God Grew Tired of Us]]'' in 2006 which won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the 2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news  |url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/movies/12tire.html?scp=3&amp;sq=john+dau&amp;st=nyt| title = After a Struggle to Escape Comes an Effort to Adjust  |work = The New York Times |accessdate = 2007-01-12| author=Stephen Holden| date=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The John Dau Foundation is governed by a ten-member Board of Directors that is headed by [[Bill Coplin]], Director of the Public Affairs Department at [[Syracuse University]]. The organization’s Board of Advisors is made up of 15 members and includes [[Lopez Lomong]], the Sudanese-born track and field athlete who carried the U.S. flag in the Opening Ceremony of the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]]. He announced his support for JDF in September 2008 and shortly thereafter became a member of the organization’s Board of Advisors.&lt;ref name="John Dau Foundation" /&gt;

== Ties to the government of South Sudan ==
John Dau has strong ties to local governmental officials in South Sudan. His uncle, Philip Thon Leek, who was a governor of the State of Jongeli and is now a Minister of Transport in the Government of National Unity, has been instrumental in providing contacts and support from the natives, Tribal Chiefs and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movements and its Health Ministry. The Foundation has received a commitment from the local government to provide support by the end of 2009 for the existing clinic. Although there is no guarantee that this will happen due to the government of South Sudan's financial constraint, it represents a viable strategy that will require less outside support to sustain what has been developed.&lt;ref name="John Dau Foundation" /&gt;

== American Care for Sudan Foundation ==
In June 2008, the American Care for Sudan Foundation (ACSF) announced that it would merge with JDF as its operational wing. ACSF was formed initially under the leadership of John Dau and the dedication and hard work of a group of members of the First Presbyterian Church of Skaneateles to build the [[Duk Lost Boys Clinic]] in Duk Payuel, South Sudan in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  |url = http://oldsite.johndaufoundation.org/About_Us/pressreleases.htm |title = Press Release: The John Dau Sudan Foundation merges with the American Care for Sudan Foundation  |accessdate = 2008|publisher=John Dau Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''MDA''''' is an Australian television series that aired between 2002 and 2005 on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)]]. It concerned the day-to-day operation of legal firm MDA, which specialised in medical defence.

==Synopsis==
The title refers to the firm Medical Defence Australia, a team of lawyers and doctors who defend doctors charged with [[malpractice]], ranging from [[Botox]] injections gone wrong to [[spinal cord]] injuries. The firm operates by collecting annual subscriptions from doctors, rather than on a case-by-case fee basis.

The main characters in the [[pilot episode]] included Dr. Louella "Ella" Davis, the moral centre of the firm whose passion lies equally distributed between her work at St Albans Hospital Emergency Ward, and defending doctors; "Happy" Henderson, a lawyer whose nickname can be greatly misleading; Dr. Jamie Lawless, an optimistic young doctor whose passion for helping others often leads him to inner conflict; Caitlin King, the new law recruit at MDA whose ambitions far exceed what she can do at the firm; Layla Young of the [[Bahá'í Faith in fiction#Popular media|Bahá'í faith]], the friendly receptionist; Dr. Tony McKinnon, a doctor who works with Ella at the hospital; and Richard Savage - the cut-throat plaintiff's advocate who often does battles with MDA.

''MDA'' premiered in 2002 during a downturn in the making of Australian television. Despite critical acclaim and a number of awards, initially no renewal was made after the second season (2003). A year later, the ABC ordered another 12 episodes for 2005, but by this time several key actors had moved on. More multi-episode story arcs were used and critical response was lukewarm. Although sentiment eventually warmed, the series was not renewed after the third season.

===Season 1===
In the opening episodes, Ella faced personal problems when her lover Nick wished to move out of the country, and she often discussed these with her sister Edwina, but those characters quickly faded into the background. Edwina did return, for one episode, in the second season.

The first episodes did not draw impressive ratings, and the critics were ambivalent, but by the eighth episode – "Bowels, Bosch and the Whole Damn Thing", in which Happy faced health problems – Jamie fell for Wendy Rossi, a doctor facing manslaughter, and Caitlin began to consider working with Richard instead of MDA – the show began to gain attention.

Other notable characters of the first season were Helena, a prosecutor whose lack of ability often led to comic relief moments; Claudia, Richard's sardonic barrister; Giles, the amiable old barrister contracted to MDA; Dr Vince Phillips, a doctor on the MDA board whose desire to take over led to a legal battle; and Dr Mark Matthews, the head of the MDA board.

In the final episodes of the season, Ella and Tony became victims of a civil suit which led to them facing considerable press exposure. They were found not guilty, but in the final moments of the season finale, ''Divine intervention'', angry plaintiff Debbie Shanahan drove her car directly at Jamie, Tony and Ella, and the audience was left to wonder who had survived.

===Season 2===
Although the ratings had been average, ''MDA'' was granted a second season.

The second season improved markedly from the first season, tightening storylines and scripts. The season opened with the episode "Eternity" in which Tony died on the operating table, and Caitlin moved to Richard Savage's firm. Caitlin gets off to a bumpy start with the MDA when she becomes involved with Justin Harris (a man secretly under investigation for murder, played by [[Jeremy Callaghan]]). After Justin is cleared he feels that there is no trust in their relationship and leaves Caitlin.

Two new characters joined: Amanda McKay, a legal case manager; and Simon Lloyd, a doctor joining MDA. Amanda and Simon's relationship evolves as a will-they-or-won't-they? couple of the show, with the risk increased due to his wife who worked abroad. By season's end they were a couple, but were still easing into it.

Significant season two storylines included the destruction of Jamie and Wendy's relationship, Dr Phillips' increasing efforts to become head of MDA, and the potential destruction of MDA itself as he attempts to incite a revolution against the firm, Caitlin and Richard's personal and professional fighting, Layla's grandmother getting closer to death, and Happy dealing with his son Jason.

In the second half of the season, Caitlin was written out of the show, as the producers decided her character had run its course. Kerry Armstrong also decided to leave - because the low Government funding for the arts in Australia under the Howard conservative government (often criticised within the industry) meant that appearing on one television show was not a sustainable income. Ella, subsequently, took a full-time posting at St. Albans' as Head of Emergency and only appeared occasionally during the latter half of season 2, making her final appearance in the penultimate episode "Pas de deux".

Despite increased audience size, critical response, and award nominations, the ABC made no official announcement of the show's renewal. The final episode, "Memento Mori", aired on 17 December 2003.

While it was no surprise that the ABC did not make an immediate announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both moved on to other projects.

===Season 3===
In August 2004, the ABC finally announced its new commitment: a 12-episode order, which would air as three four-hour miniseries in 2005. While the order was small, the renewal meant that ''MDA'' was the only series to have started in 2002 which was still on the air as of 2005.

The third season began on 30 June 2005, and was greeted with lackluster ratings, despite an impressive guest cast. Critical response, initially negative, warmed as the season progressed, to the point where it was largely positive.

* Episodes 1–4: ''Second chance.'' Facing a separation from his wife, Happy becomes enamored of a brilliant [[genetics|geneticist]], Dr Robyn Masterson ([[Sigrid Thornton]]) whose controversial experiments are in danger of being shut down. While Happy's personal feelings lead him to champion her cause, he begins to discover that all is not as it seems. Meanwhile, Amanda investigates a separate case regarding Dr Masterson's lab assistant Julia ([[Anita Hegh]]); and Layla, Mark and Jamie fear for Happy's well-being. [[Aaron Blabey]] also stars as Dr. Masterson's assistant. As incident after incident befalls Robyn's team, she blames outside forces but some suspect that she herself isn't being honest with MDA, and ultimately Happy is forced to make the choice between his relationship with Robyn and the good of the company.  [[Nicholas Hammond]] also guest stars in this episode.
* Episodes 5–8: ''Departure lounge.'' With Jamie on holiday, MDA take on a temporary case manager, Dr Andrew Morello ([[Vince Colosimo]]), an anaesthetist with strong suspicions about the high rate of infant deaths at his hospital. So when he and Amanda assist Ted Walsh (Terry Brady), a prominent doctor with similar suspicions, Morello begins to investigate - which leads him to suspect prominent [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Rupert Carr ([[Frank Gallacher]]). As Morello confides in Happy, he begins attempting to stop Carr's practices, without coming out and speaking his mind, which will ultimately result in the end of both their careers. When Andrew goes up on his own charges, Happy recalls Jamie back to MDA so that Andrew can be dismissed. As everyone including MDA turns against him, news about his wife Lucy ([[Jane Allsop]]) ultimately compels Andrew to make a final decision. Meanwhile, Amanda goes up against Gabrielle Bromley ([[Wendy Hughes]]), a fierce prosecuting attorney.
* Episodes 9–12: ''A human cost.'' Happy has a sudden [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack, and while in an outer suburban hospital befriends [[intern]] Dr Liz Gibson ([[Lisa McCune]]). The next day, Gibson becomes the subject of a medical negligence writ. Concerned that her boss, Meg Morrison ([[Louise Siversen]]), and her nemesis, nurse Chloe Davis ([[Jacinta Stapleton]]) are teaming up against her, Liz seeks Happy's assistance. Even though both Amanda and Liz herself have doubts about her competence, Happy stands by her. However, when Jamie and Layla discover just how understaffed and incompetently run Prospect Valley Hospital is, they realise that someone might be making Liz a scapegoat to cover up greater crimes. Elsewhere, Amanda goes up against a Health Review Board manager, David Simpson ([[Erik Thomson]]) in court, only to find herself in a passionate relationship with him outside of work. But when she learns that he may be behind the plot to convict Liz, Amanda is put into a devastating [[conflict of interest]]. Things come to a head when Liz and her boyfriend - fellow intern Dr Tim Whitney ([[Paul Bishop (actor)|Paul Bishop]]) - must both be protected against the schemes at the hospital, and as Happy fights with Amanda over the case, his health takes a serious turn for the worse.

A person having a [[major depressive episode]] usually exhibits a very low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an [[anhedonia|inability to experience pleasure]] in activities that were formerly enjoyed.

Depressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed one,&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation.&lt;ref name=APA354&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lose interest in school and show a decline in academic performance.

===Associated conditions===
Major depression frequently [[Comorbidity|co-occurs]] with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 ''[[National Comorbidity Survey]]'' (US) reports that half of those with major depression also have lifetime [[anxiety]] and its associated disorders such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kessler RC, Nelson CB, McGonagle KA, Liu J, Swartz M, Blazer DG |title=Comorbidity of DSM-III-R major depressive disorder in the general population: results from the US National Comorbidity Survey |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry.

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bair MJ, Robinson RL, Katon W, Kroenke K |title=Depression and pain comorbidity: a literature review |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=163 |issue=20 |pages=2433–45 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14609780 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.20.2433 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/20/2433(fulltext) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing [[cardiovascular disorders]], which further increases their risk of medical complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swardfager W, Herrmann N, Marzolini S, Saleem M, Farber SB, Kiss A, Oh PI, Lanctôt KL |title=Major depressive disorder predicts completion, adherence, and outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation: a prospective cohort study of 195 patients with coronary artery disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=72 |issue=9 |pages=1181–88 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21208573 |doi=10.4088/jcp.09m05810blu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[cardiologists]] may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schulman J, Shapiro BA|year=2008|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=25 |issue=9 |title=Depression and Cardiovascular Disease: What Is the Correlation?|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/article/10168/1171821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The cause of major depressive disorder is unknown. The [[biopsychosocial model]] proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role in causing depression.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Department of Health and Human Services |year=1999 |url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/pdfs/c2.pdf |title=The fundamentals of mental health and mental illness |website=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General |accessdate=11 November 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217031913/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/pdfs/c2.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diathesis–stress model]] specifies that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or [[Diathesis (medicine)|diathesis]], is activated by stressful life events.

[[Child abuse|Childhood abuse]], either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and [[drug abuse]]. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness.

==Pathophysiology==
{{see|Biology of depression|Epigenetics of depression}}
The pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around [[monoamine]]rgic systems, the [[circadian rhythm]], immunological dysfunction, [[HPA axis]] dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

The monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of [[tryptophan]], a necessary precursor of [[serotonin]], a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of depressed patients; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruhé HG, Mason NS, Schene AH |title=Mood is indirectly related to serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in humans: a meta-analysis of monoamine depletion studies |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=331–59 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17389902 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the [[5-HTTLPR]] gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link. Third, decreased size of the [[locus coeruleus]], decreased activity of [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], increased density of [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor]], and evidence from rat models suggest decreased [[Adrenergic nervous system|adrenergic]] neurotransmission in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado PL, Moreno FA |title=Role of norepinephrine in depression |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=61 Suppl 1 |pages=5–12 |year=2000 |pmid=10703757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, decreased levels of [[homovanillic acid]], altered response to [[dextroamphetamine]], responses of depressive symptoms to [[dopamine receptor]] agonists, decreased [[dopamine receptor D1]] binding in the [[striatum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savitz JB, Drevets WC |title=Neuroreceptor imaging in depression |journal=Neurobiology of Disease |volume=52 |pages=49–65 |date=April 2013 |pmid=22691454 |doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] of [[dopamine receptor]] genes implicate [[dopamine]], another monoamine, in depression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasler G |title=Pathophysiology of depression: do we have any solid evidence of interest to clinicians? |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=155–61 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20975857 |pmc=2950973 |doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00298.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunlop BW, Nemeroff CB |title=The role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=327–37 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17339521 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.3.327 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6466257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, increased activity of [[monoamine oxidase]], which degrades monoamines, has been associated with depression.&lt;ref name="Meyer06"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyer JH, Ginovart N, Boovariwala A, Sagrati S, Hussey D, Garcia A, Young T, Praschak-Rieder N, Wilson AA, Houle S |title=Elevated monoamine oxidase a levels in the brain: an explanation for the monoamine imbalance of major depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1209–16 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17088501 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory is inconsistent with the fact that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, the fact that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Kenneth L |editor-last1=Davis |editor-first2=Dennis |editor-last2=Charney MD |editor-first3=Joseph T |editor-last3=Coyle |editor-first4=Charles |editor-last4=Nemeroff |name-list-format=vanc |title=Neuropsychopharmacology: the fifth generation of progress: an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9780781728379|pages=1139–63|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in [[raphe nuclei]] by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adell A |title=Revisiting the role of raphe and serotonin in neuropsychiatric disorders |journal=The Journal of General Physiology |volume=145 |issue=4 |pages=257–59 |date=April 2015 |pmid=25825168 |doi=10.1085/jgp.201511389 |pmc=4380212}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, disinhibition of the dorsal raphe has been proposed to occur as a result of ''decreased'' serotonergic activity in tryptophan depletion, resulting in a depressed state mediated by increased serotonin.

==Diagnosis==

===Clinical assessment===
{{further|Rating scales for depression}}

A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained [[general practitioner]], or by a [[psychiatrist]] or [[psychologist]],&lt;ref name="NIMHPub" /&gt; who [[psychiatric history|records]] the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The broad clinical aim is to formulate the relevant biological, psychological, and social factors that may be impacting on the individual's mood. The assessor may also discuss the person's current ways of regulating mood (healthy or otherwise) such as alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a [[mental state examination]], which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or [[pessimism]], [[self-harm]] or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name="NIMHPub" /&gt; Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to [[primary care|primary-care]] clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufmann IM |title=Rural psychiatric services.

Subjective cognitive complaints appear in older depressed people, but they can also be indicative of the onset of a [[dementia|dementing disorder]], such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid17047326"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reid LM, Maclullich AM |title=Subjective memory complaints and cognitive impairment in older people |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=22 |issue=5–6 |pages=471–85 |year=2006 |pmid=17047326 |doi=10.1159/000096295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9720486"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz IR |title=Diagnosis and treatment of depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=59 Suppl 9 |pages=38–44 |year=1998 |pmid=9720486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuropsychological assessment|Cognitive testing]] and brain imaging can help distinguish depression from dementia.&lt;ref name="pmid18004006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright SL, Persad C |title=Distinguishing between depression and dementia in older persons: neuropsychological and neuropathological correlates |journal=Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=189–98 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18004006 |doi=10.1177/0891988707308801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] can exclude brain pathology in those with psychotic, rapid-onset or otherwise unusual symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, investigations are not repeated for a subsequent episode unless there is a medical [[Indication (medicine)|indication]].

No biological tests confirm major depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomarker]]s of depression have been sought to provide an objective method of diagnosis. There are several potential biomarkers, including [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] and various [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] (fMRI) techniques. One study developed a [[decision tree model]] of interpreting a series of fMRI scans taken during various activities. In their subjects, the authors of that study were able to achieve a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 87%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 98% and a positive predictive value of 32% (positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.15, 0.23, respectively). However, much more research is needed before these tests can be used clinically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hahn T, Marquand AF, Ehlis AC, Dresler T, Kittel-Schneider S, Jarczok TA, Lesch KP, Jakob PM, Mourao-Miranda J, Brammer MJ, Fallgatter AJ |title=Integrating neurobiological markers of depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=361–68 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21135315 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.178 |url=http://www.molecularpsychiatry.ukw.de/fileadmin/uk/molecularpsychiatry/PDFs/2011/Hahnetal20113.pdf |author7-link=Klaus-Peter Lesch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s revised fourth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR), and the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10), which uses the name ''depressive episode'' for a single episode and ''recurrent depressive disorder'' for repeated episodes.&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|title=Mental and behavioural disorders: Mood [affective] disorders|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2010|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|archivedate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.&lt;ref name=APA372&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="DSMvsICD" /&gt; ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, [[anhedonia]], and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine the depressive disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="DSM-10 diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|date=2010|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=12 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323025330/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|archivedate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral disorders. Clinical description and diagnostic guideline. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; According to DSM-IV-TR, there are two main depressive symptoms—depressed mood and anhedonia. At least one of these must be present to make a diagnosis of major depressive episode.&lt;ref name=APA000&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in DSM-IV-TR.&lt;ref name=APA345&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis hinges on the presence of single or recurrent [[major depressive episode]]s.&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The ICD-10 system does not use the term ''major depressive disorder'' but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without [[mania]].&lt;ref name="ICD-10" /&gt;

====Major depressive episode====
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}

A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features—commonly referred to as ''[[psychotic depression]]''—is automatically rated as severe. If the patient has had an episode of [[mania]] or [[hypomania|markedly elevated mood]], a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] is made instead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as ''unipolar'' because the mood remains at one emotional state or "pole".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Parker|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSM-IV-TR excludes cases where the symptoms are a result of [[Grief|bereavement]], although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop.&lt;ref name=APA352&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria have been criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur.&lt;ref name="Wakefield07"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wakefield JC, Schmitz MF, First MB, Horwitz AV |title=Extending the bereavement exclusion for major depression to other losses: evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=433–40 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17404120 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.4.433 |laysummary=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201693.html |laydate=3 April 2007 |laysource=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration:&lt;ref name="Kendler98"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Gardner CO |title=Boundaries of major depression: an evaluation of DSM-IV criteria |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=172–77 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9464194 |doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.172|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including [[dysthymia]], which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance;&lt;ref name="harvnb"&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=552}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[recurrent brief depression]], consisting of briefer depressive episodes;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carta MG, Altamura AC, Hardoy MC, Pinna F, Medda S, Dell'Osso L, Carpiniello B, Angst J |title=Is recurrent brief depression an expression of mood spectrum disorders in young people?

====Subtypes====
The DSM-IV-TR recognizes five further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:
* '''[[Melancholic depression]]''' is characterized by [[anhedonia|a loss of pleasure in most or all activities]], a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Atypical depression]]''' is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression''' is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=417–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Postpartum depression]]''', or '''mental and behavioral disorders associated with the {{linktext|puerperium}}, not elsewhere classified''',&lt;ref name="ICD-10" /&gt; refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth. Postpartum depression has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-IV mandates that, in order to qualify as postpartum depression, onset occur within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nonacs, Ruta M |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |publisher=eMedicine |title=Postpartum depression |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013205912/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |archivedate=13 October 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Seasonal affective disorder]]''' (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening===
In 2016, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommended screening in the adult populations with evidence that it increases the detection of people with depression and with proper treatment improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=US2016/&gt; They recommend screening in those between the age of 12 to 18 as well.&lt;ref name=US2016Peds/&gt;

A Cochrane review from 2005 found [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] programs do not significantly improve detection rates, treatment, or outcome.&lt;ref name="Gil2005"/&gt;

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}

To confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''[[double depression]]'').&lt;ref name="harvnb" /&gt; [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name="psychiatric355" /&gt; [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of [[mania]] or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further differential diagnoses involve [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawk C, Jason LA, Torres-Harding S |title=Differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and major depressive disorder |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=244–51 |date=1 January 2006 |pmid=17078775 |doi=10.1207/s15327558ijbm1303_8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.574.3376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance abuse]]. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[Mood disorder#Due to another medical condition|mood disorder due to a general medical condition]]. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a medication, drug of abuse, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called ''substance-induced mood disorder'' in the DSM-IV-TR).&lt;ref name="DSM5"/&gt;

==Prevention==
Preventative efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%.&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2008 /&gt; Eating large amounts of fish may also reduce the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li F, Liu X, Zhang D |title=Fish consumption and risk of depression: a meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=299–304 |date=March 2016 |pmid=26359502 |doi=10.1136/jech-2015-206278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral interventions, such as [[interpersonal therapy]] and [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]], are effective at preventing new onset depression.&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuijpers P, van Straten A, Smit F, Mihalopoulos C, Beekman A |title=Preventing the onset of depressive disorders: a meta-analytic review of psychological interventions |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=165 |issue=10 |pages=1272–80 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18765483 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07091422 |hdl=1871/16952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munoz2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muñoz RF, Beardslee WR, Leykin Y |title=Major depression can be prevented |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=285–95 |date=May–June 2012 |pmid=22583342 |pmc=4533896 |doi=10.1037/a0027666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2012&gt;{{cite conference|author=Cuijpers, P|title=Prevention and early treatment of mental ill-health|url=http://congres.efpa.eu/downloads/Pim-Cuijpers_Prevention-and-early-treatment-of-mental-ill-health-EFPASep%202012.pdf|place=PSYCHOLOGY FOR HEALTH: Contributions to Policy Making, Brussels|date=20 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512015105/http://congres.efpa.eu/downloads/Pim-Cuijpers_Prevention-and-early-treatment-of-mental-ill-health-EFPASep%202012.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffiths KM, Farrer L, Christensen H | year = 2010 |volume=192 |issue=11 |pages=4–11 |title=The efficacy of internet interventions for depression and anxiety disorders: a review of randomised controlled trials |journal=Medical Journal of Australia | url = https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/192_11_070610/gri10844_fm.pdf |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130932/https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/192_11_070610/gri10844_fm.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported [[Churn rate|attrition rates]], and had a well-defined intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Jané-Llopis E, Hosman C, Jenkins R, Anderson P |year=2003 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |title=Predictors of efficacy in depression prevention programmes |website=British Journal of Psychiatry |accessdate=2 April 2009 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083702/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the "Coping with Depression" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.&lt;ref name=Munoz2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuijpers P, Muñoz RF, Clarke GN, Lewinsohn PM |title=Psychoeducational treatment and prevention of depression: the "Coping with Depression" course thirty years later |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=449–58 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19450912 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the [[risk-benefit ratio]] is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of [[relapse]], and that [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are better tolerated than [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) or [[light therapy]]. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.&lt;ref name=apaguidelines/&gt; There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archer J, Bower P, Gilbody S, Lovell K, Richards D, Gask L, Dickens C, Coventry P | title = Collaborative care for depression and anxiety problems | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | page = CD006525 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23076925 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006525.pub2 | hdl = 10871/13751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.&lt;ref name=Patel04&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P |title=Treating depression in the developing world |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=539–41 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15117296 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox GR, Callahan P, Churchill R, Hunot V, Merry SN, Parker AG, Hetrick SE |title=Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=CD008324 |date=November 2014 |pmid=25433518 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may improve depressive symptoms, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary. Besides sleepiness, this method can cause a side effect of [[mania]] or [[hypomania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giedke H, Schwärzler F |title=Therapeutic use of sleep deprivation in depression |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=361–77 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12531127 |doi=10.1053/smrv.2002.0235 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
[[Psychotherapy]] can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals.

====Cognitive behavioral therapy====
{{See also|Behavioral theories of depression}}
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.&lt;ref name=abct&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726055131/http://www.abct.org/sccap/?m=sPublic&amp;fa=pub_Depression Childhood Depression]. abct.org. Last updated: 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In people under 18, according to the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[Interpersonal psychotherapy|interpersonal therapy]], or family therapy.&lt;ref name=NICEkids5&gt;{{cite book |author=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] |title=NICE guidelines: Depression in children and adolescents |publisher=NICE |location=London |year=2005 |page=5 |isbn=978-1-84629-074-9 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG28/QuickRefGuide/pdf/English |accessdate=16 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924152314/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG28/QuickRefGuide/pdf/English |archivedate=24 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce the number of sick days taken by people with depression, when used in conjunction with primary care.&lt;ref name="pmid25470301"/&gt;

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well as or better than antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dobson KS |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of cognitive therapy for depression |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=414–19 |date=June 1989 |pmid=2738214 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.57.3.414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RothFonagy78&gt;{{cite book |title=What Works for Whom?

Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.&lt;ref name="pmid25470301"/&gt;

====Variants====
Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being [[rational emotive behavior therapy]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb |Beck|1987|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid18085916"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coelho HF, Canter PH, Ernst E |title=Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: evaluating current evidence and informing future research |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1000–05 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18085916 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.6.1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms.&lt;ref name=Khoury&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khoury B, Lecomte T, Fortin G, Masse M, Therien P, Bouchard V, Chapleau MA, Paquin K, Hofmann SG |title=Mindfulness-based therapy: a comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=763–71 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23796855 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain FA, Walsh RN, Eisendrath SJ, Christensen S, Rael Cahn B |title=Critical analysis of the efficacy of meditation therapies for acute and subacute phase treatment of depressive disorders: a systematic review |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=140–52 |date=2014 |pmid=25591492 |pmc=4383597 |doi=10.1016/j.psym.2014.10.007 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0372c9xp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.&lt;ref name=Simkin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simkin DR, Black NB |title=Meditation and mindfulness in clinical practice |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=487–534 |date=July 2014 |pmid=24975623 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2014.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
[[Psychoanalysis]] is a school of thought, founded by [[Sigmund Freud]], which emphasizes the resolution of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] mental conflicts.&lt;ref name="isbn0-314-20412-1"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Dworetzky J |title=Psychology |publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub.

It also tends to focus more on the person's immediate problems, and has an additional social and interpersonal focus.&lt;ref name="IntegrativePP"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.&lt;ref name="pmid17557313"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Maat S, Dekker J, Schoevers R, van Aalst G, Gijsbers-van Wijk C, Hendriksen M, Kool S, Peen J, Van R, de Jonghe F |title=Short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy, antidepressants, and their combination in the treatment of major depression: a mega-analysis based on three randomized clinical trials |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=565–74 |year=2007 |pmid=17557313 |doi=10.1002/da.20305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antidepressants===
[[File:Zoloft bottles.jpg|thumb|[[Sertraline]] (Zoloft) is used primarily to treat major depression in adults.]]
Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iglesias-González M, Aznar-Lou I, Gil-Girbau M, Moreno-Peral P, Peñarrubia-María MT, Rubio-Valera M, Serrano-Blanco A | title = Comparing watchful waiting with antidepressants for the management of subclinical depression symptoms to mild-moderate depression in primary care: a systematic review | journal = Family Practice | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 639–48 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28985309 | doi = 10.1093/fampra/cmx054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

While small benefits were found, researchers [[Irving Kirsch]] and [[Thomas Moore (spiritual writer)|Thomas Moore]] state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication.&lt;ref name="administration2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |vauthors=Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment |year=2002 |volume=5 |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for [[clinical significance]].&lt;ref name=Kir2008 /&gt; Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis by Fornier.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), such as [[escitalopram]], [[paroxetine]], and [[sertraline]], have greater efficacy than [[placebo]] on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.&lt;ref name="Depression in Adults"&gt;{{cite web|title=The treatment and management of depression in adults|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[NICE]]|date=October 2009|accessdate=12 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112140520/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|archivedate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]] concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S |title=Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=12 |pages=CD009138 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23235671 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 |editor1-last=Leucht |editor1-first=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50–75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to [[Cure|remission]].&lt;!--This study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--&gt;&lt;ref name=apaguidelines /&gt; Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,&lt;!--This study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--&gt;&lt;ref name=apaguidelines&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=|title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (revision).

There is significant agreement between the three sets of recommendations."&lt;/ref&gt;

A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week, until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms. ECT is administered under [[anesthesia]] with a [[muscle relaxant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/5-outdated-beliefs-about-ect/00011255|title=5 Outdated Beliefs About ECT|website=Psych Central.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808042410/http://psychcentral.com/lib/5-outdated-beliefs-about-ect/00011255|archivedate=8 August 2013|date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev /&gt;

ECT appears to work in the short term via an [[anticonvulsant]] effect mostly in the [[frontal lobes]], and longer term via [[neurotrophic]] effects primarily in the [[medial temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name=Abbott2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abbott CC, Gallegos P, Rediske N, Lemke NT, Quinn DK |title=A review of longitudinal electroconvulsive therapy: neuroimaging investigations |journal=Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24381234 |doi=10.1177/0891988713516542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright [[light therapy]] reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit for both [[seasonal affective disorder]] and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants.

==Prognosis==
Major depressive episodes often resolve over time whether or not they are treated. Outpatients on a waiting list show a 10–15% reduction in symptoms within a few months, with approximately 20% no longer meeting the full criteria for a depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posternak MA, Miller I |title=Untreated short-term course of major depression: a meta-analysis of outcomes from studies using wait-list control groups |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=66 |issue=2–3 |pages=139–46 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11578666 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00304-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[median]] duration of an episode has been estimated to be 23 weeks, with the highest rate of recovery in the first three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posternak MA, Solomon DA, Leon AC, Mueller TI, Shea MT, Endicott J, Keller MB |title=The naturalistic course of unipolar major depression in the absence of somatic therapy |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=194 |issue=5 |pages=324–29 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16699380 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000217820.33841.53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People experiencing repeated episodes of depression require ongoing treatment in order to prevent more severe, long-term depression.

Cases when outcome is poor are associated with inappropriate treatment, severe initial symptoms including psychosis, early age of onset, previous episodes, incomplete recovery after one year of treatment, pre-existing severe mental or medical disorder, and [[family dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/depression-major/prognosis|title=Depression, Major: Prognosis|website=MDGuidlines|publisher=[[The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America]]|accessdate=16 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420055044/http://www.mdguidelines.com/depression-major/prognosis|archivedate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|alt=|thumb|Diagnoses of depression go back at least as far as [[Hippocrates]]]]
{{Main|History of depression}}

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of the ailment.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23&lt;/ref&gt; It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.&lt;ref name="Radden2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Radden, J |year=2003 |title=Is this dame melancholy? Equating today's depression and past melancholia |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/v010/10.1radden01.html |doi=10.1353/ppp.2003.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''depression'' itself was derived from the Latin verb ''deprimere'', "to press down".&lt;ref&gt;depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved 30 June 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203095346/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author [[Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolpert, L|year=1999|title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression|website=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|accessdate=30 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111218/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|archivedate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also came into use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]]. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist [[Louis Delasiauve]] in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.&lt;ref name="pmid3074848"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berrios GE |title=Melancholia and depression during the 19th century: a conceptual history |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=298–304 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3074848 |doi=10.1192/bjp.153.3.298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]], melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. The newer concept abandoned these associations and through the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, became more associated with women.&lt;ref name="Radden2003" /&gt;

[[File:A wretched man with an approaching depression; represented b Wellcome V0011145.jpg|thumb|left|A historical caricature of a man with an approaching depression]]
Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.&lt;ref name="Davison2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively but the ego itself is compromised.&lt;ref name="Carhart-Harris08"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carhart-Harris RL, Mayberg HS, Malizia AL, Nutt D |title=Mourning and melancholia revisited: correspondences between principles of Freudian metapsychology and empirical findings in neuropsychiatry |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=7 |page=9 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18652673 |pmc=2515304 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-7-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Richards A |vauthors=Freud S |title=11.On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psycholoanalysis |chapter=Mourning and Melancholia|pages=245–69 |publisher=Pelican |location=Aylesbury, Bucks |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-021740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.&lt;ref name="Radden2003" /&gt; [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing ''reactions'' in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term ''depression'' should be used instead of ''melancholia''.&lt;ref name="Lewis1934"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis, AJ|year=1934|title=Melancholia: A historical review |journal=Journal of Mental Science |volume=80 |issue=328|pages=1–42|doi=10.1192/bjp.80.328.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of the DSM (DSM-I, 1952) contained ''depressive reaction'' and the DSM-II (1968) ''depressive neurosis'', defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.&lt;ref name="DSMII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-II |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=1968 |chapter=Schizophrenia |url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420355.dsm-ii |format=PDF |accessdate=3 August 2008 |pages=36–37, 40|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420355.dsm-ii |doi-broken-date=2018-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schildkraut JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=509–22 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/ajp.122.5.509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.&lt;ref name="Paris2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paris J |title=The mistreatment of major depressive disorder |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

===Terminology===
The term "depression" is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other [[mood disorder]]s or simply to a low mood. People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. "Because of the lack of scientific certainty," one commentator has observed, "the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129377|title=The Depression Wars: Would Honest Abe Have Written the Gettysburg Address on Prozac?|author=Maloney F|date=3 November 2005|journal=Slate|accessdate=3 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925012423/http://www.slate.com/id/2129377/|archivedate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.&lt;ref name="Karasz05"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Tilbury F, Rapley M | year = 2004 | title = 'There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=54–64|doi=10.5172/hesr.13.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as China. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or [[Somatization|somatize]] emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker G, Gladstone G, Chee KT |title=Depression in the planet's largest ethnic group: the Chinese |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=857–64 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11384889 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.6.857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status. Australian professor [[Gordon Parker (psychiatrist)|Gordon Parker]] and others have argued that the Western concept of depression "medicalizes" sadness or misery.&lt;ref name="Parker07"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker G |title=Is depression overdiagnosed?

===Stigma===
Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings, or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression.

Depression is especially common among those over 65 years of age and increases in frequency beyond this age.&lt;ref name="SBU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/depression-treatment-for-the-elderly/|title=Depression treatment for the elderly | author = [[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU) |website=www.sbu.se|access-date=16 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618011954/http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/depression-treatment-for-the-elderly/|archivedate=18 June 2016|date=2015-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the risk of depression increases in relation to the frailty of the individual.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Depression is one the most important factors which negatively impact quality of life in adults, as well as the elderly.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Both symptoms and treatment among the elderly differ from those of the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

As with many other diseases, it is common among the elderly not to present with classical depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Treatment differs in that studies of SSRIs have shown lesser and often inadequate effects among the elderly, while other drugs, such as [[duloxetine]] (an [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]), with more clear effects have adverse effects, such as dizziness, dryness of the mouth, diarrhea and constipation, which can be especially difficult to handle among the elderly.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

[[Problem solving therapy]] was, as of 2015, the only psychological therapy with proven effect, and can be likened to a simpler form of cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; However, elderly with depression are seldom offered any psychological treatment, and the evidence proving other treatments effective is incomplete.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; ECT has been used in the elderly, and register-studies suggest it is effective, although less so as compared to the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

The risks involved with treatment of depression among the elderly as opposed to benefits are not entirely clear.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

Models of depression in animals for the purpose of study include [[iatrogenic]] depression models (such as drug-induced), forced swim tests, [[tail suspension test]], and [[learned helplessness]] models. Criteria frequently used to assess depression in animals include expression of despair, neurovegetative changes, and anhedonia, as many other criteria for depression are untestable in animals, such as guilt and suicidality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Krishnan V, Nestler EJ |volume=7 |pages=121–47 |date=2011 |pmid=21225412 |pmc=3270071 |doi=10.1007/7854_2010_108 |isbn=978-3-642-19702-4 |series=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences |title=Molecular and Functional Models in Neuropsychiatry |chapter=Animal Models of Depression: Molecular Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Man Therapy''' is an interactive mental health campaign targeting working age men (25-54) that employs humor to cut through stigma and tackle issues like depression, divorce and anxiety. The campaign features the fictional Dr. Rich Mahogany, described by Adam Newman in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as “an affable, mustachioed, middle-aged man whose personality might be described as [[Dr. Phil]] meets [[Ron Burgundy]], [[Will Ferrell]]’s fictional anchorman.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/business/media/a-humorous-approach-to-grim-issue-of-suicide-prevention.html|title=A Humorous Approach to a Serious Issue: Suicide Prevention|first=Andrew Adam|last=Newman|date=8 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017|via=[[NY Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Therapy was created by [http://www.cactusdenver.com Cactus], a Denver-based ad agency, in conjunction with the Carson J Spencer Foundation and the Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

==About the campaign==

The purpose of the Man Therapy campaign is to provide men approaching crisis, and their loved ones, a place to go and learn more about men’s mental health, examine their own and consider a wide array of actions that will put them on the path to treatment and recovery. The message is that all men should be aware of their mental health, treat it like they would a broken leg and strive to get better.

Man Therapy is built around the fictional Man Therapist, Dr. Rich Mahogany. He’s a man’s man who is dedicated to cutting through the denial with a fresh approach using his rapier wit, odd sense of humor, no BS approach and practical, useful advice for men. There exists an age-old stigma that says mental health disorders are unmanly signs of weakness. Dr. Rich Mahogany and Man Therapy, is dedicated to smashing that.

The centerpiece of the campaign is the [http://mantherapy.org ManTherapy.org] website, where men and their loved ones will find they have a virtual appointment with Dr. Mahogany. He greets visitors, makes them feel at ease and then provides an overview of what they will find and explore during their visit.  From there, visitors can navigate through Dr. Mahogany’s office where they can find useful information about men’s mental health including guy’s guide to Gentlemental Health.  Men can also choose to take an 18-question quiz to evaluate their own mental health, access resources and explore a wide range of actions from accessing do-it-yourself tips, seeking therapy referral sources, links to local support groups and organizations as well as a crisis line.

The integrated communications campaign also includes a 30-second TV PSA, viral videos, social media, outdoor boards and outreach materials such as posters, coasters and Dr. Mahogany’s business card.

==History==

In 2006, as a part of their partnership with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Cactus was introduced to Jarrod Hindman, Director of the Office of Suicide Prevention (OSP). He was running an underfunded program to address the critically important issue of suicide in [[Colorado]]. Cactus agreed to do some pro bono work for the program. Through that process the agency learned a great deal about this issue and was introduced to the Carson J Spencer Foundation (CJSF), a local non-profit dedicated to [[suicide prevention]]. CJSF was founded in 2005 after its namesake, Carson Spencer, a 34-year-old Denver businessman, died by suicide following a difficult battle with bipolar disorder. Together, the three –– Cactus, OSP and CJSF –– formed a partnership to try to reach working aged men who were potentially high risk for suicide and unlikely to seek help on their own.

With a $25,000 contribution from the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] and $5,000 allocated from a larger Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Prevention grant, Cactus developed a comprehensive public education plan while conducting some very insightful and thrifty research studies. Fortunately, the Office of Suicide Prevention landed some untapped state dollars for a one-time, $400,000 campaign. Cactus competed for the contract in a competitive, state-bid process and was awarded the contract in 2009. However, a week after the contract was signed, we were informed that due to state budget cuts the entire grant and contract was cancelled. We were once again left with nothing but a really great plan and zero budget to implement it. Not to be deterred, the partnership forged ahead to launch this vital campaign. Serendipitously, Cactus heard that the Anschutz Foundation was looking to invest in a suicide prevention program. Cactus jumped on the opportunity and submitted a grant proposal on behalf of a private/public/non-profit partnership between Cactus, Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Carson J Spencer Foundation. Additionally, Cactus was awarded a grant from The Anschutz Foundation to develop a campaign while establishing a sustainable effort in Colorado and beyond.

==Results==

Man Therapy has received numerous awards for its innovative approach to mental health, including the Gold [[Addy Award]] for Public Service: Digital Advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dvserver.net/addy2013/gold/page52/|title=206940 Man Therapy: Website|website=dvserver.net|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Advertising Age]] awarded Man Therapy the Pro Bono Campaign of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/small-agency-awards/small-agency-awards-2013-cactus/243270/|title=Small Agency of the Year, Pro Bono: Cactus|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Man Therapy was recognized by the [[Safe States Alliance]] as the 2013 Innovative Initiative of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.safestates.org/?page=2013Awards | title=2013 Award Winners | publisher=Safe States Alliance | accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical classification''', or '''medical coding''', is the process of transforming descriptions of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and [[medical procedure|procedures]] into universal medical code numbers. The diagnoses and procedures are usually taken from a variety of sources within the [[health care]] record, such as the transcription of the physician's notes, laboratory results, radiologic results, and other sources.

[[Diagnosis code]]s track [[disease]]s and other health conditions, inclusive of chronic diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[heart disease]], and infectious diseases such as [[norovirus]], the [[flu]], and [[athlete's foot]]. [[Procedure code]]s track interventions performed. These diagnosis and procedure codes are used by health care providers, government health programs, private health insurance companies, workers' compensation carriers, software developers, and others for a variety of applications in [[medicine]], [[public health]] and [[medical informatics]], including:
* statistical analysis of diseases and therapeutic actions
* reimbursement (e.g., to process claims in [[medical billing]] based on [[diagnosis-related group]]s)
* knowledge-based and [[decision support system]]s
* direct surveillance of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks

There are country specific standards and international classification systems.

== Classification types ==
Many different medical classifications exist, though they occur into two main groupings: ''Statistical classifications'' and ''Nomenclatures''.

A '''statistical classification''' brings together similar clinical concepts and groups them into categories. The number of categories is limited so that the classification does not become too big. An example of this is used by the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (known as ICD). ICD groups diseases of the circulatory system into one "chapter," known as [[ICD-10 Chapter IX: Diseases of the circulatory system|Chapter IX]], covering codes I00–I99. One of the codes in this chapter (I47.1) has the code title ([[rubric]]) ''Supraventricular tachycardia''. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Among them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.

Another feature of statistical classifications is the provision of residual categories for "other" and "unspecified" conditions that do not have a specific category in the particular classification.

In a '''[[Medical terminology|nomenclature]]''' there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the previous example, each of the tachycardia listed would have its own code. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.

Types of coding systems specific to health care include:
* [[Diagnosis code|Diagnostic codes]]
** Are used to determine diseases, disorders, and symptoms
** Can be used to measure morbidity and mortality
** Examples: [[ICD-9-CM]], [[ICD-10]]
* [[Procedure code|Procedural codes]]
** They are numbers or alphanumeric codes used to identify specific health interventions taken by medical professionals.
** Examples: [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[HCPCS]], [[International Classification of Procedures in Medicine|ICPM]], [[International Classification of Health Interventions|ICHI]]
* [[Pharmaceutical code]]s
** Are used to identify medications
** Examples: [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System|ATC]], [[National Drug Code|NDC]]
* [[Topographical code]]s
** Are codes that indicate a specific location in the body
** Examples :[[ICD-O]], [[SNOMED]]

==WHO Family of International Classifications==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) maintains several internationally endorsed classifications designed to facilitate the comparison of health related data within and across populations and over time as well as the compilation of nationally consistent data.&lt;ref name="WHO-FIC"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/en/ Family of International Classifications.] Accessed 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "Family of International Classifications" (FIC) include three main (or reference) classifications on basic parameters of [[health]] prepared by the organization and approved by the [[World Health Assembly]] for international use, as well as a number of derived and related classifications providing additional details. Some of these international standards have been revised and adapted by various countries for national use.

===Historic FIC classifications===
ICD versions before ICD-9 are not in use anywhere.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[ICD-9]] was published in 1977, and was superseded by ICD-10. [[ICD-9-CM]] (Clinical Modification), the last national variant of ICD-9 still maintained,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} was used in the US until September 2015. Starting on October 1, 2015, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMMS) granted a one-year grace period to physicians who didn't use ICD-10 coding or they would be denied Medicare Part B claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160819/NEWS/160819913/get-ready-for-the-end-of-icd-10-flexibilities|title=Get ready for the end of ICD-10 'flexibilities'|newspaper=Modern Healthcare|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Classification of Procedures in Medicine]] (ICPM) is a [[Procedure code|procedural classification]] that has not updated since 1989, and will be replaced by [[International Classification of Health Interventions|ICHI]].&lt;ref name=WHO-FIC-ICHI /&gt; National versions of the ICPM include [[OPS-301|OPS]], which is the official German procedural classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dimdi.de/static/en/klassi/ops/index.htm|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICD, SNOMED and Electronic Health Record (EHR)==

===SNOMED===
The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine ([[SNOMED]]) is the most widely recognised nomenclature in healthcare.&lt;ref name="ihtsdo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/|title=SNOMED International|work=ihtsdo.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current version, SNOMED Clinical Terms ([[SNOMED CT]]), is intended to provide a set of concepts and relationships that offers a common reference point for comparison and aggregation of data about the health care process.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_faq.html#what|title=FAQs:  Inclusion of SNOMED CT in the UMLS|work=nih.gov|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNOMED CT is often described as a reference terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/fmrc/snomed/|title=SNOMED CT - Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine|first=Publications|last=Office|work=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNOMED CT contains more than 311,000 active concepts with unique meanings and formal logic-based definitions organised into hierarchies.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"/&gt; SNOMED CT can be used by anyone with an Affiliate License, 40 low income countries defined by the World Bank or qualifying research, humanitarian and charitable projects.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"/&gt; SNOMED-CT is designed to be managed by computer, and it is a complex relationship concepts.&lt;ref name="ihtsdo.org"/&gt;

===ICD===
The International Classification of Disease ([[ICD]]) is the most widely recognized medical classification maintained by the [[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref name="Electronic Health Records: A Practical Guide for Professionals and Organizations."&gt;Margret K. Amatayakul, MBA, RHIA, CHPS, CPHIT, CPEHR&amp;FHIMSS.(2009).Electronic Health Records: A Practical Guide for Professionals and Organizations.Chicago, America:AHIMA&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary purpose is to categorise diseases for morbidity and mortality reporting. The United States has used a clinical modification of ICD ([[ICD-9-CM]]) for the additional purposes of reimbursement. [[ICD-10]] was endorsed by [[WHO]] in 1990, and WHO Member states began using the classification system in 1994 for both morbidity and mortality reporting. In the US, however, it has only been used for reporting mortality since 1999. Because of the US delay in adopting its version of [[ICD-10]], it is currently unable to compare morbidity data with the rest of the world. ICD has a hierarchical structure, and coding in this context, is the term applied when representations are assigned to the words they represent.&lt;ref name="Electronic Health Records: A Practical Guide for Professionals and Organizations."/&gt; Coding diagnoses and procedures is the assignment of codes from a code set that follows the rules of the underlying classification or other coding guidelines.

===Comparison===
[[SNOMED CT]] and [[ICD]] are designed for different purposes and each should be used for the purposes for which they were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icd10watch.com/blog/why-snomed-cannot-replace-icd-10-cmpcs-code-sets|title=Why SNOMED cannot replace the ICD-10-CM/PCS code sets|work=icd10watch.com|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a core terminology for the [[Electronic health record|EHR]], SNOMED CT provides a common language that enables a consistent language that enables a consistent way of capturing, sharing, and aggregating health data across specialties and sites of care. It is highly detailed terminology designed for input not reporting. Classification systems such as [[ICD-9-CM]], [[ICD-10-CM]], and [[ICD-10-PCS]] group together similar diseases and procedures and organise related entities for easy retrieval. They are typically used for external reporting requirements or other uses where data aggregation is advantageous, such as measuring the quality of care monitoring resource utilisation, or processing claims for reimbursement. SNOMED is clinically-based, documents whatever is needed for patient care and has better clinical coverage than ICD. ICD’s focus is statistical with less common diseases get lumped together in “catch-all” categories, which result in loss of information. SNOMED CT is used directly by healthcare providers during the process of care, whereas ICD is used by coding professionals after the episode of care. SNOMED CT has multiple hierarchy, whereas there is single hierarchy for ICD. SNOMED CT concepts are defined logically by their attributes, whereas only textual rules and definitions in ICD.

===Data Mapping===
[[SNOMED]] and [[ICD]] can be coordinated. The [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) maps ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, and other classification systems to SNOMED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/snomedCTToICD10Maps/en/|title=WHO - SNOMED CT to ICD-10 Cross-Map Technology Preview Release|work=who.int|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data Mapping is the process of identifying relationships between two distinct data models. The full value of the health information contained in an [[Electronic health record|EHR]] system will only be realised if both systems involved in the map are up to date and accurately reflect the current practice of medicine.&lt;ref name="Electronic Health Records: A Practical Guide for Professionals and Organizations."/&gt;

==Clinical Coding in Australia==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=http://www.clinicalcoding.health.wa.gov.au/about/|free=no|date=September 2016}}
Medical coding and classification systems are expected to become increasingly important in the health care sector. Together with and as an integrated part of the electronic health information systems, the coding and classification systems will be used to improve the quality and effectiveness of the medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8191453 | volume=114 | issue=6 | title=[Medical coding and classification systems]. | date=Feb 1994 | journal=Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen | pages=694–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical coding===
Clinical coding is the translation of written, scanned and/or electronic clinical documentation about patient care into code format. For example, hypertension is represented by the code 'I10'; general anaethesia is represented by the code '92514-XX[1910]'.

A standardised classification system, The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Australian Modification ([[ICD-10-AM]]), is applied in all Australian acute health facilities. It is based on the [[World Health Organization]] [[ICD-10]] system, updated with the Australian Classification of Health Interventions ([[Australian Classification of Health Interventions|ACHI]]), Australian Coding Standards ([[Australian Coding Standards|ACS]]). Clinical coding is a specialised skill requiring excellent knowledge of medical terminology and disease processes, attention to detail, and analytical skills.&lt;ref name="clinicalcoding.health.wa.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalcoding.health.wa.gov.au/about/|title=Clinical coding in Western Australia|work=health.wa.gov.au|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical coder is responsible for abstracting relevant information from the medical record and deciding which diagnoses and procedures meet criteria for coding as per Australian and State Coding Standards. The coder then assigns codes for these diagnoses and procedures based on [[ICD-10-AM]] conventions and standards.&lt;ref name="clinicalcoding.health.wa.gov.au"/&gt;

===Uses===
The assigned codes and other patient data are processed by grouper software to determine a [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) for the episode of care, which is used for funding and reimbursement. This process allows hospital episodes to be grouped into meaningful categories, helping us to better match patient needs to health care resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.vic.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The coded information is  used for clinical governance, clinical audit and outcome and effectiveness of patient's care and treatment.
Statistically this information is used to keep a track of payment by results, cost analysis, commissioning, etiology studies, health trends, epidemiology studies, clinical indicators and case-mix planning.

==Veterinary medical coding==

==History==
[[File:Charles Sherwood Stratton.png|100px|thumb|[[Charles Sherwood Stratton]] as "General Tom Thumb", circa 1861]]
Merriam-Webster dictionary states that the first use of the term "midget" was in 1816.&lt;ref name = "MW def"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/midget ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' Entry for '''midget''': ''sometimes offensive: a very small person; specifically: a person of unusually small size who is physically well-proportioned. '']&lt;/ref&gt;

Midgets have always been popular entertainers, but were often regarded with [[disgust]] and [[wikt:revulsion|revulsion]] in society. In the early 19th century, however, midgets were romanticized by the middle class and regarded with the same affectionate condescension extended to children, as creatures of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY0MDlK4_gsC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;dq=The+American+Circus+:+an+illustrated+history#v=onepage&amp;q=commodore%20nutt&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 January 2018|last=Ashby|first=LeRoy|date=12 May 2006|title=With Amusement for All: a history of American popular culture since 1830|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|place=Lexington|isbn=9780813123974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "midget" came into prominence in the mid-19th century after [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] used it in her novels ''Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands'' and ''[[Old Town Folks]]'' where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively.&lt;ref name='dwarfism-pbshome'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_dwarfism_ety.html |title=P.O.V. - Big Enough.

Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from "[[morbidity]]", which is either the [[prevalence]] or [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of a disease,&lt;ref name=Porta-2014-morbidity-rate&gt;{{cite book| editor-last=Porta| editor-first=M| title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okf1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189| year=2014 | edition=5th| publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford| isbn=978-0-19-939005-2| page=189| chapter=Morbidity rate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also from the [[incidence rate]] (the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time).

In the generic form, mortality rates are calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;d/p * 10^n&lt;/math&gt;

where d represents the deaths occurring within a given time period and p represents the size of the population in which the deaths occur.

== Use in epidemiology ==
In most cases, there are few ways, if at all possible to obtain exact mortality rates, so epidemiologists use estimation to predict correct mortality rates. Mortality rates are usually difficult to predict due to language barriers, health infrastructure related issues, conflict, and other reasons. Maternal mortality has additional challenges, especially as they pertain to [[Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society|stillbirths]], abortions, and multiple births. In some countries, during the 1920s a stillbirth was defined as "a birth of at least twenty weeks' gestation in which the child shows no evidence of life after complete birth". In most countries, however, a stillbirth was defined as "the birth of a fetus, after 28 weeks of pregnancy, in which pulmonary respiration does not occur".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Death in Childbirth: An International Study of Maternal Care and Maternal Mortality 1800-1950 - Oxford Scholarship|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229971.001.0001/acprof-9780198229971|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229971.001.0001/acprof-9780198229971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Census data and vital statistics ===
Ideally, all mortality estimation would be done using vital statistics and census data.  Census data will give detailed information about the population at risk of death. The vital statistics provide information about live births and deaths in the population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timæus|first=Ian M.|date=1991|title=Measurement of Adult Mortality in Less Developed Countries: A Comparative Review|jstor=3644262|journal=Population Index|volume=57|issue=4|pages=552–568|doi=10.2307/3644262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, either census data and vital statistics data is not available. This is especially true in developing countries, countries that are in conflict, areas where natural disasters have caused mass displacement, and other areas where there is a humanitarian crisis &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Household surveys ===
Household surveys or interviews are another way in which mortality rates are often assessed. There are several methods to estimate mortality in different segments of the population. One such example is the sisterhood method. This technique involves researchers estimating maternal mortality by contacting women in populations of interest and asking whether or not they have a sister, if the sister is of child-rearing age (usually 15) and conducting an interview or written questions about possible deaths among sisters. The sisterhood method, however, does not work in cases where sisters may have died before the sister being interviewed was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=W.|last2=Brass|first2=W.|last3=Snow|first3=R. W.|date=May 1989|title=Estimating maternal mortality: the sisterhood method|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=20|issue=3|pages=125–135|issn=0039-3665|pmid=2734809|doi=10.2307/1966567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orphanhood surveys estimate mortality by questioning children are asked about the mortality of their parents. It has often been criticized as an adult mortality rate that is very biased for several reasons. The adoption effect is one such instance in which orphans often do not realize that they are adopted. Additionally,  interviewers may not realize that an adoptive or foster parent is not the child's biological parent. There is also the issue of parents being reported on by multiple children while some adults have no children, thus are not counted in mortality estimates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Widowhood surveys estimate adult mortality by responding to questions about the deceased husband or wife. One limitation of the widowhood survey surrounds the issues of divorce, where people may be more likely to report that they are widowed in places where there is the great social stigma around being a divorcee. Another limitation is that multiple marriages introduce biased estimates, so individuals are often asked about first marriage. Biases will be significant if the association of death between spouses, such as those in countries with large AIDS epidemics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sampling ===
Sampling refers to the  selection of a subset of the population of interest to efficiently gain information about the entire population. Samples should be representative of the population of interest. [[Cluster sampling]] is an approach to non-probability sampling; this is an approach in which each member of the population is assigned to a group (cluster), and then clusters are randomly selected, and all members of selected clusters are included in the sample. Often combined with stratification techniques (in which case it is called [[multistage sampling]]), cluster sampling is the approach most often used by epidemiologists. In areas of forced migration, there is more significant [[sampling error]]. Thus cluster sampling is not the ideal choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220916/|title=ESTIMATING MORTALITY RATES|last=Migration|first=National Research Council (US) Roundtable on the Demography of Forced|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 million died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''L'Empire de la honte'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf| doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

Research suggests that this enables humans to determine the suitability of potential partners based on age, in addition to other factors.&lt;ref name="Mitro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitro|first1=Susanna|last2=Gordon|first2=Amy R.|last3=Olsson|first3=Mats J.|last4=Lundström|first4=Johan N.|title=The Smell of Age: Perception and Discrimination of Body Odors of Different Ages|journal=PLOS ONE|date=30 May 2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038110|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038110|accessdate=10 February 2016|volume=7|pages=e38110|pmid=22666457|pmc=3364187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study suggested that old person smell may be the result of [[2-nonenal]], an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[aldehyde]] which is associated with human [[body odor]] alterations during [[aging]];&lt;ref name="Haze"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Haze, S. |author2=Gozu, Y. |author3=Nakamura, S. |author4=Kohno, Y. |author5=Sawano, K. |author6=Ohta, H. |author7=Yamazaki, K. | title = 2-Nonenal Newly Found in Human Body Odor Tends to Increase with Aging | journal = [[Journal of Investigative Dermatology]] | year = 2001 | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | pages = 520–4 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01287.x | pmid = 11286617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there are other hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacMillan|first1=Amanda|title=Scientists Confirm Existence of 'Old Person Smell'|url=http://news.health.com/2012/05/30/old-person-smell/|website=Health.com|publisher=Health Media Ventures, Inc.|accessdate=30 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908030246/http://news.health.com/2012/05/30/old-person-smell/|archivedate=8 September 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study failed to detect 2-nonenal at all, but found significantly increased concentrations of [[benzothiazole]], [[dimethylsulphone]], and [[nonanal]] on older subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallagher|first1=M.|last2=Wysocki|first2=C.J.|last3=Leyden|first3=J.J.|last4=Spielman|first4=A.I.|last5=Sun|first5=X.|last6=Preti|first6=G.|title=Analyses of volatile organic compounds from human skin|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|date=October 2008|volume=159|issue=4|pages=780–791|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08748.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08748.x/full|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] published a press release claiming that the human ability to identify information such as age, illness, and genetic suitability from odor is responsible for the distinctive "old man smell".  Sensory neuroscientist Johan Lundström stated, "Elderly people have a discernible underarm odor that younger people consider to be fairly neutral and not very unpleasant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/mcsc-tss052412.php|title=The special scent of age|date=30 May 2012|work=EurekAlert!|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620161908/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/mcsc-tss052412.php|archivedate=20 June 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old person smell is known as {{nihongo||加齢臭|kareishū}} in Japan, where it is of particular concern due to the high value placed on [[personal hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levenstein|first1=Steve|title=Japan's Aging Population Deals with Old Man Smell|url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/japans_aging_population_deals_with_old_man_smell_16746|website=Inventor Spot|publisher=Halcyon Solutions Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906044247/http://inventorspot.com/articles/japans_aging_population_deals_with_old_man_smell_16746|archivedate=6 September 2015|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13994">The '''Patient Activation Measure''' ('''PAM''') is a commercial product which assesses an individual's knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing one's health and [[healthcare]].  Individuals who measure high on this assessment typically understand the importance of taking a pro-active role in managing their health and have the skills and confidence to do so.

The PAM survey measures patients on a 0–100 scale and can segment patients into one of four activation levels along an empirically derived continuum. Each activation level reveals insight into an array of health-related characteristics, including attitudes, motivators, behaviors, and outcomes.

==Development and science==
PAM was developed using qualitative methods, Rasch analysis, and classical test theory [[psychometric]] methods. Developed by Judith Hibbard and colleagues at the [[University of Oregon]], the resulting 13-item measure is a uni-dimensional, interval level, Guttman-like scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hibbard|first1=Judith |last2=Stockard|first2=J |last3=Mahoney|first3=ER |last4=Tusler|first4=M |title=Development of the Patient Activation Measure (PAM): Conceptualizing and measuring activation in patients and consumers|journal=Health Services Research|date=August 2004|volume=39|issue=4|pages=1005-10026|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00269.x|pmid=15230939|pmc=1361049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hibbard|first1=Judith |last2=Mahoney|first2=Eldon R. |last3=Stockard|first3=Jean |last4=Tusler|first4=Martin |title=Development and testing of a short form of the patient activation measure|journal=Health Services Research|date=December 2005|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1918–1930|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00438.x|pmid=16336556|pmc=1361231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAM has strong psychometric properties, and has been translated into 22 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hibbard |first1=Judith |editor-last1=deBronkart |editor1-first=e-Patient Dave |date=27 July 2014 |title=[Comment on] The Patient Activation Measure (PAM): a framework for developing patient engagement |website=e-patients.net |publisher=Society for Participatory Medicine |url=http://e-patients.net/archives/2011/10/the-patient-activation-measure-pam-a-framework-for-developing-patient-engagement.html#comment-263236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure is currently used to assess patient activation or engagement by researchers and clinicians around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rademakers |first1=Jany |last2=Nijman |first2=Jessica |last3=van der Hoek |first3=Lucas |last4=Heijmans |first4=Monique |last5=Rijken |first5=Mieke |title=Measuring patient activation in the Netherlands: translation and validation of the American short form Patient Activation Measure (PAM13) |journal=BMC Public Health |date=31 July 2012 |volume=12 |page=577 |url=http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-577 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-12-577 |pmid=22849664 |pmc=3490810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brenk-Franz|first1=K |last2=Hibbard|first2=JH |last3=Herrmann|first3=WJ |last4=Freund|first4=T |last5=Szecsenyi|first5=J |last6=Djalali|first6=S |last7=Steurer-Stey|first7=C |last8=Sönnichsen|first8=A |last9=Tiesler|first9=F |last10=Storch|first10=M |last11=Schneider|first11=N |last12=Gensichen|first12=J |date=30 September 2013 |title=Validation of the German version of the patient activation measure 13 (PAM13-D) in an international multicentre study of primary care patients |journal=PLoS One |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=e74786 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074786 |pmid=24098669 |pmc=3787015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fujita|first1=Emi |last2=Kuno|first2=Eri |last3=Kato|first3=Daiji |last4=Kokochi|first4=Mariko |last5=Uehara|first5=Kumi |last6=Hirayasu|first6=Yoshio |title=精神の健康管理への積極性評価尺度(Patient Activation Measure 13 for Mental Health；PAM13-MH)日本語版の開発 |trans-title=Development and Validation of the Japanese Version of the Patient Activation Measure 13 for Mental Health |language=Japanese |journal=Seishin Igaku (Clinical Psychiatry) |date=15 August 2010 |volume=52 |pages=765–772 |doi=10.11477/mf.1405101678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinsbekk |first1=A |title=Måling av effekt av pasientopplæring |trans-title=Patient Activation Measure |language=Norwegian |journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske lægeforening |date=23 October 2008 |volume=128 |issue=20 |pages=2316–2318 |pmid=19096487 |url=http://tidsskriftet.no/article/1748238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PAM is offered to healthcare organizations exclusively by Insignia Health, a company based in [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Research==
Multiple studies show that PAM scores are predictive of most health behaviors, including preventive behaviors (e.g. obtaining [[screening (medicine)|screenings]] and [[immunization]]s); healthy behaviors (e.g. healthy diet and regular exercise); self-management behaviors (e.g. monitoring and medication management); and health information seeking.&lt;ref name="Greene 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greene |first1=Jessica |last2=Hibbard |first2=Judith H. |title=Why Does Patient Activation Matter?

The Patient Activation Measure is being used in a number of ways to improve the delivery of health care, including:
*a metric to assess the degree to which patients are prepared and able to self-manage
*to tailor support and education to help patients increase in activation
*to track the impact of interventions and tailored support on increasing patient activation levels
*to segment an enrolled patient population, and direct more resources to low activated patients (a more efficient use of resources )
*to use in population health management
*to use in predictive modeling, by using both PAM scores and clinical data, it is possible to identify future high risk/high cost patients more accurately than just using clinical data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hibbard|first1=Judith|title=Adding A Measure Of Patient Self-Management Capability To Risk Assessment Can Improve Prediction Of High Costs|journal=Health Affairs|date=March 2016|volume=35|issue=3|pages=489–494|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pejman Azarmina''' (Persian: پژمان آذرمینا, born in 1973) is an Iranian-American medical director, author, speaker and thinkocrat.&lt;ref name="Official Website of Pejman Azarmina"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarmina|first=Pejman|title=Home Page|url=http://www.azarmina.com/|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a physician working in the biopharmaceutical industry, his work was recognized leading or contributing to innovative medical projects through cross-functional teams to enhance the value of much-needed tests, medical devices and medicines for the US and global markets. Since 2012, his interest in leadership development led to the formation of multiple tools, projects and initiatives aiming to develop the next generation of holistic leaders and systems thinkers under the umbrella term of Thinkocrats.&lt;ref name="Official Website of Pejman Azarmina"/&gt;

Azarmina published Common Medical Terms, an evidence-based medical dictionary in 1995 as a student project leading a team of seven editors and 22 term-finders, which was recognized as the best student book in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Common Medical Terms, Teimourzadeh Publications, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he authored six bestselling titles named "My Doctor" describing medical topics in plain language for the public.&lt;ref&gt;My Doctor, Teimourzadeh Publications, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he co-authored Sexuality Education Wheel of Context that introduces a "context analysis" practical framework for change agents working in the field of sexuality education.&lt;ref name="Sexuality Education Wheel of Context"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexuality Education Wheel of Context|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sexuality-Education-Wheel-Context-Researchers/dp/1536854220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azarmina is also a concert musician and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santour]] instructor.&lt;ref name="Artist Biography Page on CD Baby"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarmina|first=Pejman|title=Biography|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/PejmanAzarmina|publisher=CD Baby|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has released 5 music albums, published two sheet music and wrote three chapters of Love Dynasty, a multimedia encyclopedia for Persian Music. His first solo album, Old Persian Dances was released in 1996 and contained novel rearrangements of old dance forms from the original repertoire for Persian music.&lt;ref&gt;Old Persian Dances, Kargah Mousighi, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; His next album, ''Shabdiz'', contained a collection of his compositions for solo and two santours.&lt;ref&gt;Shabdiz, Part Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Azarmina's recent albums, Persian Nostalgia and Rebellious Solitude, were released in the US and contain fine renderings of some Persian music masterpieces and advanced repertoire for the santour.&lt;ref name="Artist Biography Page on CD Baby"/&gt;

Azarmina has also been involved in philanthropic activities by being the Vice Chair of Leadership and Professional Development Forum at Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) NexGen NY and by developing and offering several leadership and professional development programs and workshop for young and talented Iranian-Americans in New York and California.&lt;ref name="PAAIA website"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAAIA Website|url=http://www.paaia.org/CMS/paaia-and-iaba-co-host-nowruz-dinner.aspx|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Azarmina was born in Tehran, Iran; started studying the [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santour]] at age 11 with Master [[Faramarz Payvar]] (1933‒2009) and graduated from his private class after completing the 'Advanced Repertoire for the Santour' (Persian: ردیف چپ کوک) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Artist Biography Page on CD Baby"/&gt;   His other music teachers include [[Hossein Dehlavi]] (music theory, harmony and songwriting) and [[Ahmad Pejman]] (composition and counterpoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shabdiz|year=2000|publisher=Part Publications|location=Tehran|isbn=964-5664-22-5|pages=g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azarmina's style of performance is perhaps one of the closest to that of late Master Payvar, yet his interpretation of Persian music is very lean, expressive, and contemporary.&lt;ref name="Artist Biography Page on CD Baby"/&gt;

Azarmina studied medicine at [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] (1992‒1999), completed a master's degree in Healthcare Management at [[University of Surrey]] (2003‒2005) and obtained a graduate certificate in Medical Informatics from [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] (2007) and a certificate in coaching from [[New York University]] (2011).&lt;ref name="Professional Profile on LinkedIn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarmina|first=Pejman|title=Professional Profile|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/azarmina|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Red Cross''' (abbreviated as '''PRC''') is a member of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

The PRC was established in 1947, with roots in the [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]]. It was initially involved only in the provision of blood and short-term palliatives as well as participation in disaster-related activities but they now focus on a wider array of humanitarian services.

At present, the PRC provides six major services: National Blood Services, Disaster Management Services, Safety Services, Health Services, Welfare Services and [[Red Cross Youth (Philippines)|Red Cross Youth]]. All of them embody the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement – humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. These values guide and inspire all Red Cross staff and volunteers, to whom being a Red Crosser is more than just a philosophy but a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redcross.org.ph/Site/PNRC/About.aspx About the Philippine Red Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Apolinario Mabini]] encouraged the [[Malolos Republic]] to form a national Red Cross organization. On February 17, 1899, the Malolos Republic approved the Constitution of the National Association of the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=PRR026000001 Constitution and by-laws of the Philippine Red Cross, February 17, 1899]&lt;/ref&gt; The government appointed [[Hilaria Aguinaldo|Hilaria del Rosario de Aguinaldo]] – the [[First Spouse of the Philippines|consort]] of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] – as the first head of the Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filipiniana.net/index.jsp Filipiniana.net Online Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipino diplomat [[Felipe Agoncillo]], met with [[Gustave Moynier]], an original member of the [[Committee of Five]] and [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] President on 29 August 1900. He sought recognition of the Filipino Red Cross Society as well as the application of the [[First Geneva Convention]] during the [[Philippine–American War]].

On August 30, 1905, the [[American Red Cross]] (ARC) formed a Philippine Branch with Filipino and American leaders at the [[Ayuntamiento]]. After several years of continuous effort, the ANRC officially recognized it as a Chapter on December 4, 1917.

In 1934, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] established an independent Philippine Red Cross. However, because the Philippines was a [[Insular Government|territory]] and later a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] under United States sovereignty, it could not sign the Geneva Conventions and therefore it could not be recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]. In 1942, during the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the Japanese created a Philippine Red Cross that they controlled to care for internees. Once [[Manila]] was liberated by combined American and Filipino forces in 1945, local Red Cross officials and the ANRC re-established an independent Red Cross.

The Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946. Dr. J. Horacio Yanzon was appointed the first Filipino Red Cross Manager in December 1946, with thirty-six Red Cross chapters initially set up in the country. On 14 February 1947, President [[Manuel A. Roxas]] signed the [[Treaty of Geneva]] and the Prisoners of War Convention. On 22 March 1947 President Roxas signed Republic Act 95, the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) Charter.

The ICRC approved the recognition of the PRC, and telegraphed First Lady [[Aurora Aragon Quezon]], the first PRC Chairman, on 29 March 1947. Philippine Red Cross (PRC) had an inaugural ceremony on 15 April 1947.

The PRC was admitted as a bona fide member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] on 17 September 1947.

Since 2004, the Chairman of the PRC Board of Governors is [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard J. Gordon]]. Since 1965, actress [[Rosa Rosal]] has sat on the Board of Governors. Rosal was awarded in 1999 the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award|Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service]] for her activities with the PRC.

===The Philippine Red Cross Act of 2009===
The consolidation of the Senate Bill 3285 and House Bill 6509 was signed by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], and is now known as Republic Act No. 10072 or The Philippine Red Cross Act of 2009. The law is an affirmation of the country's "conformity with the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols, and the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement," as well as a confirmation of Philippine Red Cross' stand as a "voluntary, independent and autonomous nongovernmental society auxiliary to the authorities of the Republic of the Philippines in the humanitarian field."

Apart from the apparent change in the organization's name from "Philippine National Red Cross" to "Philippine Red Cross" - included in the Act's new provisions is the organizations' exemption from real property taxes, direct and indirect taxes, duties and fees that will emerge from its operations and its exclusive importations and purchases.

'''Primary Care Service Areas''' are geographic areas that are self-sufficient markets of [[primary care]].

However, they have found an especially wide audience amongst policymakers and researchers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where they were first developed. Thus for example the Health Resources and Services Administration uses them to designate areas of workforce shortage. Primary Care Service Areas are thus for example an appropriate geography for measuring  primary care [[physician supply]] or geographic access to [[General practitioners]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">'''Project SIDA''' was a scientific organization to study [[AIDS]] in Africa.

==History==

Headquartered in [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]], Project SIDA was designed as a collaboration between foreign scientists with experience studying epidemics and local scientists familiar with the local culture and customs.  Initiated in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Coming Plague | date=1994 | page=351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the U.S. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the direction of [[Jonathan Mann (WHO Official)|Jonathan Mann]], Project SIDA was based at Mama Yemo hospital in Kinshasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | last=Curran | first=James W. | last2=Jaffe | first2=Harold W. | volume=60 | pages=64–69 | date = October 7, 2011 | title= AIDS: the Early Years and CDC's Response | url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a11.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project SIDA was terminated in 1991 due to civil war in Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cohen | first= Jon | title= The Rise and Fall of Projet SIDA | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue= 5343 | pages = 1565–1568 | year=1997 | url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/278/5343/1565.full | doi=10.1126/science.278.5343.1565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific outcomes==

Project SIDA operated successfully and generated over a thousand scientific abstracts.  In particular, Project SIDA scientists were among the first to document heterosexual transmission of AIDS and the existence of AIDS outside of developed countries.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-jonathan-mann-and-mary-lou-clementsmann-1196009.html |title=Obituary: Jonathan Mann and Mary Lou Clements-Mann |publisher=The Independent |first=Daniel |last=Tarantola |date=September 5, 1998 |accessdate=July 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Project SIDA also developed and supported local scientists and scientific infrastructure, in contrast to many scientists from the developed world who collected samples in Africa but did not attempt to train local staff. In addition to Mann, prominent scientists involved with Project SIDA include [[Joseph B. McCormick|Joseph McCormick]] and [[Peter Piot]].

In [[psychology]], a '''projective test''' is a [[personality test]] designed to let a person respond to ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing hidden [[emotion]]s and internal conflicts projected by the person into the test. This is sometimes contrasted with a so-called "[[objective test]]" / "self-report test", which adopt a "structured" approach as responses are analyzed according to a presumed universal standard (for example, a multiple choice exam), and are limited to the content of the test. The responses to projective tests are [[Content analysis|content analyzed]] for meaning rather than being based on presuppositions about meaning, as is the case with objective tests. Projective tests have their origins in [[psychoanalysis]], which argues that humans have conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] attitudes and motivations that are beyond or hidden from conscious awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=J.|date=2015|title=Dredging and Projecting the Depths of Personality: The Thematic Apperception Test and the Narratives of the Unconscious|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/dredging-and-projecting-the-depths-of-personality-the-thematic-apperception-test-and-the-narratives-of-the-unconscious/405157B0360F69E6D61A6900CB37A1CF#|journal=Science in Context|volume=28|pages=9–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Imuta|first=Kana|date=2013|title=Drawing a Close to the Use of Human Figure Drawings as a Projective Measure of Intelligence|pmc=3597590|journal=PLoS One|volume=8|pages=e58991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The general theoretical position behind projective tests is that whenever a specific question is asked, the response will be consciously-formulated and socially determined.  These responses do not reflect the respondent's unconscious or implicit attitudes or motivations. The respondent's deep-seated motivations may not be consciously recognized by the respondent or the respondent may not be able to verbally express them in the form and structure demanded by the questioner. Advocates of projective tests stress that the ambiguity of the stimuli presented within the tests allow subjects to express thoughts that originate on a deeper level than tapped by explicit questions, and provide content that may not be captured by responsive tools that lacks appropriate items. After some decrease in interest in the 1980s and 1990s, newer research suggesting that implicit motivation is best captured in this way has increased the research and use of these tools.

==Projective hypothesis==

This holds that an individual puts structure on an ambiguous situation in a way that is consistent with their own conscious and unconscious needs. It is an indirect method- testee is talking about something that comes spontaneously from the self without conscious awareness or editing.

*Reduces temptation to fake 
*Does not depend as much on verbal abilities 
*Taps both conscious and unconscious traits 
*Focus is clinical perspective - not normative - but has developed norms over the years &lt;ref name="neiu"&gt;Projective Methods for Personality Assessment. (n.d.). Retrieved November 21, 2012, from http://www.neiu.edu/~mecondon/proj-lec.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common variants==

===Rorschach===
{{main|Rorschach test}}
The best known and most frequently used projective test is the Rorschach inkblot test. This test was originally developed in 1921 to diagnose schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hertz|first=Marguerite R.|date=September 1986|title=Rorschachbound: A 50-Year Memoir|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.cmich.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327752jpa5003_9?needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|volume=50|issue=3|pages=396–416|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa5003_9|issn=0022-3891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects are shown a series of ten irregular but symmetrical inkblots, and asked to explain what they see .&lt;ref name = Cordon/&gt; The subject's responses are then analyzed in various ways, noting not only what was said, but the time taken to respond, which aspect of the drawing was focused on, and how single responses compared to other responses for the same drawing. It is important that the Rorschach test and other projective tests be conducted by experienced professionals to ensure validity and consistency of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verma|first1=S. K.|title="Some Popular Misconceptions about Inkblot Techniques."|journal=[[Journal of Projective Psychology &amp; Mental Health]]|date=2000|volume=7.1|pages=71–3 |url=http://search.proquest.com.libproxy.mta.ca/docview/222319580?accountid=12599|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rorschach was commonly scored using the Comprehensive System (CS), until the development of the newer scoring system, the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Gregory J.|last2=Eblin|first2=Joshua J.|date=June 2012|title=An Overview of the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS)|url=https://link-springer-com.cmich.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1007/s12207-012-9130-y|journal=Psychological Injury and Law|volume=5|issue=2|pages=107–121|doi=10.1007/s12207-012-9130-y|issn=1938-971X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new scoring system has stronger psychometric properties than the CS, and, like the CS, allows for a standardized administration of the test&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is something that is lacking in a majority of projective measures. Additional psychometric strengths present with the R-PAS  include updated normative data. The norms from the CS were updated to also include protocols from 15 other countries, resulting in updated international norms. The CS international norm data set was based on fewer countries, most of which were European only. The new international norms provide a better representation of the Western hemisphere and westernized countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Concerning differences in administration of the task across both scoring systems, a critical issue with CS administration was addressed in the development of the R-PAS. Following CS administration procedure, it was common to obtain too few or too many responses per card which could result in an invalidated protocol (due to too few responses) or in error.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The new administration procedure introduced in the R-PAS requires the clinician to initially tell the examinee that they should provide two or three responses per card, and allows the clinician to prompt for additional responses if too few are given, or to pull cards away if too many are given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, the new administration procedure addresses the critical issue of number of responses that was prevalent with use of the CS administration procedure. The CS administration procedure prevented clinicians from prompting for more responses or pulling cards when too many responses were provided. An additional psychometric improvement concerns the presentation of obtained scores. With the R-PAS system, it is now possible to change scores to percentiles and convert percentiles to standard scores which can be presented visually and allow for easy comparison to the normative data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the CS, this was not possible and it was more difficult to compare results to normative comparison groups. Lastly, the R-PAS scores have been shown to possess similar and sometimes stronger inter-rater reliability than was seen in scores from the CS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that when different clinicians score the same protocol, they are quite likely to derive the same interpretations and scores.

===Holtzman Inkblot Test===
{{main|Holtzman Inkblot Test}}
This is a variation of the Rorschach test, but uses a much larger pool of different images. Its main differences lie in its objective scoring criteria as well as limiting subjects to one response per inkblot (to avoid variable response productivity). Different variables such as reaction time are scored for an individual's response upon seeing an inkblot.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, K. R. (1972). The holtzman inkblot technique. Psychological Bulletin, 77(3), 172-194. {{doi|10.1037/h0032332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thematic apperception test===
{{main|Thematic Apperception Test}}
Another popular projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in which an individual views ambiguous scenes of people, and is asked to describe various aspects of the scene; for example, the subject may be asked to describe what led up to this scene, the emotions of the characters, and what might happen afterwards. A clinician will evaluate these descriptions, attempting to discover the conflicts, motivations and attitudes of the respondent. A researcher may use a specific scoring system that establishes consistent criteria of expressed thoughts and described behaviors associated with a specific trait, e.g., the need for Achievement, which has a validated and reliable scoring system. In the answers, the respondent "projects" their unconscious attitudes and motivations into the picture, which is why these are referred to as "projective tests."

===Draw-A-Person test===
{{main|Draw-A-Person Test}}
The Draw-A-Person test requires the subject to draw a person.  The results are based on a [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] interpretation of the details of the drawing, such as the size, shape and complexity of the facial features, clothing and background of the figure.  As with other projective tests, the approach has very little demonstrated validity and there is evidence that therapists may attribute pathology to individuals who are merely poor artists.&lt;ref name = Cordon/&gt; A similar class of techniques is [[kinetic family drawing]].

===Animal Metaphor Test===
{{main|Animal Metaphor Test}}
The Animal Metaphor test consists of a series of creative and analytical prompts in which the person filling out the test is asked to create a story and then interpret its personal significance. Unlike conventional projective tests, the Animal Metaphor Test works as both a diagnostic and therapeutic battery. Unlike the [[Rorschach test]] and TAT, the Animal Metaphor is premised on self-analysis via self-report questions. The test combines facets of art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and insight therapy, while also providing a theoretical platform of behavioral analysis. The test has been used widely as a clinical tool, as an educational assessment, and in human resource selection. The test is accompanied by an inventory, The Relational Modality Evaluation Scale, a self-report measure that targets individuals' particular ways of resolving conflict and ways of dealing with relational stress. These tests were developed by Dr. [[Albert J Levis]] at the Center for the Study of Normative Behavior in Hamden, CT, a clinical training and research center.

===Sentence completion test===
{{main|Sentence completion tests}}
Sentence completion tests require the subject complete sentence "stems" with their own words.  The subject's response is considered to be a projection of their conscious and/or unconscious attitudes, personality characteristics, motivations, and beliefs.

===Picture Arrangement Test===
{{main|Picture Arrangement Test}}
Created by Silvan Tomkins, this psychological test consists of 25 sets of 3 pictures which the subject must arrange into a sequence that they "feel makes the best sense". The reliability of this test has been disputed, however. For example, patients suffering from schizophrenia have been found to score as more "normal" than patients with no such mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrowski, Z. (1958-01-01). The Tomkins-Horn Picture Arrangement Test. The journal of nervous and mental disease, 126(1), 106. {{doi|10.1097/00005053-195801000-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other picture tests:
* Thompson version
* CAT (animals) and CAT-H (humans) 
* Senior AT 
* [[Blacky pictures test]] - dogs
* Picture Story Test - adolescents 
* Education Apperception Test -attitudes towards learning 
* Michigan Picture Test - children 8-14 
* TEMAS - Hispanic children&lt;ref&gt;[http://temastest.com/?page_id=10]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make-A-Picture-Story (MAPS) - make own pictures from figures, 6 years and older&lt;ref name="neiu"/&gt;

===Word Association Test===
{{main|Free association (psychology)}}

Word association testing is a technique developed by Carl Jung to explore complexes in the personal unconscious. Jung came to recognize the existence of groups of thoughts, feelings, memories, and perceptions, organized around a central theme, that he termed psychological complexes. This discovery was related to his research into word association, a technique whereby words presented to patients elicit other word responses that reflect related concepts in the patients’ psyche, thus providing clues to their unique psychological make-up &lt;ref name="word"&gt;Merriam-Webster. (n.d.). Retrieved November 21, 2012, from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word-association%20test&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;Spiteri, S. P. (n.d.).

===Graphology===
{{main|Graphology}}
Graphology is the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref name='Graph_Beyer_PBS'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3282_bbeyerstein.html |title=Barry Beyerstein Q&amp;A |accessdate=2008-02-22 |work=Ask the Scientists |publisher=Scientific American Frontiers }} "they simply interpret the way we form these various features on the page in much the same way ancient oracles interpreted the entrails of oxen or smoke in the air. i.e., it's a kind of magical divination or fortune telling where 'like begets like'".&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of [[handwriting]] purporting to be able to identify the writer, indicating psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluating personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{citation | title=Longman Dictionary of Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Longman Group United Kingdom | year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the [[anecdotal evidence]]  of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, most empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Statistical debate==
From the perspective of [[statistical validity]], [[psychometrics]] and [[positivism]], criticisms of projective tests, and [[depth psychology]] tests, usually include the well-known discrepancy between [[statistical validity]] and [[clinical validity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1960) ''Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II ''Las condiciones estadisticas'', p.396. Quotation: {{quotation|En esta crítica aparece siempre ''la conocida discrepancia entre la validez estadistica y clinica de todos los «tests» de psicologia profunda''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of clinical use, they rely heavily on [[clinical judgment]], lack [[reliability (statistics)|statistical reliability]] and [[statistical validity]] and many have no standardized criteria to which results may be compared, however this is not always the case. These tests are used frequently, though the [[scientific evidence]] is sometimes debated. There have been many empirical studies based on projective tests (including the use of standardized norms and samples), particularly more established tests. The criticism of lack of scientific evidence to support them and their continued popularity has been referred to as the "projective paradox".&lt;ref name = Cordon&gt;{{cite book |author=Cordón, Luis A. |title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |pages= 201–204|isbn=0-313-32457-3 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the statistical criticism of his projective test, [[Leopold Szondi]] said that his test actually discovers "fate and existential possibilities hidden in the inherited familial unconscious and the [[personal unconscious]], even those hidden because never lived through or because have been rejected. Is any statistical method able to span, understand and integrate mathematically all these possibilities? I deny this categorically."&lt;ref&gt;Szondi (1960) ''Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II ''Las condiciones estadisticas'', p.396&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research, however, has established that projective tests measure things that responsive tests do not, though it is theoretically possible to combine the two, e.g., Spangler, 1992 &lt;ref&gt;Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 172, No.1, 140-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of works by advocates, e.g., David C. McClelland, David Winter, Abigail Stewart, and, more recently, Oliver Schultheiss, have shown clear validity for these tools for certain personality traits, most especially implicit motivation (as contrasted with self-attributed or "explicit" motivation, which are conscious states) (McClelland, Koestner, &amp; Weinberger 1989), and that criticisms of projective tools based on techniques used for responsive tools is simply an inappropriate method of measurement.

==Concerns with projective tests==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}

===Assumptions===

*The more unstructured the stimuli, the more examinees reveal about their personality.
*Projection is greater to stimulus material that is similar to the examinee
*There is an "unconscious."
*Subjects are unaware of what they disclose
*Provides information about personality that is not obtainable through self-report measures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Subjects are projecting their personality onto the ambiguous stimuli they are interpreting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Gregory J.|last2=Kurtz|first2=John E.|date=October 2006|title=Advancing Personality Assessment Terminology: Time to Retire "Objective" and "Projective" As Personality Test Descriptors|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.cmich.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa8703_01|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|volume=87|issue=3|pages=223–225|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa8703_01|issn=0022-3891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In 2006 the terms "objective test" and "projective test" came under criticism in the ''[[Journal of Personality Assessment]].'' The more descriptive "rating scale or self-report measures" and "free response measures" are suggested, rather than the terms "objective tests" and "projective tests," respectively.&lt;ref name="meyer_kurtz_2006"&gt;Meyer, Gregory J. and Kurtz, John E.(2006) 'Advancing Personality Assessment Terminology: Time to Retire "Objective" and "Projective" As Personality Test Descriptors', ''Journal of Personality Assessment'', 87: 3, 223 — 225&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are inherent biases implied in the terminology itself. For example, when individuals use the term "objective" to describe a test, it is assumed that the test possess accuracy and precision. Conversely, when the term "projective" is used to describe a test, it is assumed that these measures are less accurate. Neither of these assumptions are fully accurate, and have led researchers to develop alternative terminology to describe various projective measures. For example, it has been proposed that the Rorschach be labeled as a "behavioral task" due to its ability to provide an in vivo or real life sample of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meyer_kurtz_2006" /&gt; It is easy to forget that both objective and projective tests are capable of producing objective data, and both require some form of subjective interpretation from the examiner. Objective testing, such as self-report measures, like the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI-2]], require objective responses from the examinee and subjective interpretations from the examiner. Projective testing, such as the Rorschach, requires subjective responses from the examinee, and can in theory involve objective (actuarial) interpretation.

==Uses in marketing==
Projective techniques, including TATs, are used in [[qualitative marketing research]], for example to help identify potential associations between [[brand]] images and the emotions they may provoke.  In advertising, projective tests are used to evaluate responses to advertisements. The tests have also been used in management to assess achievement motivation and other drives, in sociology to assess the adoption of innovations, and in anthropology to study cultural meaning. The application of responses is different in these disciplines than in psychology, because the responses of multiple respondents are grouped together for analysis by the organisation commissioning the research, rather than interpreting the meaning of the responses given by a single subject.

==Uses in business==
Projective techniques are used extensively in people assessment; besides variants of the TAT, which are used to identify implicit motive patterns, the Behavioral Event Interview pioneered by American psychologist [[David McClelland]] and many of its related approaches (such as the Critical Incident Interview, the Behavioral Interview, and so on) is fundamentally a projective tool in that it invites someone to tell a specific story about recent actions they took, but does not ask leading questions or questions with yes or no answers.

In January 2016, the [[GAVI Alliance]] signed an agreement with Merck under which Merck agreed to provide VSV-EBOV vaccine for future outbreaks of Ebola and GAVI paid Merck US$5 million; Merck will use the funds to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval.

In April 2017, scientists from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine published a review of the response to the Ebola outbreak that included a discussion of how clinical trial candidates were selected, how trials were designed and conducted, and reviewed the data resulting from the trials.  The committee found that data from the Phase III Guinea trial were difficult to interpret for several reasons.  The trial had no placebo arm; it was omitted for ethical reasons and everyone involved, including the committee, agreed with the decision.  This left only a delayed treatment group to serve as a control, but this group was eliminated after an interim analysis showed high levels of protection, which left the trial even more [[underpowered]].   The committee found that under an [[intention-to-treat analysis]], the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine might have had no efficacy, agreed with the authors of the December 2016 report that it probably had some efficacy, but found statements that it had substantial or 100% efficacy to be unsupportable.&lt;ref name=NAP2017/&gt;

===Career in international organizations===
In 2015, Nishtar was the Government of Pakistan's candidate to succeed [[António Guterres]] as [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]; the post eventually went to [[Filippo Grandi]] of [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/un-appoints-filippo-grandi-as-next-high-commissioner-for-refugees UN appoints Filippo Grandi as next high commissioner for refugees] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nishtar has been Pakistan's candidate to succeed [[Margaret Chan]] as Director-General of WHO.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Huet and Carmen Paun (1 June 2016), [http://www.politico.eu/article/world-health-organization-next-leader-is-it-africa-turn/ Africa eyes WHO opening] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]], which has 57 member states and aims to serve as the collective voice for Muslims, "welcomed" Nishtar’s candidacy.

Sania Nishtar was one of the two favorite candidates in the shortlisting election in January 2017, where she secured 28 out of 34 votes. She qualified to be one of the three official nominees by WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/181827-Dr-Sania-inches-closer-to-heading-World-Health-Organisation|title=Dr Sania inches closer to heading World Health Organization|last=Maqbool|first=Shahina|date=26 January 2017|work=The News International|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[image:schmoeckpfuhlgraben.jpg|thumb|the Schmöckpfuhlgraben separates Heinersdorf and Blankenburg]]

The '''Schmöckpfuhl''' is a ditch in [[Berlin-Heinersdorf|Heinersdorf]] in the [[Pankow]] district of [[Berlin]].

It meanders above ground and partly subterraneously through allotment gardens and settlements and flows finally into the [[Panke]]. It is probably fed of wastewater from the allotment gardens.

'''Seafood Watch''' is one of the best known [[Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification|sustainable seafood advisory lists]], and has influenced similar programs around the world. It is best known for developing science-based [[seafood]] recommendations that consumers, chefs, and business professionals use to inform their seafood purchasing decisions. 

Seafood Watch is a program of the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]. It has roots in the Monterey Bay Aquarium's ''Fishing for Solutions'' exhibit, which ran from 1997 to 1999 and produced a list of sustainable seafood. It was one of the first resources for sustainable seafood information together with the [[Audubon Society]]'s ''What is a fish lover to eat?'' which also came out in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishonline.org/information/|work=Fishonline|title=Background, The Sustainable Seafood Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafood Watch assesses impacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems of fisheries (wild-caught) and aquaculture (farming) operations. The assessments and calculations result in an overall scoring and final rating known as a Seafood Watch Recommendation. 

There is currently a seafood watch app for the iPhone and the Android. One of its features allows people to find restaurants and stores near them that serve ocean-friendly seafood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations/our-app|title=Seafood Watch App for Android &amp; iPhone}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sustainable seafood list==
The organization's recommendations focus on the North American market, suggesting what seafood is a green "Best Choice," yellow "Good Alternative," or a red "Avoid." The "Avoid" category is for seafood which is overfished or fished or farmed in ways that harm other marine life or the environment. Health alerts for fish with high levels of contaminants (e.g. mercury, [[dioxin]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s) are also noted, although they may appear in any category.

The Seafood Watch website includes regional, country-wide, and sushi guides for the United States. Pocket guides are available from the aquarium and further information is on the web site. Several of the regional guides are also available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The guides are updated twice annually, while the website is updated more often. Restaurants and retailers are also targeted with an educational program developed by Seafood Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/businesses-and-organizations/become-a-partner|title=Seafood Watch Become a Partner information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Seafood Watch added its “Super Green” list, which features seafood that it is good for human health and does not harm the oceans. The Super Green list highlights products that are currently on the Seafood Watch "Best Choices" (green) list, are low in environmental contaminants, and are good sources of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.

Seafood Watch partners with zoos, aquariums, science museums, nature centers, and other non-profits to promote sustainable seafood.  Its business and culinary initiatives assist seafood buyers, distributors, retailers, food service professionals, and chefs in moving the marketplace towards environmentally responsible fisheries and aquaculture operations. The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Ocean Conservation Policy team works to advance policies and management measures to improve traceability in the global seafood supply chain; eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; strengthen and advocate for fisheries management; and restore shark and Bluefin tuna populations.

==Industry criticism==

Industry organizations have pushed back against Seafood Watch's efforts. After publication of a sustainable sushi guide, the [[National Fisheries Institute]], a seafood industry trade group, wrote on its blog that the guides were "confusing and contradictory," adding that they didn't fully take into account the  economic, environmental and social aspects of seafood sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutseafood.com/press/media-blog/confusing-guidance |title=Confusing Guidelines |work= About Seafood |publisher= National Fisheries Institute |date= 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual Recovery Anonymous''' ('''SRA''') is one of several [[twelve-step program]]s for the treatment of [[sexual addiction]] based on the original [[Twelve Steps]] of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=SRA-about&gt;{{cite web|title=SRA - Our Purpose|url=http://www.sexualrecovery.org/about.html|website=sexualrecovery.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRA takes its place among various 12-step groups that seek recovery from sexual addiction: [[Sex Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sexual Compulsives Anonymous]] and [[Sexaholics Anonymous]]. The New York-based group has meetings in several states.&lt;ref name=SRA-meetings&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Meeting|url=http://www.sexualrecovery.org/find_a_meeting.html|website=sexualrecovery.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively these groups are referred to as "S" groups since all their acronyms begin with that letter.

There is a related group called SRA-ANON for spouses, relatives, friends, and significant others of SRA members.&lt;ref name=SRA-ANON&gt;{{cite web|title=SRAA-ANON|url=http://www.sexualrecovery.org/sra_anon.html|website=sexualrecovery.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group is analogous to [[Al-Anon]] for family members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA).

SRA was founded around 1993 and is said to be a "progressive offshoot" of [[Sexaholics Anonymous]] (SA) and is said to be "far more diverse" with a strong presence of women, African Americans, Asians, and members of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=thefix-what-program&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Sex Addiction Program Do You Belong In?|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/sexual-addiction-sex-recovery2002|website=The Fix|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRA also differs from SA by allowing sexual relations between two people in a “committed relationship”, while SA only allows a heterosexual spouse as an acceptable partner.&lt;ref name=the-fix-recovering&gt;{{cite web|title=Recovering From Sex Addiction|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/sex-addiction-treatment|website=The Fix|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=white-book&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexaholics Anonymous.|date=2001|publisher=SA Literature|location=Simi Valley, CA|isbn=096228873X|page=192|edition=New and rev.|quote=In SA's sobriety definition, the term "spouse" refers to one's partner in a marriage between a man and woman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deborah Danner''', 66, was fatally shot by [[New York Police Department]] Sgt. Hugh Barry on October 18, 2016, in her home in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. According to police sources, she was armed with first a pair of scissors and then a baseball bat. According to an emergency medical technician, she had put the scissors down, and never picked up a baseball bat. 

Barry was charged with murder and manslaughter in May, 2017. He was acquitted in February, 2018. 

On October 18th, 2016, a neighbor called [[911 (emergency telephone number)|911]] at 6:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. and reported that Danner was erratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/nyregion/nypd-sergeant-fatal-shooting-bronx-woman.html|title=NYPD Sergeant Fatal Shooting Bronx Woman|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police had been called to her apartment before. 

According to the police, Danner had scissors, and Barry talked her into putting them down. Then she picked up a baseball bat and swung at him. Barry shot Danner twice, fatally wounding her. He was the only officer in the bedroom, although others were on the scene.

According to court testimony by Brittney Mullings, an emergency medical technician, Mullings had arrived before Barry. Danner had put down the scissors and Mullings was talking to her. Danner was not holding anything in her hands. Mullings was trying to explain to Danner why they had arrived. Barry then arrived, and did not talk to Mullings or Danner. The police interrupted their conversation, and Danner retreated into her bedroom. Six police officers followed Danner into her bedroom, and a minute later, Mullings heard two shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/nyregion/barry-bronx-shooting-trial.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
Danner was mentally ill and had written an essay, "Living With [[Schizophrenia]]", in 2012. She was a parishioner who regularly attended [[Trinity_Church_(Manhattan)|Trinity Church Wall Street]], and was active in that community's groups and ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3146953/Living-With-Schizophrenia-by-Deborah-Danner.pdf|format=PDF|title=Living With Schizophrenia|author=Deborah Danner|website=Assets.documentcloud.org|accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Less than six hours after the death, Sergeant Barry was placed on administrative duty and stripped of his badge and gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/nyregion/nypd-sergeant-fatal-shooting-bronx-woman.html|title=NYPD Sergeant Fatal Shooting Bronx Woman|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] said at a news conference that the sergeant had not followed training or protocols for dealing with those with [[mental illness]], and for some reason had neither used his Taser nor waited for specialized officers trained to deal with such situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/opinion/the-death-of-deborah-danner.html|title=The Death of Deborah Danner|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Danner, who was black, spurred a protest on October 19. Protestors marched from her apartment building to the 43rd Precinct station house. Marchers included members of the New York [[Black Lives Matter]] chapter.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/news/protest-held-over-nypd-shooting-of-deborah-danner-in-the-bronx/1562150/|title=PROTEST HELD OVER NYPD SHOOTING OF DEBORAH DANNER IN THE BRONX|publisher=[[WABC-TV]]|date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry was arrested and charged with second-degree murder on May 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/nyregion/new-york-city-police-deborah-danner-hugh-barry-bronx-womans-shooting-death.html|title=New York City Police Sergeant Charged With Murder in Bronx Woman’s Death|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 14, 2018, Barry was acquitted by a judge in a non-jury trial. The judge ruled that although he had violated department protocol by escalating the encounter, once he found himself in a dangerous situation in which he feared for his life, he was justified in using lethal force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/nyregion/police-sergeant-acquitted-in-killing-of-mentally-ill-woman.html Police Sergeant Acquitted in Killing of Mentally Ill Woman] By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN and JAMES C.

'''St. Jude Medical Center''' is a faith-based, not-for-profit hospital,&lt;ref name="sjabout" /&gt; located in [[Fullerton, California]], which was established by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] of [[Orange, California|Orange]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="stjudemedicalcenter.org"&gt;http://www.stjudemedicalcenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the St. Joseph Health System, St. Jude Medical Center serves as a quaternary and referral center for a variety of patient services, including one of California's only accredited programs in [[spinal cord injury]], [[brain injury]], and comprehensive [[stroke rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="stjudemedicalcenter.org"/&gt;  Other areas of specialty include: high- and low-risk maternity, digestive diseases and [[GI surgery]], [[orthopedics]] and [[joint replacement]], [[neurosciences]], [[women's health]], rehabilitation, cardiac care, robotic and [[minimally-invasive surgery]], and [[cancer care]]. 

In 2014, the hospital opened the $255 million Northwest Tower,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stjudemedicalcenter.org/About-Us/Newsroom-and-Highlights/Press-Releases/2014/New-Hospital-Tower-Creates-State-s-Most-Advanced.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; which along with the Southwest Tower built several years earlier, created beautifully-designed, private patient rooms. Key areas of expansion included three entire floors dedicated to maternity services and another floor encompassing 14 "smart" surgical suites, including a "hybrid" cardiovascular suite with robotic c-arm imaging, and a dedicated neurosurgery suite with [[intraoperative MRI]]. Additional surgical technology includes da Vinci surgical robots as well as the superDimension robotic system for lung cancer treatment.

St. Jude Medical Center is one of three St. Joseph Health hospitals in Orange County – each founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange—part of a 14-hospital system within the western United States that includes outpatient services, fetal diagnostic center, as well as inpatient services. In 2014, a partnership with Hoag Hospital created an integrated health system called St. Joseph Hoag Health. 

==History==

The Sisters of St. Joseph of [[Carondelet, St. Louis|Carondelet]] began operating their first hospital in [[Eureka, California]] in 1919 in response to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu epidemic]]. The Order moved its [[convent|mother house]] to Orange County in 1922.&lt;ref name="ssj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistersofstjosephorange.org/about-us/our-history/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange: Our History|accessdate=2017-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106102625/http://www.sistersofstjosephorange.org/about-us/our-history/|archive-date=2017-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They acquired Fullerton General Hospital, a historic facility designed by [[Frederick Eley (architect)|Frederick Eley]],&lt;ref name="hf"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqNBm8X_h18C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;ots=C-46dX-zjA&amp;sig=au1nOgyz_X3w2obu3TlWIHpxV2w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA48,M1|title=Fullerton|author=Kathryn Morris, Debora Richey, Cathy Thomas|page=48|year=2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|ISBN=978-0-7385-4788-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931, but it did not meet postwar standards for operation. The Sisters began raising the one million dollars estimated as necessary to build a new hospital.&lt;ref name="sjmc" /&gt;

In 1953 a group of physicians, led by Ramiro Fernandez, M.D., met with the sisters to see about building a new hospital. It was Dr. Fernandez’s wife, Emily, who suggested the name St. Jude, the patron saint of desperate situations. 

A businessman, Miles Sharkey, donated land in western Fullerton with the stipulation that it be used to build a hospital.  Of the {{convert|17|acre}} acquired by the Sisters, the first {{convert|7.5|acre}} was deeded to them for $10.&lt;ref name="sjmc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjudemedicalcenter.org/About-Us/History-Medical-Milestones/Historical-Timeline.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 1953, the hilltop property on which St. Jude Hospital was later built was blessed and dedicated.

St. Jude's Hospital was publicly dedicated on May 11, 1957, with 2000 spectators in attendance as well as dignitaries including [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[James B. Utt]] and [[James McIntyre (cardinal)|Cardinal James McIntyre]], [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="sjmc50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjudemedicalcenter.org/images/stories/content_images/OtherImages/historicalnewspaper.pdf |title=Historical newspaper article montage, for the 50th anniversary of St. Jude Medical Center |df= }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drinking water supply and sanitation in Algeria''' is characterized by achievements and challenges. Among the achievements is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers, thanks to the country's substantial oil and gas revenues. These measures increased per capita water supply despite a rapidly increasing population. Another achievement is the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply in the capital Algiers in 2011, along with considerable improvements in [[wastewater treatment]] resulting in better water quality at beaches. These achievements were made possible through a public-private partnership with a private French water company.&lt;ref name=SEEAL/&gt; The number of wastewater treatment plants throughout the country increased rapidly from only 18 in 2000 to 113 in 2011, with 96 more under construction.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"/&gt; However, there are also many challenges. One of them is poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply.&lt;ref name=Terra/&gt; Another challenge is the pollution of water resources. There has also been insufficient progress concerning reuse of treated water, a government priority in this dry country.

==Access==
[[File:Fontaine dans la haute Casbah Alger.JPG|thumb|300px|Traditional fountains such as this one in the old city of Algiers are being replaced by piped drinking water supply to homes.]]
In 2015, in Algeria 84% of the population had access to "improved" water, 84% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were still around 7 million lacking access to "improved" water. Regarding sanitation, 88% of the population had access to "improved" sanitation, 90% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/algeria/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Algeria|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN, 84% of Algerians had access to an [[improved water source]] in 2010, including 74% that had access to drinking water on their premises. The remainder had access to fountains, standpipes, protected wells or protected springs, mostly in rural areas. 95% of Algerians had access to [[improved sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP table" /&gt; The Algerian government states that access water supply is higher than shown in the UN statistics, with 93% being linked to drinking water networks in 2010. It also says that 86% of the population are connected to sewer networks.&lt;ref name="Bouteflika"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7327833.html Algeria's drinking water supply increases by 3 times within a decade: president], Xinhua, 22 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service quality==
Only 22% of urban residents in Algeria receive water 24 hours per day. 34% receive water only once per day, 24% every second day and 14% only every third day.&lt;ref name=Terra&gt;Messaoud Terra from the Ministry of Water Resources quoting AdE figures, quoted in Algérie-Focus: 
[http://www.algerie-focus.com/blog/2013/08/un-algerien-sur-quatre-na-leau-potable-quun-jour-sur-deux/ Un Algérien sur quatre n’a l’eau potable qu’un jour sur deux], 19 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions water only comes every 10 days, such as in the [[Bouzeguène District]] and other districts in the [[Kabylie]] region. These shortages are 
poor execution and lack of completion of works, poor maintenance and numerous illegal connections to the network. Residents store water in tanks or jerry cans in their houses, or fill up jerry cans at water towers particularly during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Kamel Kaci: [http://observers.france24.com/content/20121210-algeria-kabylie-water-shortage-bouzeguene Water shortages in northern Algeria: “Washing and cooking have become luxuries”], France 24, 10 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Setif]] in Northeastern Algeria water shortages have led to protests and clashes with the police.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Online:[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=61157 Algeria's Setif region fumes: Water shortages trigger protests], 2013-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in Algiers continuous water supply was established with the help of a French private company, SUEZ, in 2011.&lt;ref name=SEEAL&gt;Jean-Marc Jahn, CEO of SEEAL: SEEAL performance in Algiers:From 8% to 100% 24/7 water supply in 3.5 years, in: Global water summit 2011:Focusing on performance, Global Water Intelligence 2011, p. 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water resources and infrastructure==
Drinking water in Algeria comes from conventional resources – surface water and groundwater – as well as non-conventional resources such as seawater desalination.

===Conventional water resources===
[[image:Taqsebt.JPG|thumb|300px|Reservoirs are a major source of drinking water in Algeria. For example, the Taksebt reservoir provides drinking water for residents of three provinces.]] 
Since rainfall is highly seasonal, surface water is stored in 72 reservoirs with a total production capacity of 7.4 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year in 2009.&lt;ref name=Takheroubt/&gt; Most of this water is used for irrigation. Total drinking water supply was about 2.8 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"/&gt; One of the largest reservoir systems in Algeria is the Beni Haroun complex in [[Mila Province]] that supplies water for irrigation and drinking water to 4 million people in six provinces in the East of Algeria. Another large system is the Taksebt complex in [[Tizi Ouzou]] in Kabylie. It supplies three provinces, including parts of the capital [[Algiers]], with drinking water. In the [[Bouira Province]], water is supplied from the Koudiat Acerdoune dam. The longest water transfer project in Algeria, dubbed "project of the century", transfers non-renewable groundwater from  [[In Salah]] to [[Tamanrasset]] in the Sahara over a distance of 750&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Takheroubt&gt;Brahim TAKHEROUBT: [http://www.semide.dz/FR/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=13090200 L'eau c'était lui!], L'Expression, 2 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 2011 at a cost of USD 2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Algeria Press Service:[http://www.aps.dz/Algeria-s-experience-in-water,106511.html Algeria’s experience in water resources management presented in Cairo], 6 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the country, such as in the valleys of [[El Oued]] and [[Ouargla]], a rising water table due to seepage from septic tanks was a major problem. Beginning in 2005 at a cost of almost 1 billion USD sewers were laid, pumping stations and treatment plants were built to convey the [[reclaimed water]] to agricultural areas for reuse.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"/&gt;

Pollution of water resources has reached a worrying degree. Groundwater in the Mitidja plain close to Algiers is polluted with nitrates, and groundwater in coastal areas is often damaged by saline intrusion from the sea due to overpumping. This is the case in the Oran, Algiers and [[Jijel]] areas. Major parts of the rivers Tafna, Macta, [[Chéliff]], Soummam and Seybousse are polluted. Some of them, such as the country's largest river, the Chéliff that supplies the Oran area, are used for drinking water supply. In the Constantine area the level of [[manganese]] and of [[chlorides]] in drinking water was close to those allowed by the WHO as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO): [http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/DZA/index.stm Algérie], Aquastat, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-conventional water resources===

==== Desalination ====
Algeria had 15 seawater desalination plants along its coast in 2011 with a capacity of 2.3 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day. It plans to build 43 more until 2019. Several desalination plants supply the [[Oran]] area that is particularly water-scarce. The first one was inaugurated in 2005 under the name Kahrama close to the industrial zone of [[Arzew]]. 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day are supplied to industry and 70,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day to the city. Two smaller plants became operational a few months later. In 2009 the first phase of a much larger plant with a capacity of 200,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day was put into production in Chatt el Hilal to supply [[Aïn Témouchent]] and Oran. Another 200,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day plant in Mostaganem was under construction as of 2010, as well as a plant in Mactaa with a capacity of 500,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day, making it one of the largest plants in the world.&lt;ref&gt;SEOR:

==== Water reuse ====
The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a priority of the state. A government decree – Decree No. 07-149 of 20 May 2007 – sets out the procedures to grant a permit for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation. However, as of 2010 only 510 hectares were irrigated with reclaimed water. An additional 3,800 hectares were  fully equipped for reuse without being operated. Studies for additional projects for irrigation of another 9,800 hectares with reclaimed water were completed.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC" /&gt;

===Infrastructure===
The water distribution system in Algeria is 105,000&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref name=Terra/&gt; AdE manages a network of 50,000&amp;nbsp;km as well as 2,528 wells, 
72 water treatment plants, 10 desalination plants, 1,141 pumping stations and 4,798 reservoirs.&lt;ref name="AdE Organisation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.ade.dz/index.php/l-entreprise-2/organisation|publisher=AdE|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sewer system is 41,000&amp;nbsp;km long and there are 113 municipal wastewater treatment plants, including 56 using activated sludge technology and 67 mostly smaller plants using different kinds of lagoon technologies. There were only 18 plants in the country in 2000; 96 more plants were under construction in 2011.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"&gt;Ministry of Water Resources:[http://www.arabwatercouncil.org/administrator/Modules/CMS/Algeria-Country-Report.pdf ALGERIA REPORT COUNTRY], presented by Hassina Hammouche, Chief Engineer DAPE, 22–24 May 2011, Dubai, retrieved on November 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water use==
[[File:Oran mer.jpg|thumb|300px|The city of Oran in the dry western part of Algeria relies increasingly on desalination, after having suffered from protracted drought.]]
According to government sources, in 2011 average water production was as high as 170 liter per capita and day.&lt;ref name=Bouteflika/&gt; As of 2000, per capita water production varied between different parts of the country. It was highest in Ghardaia with 220 liter per capita per day and lowest in Sidi Bel Abbes with only 65 liter. In Oran and Mostaganem water production was only 70 liter. Actual water use is lower than the above figures because of distribution losses. Non-revenue water, consisting of physical and administrative losses, was estimated at 40% in 2004.&lt;ref name=SOGESID&gt;SOGESID, for SEMIDE-EMWIS:[http://www.emwis.org/countries/fol749974/semide/PDF/Sogesid-algeria Approvisionnement en eau et assainissement au niveau local:Rapport par pays - Algérie], Novembre 2005, p. 4 and p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==

===Policy and regulation===
The Ministry of Water Resources is in charge of policy-making for drinking water supply and sanitation, as well as for water resources management. Within the Ministry there is a directorate for drinking water and another directorate for sanitation and the environment. The Ministry also has 48 branches in each province (wilaya) of Algeria.

===Service provision===
80% of water distribution systems in Algeria are under the responsibility of Algérienne des Eaux (AdE), a state-owned company.&lt;ref name="AdE Organisation"/&gt; Most sewer systems are under the responsibility of the Office National d'Assainissement (ONA). Both entities were created in 2001 and operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources that was established a year earlier.&lt;ref name=ONA/&gt;

AdE serves 3.4 million customers in 814 out of 1,541 municipalities. By law it is charged not only to provide water services, but also to promote water conservation and to increase public awareness. The company operates extensive water transmission systems that transfer water over long distances, often covering several provinces. AdE has branches (unités) in each of the country's 48 provinces. In each of the four largest cities of Algeria, a joint subsidiary of AdE and ONA provides water and sanitation services:
* SEEAL in Algiers and in neighboring [[Tipaza]], 
* SEACO in Constantine,
* SEOR in Oran, and
* SEATA in Annaba and in neighboring [[El Tarf]].

In other parts of its service area, AdE directly provides water services through 15 "zones", each comprising two to four provinces. In 2014, AdE had 25,000 employees.&lt;ref name="AdE Organisation"/&gt;

ONA operates sanitation systems on behalf of 708 municipalities and has more than 8,000 employees.&lt;ref name=ONA&gt;ONA:[http://www.ona.dz/article/l-ona-en-chiffres.html ONA en chiffres], retrieved on November 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It operates 68 wastewater treatment plants, about half the plants in the country. The remainder are operated by private companies operating under management contracts in the largest cities or by municipalities.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"/&gt;

The Algerian Energy Company (AEC) develops power plants as well as desalination plants. It is a subsidiary of [[Sonatrach]] and [[Sonelgaz]].

{{see also|Water privatization in Algeria}}

The private sector operates the water supply and sanitation systems of three large cities, i.e. Algiers, Oran and Constantine, under management contracts with AdE and ONA.

==Financial aspects==

===Investment and financing===
[[File:Iharen.jpg|thumb|300px|The Tamanrasset area in the Algerian Sahara benefited from a water transfer over a distance of 750km, completed in 2001 at a cost 2.5 billion US dollars.]]
Algeria plans to invest 20 billion US dollar in the water sector during the Five-Year Plan 2010-2014.&lt;ref name=Eldjazair&gt;Ammar Belhimer, Eldjazair:[http://www.eldjazaircom.dz/index.php?id_rubrique=263&amp;id_article=2638 L’eau, une priorité de l’Etat], retrieved on November 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Dams, which have accounted for 43% of water investments in 1995–2004, continue to be an important focus of water investments.&lt;ref name="MWR AWC"/&gt; Most investments are financed by the Algerian state from its vast oil and gas revenues. However, many desalination plants are financed by foreign direct investment through [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) contracts.

===Tariffs and cost recovery===
The legal basis for water and sanitation tariffs is Decree 05-13 of January 9, 2005, on tariff policy (politique de tarification). It specifies five tariff zones: the hydrographic zones of Algiers, Oran, Costantine, Chlef and Ouargla covering together the entire country. However, in practice water and sanitation tariffs are almost the same throughout the zones, with tariffs being only 3 percent lower in the Chlef zone and about 8 percent lower in the Ouargla zones compared to the three other zones. Tariffs comprise a fixed and a variable component. The decree also defines three user categories: residential; administration and services; as well as industrial and touristic. The variable tariff component for residential users increases by consumption blocks. In the highest of the four blocks is 6.5 times more expensive than in the lowest block. The tariff in the other two user categories corresponds to the tariff in the highest residential consumption block.&lt;ref name="SOGESID"/&gt; Tariffs are very low and are far from covering the costs of supply. Tariff increases have to be approved by the national government.

The first block of the residential tariffs, also called "social block" (tranche sociale), is charged until a consumption of 25 cubic meter per quarter, corresponding to 55 liter per capita per day for a family of five. In 2005 this tariff was 6.3 Algerian Dinar per cubic meter or 9 US Cents in the Algiers, Oran and Constantine zones.&lt;ref name=Boukhari&gt;Boukhari S, Djebbar Y, Abida H:[http://www.iwra.org/congress/2008/resource/authors/abs412_article.pdf Prix des services de l’eau en Algérie, un outil de gestion durable]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, this tariff remained unchanged according to the website of AdE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ade.dz/index.php/espace-client/procedure-de-branchement AdE: La tarification de l'eau potable], retrieved on March 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This tariff is about 20 times lower than water tariffs in Central Europe. The sewer tariff is even lower than the water tariff.

The European Union (EU), through the European Commission, is an important external partner for the Algerian water sector. It provided a grant of 30 million Euro in 2011 to support sanitation through a program called EAU II. An earlier 20 million Euro grant called EAU I financed the updating of the National Water Plan, an operational plan for the Ghrib dam, an early warning and forecasting system for floods in Sidi Bel Abbés as well as an electronic documentation system for the Ministry of Water Resources.&lt;ref&gt;Algeriainvest:
