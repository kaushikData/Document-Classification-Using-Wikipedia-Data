The '''Ashanti–Akim–Akwapim War''', also known as the '''Ashanti Invasion of the Gold Coast''' was the expansion of [[West Africa]]n [[Empire of Ashanti]] against the alliance of [[Akyem]] and [[Akuapem]] tribes from 1814 until 1816 for access to the coast. This battle was not a direct war on Akyem states which were never subdued by any power but, a war to get access to the coasts in which the Akyem along with Akuapem forces allied for. 

In 1814 the Ashanti, under the leadership of [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]] [[Osei Bonsu]], defeated the outnumbered Akim-Akwapim alliance,. 

After the war and with access to the coast the Ashanti followed up their victory by pillaging the coastal [[Ga people]].

The '''Council of Europe''' ('''CoE'''; {{lang-fr|Conseil de l'Europe, CdE}}) is an [[international organization|international organisation]] whose stated aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/values|title=Values|website=The Council of Europe in brief|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to uphold [[European Convention on Human Rights|human rights]], [[democracy]] and the [[Law in Europe|rule of law]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4816408.stm|title=BBC News - Profile: The Council of Europe|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, covers approximately 820 million people and operates with an annual budget of approximately half a billion [[euro|euros]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/budget Budget], Retrieved: 21 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation is distinct from the 28-nation [[European Union]] (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] which was created by the Council of Europe in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe.

Unlike the EU, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws, but it does have the power to enforce select international agreements reached by European states on various topics. The best known body of the Council of Europe is the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which enforces the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

The Council's two statutory bodies are the [[Committee of Ministers]], comprising the foreign ministers of each member state, and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]], composed of members of the national parliaments of each member state. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] is an independent institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the member states. The [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]] heads the secretariat of the organisation. Other major CoE bodies include the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]].

The headquarters of the Council of Europe are in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are its two [[official language]]s. The Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly and the [[Congress of the Council of Europe|Congress]] also use [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for some of their work.

== History ==
[[File:Palais Universitaire de Strasbourg-10 août 1949.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Plaque commemorating the first session of the Council of Europe Assembly at [[Palais Universitaire, Strasbourg|Strasbourg University]]]]
Britain's wartime leader Sir [[Winston Churchill]] was the first to suggest the creation of "a Council of Europe" in a [https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1941-1945-war-leader/national-address/ BBC radio broadcast] on 21 March 1943, while the second world war was still raging. In his own [http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1943/1943-03-21a.html words], he tried to "peer through the mists of the future to the end of the war", once victory had been achieved, and think about how to re-build and maintain peace on a shattered continent. Given that Europe had been at the origin of two world wars, the creation of such a body would be, he suggested, "a stupendous business". He returned to the idea during a well-known speech at the [[University of Zurich]] on 19 September 1946, &lt;ref name=COE_Churchill&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Archives/Selection/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe |work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}, including audio extracts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA_Churchill"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Navigator (ENA)|url=http://www.ena.lu/the_zurich_speech-020100043.html|accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including full transcript&lt;/ref&gt; throwing the full weight of his considerable post-war prestige behind it.

[[Willy Brandt]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Minister for Foreign Affairs]], is speaking.]]

The future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at a specific congress of several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and civil society in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1948. There were two schools of thought competing: some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers (in which governments were represented) and a Consultative Assembly (in which parliaments were represented), the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [[European Communities]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]  and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].

The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]]. The Statute was signed in London on that day by ten states: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Three months later, on 10 August 1949, 100 members of the Council's Consultative Assembly, parliamentarians drawn from twelve nations (Turkey and Greece had by then joined the original ten founding members), met in Strasbourg for its first plenary session, held over 18 sittings and lasting nearly a month. They debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from war, yet already facing a new East-West divide, launched the concept of a trans-national court to protect the basic human rights of every European citizen, and took the first steps towards what would in time become the [[European Union]]. 
In August 1949, [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] of Belgium was elected president of the first session of the its assembly. Spaak helped develop a network of intergovernmental contacts in many fields, such as human rights, local government, education, culture, sports, and youth policy. However,  the organization only played an advisory role, and was not nearly strong enough to achieve Spaak's long-term goals of European unification.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Guerrieri,  "From the Hague Congress to the Council of Europe: hopes, achievements and disappointments in the parliamentary way to European integration (1948–51)." ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' 34#2 (2014): 216-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic speeches at the Council of Europe ===
In 2018 an archive of all speeches made to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] by heads of state or government since the Council of Europe's creation in 1949 appeared online, the fruit of a two-year project entitled [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-EN.asp "Voices of Europe"]. At the time of its [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7112&amp;lang=2 launch], the archive comprised 263 speeches delivered over a 70-year period by some 216 Presidents, Prime Ministers, monarchs and religious leaders from 45 countries - though it continues to expand, as new speeches are added every few months. 

Some very early speeches by individuals considered to be "founding fathers" of the European institutions, even if they were not heads of state or government at the time, are also included (such as Sir [[Winston Churchill]] or [[Robert Schuman]]). Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list (such as King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], King [[Albert II of Belgium]] and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri of Luxembourg]]) as well as the speeches given by religious figures (such as [[Pope John Paul II]]) and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (such as [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] or King [[Hussein of Jordan]]). 

The full text of the speeches is given in both English and [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-FR.asp French], regardless of the original language used. The archive is searchable by country, by name, and chronologically.

== Aims and achievements ==
Article 1(a) of the Statute states that "The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm|website=conventions.coe.int|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all European states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human rights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.

While the member states of the European Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]], Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties ([[international law]]) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe. Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for European co-operation and harmony, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. "The Council of Europe and the European Union: different roles, shared values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/european-union|title=The Council of Europe and the European Union|website=www.coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Council of Europe conventions/treaties are also open for signature to non-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe.

The Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations '[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]' (UDHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention created the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.

The various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website. The Council of Europe works in the following areas:

== Institutions ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The institutions of the Council of Europe are:

* The [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]], who is elected for a term of five years by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] and heads the Secretariat of the Council of Europe. Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 29 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/historiske-artikler/offices/prime-minister-since-1814/thorbjorn-jagland/id463465/|title=Thorbjørn Jagland|last=regjeringen.no|date=2014-06-25|website=Government.no|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, he became the first Secretary General to be re-elected, commencing his second term in office on 1 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/jagland-re-elected-head-of-council-of-europe/|title=Jagland re-elected head of Council of Europe|date=2014-06-25|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]], comprising the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of all 47 member states who are represented by their [[Ministers Deputies|Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors]] accredited to the Council of Europe. Committee of Ministers' presidencies are held in alphabetical order for six months following the English alphabet: [[Turkey]] 11/2010-05/2011, [[Ukraine]] 05/2011-11/2011, the [[United Kingdom]] 11/2011-05/2012, [[Albania]] 05/2012-11/2012, [[Andorra]] 11/2012-05/2013, [[Armenia]] 05/2013-11/2013, [[Austria]] 11/2013-05/2014, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/cm/cm-chairmanship|title=Chairmanship|website=Committee of Ministers|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plenary chamber of the Council of Europe's Palace of Europe 2014 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Council's [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] [[hemicycle]]]]
* The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] (PACE), which comprises national parliamentarians from all member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://website-pace.net/en_GB/web/apce/how-it-works|title=How it works|website=website-pace.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting resolutions and recommendations to governments, the Assembly holds a dialogue with its governmental counterpart, the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe|Committee of Ministers]], and is often regarded as the "motor" of the organisation. The national parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was rapporteur for the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Dick Marty]]'s reports on secret [[CIA]] detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2006 and 2007. Other Assembly reports were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, highlighting the political and human rights situation in [[Chechnya]], identifying who was responsible for disappeared persons in [[Belarus]], chronicling threats to freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.
* The [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] (Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe), which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the Council of Europe in this field are the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] of 1985 and the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/overview|title=In brief|website=Congress &lt;br /&gt;of Local and Regional Authorities|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/origins-and-history|title=History|website=Congress &lt;br /&gt;of Local and Regional Authorities|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[European Court of Human Rights]], created under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] of 1950, is composed of a judge from each member state elected for a single, non-renewable term of nine years by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] and is headed by the elected President of the Court. The current President of the Court is Guido Raimondi from Italy. Under the recent Protocol No. 14 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the Court's case-processing was reformed and streamlined. Ratification of Protocol No. 14 was delayed by Russia for a number of years, but won support to be passed in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/194/signatures|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] is elected by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] for a non-renewable term of six years since the creation of this position in 1999. Since April 2012, this position has been held by [[Nils Muižnieks]] from Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/home|title=Home - Commissioner for Human Rights|website=Commissioner for Human Rights|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [http://www.coe.int/T/NGO/default_en.asp Conference of INGOs.] NGOs can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]]. Since the [Resolution (2003)8] adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 19 November 2003, they are given a "participatory status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/16806ecbd2|title=A word from the President on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Conference of INGOs of the Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [https://www.coe.int/en/web/youth/about-us Joint Council on Youth of the Council of Europe.] The European Steering Committee (CDEJ) on Youth and the Advisory Council (CCJ) on Youth of the Council of Europe form together the Joint Council on Youth (CMJ). The CDEJ brings together representatives of ministries or bodies responsible for youth matters from the 50 States Parties to the European Cultural Convention. The CDEJ fosters co-operation between governments in the youth sector and provides a framework for comparing national youth policies, exchanging best practices and drafting standard-setting texts. The Advisory Council on Youth comprises 30 representatives of non-governmental youth organisations and networks. It provides opinions and input from youth NGOs on all youth sector activities and ensures that young people are involved in the Council’s other activities.
* Information Offices of the Council of Europe in many member states.

[[File:EU-FR-AL-67@Strasbourg-Pharmacopée européenne 01.jpg|thumb|[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]].]]

The CoE system also includes a number of semi-autonomous structures known as "[[Partial Agreement]]s", some of which are also open to non-member states:

* The [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] in [[Paris]]
* The [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] with its [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* The [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]
* The European Support Fund ''[[Eurimages]]'' for the co-production and distribution of films

[[File:Council of Europe Agora building in Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|Council of Europe's Agora building]]
The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]], France. First meetings were held in Strasbourg's [[University of Strasbourg|University]] Palace in 1949, but the Council of Europe soon moved into its own buildings. The Council of Europe's eight main buildings are situated in the ''Quartier européen'', an area in the northeast of Strasbourg spread over the three districts of Le Wacken, La Robertsau and Quartier de l'Orangerie, where are also located the four buildings of the [[seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg]], the [[Arte]] headquarters and the seat of the [[International Institute of Human Rights]].

Building in the area started in 1949 with the predecessor of the Palais de l'Europe, the House of Europe (demolished in 1977), and came to a provisional end in 2007 with the opening of the New General Office Building, later named "Agora", in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf |date=30 January 2008 |language=French |title=Inauguration of the Agora Building |publisher=Council of Europe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528112354/http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais de l'Europe ([[Palace of Europe]]) and the [[Art Nouveau]] Villa Schutzenberger (seat of the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]) are in the Orangerie district, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the Agora Building are in the Robertsau district. The Agora building has been voted "best international business center real estate project of 2007" on 13 March 2008, at the [[MIPIM]] 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mipim.com/App/homepage.cfm?appname=100517&amp;moduleid=288&amp;campaignid=11888&amp;iUserCampaignID=43827991 |title=2008 List of MIPIM winners }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Youth Centre is located in the Wacken district.

Besides its headquarters in Strasbourg, the Council of Europe is also present in other cities and countries. The Council of Europe Development Bank has its seat in Paris, the [[North-South Centre]] of the Council of Europe is established in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and the Centre for Modern Languages is in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]. There are [[European Youth Centres]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and in Strasbourg. The European Wergeland Centre, a new Resource Centre on education for intercultural dialogue, human rights and democratic citizenship, operated in cooperation with the Norwegian Government, opened in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =European Wergeland Centre |url =http://www.theewc.org/about-the-ewc.html |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090418213025/http://www.theewc.org/about-the-ewc.html |archivedate =18 April 2009 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these offices are establishments of the Council of Europe and they share its juridical personality with privileges and immunities.

Due to persistent budgetary shortages, the Council of Europe is expected to cut down significantly the number of its activities, and thus the number of its employees, from 2011 on. This will notably affect the economy of the city of Strasbourg, where a total of 2,321 people (on 1 January 2010) are doing salaried work for the CoE. Most offices in foreign countries are expected to be closed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lalsace.fr/fr/france-monde/article/3340157,218/Reduction-drastique-des-activites-a-Strasbourg.html |title=Conseil de l'Europe – Réduction drastique des activités à Strasbourg |location=Mulhouse |date=19 June 2010 |work=L'Alsace |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member states, observers, partners ==
{{Main|Member states of the Council of Europe}}
The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] joined three months later, and [[Iceland]] and [[West Germany]] the next year. It now has 47 member states, with [[Montenegro]] being the latest to join.

Article 4 of the Council of Europe Statute specifies that membership is open to any "European" State. This has been interpreted liberally from the beginning, when Turkey was admitted, to include [[Geography of Europe#Countries bordering or spanning another continent|transcontinental states]] (such as Georgia and Azerbaijan) and states that are geographically Asian but socio-politically European (such as Armenia and Cyprus).

Nearly all [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European states]] have acceded to the Council of Europe, with the exceptions of [[Belarus]] ([[Human rights in Belarus|human rights concerns]]), [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Human rights in Kazakhstan|human rights concerns]]), and the [[Vatican City]] (a [[theocracy]]), as well as some of the territories [[List of states with limited recognition|with limited recognition]].

Besides the status as a full member, the Council of Europe has established [[Member states of the Council of Europe#Observers|other instruments for cooperation and participation]] of non-member states: observer, applicant, special guest, and partner for democracy.

== Co-operation ==

=== Non-member states ===
The Council of Europe works mainly through conventions. By drafting conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. However, several conventions have also been opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] (signed for example, by Canada, Japan, South Africa and the United States), the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada, the [[Holy See]], Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand and the United States), the Anti-[[Doping (sport)|doping]] Convention (signed, for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia) and the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] (signed for example, by Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal as well as the [[European Community]]). Non-member states also participate in several partial agreements, such as the [[Venice Commission]], the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO), the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] Commission and the [[North-South Centre]].

Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the Council of Europe on a case-by-case basis are sent to three groups of non-member entities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheNonMembres.asp?CM=14&amp;CL=ENG |title=CoE Conventions |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date=31 December 1998 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-European states: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, Syria, Tajikistan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uruguay, Venezuela and the observers Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, United States.
* European states: Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Belarus and the observer Vatican City.
* the European Community and later the [[European Union]] after its [[legal personality]] was established by the ratification of the EU's [[Lisbon Treaty]].

=== European Union ===
{{main|Council of Europe–European Union relations}}
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the "Council of Ministers") or the [[European Council]]. These belong to the [[European Union]], which is separate from the Council of Europe, although they have shared the same European flag and anthem since the 1980s because they both work for [[European integration]]. The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the European Union itself.

The Council of Europe is an entirely separate body&lt;ref name="COE_not_EU"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu/index_en.htm| title = Council of the European Union| publisher =[[European Union]]| accessdate = 2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the European Union. It is not controlled by it.

Cooperation between the [[European Union]] and the Council of Europe has recently been reinforced, notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE&amp;ShowBanner=no&amp;Target=_self|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the Convention). There are also concerns about consistency in case law – the [[European Court of Justice]] (the EU's court in [[Luxembourg]]) is treating the Convention as part of the legal system of all [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (the court in [[Strasbourg]] interpreting the Convention). Protocol No. 14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a protocol binding the EU to join. The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are.&lt;ref name="Juncker Council"&gt;{{cite web|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker|title =Council of Europe – European Union: "A sole ambition for the European continent"|year=2006|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Sessions/2006/speeches/20060411_report_JCJuncker_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reform Draft"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=24 July 2007|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=5 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808073053/http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
The beginning of co-operation between the CoE and the UN started with the agreement signed by the Secretariats of these institutions on 15 December 1951. On 17 October 1989, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] approved a resolution on granting observer status to the Council of Europe which was proposed by several member states of the CoE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/der/united-nations|title=The Council of Europe's Relations with the United Nations|website=www.coe.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Council of Europe holds [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status]] with the [[United Nations]] and is regularly represented in the [[UN General Assembly]]. It has organised the regional UN conferences against racism and on women and co-operates with the United Nations at many levels, in particular in the areas of human rights, minorities, migration and counter-terrorism. In November 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus Resolution (A/Res/71/17) on Cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe whereby it acknowledged the contribution of Council of Europe to the protection and strengthening of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, welcomed the ongoing co-operation in a variety of fields.

=== Non-governmental organisations ===
Non-governmental organisations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]] and become observers to inter-governmental committees of experts. The Council of Europe drafted the [[European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations]] in 1986, which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs. The rules for [[Consultative Status]] for INGOs appended to the resolution (93)38 "On relation between the Council of Europe and [[international nongovernmental organizations|non-governmental organisations]]", adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies.
On 19 November 2003 the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status, "considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the Organisation's policy and work programme".&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=Res%282003%298&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383] (Resolution Res (2003)8)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
On 30 May 2018, the Council of Europe signed a [[Memorandum of understanding]] with the European [[Association football|football]] confederation [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA and the Council of Europe sign Memorandum of Understanding |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2561781.html |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe also signed an agreement with FIFA in which the two agreed to strengthen future cooperation in areas of common interests. The deal which included cooperation between member states in the sport of football and safety and security at football matches, was finalized in October 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.com/sport/1024752|title=Council of Europe and FIFA ink landmark deal on cooperation in shared areas|work=TASS|access-date=2018-12-03|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
=== Privileges and immunities ===
The General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe grants the organisation certain privileges and immunities.&lt;ref name="priv-immu-EC"&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/002.htm General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe], Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

The working conditions of staff are governed by the Council's staff regulations, which are public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/administrativetribunal/WCD/staff_en.asp Resolutions on the Council of Europe Staff Regulations], Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries and emoluments paid by the Council of Europe to its officials are tax-exempt on the basis of Article&amp;nbsp;18 of the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref name="priv-immu-EC"/&gt;

=== Symbol and anthem ===
{{Main|Symbols of Europe|Flag of Europe}}

The Council of Europe created, and has since 1955 used as its official symbol, the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] with 12 golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background.

Its  musical anthem since 1972, the "[[European Anthem]]", is based on the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme from [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth symphony]].

On 5 May 1964, the 15th anniversary of its founding, the Council of Europe established 5 May as [[Europe Day]].&lt;ref name="symbols"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flag, anthem and logo: the Council of Europe's symbols |publisher=Council of Europe |url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp |accessdate=5 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731041722/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp |archivedate=31 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide private and public use of the European Flag is encouraged to symbolise a European dimension. To avoid confusion with the [[European Union]] which subsequently adopted the same flag in the 1980s, as well as other European institutions, the Council of Europe often uses a modified version with a lower-case "e" surrounding the stars which is referred to as the "Council of Europe Logo".&lt;ref name="symbols"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Logo of the Council of Europe| publisher=Council of Europe| url=http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| accessdate = 5 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024938/http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversies==
In recent years, the Council of Europe has been criticised for doing too little to stand up to the transgressions of some of its members. In 2013 ''[[The Economist]]'' agreed, saying that the "Council of Europe's credibility is on the line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Economist|title=Azerbaijan and the Council of Europe|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/azerbaijan|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Human Rights Watch and the European Stability Initiative have called on the Council of Europe to undertake concrete actions to show that it is willing and able to return to its "original mission to protect and ensure human rights".&lt;ref name="ESI_HavelPrize"&gt;{{cite news|last1=European Stability Initiative|title=What the 2014 Havel Prize says about the Council of Europe – and what should happen now|url=http://www.esiweb.org/rumeliobserver/2014/09/29/what-the-2014-havel-prize-says-about-the-council-of-europe-and-what-should-happen-now/|accessdate=29 September 2014|agency=ESI web|issue=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues have been raised regarding [[Azerbaijan]]'s relationship to the Council of Europe, including allegations that Azerbaijan has, over a sustained period, provided bribes to Council members to vote down criticism of the authoritarian rule of the [[Ilham Aliyev|Aliyev]] regime and support motions advantageous to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan joined the Council of Europe in 2001. Since September 2014 [[Human Rights Watch]], said that Azerbaijan's "systematic crackdown on human rights defenders and other perceived government critics shows sheer contempt for its commitments to the Council of Europe".&lt;ref name=HRW_Criticism&gt;{{cite news|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=Azerbaijan: Government Repression Tarnishes Chairmanship Council of Europe’s Leadership Should Take Action|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/09/29/azerbaijan-government-repression-tarnishes-chairmanship|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Council member and Italian politician Luca Volontè was accused by Italian prosecutors of receiving over 2.3 million euros in bribes in exchange for working for Azerbaijan in the parliamentary assembly, and that in 2013 he played a key role in orchestrating the defeat of a highly critical report on the abuse of political prisoners in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Rankin, ''Council of Europe urged to investigate Azerbaijan bribery allegations'', The Guardian, 1 February 2017 [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/01/council-of-europe-urged-investigate-azerbaijan-bribery-allegations].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.1843magazine.com/features/heaping-on-the-caviar-diplomacy Matthew Valencia, ''Heaping on the Caviar Diplomacy'']&lt;/ref&gt; The money was paid to Volontè in monthly installments of 100,000 euros, starting in 2013, via four anonymous offshore companies. The payments stopped in 2014 when Volontè's bank reported them as suspicious transactions to the Milan prosecutor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=it|first=Milena|last=Gabanelli|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/17_gennaio_30/consiglio-d-europa-caso-azerbaijan-regali-milioni-2cbc0b5e-e66b-11e6-84c1-08780d9999f1.shtml?refresh_ce-cp|title=Il Consiglio d’Europa e il caso Azerbaijan tra regali e milioni|work=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arif Mammadov (ambassador)|Arif Mammadov]], former head of the Azerbaijan representation at the Council of Europe, has stated that Azerbaijan's delegation at the Council had 25 million dollars available to "bribe members of the delegations and [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Pace]] generally".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Rankin, ''Fresh claims of Azerbaijan vote-rigging at European human rights body'', The Guardian, 20 April 2017 [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/20/council-of-europe-urged-to-investigate-azerbaijan-bribery-allegations].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, Russia's voting rights have been suspended by the Council due to Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In response, Russia has started to withhold its annual membership dues in the amount of 33 million euros,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-cancels-council-of-europe-payment-members-persecuted-a7816951.html Russia cancels payment to Council of Europe after claiming its delegates are being persecuted over Crimea], The Independent. 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; placing the institution under financial strain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/russia-withholds-payments-to-the-council-of-europe/a-42792673|title=Russia withholds payments to the Council of Europe {{!}} DW {{!}} 01.03.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia claims that its suspension by the Council is unfair and demands the restoration of voting rights.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3cccaf92-d12c-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc|title=Russia tests Council of Europe in push to regain vote|last=Buckley|first=Neil|date=November 26, 2017|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Council secretary-general [[Thorbjørn Jagland]] organized a special committee to find a compromise with Russia in early 2018, a move that has been criticized as giving in to Russian pressure by Council members and academic observers, especially if voting sanctions were lifted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.boell.org/en/2018/02/21/classic-dilemma-russias-threat-withdraw-council-europe|title=A Classic Dilemma: Russia’s Threat to Withdraw from the Council of Europe|work=Heinrich Böll Stiftung European Union|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demographics of Europe.svg|thumb|[[Population growth]] and decline as of 2009 in Europe]]

Figures for the '''population of [[Europe]]''' vary according to how one [[Europe#Definition|defines]] the boundaries of Europe. According to the United Nations, the population within the standard physical geographical boundaries comprised 737 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="UNPP 2012" /&gt; In 2010 the population was 711 million,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} defining Europe's boundaries as the [[continental divide]]s of the [[Caucasus]] and [[Ural Mountains|Ural mountains]] and the [[Bosphorus | Bosporous]], and including the European parts of the countries of [[Russia]] and of [[Turkey]]. 

Europe's [[population growth]] is comparatively low, and its [[median age]] comparatively high, in relation to the world's other continents, especially compared to Asia, Africa and Latin America. Most of Europe is in a mode of [[sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is becoming less populous than the older.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028012124/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_8.htm "Figure 8: Population by Total Fertility (millions)"] in ''World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision''. United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless most European countries still have growing populations due to [[immigration]], [[population momentum]] and increases in [[life expectancy]]. Some current and past factors in European demography have included [[emigration]], [[ethnic relations]], [[Immigration#Why do people immigrate?|economic immigration]], a declining [[birth rate]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]]. 

== History ==
{{see|World_population_estimates#By_world_region}}
Estimates for historical population sizes of Europe (including Central Asia, listed under "[[former USSR]]") based on Maddison (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison, The World Economy: Historical Statistics,   Statistical Appendix (2007, ggdc.net).
Estimates cited are for the beginning of the 1st millennium ("year 0"), the beginning of the 2nd millennium ("year 1000"), and for the beginning each century since the 16th (years 1820 and 1913 are given for the 19th and 20th century, respectively, as Maddison presents detailed estimates for these years), and a projection for the year 2030.&lt;/ref&gt;  in millions, with estimated percentage of [[world population]]:

==Total population==
330,000,000 people lived in Europe in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=|edition=|pages=|year=1916|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=John C. Winston Company|author=|editor=Charles Morris|volume=|quote=|location=|title=Winston's Cumulative ...: Encyclopedia; a Comprehensive Reference Book, Volume 4|series=Winston's Cumulative ...: Encyclopedia; a Comprehensive Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNFAAQAAMAAJ|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 there were 549,000,000.&lt;ref name="UNPP 2012" /&gt; The population of Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million according to the [[United Nations]],&lt;ref name="UNPP 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/wpp/|title=World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision|publisher=UN&amp;nbsp;— Department of Economic and Social Affairs|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was slightly less than 11% of the [[world population]]. The precise figure depends on the exact definition of the geographic extent of [[Europe]]. The population of the [[European Union]] (EU) was 509 million as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00001&amp;tableSelection=1&amp;footnotes=yes&amp;labeling=labels&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat: Population on 1 January|publisher=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-EU countries situated in Europe in their entirety&lt;ref&gt;Population in million: [[Albania]] 2.9, [[Belarus]] 9.5, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] 3.5, [[Croatia]] 4.2, [[Iceland]] 0.3, [[Republic of Macedonia]] 2.1, [[Moldova]] 4.1, [[Norway]] 5.2, [[Serbia]] and [[Kosovo]] 8.9, [[Switzerland]] 8.3, [[Ukraine]] 44.7.&lt;/ref&gt; account for another 94 million. Five transcontinental countries&lt;ref&gt;Population in million: [[Armenia]] 2.9, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] 4.0, [[Kazakhstan]] 17.8, [[Russia]] 144, [[Turkey]] 78.3.&lt;/ref&gt; have a total of 247 million people, of which about half reside in Europe proper.

As it stands now, around 12% of the world's people live in Europe. If demographic trends keep their pace, its share may fall to around 7% in 2050, but still amounting to 716 million people in absolute numbers, according to the United Nations estimate.&lt;ref name="UNPP 2012" /&gt; (The decline in the percentage is partly due to high [[fertility rate]]s in other parts of the world.) The [[sub-replacement fertility]] and high life expectancy in most European states mean a declining and [[Ageing of Europe|aging population]] as it is not offset by the current immigration level. This situation is expected{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to be a challenge for their economies, political and social institutions. Countries on the edges of Europe{{clarify|date=January 2018}}, except for southern Europe, have generally stronger growth than Central European counterparts. Albania and Ireland have strong growth, hitting over 1% annually.

==Age==
{{Main|Aging of Europe}}
Mirroring their mostly sub-replacement fertility and high [[life expectancy]], European countries tend to have older populations overall. They had nine of the top ten highest median ages in national populations in 2005. Only Japan had an older population.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;United Nations Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision Highlights.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Europe}}
{{Further|Christianity in Europe|Islam in Europe}}
Over the last several centuries, religious practice has been on the decline in a process of [[secularization]]. Several European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that, on average, 51% of the citizens of the EU member states state that they believe there is a God, 26% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 20% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |title=Special Eurobarometer, biotechnology, page 204 |date=2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215001129/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Eurobarometer survey must be taken with caution, however, as there are discrepancies between it and national census results. For example, in the United Kingdom, the 2001 census revealed that over 70% of the population regarded themselves as "Christians" with only 15% professing to have no religion, though the wording of the question has been criticized as "misleading" by the [[British Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/census-2011 |title=Census 2011 |publisher=Humanism.org.uk |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 census showed a dramatic reduction to less than 60% of the population regarding themselves as "Christians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20677321 |title=BBC News - At-a-glance: Census 2011 findings |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its decline, [[Christianity]] is still the largest religion in Europe. According to a survey published in 2010, 76.2% of Europeans identified themselves as Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-exec.aspx |title=Global Christianity |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-christians/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape: Christians |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholics]] were the largest Christian group in Europe, accounting for more than 48% of European Christians.&lt;ref name="Christianity in Europe"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-europe.aspx Christianity in Europe], excluding the Asian part of Russia, including the European part of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; The second-largest Christian group in Europe was the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], who made up 32% of European Christians.&lt;ref name="Christianity in Europe"/&gt; And about 19% of European Christians were part of the [[Protestant]] tradition.

According to a 2003 study,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mattei Dogan|Dogan, Mattei]], ''Religious Beliefs in Europe: Factors of Accelerated Decline'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 47% of French people declared themselves as agnostics in 2003. This situation is often called "[[Post-Christian]] Europe". A decrease in religiousness and church attendance in western Europe (especially in [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]]) has been noted. According to a survey published in 2012 [[Atheists]] and [[Agnostics]] make up about 18.2% of the European population.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"/&gt; According to the same survey the [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] make up the majority of the population only in two [[Europe]]an countries: [[Czech Republic]] (75%) and [[Estonia]] (60%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another survey about Religiosity in the [[European Union]] from 2012 by [[Eurobarometer]], [[Christianity]] was the largest religion in the [[European Union]] (accounting for 72% of the EU population), [[Catholics]] were with 48% the largest [[Christian]] group in EU, [[Protestant]]s made up 12%, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] made up 8% and other Christians accounted for 4% of the EU population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=European Union |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agnostic|non-believers/agnostics]] accounted for 16%, [[atheists]] accounted for 7% and [[Muslims]] accounted for 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy }} The question asked was "Do you consider yourself to be...?"

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Europe}}
{{Further|Immigration to Europe}}
Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "'''peoples of Europe'''", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. The total number of  national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans. (including Europeans in Asian Russia)&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Pan, Beate Sibylle Pfeil,''Minderheitenrechte in Europa. Handbuch der europäischen Volksgruppen'' (2002). [http://www.living-diversity.eu/Introduction.html Living-diversity.eu], English translation 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest ethnic groups are the [[Russian people|Russians]], of whom 92 million reside in Europe and the Germans, with 72 million. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Spain, the designation of [[nationality]] may controversially take on [[ethnicity|ethnic]] aspects, subsuming smaller ethnic groups such as [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Breton people|Bretons]] and [[Basque people|Basques]], making it difficult to quantify a "British" or "French" ethnicity, for example.

Approximately 20 million non-Europeans live in the EU, 4% of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics |title=Migration and migrant population statistics |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ethnic Europe}}

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}

Most of the [[language]]s of [[Europe]] belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. This family is divided into a number of branches, including [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Celtic language|Celtic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. The [[Uralic languages]], which include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], also have a significant presence in Europe. The [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] families also have several European members, while the [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] and [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] families are important in the southeastern extremity of geographical Europe. The [[Basque language]] of the western [[Pyrenees]] is an [[language isolate|isolate]] unrelated to any other group, while [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] in Europe with national language status.

The [[European Union]] (EU), which currently excludes many European countries (i.e. [[Norway]], [[Russia]] and [[Switzerland]]), recognises 23 official languages as of 2007.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/index_en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619124053/http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/index_en.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 June 2006|title=EUROPA - Education and Training - Languages in Europe|date=19 June 2006|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same source, the eight most natively spoken languages in the EU are (percentage of total EU population&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;):

# 19% German
# 13% French
# 12% English
# 11% Italian
# 9%  Spanish
# 9%  [[Polish language|Polish]]
# 7%  [[Romanian language|Romanian]]
# 5%  Dutch

These figures change when foreign language skills are taken into account. The list below shows the top eight European languages ordered by total number of speakers in the EU:&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

# 49% English
# 35% German
# 26% French
# 16% Italian
# 15% Spanish
# 10% Polish
# 7% [[Russian language|Russian]]
# 6% Dutch

This makes German the most frequently spoken native language and English the most frequently spoken non-native language overall in the European Union, with German the second-most common language overall.

Languages that are not official state languages are protected in many European countries by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. These can include languages spoken by relatively many people, such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Basque language|Basque]] in Spain, as well as languages spoken by relatively few such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] in the United Kingdom.

==Genetic origins==
{{Main|Genetic history of Europe}}
{{Further|White people|Caucasoid}}{{wide image|Location European nation states (1).png|1050px|align-cap=center|Distribution and percentage of the major [[haplogroup]]s}}
''[[Homo sapiens]]'' appeared in Europe roughly 40,000 years ago, with the settlement of the [[Cro-magnon]]s. Over the prehistoric period there was continual immigration to Europe, notably by the immediate descendants of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] who migrated west after the advent of the [[Neolithic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], s.v. "Europe : The people".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA===
Studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) have suggested substantial genetic homogeneity of European populations,&lt;ref&gt;Torroni A, Achilli A, Macaulay V, Richards M, Bandelt HJ (2006): "Harvesting the fruit of the human mtDNA tree". ''Trends in Genetics'' '''22''': 339–345.&lt;/ref&gt; with only a few geographic or linguistic isolates appearing to be genetic isolates as well.&lt;ref&gt;Simoni L, Calafell F, Pettener D, Bertranpetit J, Barbujani G (2000): "Geographic patterns of mtDNA diversity in Europe". ''American Journal of Human Genetics'' '''66''': 262–278.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, analyses of the [[Y chromosome]] &lt;ref&gt;Chikhi L, Nichols RA, Barbujani G, Beaumont MA (2002): "Y genetic data support the Neolithic demic diffusion model". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' '''99''': 11008–11013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roewer L, Croucher PJ, Willuweit S, Lu TT, Kayser M, et al. (2005): "Signature of recent historical events in the European Y-chromosomal STR haplotype distribution". ''Human Genetics'' '''116''': 279–291.&lt;/ref&gt; and of autosomal diversity&lt;ref&gt;Barbujani G, Goldstein DB (2004): "Africans and Asians abroad: genetic diversity in Europe". ''Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics'' '''5''': 119–150.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown a general gradient of genetic similarity running from the southeast to the northwest of the continent.

====Y-chromosome DNA====
Listed here are the average frequencies of human [[Y-chromosome DNA]] [[haplogroup]]s found in indigenous people of geographical Europe (including only the European parts of [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml|title=European Y-DNA haplogroups frequencies by country|website=Eupedia.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population structure===
A study in May 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005472#pone.0005472.s003 Genetic Structure of Europeans: A View from the North–East], Nelis et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  that examined 19 populations from Europe using 270,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highlighted the genetic diversity of European populations corresponding to the northwest to southeast gradient and distinguished "several distinct regions" within Europe:
* [[Finland]]
* the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), western [[Russia]] and [[Poland]].
* Central and Western Europe.
* [[Italy]], South-Eastern Europe, Southern Russia.

In this study, Fst ([[Fixation index]]) was found to correlate considerably with geographic distances ranging from ≤0.0010 for neighbouring populations to 0.0230 for [[Southern Italy]] and [[Finland]]. For comparisons, pair-wise Fst of non-European samples were as follows: Europeans – Africans (Yoruba) 0.1530; Europeans – Chinese 0.1100; Africans (Yoruba) – Chinese 0.1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005472.s003 |title=Pair-wise Fst between European samples|website=Plosone.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Embassy of Canada to Croatia''' in [[Zagreb]] is the [[List of diplomatic missions of Canada|diplomatic mission of Canada]] to [[Croatia]]. This embassy also represents Canadian diplomatic relations with [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada-Kosovo Relations|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/croatia-croatie/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/Canada_Kosovo_relations.aspx?menu_id=37&amp;view=d|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visas for immigration to Canada are not processed in Zagreb, as they are processed at the Visa Section of the Embassy of Canada to Austria in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa and Immigration|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/croatia-croatie/visas/index.aspx?lang=eng&amp;menu_id=3&amp;view=d|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

The building in which the embassy is located is rented from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian orthodox]] [[Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name="Mitropolija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitropolija-zagrebacka.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34&amp;lang=sr |language= Serbian| title=Nekretnine Mitropolije Zagrebačko-ljubljanske u Zagrebu |publisher=[[Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana]]|date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was built between 1886 and 1887, and it was architecturally designed by Kuno Vajdman.&lt;ref name="Mitropolija"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the beginning of the [[War in Croatia]], the building was the seat of the metropolitanate and its museum, archive and library.&lt;ref name="Mitropolija"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 1992, the building was dynamited, after which the seat of the metropolitanate was moved to another building.&lt;ref name="Mitropolija"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the metropolitanate restored the building, they rented it to the embassy.&lt;ref name="Mitropolija"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eswatini''' ({{lang-ss|eSwatini}} {{IPA-ss|ɛswa̯ˈtiːni|}}), officially the '''Kingdom of Eswatini''' ({{lang-ss|Umbuso weSwatini}}) and also known as '''Swaziland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|z|ᵻ|l|æ|n|d|,_|-|l|ə|n|d}}), is a [[landlocked country]]  in [[Southern Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Mozambique]] to its northeast and [[South Africa]] to its north, west and south. The country and the [[Swazi people]] take their names from [[Mswati II]], the 19th-century king under whose rule Swazi territory was expanded and unified.&lt;ref name="Kuper86"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuper |first=Hilda |title=The Swazi: A South African Kingdom |year=1986 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At no more than {{convert|200|km|mi}} north to south and {{convert|130|km|mi}} east to west, Eswatini is one of the smallest countries in Africa; despite this, its climate and [[topography]] are diverse, ranging from a cool and mountainous [[highveld]] to a hot and dry [[Veld#Lowveld|lowveld]]. The population is primarily ethnic Swazis, whose language is [[siSwati]]. They established their kingdom in the mid-18th century under the leadership of [[Ngwane III]]; the present boundaries were drawn up in 1881 in the midst of the [[Scramble for Africa]].&lt;ref name="Bonner82"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bonner |first=Philip |title=Kings, Commoners and Concessionaires |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Great Britain |isbn=0521242703 |pages=9–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second Boer War]], Swaziland&lt;!-- Don't change historical references to Eswatini--&gt; was a [[British protectorate]] from 1903 until it regained its independence on 6 September 1968.&lt;ref name="Gillis99"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillis |first=Hugh |title=The Kingdom of Swaziland: Studies in Political History |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313306702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19 April 2018, the official English name was changed from Kingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini, mirroring its Swazi name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Member States |url=http://www.un.org/en/member-states/index.html#gotoE |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=30 June 2018 |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eswatini is a [[developing country]] with a small economy. With a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita of $9,714, it is classified as a country with a lower-middle income.&lt;ref name="imf2"/&gt; As a member of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) and the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), its main local trading partner is South Africa; in order to ensure economic stability, Eswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[South African rand]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Eswatini}}

Artifacts indicating human activity dating back to the early [[Stone Age]], around 200,000 years ago, have been found in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Prehistoric rock art paintings dating from as far back as c. 27,000 years ago, to as recent as the 19th century, can be found in various places around the country.&lt;ref name="South African History Online"&gt;{{cite book|last=History Online|first=South African|title=Swaziland|year=2011|publisher=South African History Online|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/places/swaziland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known inhabitants of the region were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by the Kashian hunter-tribe during the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]]. These peoples hailed from the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]]s of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century. People speaking languages ancestral to current [[Sotho languages|Sotho]] and [[Nguni languages]] began settling no later than the 11th century.&lt;ref name="BonnerPhilip"/&gt;

===Swazi settlers (18th century)===
The Swazi settlers, then known as ''the Ngwane'' (or ''bakaNgwane'') before entering Swaziland, had been settled on the banks of the [[Pongola River]]. Before that they were settled in the area of the Tembe River near present-day [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. Continuing conflict with the [[Ndwandwe]] people pushed them further north, with [[Ngwane III]] establishing his capital at Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills.&lt;ref name="BonnerPhilip"/&gt;

Under [[Sobhuza I]], the Ngwane people eventually established their capital at Zombodze in the heartland of present-day Eswatini. In this process, they conquered and incorporated the long established clans of the country known to the Swazi as ''Emakhandzambili''.&lt;ref name="BonnerPhilip"&gt;Bonner, Philip (1983). [https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/philip_bonner_kings_commoners_and_concessionairbook4you.pdf ''Kings, Commoners and Concessionaires: The Evolution and Dissolution of the Nineteenth-Century Swazi State'']. Cambridge: Cambridge U. Press. pp. 60, 85–88. {{ISBN|9780521523004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Récipient Swazi.jpg|thumb|A 19th-century Swazi artifact]]

Swaziland derives its name from a later king named [[Mswati II]]. ''KaNgwane'', named for [[Ngwane III]], is an alternative name for Swaziland the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. ''Nkhosi'' literally means "king". Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Swaziland, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide [[autonomy]], often including grants of special [[ritual]] and political status. The extent of their autonomy however was drastically curtailed by [[Mswati II|Mswati]], who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="BonnerPhilip" /&gt;

With his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the Swazis as ''Emafikamuva''. The clans who accompanied the Dlamini kings were known as the ''Bemdzabuko'' or ''true Swazi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Johnston, W. and A.K. - South African Republic. Orange Free State, Natal, Basuto Land, Etc..jpg|thumb|right|Swaziland in Southern Africa, 1896]]

The autonomy of the Swaziland nation was influenced by British and Dutch rule of southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881 the British government signed a convention recognizing Swazi independence despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognized in the [[London Convention (1884)|convention of 1884]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Because of controversial land/mineral rights and other concessions, Swaziland had a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890 following the death of King [[Mbandzeni]] in 1889. This government represented the British, the Dutch republics and the Swazi people. In 1894 a convention placed Swaziland under the [[South African Republic]] as a protectorate. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

King Ngwane V died in December 1899 during [[incwala]] after the outbreak of the Boer war. His successor [[Sobhuza II]] was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the [[Second Boer War|war]] with various skirmishes between the British and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===British rule over Swaziland (1906–1968)===
In 1903, after British victory in the Anglo-Boer war, Swaziland became a British protectorate. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the Transvaal colony was granted self-government. Following this, Swaziland was partitioned into European and non-European (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land. Sobhuza's official coronation was in December 1921 after the regency of [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]] after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the Privy council in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.&lt;ref name=Vail91&gt;{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520074203|pages=295–296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&amp;dq=Sobhuza+deputation+london&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the Swazi Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the Swazi reserves and also established the Swazi National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education. His stature grew with time and the Swazi royal leadership was successful in resisting the weakening power of the British administration and the incorporation of Swaziland into the [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Vail91 /&gt;

The constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which legislative and executive councils were established. This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council (liqoqo). Despite such opposition, elections took place and the first Legislative Council of Swaziland was constituted on 9 September 1964. Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new constitution providing for a House of Assembly and Senate was drawn up. Elections under this constitution were held in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Independence (1968–present)===
Following the 1967 elections, Swaziland was a protected state until independence was regained in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/56/enacted?view=plain|title=Swaziland Independence Act 1968|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the elections of 1973, the constitution of Swaziland was suspended by King [[Sobhuza II]] who thereafter ruled the country by decree until his death in 1982. At this point [[Sobhuza II]] had ruled Swaziland for 83 years, making him the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning monarch in history]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0520/oswaz.html|title=Swazi King ready to rule – after exams|date=20 May 1986|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=20 April 2018|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regency followed his death, with Queen Regent [[Dzeliwe Shongwe]] being head of state until 1984 when she was removed by the Liqoqo and replaced by Queen Mother [[Ntfombi Tfwala]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Mswati III]], the son of Ntfombi, was crowned king on 25 April 1986 as King and ''[[Ngwenyama|Ingwenyama]]'' of Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/04/26/Mswati-III-the-new-teenage-king-of-Swaziland-vowed/9754514875600/|title=Mswati III, the new teenage king of Swaziland, vowed...|work=UPI|date=26 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw a rise in student and labour protests pressuring the king to introduce reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/swaziland/swaziland-doubt-over-legality-protests-keep-swazis-bay-now|title=Swaziland: Doubt over legality of protests keep Swazis at bay, for now|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, progress toward constitutional reforms began, culminating with the introduction of the current Swazi constitution in 2005. This happened despite objections by political activists. The current constitution does not clearly deal with the status of political parties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first election under the new constitution, took place in 2008. [[Member of parliament|Members of parliament]] were elected from 55 constituencies (also known as tinkhundla). These MPs served five-year terms which ended in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/swaziland/constitution-politics|title=Swaziland : Constitution and politics {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=|first=|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org|publisher=The Commonwealth|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107005133/http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/swaziland/constitution-politics|archive-date=7 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Swaziland suffered an economic crisis, due to reduced [[Southern African Customs Union|SACU]] receipts. This caused the government of Swaziland to request a loan from neighbouring South Africa. However, they did not agree with the conditions of the loan, which included political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/economy/timeline-swaziland-economic-crisis-1448880|title=Timeline: Swaziland economic crisis |publisher= IOL Business Report|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was increased pressure on the Swazi government to carry out more reforms. Public protests by civic organisations and trade unions became more common. Starting in 2012, improvements in SACU receipts have eased the fiscal pressure on the Swazi government. A new parliament, the second since promulgation of the constitution, was elected on 20 September 2013. This saw the reappointment of [[Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini|Sibusiso Dlamini]], by the king, as prime minister for the third time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D1460%3Aking-re-appoints-dr-bs-dlamini-as-prime-minister%26catid%3D1%3Alatest-news|title=King re-appoints Dr. B.S.

On 19 April 2018, King [[Mswati III]] announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had renamed itself the Kingdom of Eswatini, reflecting the extant Swazi name for the state ''eSwatini'', to mark the 50th anniversary of Swazi independence. The new name, Eswatini, means "land of the [[Swazi people|Swazis]]" in the [[Swazi language]], and was partially intended to prevent confusion with the similarly named [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43821512|title=Swaziland king changes the country's name|date=19 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom of Eswatini Change Now Official|url=http://www.times.co.sz/news/118373-kingdom-of-eswatini-change-now-official.html|website=Times Of Swaziland|accessdate=25 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 19 September 2018, Eswatini workers continued their anti-government protests against low salaries.  They went on a three-day strike organized by [[Trade Union Congress of Swaziland]] (TUCOSWA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201809210158.html|title=Swaziland: Police Turn Swaziland City Into 'Warzone' As National Strike Enters Second Day|date=21 September 2018|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mswati III King of Swaziland.JPG|thumb|''[[Ngwenyama|Ingwenyama]]'' [[Mswati III]] has been [[List of Kings of Swaziland|king]] of Eswatini since 1986.]]

===Diarchy===
Eswatini is an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[diarchy|diarchy]] with constitutional provisions and Swazi law and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=209 |title=Our governance |publisher=Gov.sz |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functional [[head of state]] is the king or ''[[Ngwenyama]]'' (lit. ''Lion''), currently [[King Mswati III]], who ascended to the throne in 1986 after the death of his father [[King Sobhuza II]] in 1982 and a period of regency. According to the country's constitution, the [[Ngwenyama|Ingwenyama]] is a symbol of unity and the eternity of the Swazi nation.&lt;ref name=Const05&gt;[http://www.gov.sz/images/stories/Constitution%20of%20%20SD-2005A001.pdf The Constitution of The Kingdom of Swaziland Act, 2005], Chapter 1, Section 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

By tradition, the king reigns along with his mother (or a ritual substitute), the ''[[Ndlovukati]]'' (lit. ''She-Elephant''). The former was viewed as the administrative head of state and the latter as a spiritual and national head of state, with real power counterbalancing that of the king, but, during the long reign of Sobhuza II, the role of the ''Ndlovukati'' became more symbolic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The king appoints the prime minister from the legislature and also appoints a minority of legislators to both chambers of the [[Parliament of Swaziland|Libandla]] (parliament) with help from an advisory council. The king is allowed by the constitution to appoint some members to parliament to represent special interests. These special interests are citizens who might have been electoral candidates who were not elected, or might not have stood as candidates. This is done to balance views in parliament. Special interests could be people of particular gender or race, people of disability, the business community, civic society, scholars, chiefs and so on.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Parliament===
The Swazi [[bicameral]] Parliament or [[Libandla]] consists of the [[Senate of Swaziland|Senate]] (30 seats; 10 members appointed by the House of Assembly and 20 appointed by the monarch; to serve five-year terms) and the [[House of Assembly of Swaziland|House of Assembly]] (65 seats; 10 members appointed by the monarch and 55 elected by [[Direct election|popular vote]]; to serve five-year terms). The elections are held every five years after dissolution of parliament by the king. The last elections were held on 20 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.sz/ |title=Swaziland Elections &amp; Boundaries Commission |publisher=Elections.org.sz |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24070826 |title=BBC News – Swaziland votes in no-party election |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balloting is done on a non-party basis in all categories. All election procedures are overseen by the elections and boundaries commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/swa3.htm |title=Swaziland: Elections and Boundaries Commission |publisher=EISA |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416082843/http://eisa.org.za/WEP/swa3.htm |archivedate=16 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political culture===
At Eswatini's independence on 6 September 1968, Eswatini adopted a [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] constitution. On 12 April 1973 King Sobhuza II annulled it by decree, assuming supreme powers in all executive, judicial and legislative matters.&lt;ref name=Eisa08&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland: Tinkhundla electoral system|url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/swaziland-tinkhundla-electoral-system|publisher=Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227055747/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/swaziland-tinkhundla-electoral-system|archivedate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first non-party elections for the House of Assembly were held in 1978, and they were conducted under the [[inkhundla|tinkhundla]] as electoral constituencies determined by the King, and established an Electoral Committee appointed by the King to supervise elections.&lt;ref name=Eisa08 /&gt;

Until the 1993 election, the ballot was not secret, voters were not registered and they did not elect representatives directly. Instead, voters elected an electoral college by passing through a gate designated for the candidate of choice while officials counted them.&lt;ref name=Eisa08 /&gt; Later on, a constitutional review commission was appointed by King Mswati III in July 1996 comprising chiefs, political activists and unionists to consider public submissions and draft proposals for a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Africa South of the Sahara 2004''. Psychology Press. 2003. p. 1096.  {{ISBN|9781857431834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drafts were released for comment in May 1999 and November 2000. These were strongly criticized by civil society organisations in Swaziland and human rights organisations elsewhere. A 15-member team was announced in December 2001 to draft a new constitution; several members of this team were reported to be close to the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;''Africa South of the Sahara 2004''. Psychology Press. 2003. p. 1097.  {{ISBN|9781857431834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the constitution was put into effect. There is still much debate in the country about the constitutional reforms. From the early seventies, there was active resistance to the royal [[hegemony]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Elections===
{{further|Elections in Eswatini}}
Nominations take place at the chiefdoms. On the day of nomination, the name of the nominee is raised by a show of hand and the nominee is given an opportunity to indicate whether he or she accepts the nomination. If he or she accepts it, he or she must be supported by at least ten members of that chiefdom. The nominations are for the position of Member of Parliament, Constituency Headman (Indvuna) and the Constituency Executive Committee (Bucopho). The minimum number of nominees is four and the maximum is ten.&lt;ref name="EISA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/swatinkundla.htm |title=Swaziland: Tinkhundla electoral system |publisher=EISA |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416062059/http://eisa.org.za/WEP/swatinkundla.htm |archivedate=16 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary elections also take place at the chiefdom level. It is by secret ballot. During the Primary Elections, the voters are given an opportunity to elect the member of the executive committee (Bucopho) for that particular chiefdom. Aspiring members of parliament and the constituency Headman are also elected from each chiefdom. The secondary and final elections takes place at the various constituencies called [[Tinkhundla]].&lt;ref name="EISA"/&gt;

Candidates who won primary elections in the chiefdoms are considered nominees for the secondary elections at inkhundla or constituency level. The nominees with majority votes become the winners and they become members of parliament or constituency headman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.sz/images/stories/justice/CONDUCT%20OF%20ELECTIONS%20IN%20SWAZILAND.pdf |title=Conduct of elections in Swaziland |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/swa4.htm |title=Swaziland: Electoral system |publisher=EISA |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416090129/http://eisa.org.za/WEP/swa4.htm |archivedate=16 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===

Eswatini is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sz.one.un.org/|title=United Nations in Swaziland|website=sz.one.un.org|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/kingdom-eswatini|title=Kingdom of eSwatini {{!}} The Commonwealth|website=thecommonwealth.org|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/en/countryprofiles/kingdom-swaziland|title=Kingdom of Swaziland {{!}} African Union|website=au.int|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comesa.int/comesa-members-states/|title=COMESA Members States – Common Market for Eastern &amp; Southern Africa|work=Common Market for Eastern &amp; Southern Africa|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sadc.int/member-states/swaziland/|title=Southern African Development Community :: Eswatini|website=www.sadc.int|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judiciary===
The judicial system in Eswatini is a dual system. The 2006 constitution established a court system based on the western model consisting of four regional Magistrates Courts, a High Court and a Court of Appeal (the Supreme Court), which are independent of crown control. In addition traditional courts (Swazi Courts or National Courts) deal with minor offenses and violations of traditional Swazi law and custom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Judges are appointed by the King and are usually expatriates from South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Swaziland-JUDICIAL-SYSTEM.html|title=Swaziland – Judicial system |publisher=Nations Encyclopaedia|accessdate= 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court, which replaced the previous Court of Appeal, consists of the Chief Justice and at least four other Supreme Court judges. The High Court consists of the Chief Justice and at least four High Court judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Swaziland.html|title=The Law and Legal Research in Swaziland|publisher=Hauser Global Law School Program|accessdate= 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Military of Eswatini (Umbutfo weSwatini Defence Force) is used primarily during domestic protests, with some border and customs duties. The military has never been involved in a foreign conflict.&lt;ref name="crash"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=qw1101220382909B224|title=Crash diminishes Swaziland's air force|date=23 November 2004|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King of Swaziland|King]] is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Defence Force and the substantive Minister of the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africafocus.org/docs11/swaz1104.php |title=Swaziland: Time for Democracy? |publisher=Africafocus.org |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 3,000 personnel in the defence force, with the army being the largest component.&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=SIPRI military expenditure database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=28 March 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small air wing, which is mainly used for transporting the King as well as cargo and personnel, surveying land with search and rescue functions, and mobilising in case of a national emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-Southern-Africa/Air-force-Swaziland.html |title=Air force (Swaziland) – Sentinel Security Assessment – Southern Africa |publisher=Janes.com |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
&lt;!--This section also linked via [[Administrative divisions of Eswatini]]--&gt;
{{Districts of Swaziland Image Map}}
{{main|Regions of Eswatini}}

Eswatini is divided into four regions: [[Hhohho Region|Hhohho]], [[Lubombo Region|Lubombo]], [[Manzini Region|Manzini]] and [[Shiselweni Region|Shiselweni]]. In each of the four regions, there are several ''[[tinkhundla]]'' (singular ''inkhundla''). The regions are managed by a regional administrator, who is aided by elected members in each inkhundla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Profile: Swaziland: The local government system in Swaziland |work=Commonwealth Local Government Forum |accessdate=19 October 2014 |date=16 May 2013 |url=http://www.clgf.org.uk/userfiles/1/files/Swaziland%20local%20government%20profile%202011-12.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204654/http://www.clgf.org.uk/userfiles/1/files/Swaziland%20local%20government%20profile%202011-12.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local government is divided into differently structured rural and urban councils depending on the level of development in the area. Although there are different political structures to the local authorities, effectively the urban councils are municipalities and the rural councils are the tinkhundla. There are twelve municipalities and 55 tinkhundla.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

There are three tiers of government in the urban areas and these are city councils, town councils and town boards. This variation considers the size of the town or city. Equally there are three tiers in the rural areas which are the regional administration at the regional level, tinkhundla and chiefdoms. Decisions are made by full council based on recommendations made by the various sub-committees. The town clerk is the chief advisor in each local council council or town board.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

There are twelve declared urban areas, comprising two city councils, three town councils and seven town boards. The main cities and towns in Eswatini are [[Manzini, Swaziland|Manzini]], [[Mbabane]], [[Nhlangano]] and [[Siteki]] which are also regional capitals. The first two have city councils and the latter two have town councils. Other small towns or urban area with substantial population are [[Ezulwini]], [[Matsapha]], [[Hlatikhulu]], [[Pigg's Peak]], [[Simunye]] and [[Big Bend, Swaziland|Big Bend]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

As noted above, there are 55 tinkhundla in Eswatini and each elects one representative to the [[House of Assembly of Eswatini]]. Each inkhundla has a development committee ('''bucopho''') elected from the various constituency chiefdoms in its area for a five-year term. Bucopho bring to the inkhundla all matters of interest and concern to their various chiefdoms, and take back to the chiefdoms the decisions of the inkhundla. The chairman of the bucopho is elected at the inkhundla and is called ''indvuna ye nkhundla''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

These are the administrative regions of Eswatini. The major towns and regional capitals are also shown.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Eswatini}}
[[File:Swaziland landscape.jpg|thumb|Landscape in Eswatini]]
[[File:Swaziland Topography.png|thumb|Topographic map of Eswatini]]

Eswatini lies across a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] which runs from the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains of [[Lesotho]], north through the Eastern highlands of [[Zimbabwe]], and forms the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] of Kenya.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

A small, landlocked kingdom, Eswatini is bordered in the North, West and South by the Republic of South Africa and by Mozambique in the East. Eswatini has a land area of 17,364&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Eswatini has four separate geographical regions. These run from North to South and are determined by altitude. Eswatini is at approximately 26°30'S, 31°30'E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/sz.htm |title = Map of Swaziland |author = WorldAtlas.com, Inc |accessdate =29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eswatini has a wide variety of landscapes, from the mountains along the Mozambican border to [[savanna]]s in the east and [[rain forest]] in the northwest. Several rivers flow through the country, such as the [[Great Usutu River]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Along the eastern border with Mozambique is the Lubombo, a mountain ridge, at an altitude of around 600 metres. The mountains are broken by the [[canyon]]s of three rivers, the Ngwavuma, the [[Maputo River|Usutu]] and the [[Mbuluzi River]]. This is cattle ranching country. The western border of Eswatini, with an average altitude of 1200 metres, lies on the edge of an [[escarpment]]. Between the mountains rivers rush through deep gorges. Mbabane, the capital, is on the Highveld.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The [[Veld|Middleveld]], lying at an average 700 metres above sea level is the most densely populated region of Eswatini with a lower rainfall than the mountains. Manzini, the principal commercial and industrial city, is situated in the Middleveld.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The [[Lowveld]] of Eswatini, at around 250 metres, is less populated than other areas and presents a typical African bush country of thorn trees and grasslands. Development of the region was inhibited, in early days, by the scourge of [[malaria]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Climate===
{{further|Climate of Eswatini}}
Eswatini is divided into four climatic regions, the Highveld, Middleveld, Lowveld and Lubombo plateau. The seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere with December being mid-summer and June mid-winter. Generally speaking, rain falls mostly during the summer months, often in the form of thunderstorms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Winter is the dry season. Annual rainfall is highest on the Highveld in the West, between {{convert|1000|and|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the year. The further East, the less rain, with the Lowveld recording {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per annum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Variations in temperature are also related to the altitude of the different regions. The Highveld temperature is temperate and seldom uncomfortably hot, while the Lowveld may record temperatures around {{convert|40|°C}} in summer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

There are known to be [[List of birds of Swaziland|507 bird species]] in Eswatini, including 11 globally threatened species and four introduced species, and [[List of mammals of Swaziland|107 mammal species]] endemic to Eswatini, including the critically endangered [[South-central black rhinoceros]] and seven other endangered or vulnerable species.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Protected areas of Eswatini]] include seven nature reserves, four frontier conservation areas and three wildlife or game reserves. [[Hlane Royal National Park]], the largest park in Eswatini, is rich in bird life, including [[white-backed vulture]]s, [[White-headed vulture|white-headed]], [[Lappet-faced vulture|lappet-faced]] and [[Cape vulture]]s, raptors such as [[martial eagle]]s, [[bateleur]]s, and [[long-crested eagle]]s, and the southernmost nesting site of the [[marabou stork]].&lt;ref name="bgp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biggameparks.org/3parks_hlane.html|title=Hlane Royal National Park|work=biggameparks.org|publisher=Big Game Parks|accessdate=8 October 2009|location=Malkerns, Swaziland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Eswatini}}
[[File:Swaziland treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Eswatini's exports]]

Eswatini's economy is diverse, with agriculture, [[forestry]] and mining accounting for about 13% of GDP, manufacturing (textiles and sugar-related processing) representing 37% of GDP and services&amp;nbsp;– with government services in the lead&amp;nbsp;– constituting 50% of GDP. [[Land tenure|Title Deed]] Lands (TDLs), where the bulk of high value crops are grown (sugar, forestry, and citrus) are characterised by high levels of investment and irrigation, and high productivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

About 75% of the population is employed in [[subsistence agriculture]] upon [[Swazi Nation Land]] (SNL). In contrast with the commercial farms, Swazi Nation Land suffers from low productivity and investment. This dual nature of the Swazi economy, with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural TDLs on the one hand, and declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) on the other, may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Economic growth in Eswatini has lagged behind that of its neighbours. Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2.8%, nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) member countries. Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs, repeated droughts, the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors. Eswatini's public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizeable surpluses a decade earlier. A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Central bank swazi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Central bank of Eswatini in Mbabane]]

The considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor.  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages, transfers, and subsidies.  The wage bill today constitutes over 15% of GDP and 55% of total public spending; these are some of the highest levels on the African continent.  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has, however, reversed the fiscal situation, and a sizeable surplus was recorded since 2006. [[SACU]] revenues today account for over 60% of total government revenues.  On the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20% in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eswatini's economy is very closely linked to the [[economy of South Africa]], from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Eswatini's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]&amp;nbsp;– AGOA&amp;nbsp;– to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).  Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.  Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Southern African Customs Union.svg|thumb|Eswatini is part of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (green).]]

The continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles, the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries, and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market. Eswatini will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment. A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard, namely that Eswatini firms are among the most productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle-income countries in other regions. They compare more favourably with firms from lower middle income countries, but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is pegged to the [[South African rand]], subsuming Eswatini's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union, which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year, and worker [[remittance]]s from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Eswatini is not poor enough to merit an [[IMF]] programme; however, the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for [[foreign direct investment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Society==

===Demographics===
{{main|Demographics of Eswatini}}
[[File:Swaziland-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Swaziland's population in thousands (1961–2013)]]

The majority of Eswatini’s population is ethnically [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[White Africans]], mostly people of British and [[Afrikaner]] descent. Traditionally Swazi have been [[subsistence farmers]] and herders, but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and African refugees from [[Mozambique]]. Christianity in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Many traditionalists believe that most Swazi ascribe a special spiritual role to the monarch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

{{main|Education in Eswatini}}
[[File:School Day (3638222558).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A rural primary school in Eswatini]]
Education in Eswatini begins with pre-school education for infants, primary, secondary and high school education for general education and training (GET), and universities and colleges at tertiary level. Pre-school education is usually for children 5-year or younger after that the students can enroll in a primary school anywhere in the country. In Eswatini early childhood care and education (ECCE) centres are in the form of preschools or neighbourhood care points (NCPs). In the country 21.6% of preschool age children have access to early childhood education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=302&amp;Itemid=415 |title=Early Childhood &amp; Care Education |publisher=Gov.sz |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary education in Eswatini begins at the age of six. It is a seven-year programme that culminates with an end of Primary school Examination [SPC] in grade 7 which is a locally based assessment administered by the Examinations Council through schools. Primary Education is from grade 1 to grade 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=295&amp;Itemid=408 |title=Primary Education |publisher=Gov.sz |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary and high school education system in Eswatini is a five-year programme divided into three years junior secondary and two years senior secondary. There is an external public examination (Junior Certificate) at the end of the junior secondary that learners have to pass to progress to the senior secondary level. The Examinations Council of Eswatini (ECESWA) administers this examination. At the end of the senior secondary level, learners sit for a public examination, the Swaziland General Certificate of Secondary Education (SGCSE)&lt;!-- Don't change to "Eswatini General Certificate of Secondary Education (EGCSE)" or anything similar. The Examinations Council of Eswatini refers to it as the SGCSE and will be here. --&gt; and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) which is accredited by the Cambridge International Examination (CIE). A few schools offer the Advanced Studies (AS) programme in their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=296&amp;Itemid=409 |title=Secondary Education |publisher=Gov.sz |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King of Swaziland.jpg|thumb|King [[Mswati III]] at the reed dance festival where he will choose his next wife]]
The principal Swazi social unit is the homestead, a traditional beehive hut thatched with dry grass. In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors' quarters and guest accommodation.

Central to the traditional homestead is the cattle byre, a circular area enclosed by large logs interspaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.

The headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often [[polygamous]]. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.

The [[Sangoma]] is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called "kwetfwasa". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various reasons, such as the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on "kubhula", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural superpowers. The [[Inyanga]] (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill ("kushaya ematsambo") used to determine the cause of the sickness.

The most important cultural event in Eswatini is the [[Incwala]] ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as "first fruits ceremony", but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as "Kingship Ceremony": when there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is [[high treason]] for any other person to hold an Incwala.

Every Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors ([[induna]]s), the chiefs, the regiments, and the "bemanti" or "water people".

Eswatini's most well-known cultural event is the annual [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga Reed Dance]]. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen mother, and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be "induna" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.

The Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old "[[umchwasho]]" custom. In "umchwasho", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the [[Sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] of "umchwasho" until 19 August 2005.

Eswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per ''TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study'', February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3548">The '''European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment''' was adopted by the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]] on 26 November 1987. It was subsequently amended by two Protocols that entered into force on 1 March 2002. Overseeing compliance with its provisions of the Convention is the task of the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]], which was set up by the Convention.

After the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the Convention for the Prevention of Torture is widely regarded as being one of the most important of the Council of Europe's treaties. It has been ratified by all 47 of the Council of Europe's member states, and ratification of the Convention has been a pre-condition for all states who have joined the Council of Europe in the last few years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">The [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions]] launched in May 2006 a '''European charter for equality of women and men in local life'''. This [[charter]] is addressed to the local and regional governments of Europe, who are invited to sign it, to make a formal public commitment to the principle of [[gender equality|equality of women and men]], and to implement, within their territory, the commitments set out within the Charter.

== The six fundamental principles ==

* Equality of women and men is a fundamental right
* In order to ensure the equality of women and men, multiple discriminations based on ethnic origin, [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], religion, socio economic status... must also be addressed
* The balanced participation of women and men in [[decision-making]] is necessary for a democratic society
* [[Gender stereotypes]] and the attitudes and assumptions that arise from them must be eliminated
* A gender perspective must be taken into account in all activities of local and regional government
* Properly resourced action plans need to be drawn up and implemented.

== Background to the charter ==

CEMR has always worked to eliminate all types of discriminations, including on men/women equality issues. 
 
Throughout 2005, CEMR, with the financial support of the [[European Commission]], led a project on  The town for equality. That project aimed mainly at collecting best practice cases of gender equality in European local governments as well as at setting up a methodology to help local representatives achieve true gender equality in their municipalities.
 
At the end of the project, CEMR, still with the support of the European Commission, started a new project to draft a European charter for equality of women and men in local life. Its aim was to encourage local politicians to sign it, thus committing themselves publicly to implement the measures in the charter in their municipalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">"'''Eurotrash'''" is a [[derogatory]] term for certain [[Europe]]ans, particularly those perceived to be arrogant, affluent, and expatriates in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com |title=eurotrash |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work= Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged|publisher=Merriam-Webster |date= 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early printed uses of the term was in the early 1980s, when [[Taki Theodoracopulos]], a wealthy [[Greek people|Greek]] living in [[New York City]], wrote a newspaper column entitled "Eurotrash" in ''The East Side Express.''&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=2002-12-08| title=A New Eurofestation| author=Julia Chaplin|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E7DC103BF93BA35751C1A9649C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used into the 1990s, with American band [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]] releasing a single called "[[Euro-Trash Girl]]". The song's narrator describes a dissolute life, drifting across Europe in pursuit of an "angel in black," the titular Euro-trash girl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14232">'''Fascism in Asia''' refers to political ideologies in [[Asia]] that adhered to [[Fascism|fascist]] policies, which gained popularity in many countries in Asia during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="DuBois2011"&gt;{{citation|author=Thomas David DuBois|title=Religion and the Making of Modern East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NH4Jeh5QG4C&amp;pg=PA176|date=25 April 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49946-0|pages=176–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Asia==

===Iran===
Fascism in [[Iran]] was adhered to by the [[SUMKA]] (''Hezb-e Sosialist-e Melli-ye Kargaran-e Iran'' or the Iran National-Socialist Workers Group), a [[neo-Nazi]] party founded by [[Davud Monshizadeh]] in 1952. SUMKA copied not only the ideology of the [[Nazi Party]] but also that group's style, adopting the [[swastika]], the black shirt and the [[Hitler salute]] while Monshizadeh even sought to cultivate an appearance similar to that of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="Fardust"&gt;Hussein Fardust, ''The Rise and Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty: Memoirs of Former General Hussein'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The group became associated with opposition to [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] and the [[Tudeh Party]] while supporting the Shah over Mossadegh.&lt;ref name="Fardust"/&gt;

===Israel===

====Revisionist Maximalism====
The [[Revisionist Maximalism|Revisionist Maximalist]] short-term movement formed by [[Abba Achimeir]] in 1930 was the ideology of the right-wing fascist faction [[Brit HaBirionim]] within the [[Revisionist Zionism|Zionist Revisionist Movement]] (ZRM). Achimeir was a self-described fascist who wrote a series of articles in 1928 titled "From the Diary of a Fascist".&lt;ref name=Kaplan15&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Eran |title=The Jewish Radical Right |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0299203801 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achimeir rejected [[humanism]], [[liberalism]], and [[socialism]]; condemned liberal [[Zionism|Zionists]] for only working for middle-class Jews; and stated the need for an [[Integralism|integralist]], "pure nationalism" similar to that in Fascist Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=Kaplan15 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Stein Ugelvik (ed.). ''Fascism Outside of Europe''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-88033-988-8}}. pp. 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt; Achimeir refused to be part of reformist Zionist coalitions and insisted that he would only support revolutionary Zionists who were willing to utilize violence.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p377"&gt;Larsen, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Jewish violence in 1929 in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] resulted in a rise in support for Revisionist Maximalists and lead Achimeir to decry British rule, claiming that the English people were declining while the Jewish people were ready to flourish, saying:
{{quote|We fought the Egyptian Pharaoh, the Roman emperors, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the Russian tsars. They 'defeated' us. But where are they today? Can we not cope with a few despicable muftis or sheiks?... For us, the forefathers, the prophets, the zealots were not mythological concepts...." Abba Achimeir.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1930, Achimeir and the Revisionist-Maximalists became the largest faction within the ZRM and they called for closer relations with Fascist Italy and the Italian people, based on Achimeir's claim that Italians were deemed the least anti-Semitic people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the Revisionist Maximalists pressed the ZRM to adopt their policies, titled the "Ten Commandments of Maximalism", made "in the spirit of complete fascism".&lt;ref name="Larsen, p377"/&gt; Moderate ZRM members refused to accept this and moderate ZRM member [[Yaacov Kahan]] pressured the Revisionist Maximalists to accept the democratic nature of the ZRM and not push for the party to adopt fascist dictatorial policies.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p377"/&gt;

In spite of the Revisionist Maximalists' opposition to the [[anti-Semitism]] of the [[Nazi Party]], Achimeir was initially controversially supportive of the Nazi Party in early 1933, believing that the Nazis' rise to power was positive because it recognized that previous attempts by Germany to assimilate Jews had finally been proven to be failures.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1933, Achimeir wrote about the Nazi party, stating, "The anti-Semitic wrapping should be discarded but not its anti-Marxist core...."&lt;ref name="Larsen, p377"/&gt; Achimeir personally believed that the Nazis' anti-Semitism was just a nationalist ploy that did not have substance.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Achimeir supported the Nazis, other Zionists within the ZRM quickly condemned Achimeir and the Revisionist Maximalists for their support of Hitler.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p380"&gt;Larsen, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Achimeir, in response to the outrage, in May 1933 reversed their position and opposed Nazi Germany and began to burn down German consolates and tear down Germany's flag.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p380"/&gt; However, in 1933, Revisionist Maximalist' support quickly deteriorated and fell apart, they would not be reorganized until 1938, after Achimeir was replaced by a new leader.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p380"/&gt;

===Lebanon===
Within [[Lebanon]] two pre-war groups emerged that took their inspiration from the fascist groups active in [[Europe]] at the time. In 1936 the [[Kataeb Party]] was founded by [[Pierre Gemayel]] and this group also took its inspiration from the European fascists, also using the Hitler salute and a brown shirted uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Fisk|authorlink=Robert Fisk|title=Lebanese strike a blow at US-backed government|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-lebanese-strike-a-blow-at-usbacked-government-460547.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-08-07|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group also espoused a strong sense of nationalism and a leadership cult but it did not support [[totalitarianism]] and as a result it could not be characterised as fully fascist.&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn = 9780313262135 | pages = 203–204 / 557 | last = Reich | first = Bernard | title = Political leaders of the contemporary Middle East and North Africa: a biographical dictionary | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "JPE"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Brill | isbn = 9789004039117 | volume = 10 | pages = 45 / 227 | last = Entelis | first = John Pierre | title = Pluralism and party transformation in Lebanon: Al-Kataʼib, 1936-1970 | series = Social, economic, and political studies of the Middle East | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups are still active although neither of them demonstrates the characteristics of fascism now.

===Syria===
The [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] was founded in 1932 by [[Antun Saadeh]] with the aim of restoring independence to [[Syria]] and taking its lead from Nazism and fascism.&lt;ref name="Simon1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Simon | first=Reeva S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East |year= 1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party%22+nazi&amp;dq=%22Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party%22+nazi&amp;pgis=1 | publisher=Macmillan Reference USA | isbn=0028960114 |quote=The Syrian Social Nationalist party (SSNP) was the brainchild of Antun Sa'ada, a Greek Orthodox Lebanese who was inspired by Nazi and fascist ideologies. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group also used the Hitler salute and a symbol similar to the swastika&lt;ref name=am1987&gt;{{cite news | last=Ya’ari | first=Ehud |title=Behind the Terror |work=Atlantic Monthly |date=June 1987 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/87jun/yaari.htm |quote=[The SSNP] greet their leaders with a Hitlerian salute; sing their Arabic anthem, "Greetings to You, Syria", to the strains of "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles"; and throng to the symbol of the red hurricane, a swastika in circular motion. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes1992&gt;{{cite book | last=Pipes | first=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Pipes |title=Greater Syria |year= 1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3PsAb1uV94C | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0195060229 |quote=The SSNP flag, which features a curved swastika called the red hurricane (''zawba'a''), points to the party's fascistic origins. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rolland2003&gt;{{cite book | last= Rolland | first=John C. |title=Lebanon |year= 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JVOKeNkllgC |publisher=Nova Publishers | isbn=1590338715 |quote=[The SSNP's] red hurricane symbol was modeled after the Nazi swastika. }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Saadeh borrowed elements of Nazi ideology, notably the cult of personality and the yearning for a mythical, racially pure golden age.&lt;ref name=johnson2001&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=Michael |title=All Honourable Men |year= 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zydtz0dDntQC |publisher=I.B.Tauris | isbn=1860647154 |quote=Saadeh, the party's 'leader for life', was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and influenced by Nazi and fascist ideology. This went beyond adopting a reversed swastika as the party's symbol and singing the party's anthem to ''Deutschland über alles'', and included developing the cult of a leader, advocating totalitarian government, and glorifying an ancient pre-Christian past and the organic whole of the Syrian Volk or nation. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A youth group, based on the [[Hitler Youth]] template, was also organised.&lt;ref name=becker1984&gt;{{cite book | last=Becker | first=Jillian |title=The PLO: The Rise and Fall of the Palestine Liberation Organization |year= 1984 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgu7AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=SSNP+swastika&amp;dq=SSNP+swastika&amp;pgis=1 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson | isbn=0297785478 |quote=[The SSNP] had been founded in 1932 as a youth movement, deliberately modeled on Hitler's Nazi Party. For its symbol it invented a curved swastika, called the Zawbah. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Syrian [[dictator]] and [[military officer]] [[Adib Shishakli]] founded the [[Arab Liberation Movement]], based on the ideas' of  "[[Greater Syria]]" (similar to the SSNP, Shishakli's former party) and [[Arab nationalism]], but also with [[fascist]]-type elements. After the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état]] the party was banned.

====''Kai-tsu p'ai'' faction of the Kuomintang====
[[Wang Jingwei]], a right-wing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] member of the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party of China), and in particular the left-wing nationalist ''Kai-tsu p'ai'' (Reorganization) faction, was originally hostile towards fascism in Europe, but it gradually drifted to be in favour of fascism, especially towards the economic policies of [[Nazism]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Dongyoun Hwang. ''Wang Jingwei, The National Government, and the Problem of Collaboration.'' Ph.D. Dissertation, Duke University. UMI Dissertation Services, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 2000, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Stein Ugelvik (ed.). ''Fascism Outside of Europe''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-88033-988-8}}. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Jingwei visited Germany in 1936, and changed his views on fascism, speaking positively about European fascist states, saying, "Several advanced countries have already expanded their national vitality and augmented their people's strength, and are no longer afraid of foreign aggression."&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"&gt;Larsen, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Publicist T'iang Leang-Li of the People's Tribune newspaper associated with the ''Kai-tsu p'ai'' promoted the good nature of fascism in Europe while attempting to distance ''Kai-tsu p'ai'' from the overtly negative aspects of fascism and wrote in 1937: "Whatever we may think about fascist and Nazi methods and policies, we must recognize the fact that their leaders have secured the enthusiastic support of their respective nations."&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"/&gt; T'iang Leang-Li claimed that the "foolish, unwise, and even cruel things" done in the fascist states had been done in a positive manner to bring about "tremendous change in the political outlook of the German and Italian people".&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"/&gt; T'iang Leang-Li wrote articles that positively assessed the "socialist" character of Nazism. Similarly, Shih Shao-pei of the ''Kai-tsu p'ai'' rebuked Chinese critics of Nazism by saying "We in China &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have heard too much about the 'national' and other flagwaving activities of the Nazis, and not enough about the 'socialist' work they are doing."&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"/&gt; Shih Shao-pei wrote about reports of improved working conditions in German factories, the vacations given to employees by ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'', improved employer-employee relations, and the provision of public service work camps for the unemployed.&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"/&gt; Other works made by the People's Tribune spoke positively about Nazism, saying that it was bringing the "integration of the working classes ... into the National Socialist state and the abolition of ... the evil elements of modern capitalism".&lt;ref name="Larsen, p255"/&gt;

====Tohokai====
[[Tohokai]] was a Japanese Nazi party formed by [[Seigo Nakano]].

====National Socialist Workers' Party====

The '''Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions''' (also referred to as the '''Egyptian Independent Trade Union Federation'''&lt;ref name="Solidarity"&gt;[http://solidaritymagazine.org/2011/02/the-formation-of-the-constituent-body-of-the-egyptian-independent-trade-union-federation/ Solidarity Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions'''&lt;ref name="TUC"/&gt;) is the first independent trade union organization since the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]]. Labor organization had previously been completely under government control.
==Formation==
For the years leading up to the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution | Revolution]], workers had been engaged in strikes and actions against the Mubarak regime. These actions eventually coalesced into the Revolution itself and formed the movement behind the establishment of the Federation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero082313|title=Egyptian Workers After June 30 {{!}} Middle East Research and Information Project|website=www.merip.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2011, as part of the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], a meeting convened in Tahrir square led to the formation of the Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions in response to the effective state control of the [[Egyptian Trade Union Federation]].&lt;ref name="CTUWS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctuws.com/|title=دار الخدمات النقابية والعمالية {{!}} الحائزة على جائزة الجمهورية الفرنسية لحقوق الإنسان لعام 1999|website=www.ctuws.com|language=ar|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TUC"&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/international/tuc-19067-f0.cfm TUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

:*RETA
:*Retired Workers’ Union
:*Health Professionals Union
:*Teachers’ Independent Union

==Demands==
The first acts of the new federation were to call for a general strike in support of the opposition movement's demands for change, and to publish a list of demands for wage reform, welfare reform, workers rights and the release of opposition detainees. These demands received support from a number of Labour organisations internationally, including the [[International Trade Union Confederation]]&lt;ref name="ITUC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/egypt-ituc-supports-general-strike.html|title=Egypt: ITUC Supports General Strike Call and Welcomes New Independent Trade Union Federation|website=www.ituc-csi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British [[Trades Union Congress]] Touchstone Blogger, [http://www.touchstoneblog.org.uk/author/owen-tudor/ Owen Tudor].&lt;ref name="Touchstone"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.touchstoneblog.org.uk/2011/02/new-egyptian-trade-unions-play-their-part/|title=New Egyptian trade unions play their part|date=2011-02-01|work=ToUChstone blog|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the federation called for [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) against [[Israel]] and the expulsion of [[Histadrut]] from the ITUC, [http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=25349] which won the backing of the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosatu.org.za/show.php?ID=5139|title=COSATU welcomes formation of the Egyptian Independent Trade Union Federation (EITUF) and their inspirational call for BDS against Israel|website=www.cosatu.org.za|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-074-34, Besetzung der Insel Ösel, Truppenanlandung.jpg|thumb|right|300px|German troops landing at Ösel]]
The '''occupation of Estonia by the German Empire''' occurred during the later stages of the [[First World War]]. On October 11–21, 1917, when the [[Imperial German Army]] occupied the [[West Estonian archipelago]] (Moonsund archipelago), consisting of the islands of [[Saaremaa]] (''Ösel''), [[Hiiumaa]] (''Dagö''), and [[Muhu]] (''Mühn'').

Fighting ceased whilst negotiations over the [[Treaty of Brest-Litowsk]] took place. These broke down in February&lt;ref name="PBBG"&gt;{{cite book |first=Prit |last=Buttar |title=Between Giants |ISBN=9781780961637}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} and to put on the pressure against the new [[Bolshevik]] regime of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] to sign the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Germans landed on the mainland of [[Estonia]] on February 18, 1918 and marched in [[Haapsalu]] (''Hapsal'') on February 21, 1918. The Germans occupied [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] (''[[Walk, Livonia|Walk]]'') on February 22,  [[Pärnu]] (''Pernau''), [[Viljandi]] (''Fellin''), [[Tartu]] (''Dorpat'') on February 24. [[Tallinn]] (''Revel''), was occupied on February 25, 1918 and the rest of Estonia, last town taken being [[Narva]], on March 4, 1918, putting an end to both [[Republic of Estonia|the republican regime]] which had [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declared Estonia's independence]] on February 24, 1918 at Tallinn, and the rule of local Russian-Estonian [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]]. The last Red Guards escaped over River Narva on March 5, 1918.

Lieutenant General Adolf von Seckendorff arrived in Tallinn on February 28, 1918. He had acted as Military Commander of [[Third Kommandatur]] at the head of the German military administration of the West Estonian archipelago. Later in 1918, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litowsk]], the Bolsheviks renounced all claims to Estonia and Germany was free to create Baltic client states.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|19}} Estonia became part of the German [[Ober Ost]] military administration for [[Curonia]], [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]], [[Saaremaa|Ösel]], and [[Riga]].

==German Occupation==
First part of today's Estonia what was occupied was island [[Ruhnu]] (then part of [[Governorate of Livonia]]) in 1915.

During the occupation of Estonia the Germans suffered total 368 dead and about 1400 wounded soldiers. They took 20,000 Russian POW's and captured several Russian warships. One older Russian warship, battleship ''[[Russian battleship Slava|Slava]]'', was sunk during the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] just outside Muhu island. The [[Imperial German Army]] used its 60th Corps (19th Infantry Division, 77th Reserve Division, and 4th Cavalry Division) to attack Northern Livonia and Estonia. The 6th Corps (205th and 219th Infantry Divisions, and 1st Cavalry Division) attacked from West Estonian archipelago to Lihula, Virtsu, and Haapsalu.

==Estonian Declaration of Independence==
{{main|Estonian Declaration of Independence}}
Between retreating Russian and advancing German troops, the Occupation of Estonia by the German Empire approaching, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council, [[Maapäev]], declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1918. However, the German forces did not recognise the independence.

On March 23, 1918 the Commander of German 68th Corps declared the just formed Estonian Army illegal. The arrests of the leaders of the national independence movement started in June 1918. The elected head of state [[Konstantin Päts]] was sent to Germany to be kept in prison. During this whole period the [[Estonian Salvation Committee]] continued its [[Resistance movement|underground activities]], entering into relation with the [[Allies (WWI)|Western Allied powers]]. Great Britain recognised Estonian independence (de facto) on May 3, 1918, followed by France on May 18, and Italy on May 29, 1918, giving the committee a legal status of the representative of the Estonian nation.

After the [[German Revolution]], between 11 and 14 November 1918 the representatives of Germany formally handed over political power in Estonia to the national government. The departure of German troops left a void and the Russian Bolshevik troops moved in.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|19}} The [[Estonian War of Independence]] followed. On 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Peace Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the [[Republic of Estonia]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.

==United Baltic Duchy==
{{main|United Baltic Duchy}}
The Baltic German minority tried to found the [[United Baltic Duchy]]. When signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litowsk]] on March 3, 1918 Soviet Russia formally transferred Estonia to German military administration, its future status having to be determined later.

On April 12, 1918 the [[German Balts]] assembled [[Landesversammlung]] at [[Riga]]  asking the forming of [[United Duchy of Estland, Livland and Kurland]] to be incorporated to [[Imperial Germany]] in personal union with [[Hohenzollern]] family, a request presented by the [[Legislature|Landesrat]] in Riga to the [[Emperor of Germany]].

==Ober Ost==
{{main|Ober Ost}}
Tallinn, Tartu, and Narva were placed direct under the German military administration ([[Ober Ost]]), but the rest of the country were divided and administrated as [[Amtsbezirk]]s and smaller [[Ortsbezirk]]s. Usually representatives of the [[Baltic nobility]] ([[Baltic German]] feudal landowners) were appointed as local heads of administration. All [[Estonian language]] newspapers, except the German minded [[Rewaler Tagesblatt]] / [[Tallinna Päevaleht]] were forbidden. This situation lasted until November 10, 1918. Germany denounced the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with all its (then secret) additional protocols on 5 November 1918. August Winnig, the last German representative in Estonia signed the treaty with the [[Estonian Provisional Government]] on November 19, 1918 giving all the administration power to the Estonian Provisional Government. Soviet Russia invaded Estonia on November 28, 1918, starting the [[Estonian War of Independence]].

== German military administrators ==
Three German military administrations (Etappenverwaltungen) - [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] and [[Ösel]] - were set up as German advance progressed. The military administrators were at first subordinated to the Ober Ost 1917 -
1918 and then to the Head of the [[Military Administration of the Baltic Lands]].

It is named after [[Cividale del Friuli]], a town in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] (Northern Italy) where it is kept. It contains about 1500 Slavic and German names of pilgrims to the monastery of [[San Giovanni di Duino]] ({{lang|sl|Štivan}}), written in the second half of the 9th and the first half of the 10th century. The monastery was a property of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]].

The Gospel contains the first known [[Croatian language|Croatian]] autographs in a Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7U0PvCMl-5gC&amp;pg=PA275 | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | title = Orthographies in Early Modern Europe | page = 275 | quote = The Latin alphabet [...] was first used to render Croatian onymic material in Latin texts (first in the famous ''Evangelario di Cividale'' with Croatian autographs from the 8th century onwards; cf.

'''''Hortobágyi palacsinta''''' is a [[Umami|savoury]] [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]] [[Palatschinken|pancake]], filled with meat (usually [[veal]]). The meat is prepared as a stew; minced meat is fried with onions and spices like the ''[[Goulash|pörkölt]]'' or the ''paprikás'' dish, using veal, veal with mushrooms, chicken, or [[Kolbász|Hungarian sausage]].The pancakes are filled with the minced meat, tucking in the ends, and are baked in the oven with a [[paprika]]&lt;ref name="Bennitt 2010 p. 584"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bennitt | first=L. | title=The Rough Guide to Europe On A Budget | publisher=Rough Guides Limited | series=Music rough guide | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-84836-458-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9jxc274bRQC&amp;pg=PA584 | page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Smetana (dairy product)|''tejföl'']] (sour cream) sauce, then topped with fresh parsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HORTOBÁGYI PALACSINTA|url=http://www.manusmenu.com/hortobagyi-palacsinta|website=manusmenu.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dish does not originate from the [[Hortobágy National Park]] region of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] and has nothing to do with Hortobágy. It was originally invented for the [[Expo 58|1958 Brussels World Fair]]. However, some Hungarian recipe books already featured a similar recipe in the 1930s. The name of the food is simply a marketing trick.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''''Jääpeili''''' is a 1928 poetry collection by Finnish poet [[Aaro Hellaakoski]], considered by contemporary Finnish literature critics to be one of his best works.

==Overview==
The poetry's innovative pictorial typography in the poems "Sade" and "[[Dolce far niente]]" recalled Apollinaire's ''Calligrammes'' (1918); "Sade" especially recalls his "Il pleut", and both are classified as [[visual poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Wim |editor1-last=Van Mierlo|editor2-first=Alexandre|editor2-last=Fachard|last=Pulkkinen|first=Pulkkinen|chapter=A Genetic and Semiotic Approach to the Bibliographical Code Exemplified by the Typography of Aaro Hellaakoski's 'Dolce Far Niente'|title=The Journal of the European Society for Textual Scholarship|date=2013|publisher=Editions Rodopi|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789401209021|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUUjAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|pages=163–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of inspiration for the poems were extracted from [[Cubism]] and the works of the Italian poet [[F.T. Marinetti]], writer of the [[Manifeste du futurisme]] (1912).

Hellaakoski's enthusiasm about urban visual landscape is present in the poems that also had connections with the youthful [[romanticism]] of other Finnish writers such as  [[Mika Waltari]] and [[Olavi Paavolainen]].

'''The King's Medal of Merit''' (Norwegian: ''Kongens fortjenstmedalje'') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] award. It was instituted in 1908 to reward meritorious achievements in the fields of art, science, business, and public service. It is divided in two classes: gold and silver. The medal in gold is rewarded for extraordinary achievements of importance to the nation and society. The medal in silver may be awarded for lesser achievements. The medal is suspended from a ribbon in the colours of the [[Royal Standard of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c28562/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28665 |title=The King's Medal of Merit |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medal in gold is ranked eighth in the ranking of [[Norwegian orders and medals]]. The medal in silver is ranked 11th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c33027/artikkel/vis.html?tid=33029 |title=Norwegian Decorations |date=13 February 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design of the Medal==
* The obverse shows the head of the reigning Monarch with name and motto. To date (2015) there have been three versions: Haakon VII (1908–1957), Olav V (1957–1991), and Harald V (since 1991).
* The reverse bears a wreath and the words "KONGENS FORTJENSTMEDALJE" (Royal Medal of Merit) with the recipient's name engraved in the middle of the wreath.
* The ribbon is red with a yellow central stripe.

'''Lara de los Infantes''' is a town with 26 inhabitants in the [[Burgos (province)|province of Burgos]] in the autonomous region of Castille y León in [[Spain]]. 

It is the seat of the [[municipality]] of [[Jurisdicción de Lara]], which includes a few more inhabitants as it includes other localities like [[Paúles de Lara]], and [[Aceña de Lara]]. It is situated in the shire of [[Sierra de la Demanda (shire)|Sierra de la Demanda]] 45 kilometers from the city of [[Burgos]].

Although sparsely populated today, the area was important in Roman times.  In the Middle Ages it formed part of the Alfoz of Lara, where the [[Lara family]] had its hereditary base, and its full name, Lara de los Infante (Lara of the Princes) reflects that family's legend, told in the ''[[Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara]]''.

The '''House of Lichnowsky''' or '''House of Lichnovský''' is a Czech aristocratic family of [[Silesia]]n and [[Moravia]]n origin, documented since the 14th century.

==History==
The noble family first appeared in the [[Duchy of Pless]] (Pszczyna) in [[Upper Silesia]], when one Estepan de Woszyczyki, probably from Woszczyce ({{lang-de|Woschtitz}}) near [[Orzesze]], on 17 March 1377 obtained the office of a ''[[Schultheiß]]'' reeve in [[Lędziny]] from the [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] duke [[John I, Duke of Opava-Ratibor|John of Opava]]. His descendant Hanuš (John) of Woszczyki, judge in the Upper Silesian [[Duchy of Krnov]] from 1498 to 1507, by marriage acquired the estates of [[Lichnov (Bruntál District)|Lichnov]] in Moravia. He is first mentioned with his surname Lichnovský in a 1494 deed.

==Ennoblements==
* Franz Bernhard Lichnowsky (1664-1747): [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] ''[[Freiherr]]'' ([[Baron]]) with the [[nobiliary particle]] of an ''[[Edler]] von Woschtitz'' in 1702
* Karl Franz Leopold Bernhard Lichnowsky (1690-1742), son: Bohemian ''[[Graf]]'' ([[Count]]) on 1 January 1721, [[Imperial Count]] on 27 May 1727

The head of the family was an hereditary member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]] from 12 October 1854 and was granted the title of ''[[Durchlaucht]]'' (Serene Highness) in Prussia on 8 March 1860.

==Notable members==
* [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] (1761–1814)
* Moritz Lichnowsky (1771–1837), younger brother of Karl Alois and a faithful friend of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]
* Eduard Lichnowsky (1789–1845), writer

'''Louis Charles Bernacchi''' (8 November 1876 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1942), a [[physicist]] and [[astronomer]], is best known for his role in several expeditions to the [[Antarctic]].

==Early life==

Bernacchi was born in [[Belgium]] to Italian parents, who migrated to [[Tasmania]] in 1884.  His father, Diego Bernacchi, established a vineyard on [[Maria Island]] in 1884. He was educated in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], at the Hutchins School. He trained in astronomy at the [[Melbourne Observatory]] in the use of sextants and magnetic instruments. During this period he developed an interest in Antarctic exploration, expressed in letters to the press and by following the proceeding of Antarctic Exploration Committees.

==Polar exploration==

He joined [[Carstens Borchgrevink]]'s Southern Cross expedition (1898–1900) which wintered at [[Cape Adare|Cape Adare, Antarctica]], joining the expedition in [[New Zealand]] after the previous physicist candidate had been rejected on medical grounds. The expedition was the first to spend the winter on the Antarctic continent (the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] having been first to overwinter in 1898) and the first to sledge towards the [[South Pole]]. He wrote a book about the  expedition ''To the south polar regions: expedition of 1898-1900'' published in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/physics/P001408p.htm|title=Physics in Australia to 1945 - BERNACCHI, Louis Charles|website=www.asap.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; His granddaughter Janet Crawford has edited a version of his diaries from the expedition under the title ''The First Antarctic Winter: The story of the Southern Cross Expedition of 1898-1900''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,3867957,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was again a physicist on the Discovery expedition led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (1901–1904). Bernacchi was the only man on this expedition who had previously been to the Antarctic. During the trip, he made extensive magnetic observations. Following the trip, Bernacchi was awarded the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and King's Antarctic Medal as well as the [[Légion d'honneur]]. Scott was the best man at Bernacchi's marriage in 1906.

==Subsequent career==

Following two short expeditions to Africa and the upper [[Amazon Basin]] in [[Peru]], Bernacchi made two unsuccessful attempts to run for the House of Commons as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate, standing in Widnes in 1910. He also invested in rubber plantations in [[Malaysia|Malaya]], [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Borneo]].

During World War I, he served subsequently in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], the [[Admiralty]] and the [[United States Navy]]. In 1919, he received both an [[Order of the British Empire]] and the United States [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. Following the war, he returned to his interests in rubber.

He remained active in scientific organisations, most notably the Royal Geographical Society, serving as a council member between 1928 and 1932. Bernacchi planned his own expedition to the Antarctic in 1925, but failed to raise sufficient funds. In 1930, he organised the [[British Polar Exhibition]] and helped to organise the Second [[International Polar Year]] in 1932.

Bernacchi wrote a number of books on the Antarctic including a biography of [[Lawrence Oates]] called ''A Very Gallant Gentleman'' published in 1933 and ''Saga of the Discovery'' in 1938. In World War II, he returned to the Royal Naval Reserve Volunteers before his death in 1942.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3553">The '''Metz family''' is a family in [[Luxembourg]] that was prominent in politics and industry in the mid- and late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.  The head of the household was Jean Metz, who had nine children.  This second generation included [[Auguste Metz]], [[Charles Metz]], and [[Norbert Metz]], who were all leading [[liberalism|liberal]] politicians during the early stages of Luxembourg's independence, in the mid-nineteenth century.  These three brothers defined political and economic life in Luxembourg in the mid-nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; and their children included further political and industrial leaders.

The Metz family also inter-married with other famous and powerful Luxembourgian families, including the Le Gallais, Vannérus, Laval, and Laeis families.

Görling, who took his nickname from trombonist [[Miff Mole]], got his start late in the 1920s with [[Frank Vernon]]'s orchestra, where he played until 1932. He then worked with [[Arne Hülphers]], [[Gösta Jonsson]], [[Seymour Österwall]], and [[Gösta Säfbom]] before organizing his own ensemble in 1938. He led bands into the 1950s, and also did arrangement and composition work for other jazz groups as well as for popular Swedish musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Kjellberg, "Miff Görling".

"'''Neka mi ne svane'''" ("May the dawn never come") was the [[Croatia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moopy.org.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=59895|title=Neka Mi Ne Svane|publisher=Moopy Eurovision forum|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed in [[Croatian Language|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diggiloo.net/?1998hr|title= Neka mi ne svane|publisher=Diggiloo Thrush|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Danijela Martinović|Danijela]].

The song was performed first on the night, preceding [[Greece]]'s [[Thalassa (band)|Thalassa]] with "[[Mia Krifi Evesthisia]]". At the close of voting, it had received 131 points, placing 5th in a field of 25.

The song is a dramatic ballad, often described as the archetypal "Balkan Ballad" by fans, with Danijela wishing that she will "cease to exist" rather than live another day without her lover. The song begins quietly, with only Danijela's voice heard, but swells to a climax with backing vocals and light instrumentation. Memorable in her performance is when Danijela removes the black cape she wears to reveal the white evening dress beneath it and the audience starts to applause.

It is generally regarded as one of the stronger entries from the successor states of [[Yugoslavia]].

It was succeeded as [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Croatian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]] by [[Doris Dragović|Doris]] with "[[Marija Magdalena]]".  As with many Croatian Eurovision entries, an English version was also recorded, entitled "Despair".   An instrumental version with a piano replacing the vocals also exists.

'''Peter Coade''' (born February 14, 1942) is a Canadian broadcast [[meteorology|meteorologist]]. In 2013 he was certified by the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as having had the longest career of any weather forecaster.

==Career==
Coade was born in [[North End, Halifax|north-end Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], one of five children of pharmacist Vincent Coade and his wife, Jessie (Preston) Coade, the first female sports journalist for the ''[[Halifax Herald]]''. Sometimes interviewing sailors aboard vessels in port, she became known as "Messdeck Annie".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/columnist-messdeck-annie-to-be-honoured-1.2554496 Columnist 'Messdeck Annie' to be honoured]", CBC News, February 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While in high school, Coade job-shadowed the popular Halifax meteorologist Rube Hornstein, appearing with Hornstein on television,&lt;ref name=milestone&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/maritimes/peter-coade-marks-50/ Celebrating a Milestone: Peter Coade marks 50 years as a meteorologist]", CBC Maritimes, Aug 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but it would be several years before he became an on-air weather forecaster himself. He was hired by the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] in 1962 where he received on-the-job training in meteorology. Postings with the department included Truro, Goose Bay, and Toronto. He began his broadcast career while in Goose Bay in 1967, providing the nightly weather forecasts for the local CBC affiliate [[CFLA-TV]], which was broadcast to US troops in an agreement with the US Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Legge, "[http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/190564-coade-has-weathered-the-years Coade has weathered the years]", ''Chronicle Herald'', November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1970, he and his family moved to Toronto where he continued with Environment Canada as a spokesman, meanwhile also serving as staff meteorologist for radio station [[CFRB]]. While in Toronto, he was also the official meteorologist for the [[Canadian International Air Show]]. In 1990, he returned to Halifax where he began a seventeen-year tenure as the evening weatherman for ATV's ''[[CTV News at 5 (Maritimes)|Live at Five]]'' (1998–2007) and the [[Atlantic Satellite Network]]. He left ATV when he reached mandatory retirement age in 2007 and immediately re-joined CBC where he continued to forecast the weather for the CBC evening news.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205045810/http://dorchester.ca/documents/SandpiperFestivalNewsReleaseApri14-2008-1.pdf Meteorologist Peter Coade to attend the 2008 Annual Sandpiper Festival], Village of Dorchester, New Brunswick, April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 3, 2012, he became CBC Radio One's morning meteorologist, providing weather forecasts for six CBC radio stations within the three Maritime provinces, including [[Information Morning]] in Halifax.

Coade's career record surpassed that of fellow Canadian [[Dave Devall]] of CTV Toronto who retired from his 48-year career in 2009. His ''Guinness Book of Records'' citation read: "The longest career as a weather forecaster is 50 years, 8 months and 21 days, and was achieved by Peter Coade (Canada) at CBC Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada from October 1, 1962 to June 21, 2013".&lt;ref name=milestone/&gt; This was subsequently surpassed by [[Dick Goddard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-career-as-a-weather-forecaster Longest career as a weather forecaster - Guinness World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired on September 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodbury|first1=Richard|title=CBC meteorologist Peter Coade retires after record-setting career|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/peter-coade-cbc-meteorologist-retires-1.3783674|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=CBC News Nova Scotia|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poporanism''' is a Romanian version of nationalism and populism.

The word is derived from ''popor'', meaning "people" in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Founded by [[Constantin Stere]] in the early 1890s, poporanism is distinguished by its opposition to [[socialism]], promotion of [[voting rights]] for all and its intent to reform the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and the farming system.

Regarding Romania's agrarian situation, poporanists wished to form [[co-operative]] farms for the peasants and to remove them from [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] control. Unlike [[Junimist|Junimism]], another popular political philosophy, poporanism focused mainly on expanding the power of the peasants. In a very nationalist manner, it was also a champion of the Romanian language and of maintaining the Romanian spirit. &lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

Several famous Romanians, including [[Ion Agârbiceanu]], supported it.

==Narodism and Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea==
[[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], a Romanian political activist, first introduced the Russian ideas of [[Narodism]] to Romania and supported the ideas of Poporanism.  The fundamental philosophy of Narodism had a lasting impact on Poporanism, spurring its rejection of capitalism and of [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas.  However, unlike Narodists, Stere did not believe that a revolution was necessary in Romania.   Later, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Stere had a split of political philosophy in regards to [[anti-Semitism]] and [[liberalism]], and Dobrogeanu-Gherea formed the Social-Democratic Worker’s Party, and Poporanists joined the National Liberal Party. &lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/Sociologie/henri/11.htm |title=Sociologie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404103321/http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/Sociologie/henri/11.htm |archivedate=2007-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major|Maggiore]] '''Sebastiano Bedendo''' (18 July 1895-24 August 1935) was a World War I [[flying ace]] credited with five aerial victories.&lt;ref name="thea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/italy/bedendo.php|title=Sebastiano Bedendo|website=www.theaerodrome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his education postwar, he rejoined Italian military aviation. He set several world aviation flying records with a Nuvoli N.5 monoplane before dying in an air crash.

==World War I==
Sebastiano Bedendo was born on 18 July 1895 in [[Rovigo]], in the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. He began his military service with the 5th Fortress Artillery Regiment.&lt;ref name=fronts134&gt;Franks et al 1997, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Bedendo was conscripted when Italy entered World War I. His time with the cannons was brief, as he quickly transferred to [[aerial observer]] duty in a kite balloon section.&lt;ref name="ital"&gt;Varriale 2009, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was accepted for flying training on 17 April 1916; he took his first flight three days later, in a [[Caudron G.3]]. On 19 June in [[Busto Arsizio]], he qualified as a pilot. He continued training, qualifying on the Caudron G.3 on 1 July, [[Farman]] on 1 September, and [[Caudron G.4]] on 3 October 1916. His first assignment was flying reconnaissance on the battle fronts of northern Italy. On 7 October, he was assigned to ''48a Squadriglia'' as a G.4 pilot.&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;

On 17 February 1917, Bedendo transferred to the ''71a Squadriglia''. He was selected for fighter training on [[Nieuport]]s, which he began on 18 October in [[Malpensa]]. When training was completed, he was posted back to ''72a Squadriglia'' on 27 November 1917.&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;

Bedendo was detached to serve in the [[Hanriot]] flight of ''71a Squadriglia'' on 18 January 1918. He served a month with them before returning to ''72a Squadriglia'' for a month. On 11 March 1918, he would settle into service with ''71a Squadriglia''. He would stake his first aerial victory claim while with them, on 19 March 1918. It went unconfirmed, as did his second claim on 7 June. It would not be until 29 July that he was credited with his first confirmed aerial victory. This began a string of aerial victory claims that, by competing accounts, made him an ace with five confirmed wins and four unconfirmed ones. By all accounts, he began scoring on 29 July 1918, followed by a certain second win the next day. From there the accounts differ, but in any case, after scoring his fifth win, he transferred out.&lt;ref name="thea" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;&lt;ref name="ital"/&gt; On 20 October 1918, he joined the "Squadron of Aces", ''91a Squadriglia'', by invitation. There he participated in the war's final offensive,&lt;ref name="ital" /&gt; though with no more aerial victories.&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;

==Postwar life==
Bedendo returned to his engineering studies at university. After graduation, he joined the newly formed ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' in 1924, in their engineering branch&lt;ref name="ital" /&gt; as a ''Capitano''. In December 1930, he was promoted to [[Major|Maggiore]].&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;

On 6 March 1933, he made the maiden flight with a [[Nuvoli N5]] light aircraft. Between April and June, Bedendo set a world aeronautical record for light aircraft, and two speed records over 100&amp;nbsp;km and 500&amp;nbsp;km courses.&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt; A French [[Farman|Farman 239]] took one of the records, and Bedendo seized it back in 1935, using a modernized [[Nuvoli N.5 RR]].&lt;ref name="ital" /&gt;

On 24 August 1935, Nuvoli N.5 Cab. I-NUBE lost a wing in flight. The crew of Sebastiano Bedendo, Giovanni Testore, and Giovanni Nicastro did not survive the crash&lt;ref name="ital" /&gt; at Spinosa di Ottiglio.&lt;ref name=fronts134/&gt;

A '''secret broadcast''' is, simply put, a broadcast that is not for the consumption of the general public. The invention of the [[wireless]] was initially greeted as a boon by armies and navies.  Units could now be coordinated by nearly instant communications.  An adversary could glean valuable and sometimes decisive intelligence from intercepted radio signals:

* messages that were not [[encryption|encrypted]] or poorly encrypted could be read
* [[order of battle]] and future intentions could be deduced by [[traffic analysis]]
* individual units could be located  using [[direction finding]]

In the 1920s the [[United States]] was able to track [[Japan]]ese fleet exercises even through fog banks by monitoring their radio transmissions.

A doctrine was developed of having units in the field, particularly ships at sea, maintain radio silence except for urgent situations, such as reporting contact with enemy forces. Ships in formation reverted to pre-wireless methods, including [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] and [[signal flags]], with signal lamps used at night. Communication from headquarters were sent by one-way radio broadcasts.

=="Personal messages" on  propaganda stations==
During World War II, the [[BBC]] would include "personal messages" in its broadcasts of news and entertainment to occupied-Europe. Often they were coded messages intended for secret agents. [[Leo Marks]] attributes this idea to [[Georges Bégué]], an agent for the [[Special Operations Executive]] who felt their use could eliminate a lot of the two-way radio traffic that often compromised agents. Such messages were also used to authenticate agents to sources of assistance in the field. The agent would arrange to have the BBC broadcast any short phrase the other person chose.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Numbers stations==
{{Main article|Numbers station}}
In the mid-twentieth century, the [[High Frequency]] radio bands were used by numerous stations sending seemingly random Morse code, usually in five-letter groups. As more advanced communications methods, such as [[teleprinter]] and satellite, took over, the number of such stations diminished, but another type appeared that transmitted spoken and also seemingly random number and letter groups, the latter usually using words from a [[radio alphabet]] such as [[NATO phonetic alphabet|ICAO/NATO alphabet]].

Though there has been no official confirmation (beyond a 1998 article in ''The Daily Telegraph'' which quoted a spokesperson for the Department of Trade and Industry as saying, "These [numbers stations] are what you suppose they are. People shouldn't be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/09/16/numbers_2/ |title=Salon People Feature &amp;#124; Counting spies |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-09-16 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) there is little doubt that most of these numbers stations are primarily used to send messages to [[Espionage|spies]] and other clandestine agents (additional possible uses include communication with embassies when a crisis might dictate destruction of cryptographic equipment and as a backup to normal command systems in wartime). Other intended recipients of secret broadcasts have faster and easier-to-use equipment at their disposal. But number stations are ideal for spies in that they require no special equipment, beyond a short-wave receiver. Morse code skills, once a staple of spy training, are no longer required.

==Problems with secret broadcast==
An issue in the past has been the limited bandwidth of the broadcast. Morse code was typically sent at 25 words per minute. [[Teleprinter]]s could operate at or above 60 words per minute. The military uses a [[message precedence]] system to prioritize critical traffic, but all too often, senior commanders insisted on high precedence for lengthy messages lacking real urgency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''"Sva bol svijeta"''' ("All the Pain in the World") was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovinian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993]], performed in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by [[Fazla]].

The song was the eighteenth performed that night, following Finland's Katri Helena with "Tule luo" and preceding the United Kingdom's Sonia with "[[Better the Devil You Know (Sonia song)|Better The Devil You Know]]". After the vote was tallied, it had been completely underestimated, having received 27 points with one 12-point from Turkey, and placing 16th in a field of 25.

The song's title, "all the pain in the world" refers to the suffering of the [[Bosnian War]] which was ongoing at the time.

It was followed a year later by [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]]'s entry for [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by [[Alma Čardžić|Alma]] &amp; Dejan performing "[[Ostani kraj mene]]".

'''''The Apprentice Africa''''' is an African version of the original American Reality TV format, [[The Apprentice (TV series)|''The Apprentice'']], hosted by [[Donald Trump]]. The show was hosted by Mr. [[Biodun Shobanjo]], an advertising magnate, co-founder of Insight Communications and CEO of Troyka Group. It gathered 18 contestants from across six African countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon and Guinea. The show was aired in [[Nigeria]] on ([[Nigerian Television Authority]]), [[Silverbird TV]], Super Screen, and [[MBI Television]]; [[Ghana]] on ([[TV3 Ghana|TV3]]); [[Kenya]] on ([[Kenya Television Network|KTN]]); [[Uganda]] on (WBS); and [[Tanzania]] (TBC1); premiered in February 2008 and ended in June 2008.

The premier edition, shot in the [[Nigerian]] commercial capital [[Lagos]], had eighteen episodes where contestants competed in seventeen business tasks requiring street smarts and corporate intelligence to conquer. Contestants were arranged into two groups and in each episode, the winning team was rewarded while the losing team meet the CEO and his associates in the boardroom to explain why they lost. The Project Manager for that task would choose two teammates perceived to be the reason for the lost or the weakest link in the team, one of whom would then be fired.

[[Isaac Dankyi-Koranteng]], a 31-year-old Sales and Marketing Manager from [[Ghana]], won the first season. He was hired by [[Biodun Shobanjo]]. As a reward, the winner was offered a brand new car and an annual salary of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaschoolsonline.com/details.cfm?corpnews_scatid=6&amp;corpnews_catid=6&amp;corpnews_scatlinkid=22|title=The Apprentice Africa: Isaac, You're Hired!|website=www.ghanaschoolsonline.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cup''''' (ཕོར་པ། or ''Phörpa'') is a 1999 [[Tibetan-language film]] directed by [[Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche|Khyentse Norbu]]. The plot involves two young football-crazed [[Tibet]]an refugee [[samanera|novice monks]] in a remote [[Himalaya]]n [[monastery]] in India who desperately try to obtain a [[television]] for the monastery to watch the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] final.

The movie was shot in the Tibetan refugee village Bir in India (Himachal Pradesh) (almost entirely between Chokling Gompa and Elu Road).&lt;ref name=TM&gt;{{cite news | author =Susan Jakes | title =The God of Small Films | publisher =Time Magazine  | date =January 27, 2003 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,411452,00.html | accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Jeremy Thomas had developed a relationship with Norbu when he was an advisor on Bertolucci's ''[[Little Buddha]]''.&lt;ref name=berlinale/&gt; Thomas later remembered his experience making the film:

{{quote|The director Khyentse Norbu is a Tibetan Lama who went to NYC film school, who wanted to make a movie, and I had become friendly with him. There was this charming story, which was a teaching for him but a story for everyone else, about little monks and the World Cup. It was shown in  [[Director’s Fortnight]] at Cannes, and we brought a lot of the Tibetans to the screening and it was well received and sold all over the world. It was a very happy story for everybody involved.&lt;ref name=berlinale&gt;{{cite web |title="At the Cutting Edge" – Producer Jeremy Thomas, interviewed by producer Sandy Lieberson |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |author2=Lieberson, Sanford |date=2006-04-11 |url=http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |publisher=[[Berlinale Talent Campus]] |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524091710/http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lira''' (plural ''lire'') was the [[currency]] of the [[Vatican City]] between 1929 and 2002.

==History==
The [[Papal States]], by then reduced to a smaller area close to [[Rome]], used its own [[Papal States lira|lira]] between 1866 and 1870, after which it ceased to exist. In 1929, the [[Lateran Treaty]] established the State of the [[Vatican City]] and, according with the terms of the Treaty, a distinct coinage was introduced, denominated in centesimi and lire, on par with the [[Italian lira]]. Italian coins and banknotes were legal tender in the Vatican City. The Vatican coins were minted in [[Rome]] and were also legal tender in Italy and [[San Marino]].

In 2002, the Vatican City switched to the [[euro]] at an exchange rate of 1 euro = 1936.27 lira. It has its own set of [[Vatican euro coins|euro coins]].

== Coins ==

The development of Vatican coins largely mirrored the development of the Italian lire coins.

In 1929, [[copper]] 5 and 10 centesimi, [[nickel]] 20 and 50 centesimi, 1 and 2 lire, and [[silver]] 5 and 10 lire coins were introduced. In 1939, [[aluminium bronze]] replaced copper and, in 1940, [[stainless steel]] replaced nickel. Between 1941 and 1943, production of the various denominations was reduced to only a few thousand per year.

In 1947, a new coinage was introduced consisting of [[aluminium]] 1, 2, 5 and 10 lire. The sizes of these coins were reduced in 1951. In 1955, stainless steel 50 and 100 lire were introduced, followed by aluminium bronze 20 lire in 1957 and silver 500 lire in 1958. The 1 and 2 lire ceased production in 1977, followed by the 5 lire in 1978. Aluminium-bronze 200 lire were introduced in 1978, followed by [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 500 and 1000 lire in 1985 and 1997, respectively. The 50 and 100 lire were reduced in size in 1992.

Beginning in 1967, the Vatican began issuing coins using [[Roman numerals]] for the year of issue, as opposed to the more common [[Arabic numerals]].

Vatican lire coins were discontinued with the advent of the euro.

Vatican City has frequently issued its coins in yearly changing commemorative series, featuring a wide variety of themes. While most of these were sold in the form of uncirculated mint sets, a portion of Vatican coins were released into general circulation.
