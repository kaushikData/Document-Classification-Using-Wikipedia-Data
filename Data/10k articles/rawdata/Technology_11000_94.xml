      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24678">The biological treatment of wastewater in the [[sewage treatment]] plant is often accomplished using conventional [[activated sludge]] systems. These systems generally require large surface areas for treatment and biomass separation units due to the generally poor settling properties of the [[sludge]]. Aerobic granules are a type of sludge that can self-immobilize flocs and microorganisms into spherical and strong compact structures. The advantages of aerobic granular sludge are excellent settleability, high biomass retention, simultaneous nutrient removal and tolerance to toxicity. Recent studies show that aerobic granular sludge treatment could be a potentially good method to treat high strength wastewaters with nutrients, toxic substances.

The aerobic granular sludge usually is cultivated in SBR (sequencing batch reactor) and applied successfully as a wastewater treatment for high strength wastewater, toxic wastewater and domestic wastewater. Compared with conventional aerobic granular processes for COD removal, current research focuses more on simultaneous nutrient removal, particularly COD, phosphorus and nitrogen, under pressure conditions, such as high salinity or thermophilic condition.

In recent years, new technologies have been developed to improve settlability. The use of '''aerobic granular sludge technology''' is one of them.

==Context==
Proponents of aerobic granular sludge technology claim "it will play an important role as an innovative technology alternative to the present activated sludge process in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment in the near future"&lt;ref name=ni&gt;{{cite book|last=Ni|first=Bing-Jie|title=Formation, Characterization and Mathematical Modeling of the Aerobic Granular Sludge|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-31280-9|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/601/bfm%253A978-3-642-31281-6%252F1.pdf?auth66=1355393926_e27270dacd9faf9671be171972ced9d5&amp;ext=.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it "can be readily established and profitably used in activated sludge plants".&lt;ref name=bathe /&gt; However, in 2011 it was characterised as "not yet established as a large-scale application ... with limited and unpublished full-scale applications for municipal wastewater treatment."&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Dawen|author2=Liu, Lin|author3= Liang, Hong|author4= Wu, Wei-Min|title=Aerobic granular sludge: characterization, mechanism of granulation and application to wastewater treatment|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date=1 June 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=137–152|doi=10.3109/07388551.2010.497961|url=http://era.stanford.edu/pubs/Gao%20et%20al.%20%28CRB%29-2011_5579.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerobic granular biomass==
The following  definition differentiates an aerobic granule from a simple floc with relatively good settling properties and came out of discussions which took place at the ''1st IWA-Workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge'' in Munich (2004):&lt;ref name=bathe&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathe|first=Stephan|title=Aerobic granular sludge : selected proceedings of the 1st IWA-workshop aerobic granular sludge organised by the Institute of water quality control and waste management of the technical University of Munich (TUM) in cooperation with the Institute of advanced studies on sustainability of the European Academy of sciences and arts (EASA) and the international water association (IWA)|year=2005|publisher=IWA publishing|location=Londen|isbn=978-1843395096|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2005). "Discussion outcomes". Ede. In: ''Aerobic Granular Sludge''. Water and Environmental Management Series. IWA Publishing. Munich, pp. 165–169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formation of aerobic granules==
[[Image:ReactorSBR.JPG|right|thumb|220px|SBR Reactor, with aerobic granules]]

Granular sludge biomass is developed in [[sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBR) and without carrier materials. These systems fulfil most of the requirements for their formation as:

: '''Feast - Famine regime: '''short feeding periods must be selected to create feast and famine periods (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"&gt;Beun J.J., Hendriks A., Van Loosdrecht M.C.M., Morgenroth E., Wilderer P.A. and Heijnen J.J. (1999). Aerobic granulation in a sequencing batch reactor. ''Water Research, ''Vol.  33, No. 10, pp. 2283–2290.&lt;/ref&gt;), characterized by the presence or absence of organic matter in the liquid media, respectively. With this feeding strategy the selection of the appropriate micro-organisms to form granules is achieved. When the substrate concentration in the bulk liquid is high, the granule-former organisms can store the organic matter in form of poly-''β''-hydroxybutyrate to be consumed in the famine period, giving an advantage over filamentous organisms. When an anaerobic feeding is applied this factor is enhanced, minimising the importance of short settling time and higher hydrodynamic forces.

: '''Short settling time: ''' This hydraulic selection pressure on the microbial community allows the retention granular biomass inside the reactor while flocculent biomass is washed-out. (Qin et al. 2004&lt;ref&gt;Qin L. Liu Y. and Tay J-H (2004). Effect of settling time on aerobic granulation in sequencing batch reactor''. Biochemical Engineering Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt;)

: '''Hydrodynamic shear force ''': Evidences show that the application of high [[shear forces]] favours the formation of aerobic granules and the physical granule integrity. It was found that aerobic granules could be formed only above a threshold shear force value in terms of superficial upflow air velocity above 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm/s in a column SBR, and more regular, rounder, and more compact aerobic granules were developed at high hydrodynamic shear forces (Tay et al., 2001&lt;ref&gt;Tay J.-H., Liu Q.-S. and Liu Y. (2001). The effects of shear force on the formation, structure and metabolism of aerobic granules. ''Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology'', Vol. 57, Nos. 1–2, pp. 227–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  ).

Granular activated sludge is also developed in flow-through reactors using the Hybrid Activated Sludge (HYBACS®) process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828175556/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |archivedate=2015-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising an attached-growth reactor with short retention time upstream of a suspended growth reactor. The attached bacteria in the first reactor, known as a SMART unit, are exposed to a constant high COD, triggering the expression of high concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes in the EPS layer around the bacteria (citation needed). The accelerated hydrolysis liberates soluble readily-degradable COD which promotes the formation of granular activated sludge.

==Advantages==
The development of biomass in the form of aerobic granules is being studied for its application in the removal of  [[Natural organic matter#NOM in water|organic matter]], [[Microbial metabolism#Nitrification|nitrogen]] and [[Enhanced biological phosphorus removal|phosphorus]] compounds from wastewater.
Aerobic granules in an aerobic SBR present several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge process such as:

: '''Stability and flexibility:''' the SBR system can be adapted to fluctuating conditions with the ability to withstand shock and toxic loadings

: '''Low energy requirements:''' the aerobic granular sludge process has a higher aeration efficiency due to operation at increased height, while there are neither return sludge or nitrate recycle streams nor mixing and propulsion requirements

: '''Reduced footprint:''' The increase in biomass concentration that is possible because of the high settling velocity of the aerobic sludge granules and the absence of a final settler result in a significant reduction in the required footprint.

: '''Good biomass retention:''' higher biomass concentrations inside the reactor can be achieved, and higher substrate loading rates can be treated.

: '''Presence of aerobic and anoxic zones inside the granules:''' to perform simultaneously different biological processes in the same system (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"/&gt;  )

: '''Reduced investment and operational costs:''' the cost of running a wastewater treatment plant working with aerobic granular sludge can be reduced by at least 20% and space requirements can be reduced by as much as 75% (de Kreuk et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;de Kreuk, M.K.,  Bruin L.M.M. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge: From idea to pilot plant.. In Wilderer, P.A. (Ed.), ''Granules 2004. IWA workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge, Technical University of Munich, 26–28 September 2004 ''(pp. 1–12). London: IWA.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The HYBACS process has the additional benefit of being a flow-through process, thus avoiding the complexities of SBR systems. It is also readily applied to the upgrading of existing flow-through activated sludge processes, by installing the attached growth reactors upstream of the aeration tank. Upgrading to granular activated sludge process enables the capacity of an existing wastewater treatment plant to be doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514063005/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of industrial wastewater==
Synthetic wastewater was used in most of the works carried out with aerobic granules. These works were mainly focussed on the study of granules formation, stability and nutrient removal efficiencies under different operational conditions and their potential use to remove toxic compounds. The potential of this technology to treat industrial wastewater is under study, some of the results:

*  Arrojo et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Arrojo B., Mosquera-Corral A., Garrido J.M. and Méndez R. (2004) Aerobic granulation with industrial wastewater in sequencing batch reactors. ''Water Research'', Vol. 38, Nos. 14-15, pp. 3389 – 3399&lt;/ref&gt; operated two reactors that were fed with industrial wastewater produced in a laboratory for analysis of dairy products (Total [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] : 1500–3000&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 300–1500&amp;nbsp;mg/L; total nitrogen: 50–200&amp;nbsp;mg/L). These authors applied organic and nitrogen loading rates up to 7 g COD/(L·d) and 0.7 g N/(L·d) obtaining removal efficiencies of 80%.
* Schwarzenbeck ''et al. ''(2004)&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzenbeck N., Erley R.  and Wilderer P.A. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge in an SBR-system treating wastewater rich in particulate matter. ''[[Water Science and Technology]]'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;   treated malting wastewater which had a high content of particulate organic matter (0.9 g TSS/L). They found that particles with average diameters lower than 25-50&amp;nbsp;µm were removed at 80% efficiency, whereas particles bigger than 50&amp;nbsp;µm were only removed at 40% efficiency. These authors observed that the ability of aerobic granular sludge to remove particulate organic matter from the wastewaters was due to both incorporation into the [[biofilm]] matrix and metabolic activity of protozoa population covering the surface of the granules.
* Cassidy and Belia (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy D.P. and Belia E. (2005). Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from an abattoir wastewater in a SBR with aerobic granular sludge. ''Water Research'', Vol. 39, No. 19, pp. 4817–4823.&lt;/ref&gt;   obtained removal efficiencies for COD and P of 98% and for N and VSS over 97% operating a granular reactor fed with slaughterhouse wastewater (Total COD: 7685&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 5163&amp;nbsp;mg/L; [[TKN]]: 1057&amp;nbsp;mg/L and VSS: 1520&amp;nbsp;mg/L). To obtain these high removal percentages, they operated the reactor at a [[Dissolved oxygen|DO]] saturation level of 40%, which is the optimal value predicted by Beun et al. (2001) for N removal, and with an anaerobic feeding period which helped to maintain the stability of the granules when the DO concentration was limited.

Studies on Biodegradation of Phenols and m -Cresols by Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket and Aerobic Sequential Batch Reactor.''Global Nest Journal'',10(1), 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Wastewaters from fossil fuel refining, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides are the main sources of phenolic compounds. Those with more complex structures are often more toxic than the simple phenol. This study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of granular sludge in UASB and SBR for the treatment of mixtures of phenolics compounds. The results indicates that anaerobic treatment by UASB and aerobic treatment by SBR can be successfully used for phenol/cresol mixture, representative of major substrates in chemical and petrochemical wastewater and the results shows proper acclimatization period is essential for the degradation of m - cresol and phenol. Moreover, SBR was found as a better alternative than UASB reactor as it is more efficient and higher concentration of m cresols can be successfully degraded.

Technol. 238, 559–567.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared an aerobic feast/famine strategy and an anaerobic feast, aerobic famine strategy for the formation of aerobic granular sludge during the treatment of industrial petrochemical wastewater. Both strategies were successful.

==Pilot research in aerobic granular sludge==
Aerobic granulation technology for the application in wastewater treatment is widely developed at laboratory scales. The large-scale experience is growing rapidly and multiple institutions are making efforts to improve this technology:

* Since 1999 Royal HaskoningDHV (former DHV Water), Delft University of technology (TUD), STW (Dutch Foundation for Applied Technology) and STOWA (Dutch Foundation for Applied Water Research) have been cooperating closely on the development of the aerobic granular sludge technology ([http://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/en-gb/nereda Nereda]). In September 2003, a first extensive pilot plant research was executed at STP Ede, the Netherlands with focus on obtaining stable granulation and biological nutrient removal. Following the positive outcome together with six Dutch Water Boards the parties decided to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)- the National Nereda Research Program [http://www.neredannop.nl (NNOP)]- to mature,  further scale-up and implement several full-scale units. As part of this PPP extensive pilot tests have been executed between 2003 and 2010 at multiple sewage treatment plants. Currently more than 20 plants are running or under construction across 3 continents.
* From the basis of the aerobic granular sludge but using a contention system for the granules, a [[sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor]] (SBBGR) with a volume of 3.1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was developed by IRSA (Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque, Italy). Different studies were carried out in this plant treating sewage at an Italian wastewater treatment plant.
* The use of aerobic granules prepared in laboratory, as a starter culture, before adding in main system, is the base of the technology ARGUS ([[Aerobic granules upgrade system]]) developed by EcoEngineering Ltd.. The granules are cultivated on-site in small bioreactors called propagators and fill up only 2 to 3% of the main bioreactor or fermentor (digestor) capacity.  This system is being used in a pilot plant with a volume of 2.7 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; located in one Hungarian pharmaceutical industry.
* The Group of Environmental Engineering and Bioprocesses from the University of Santiago de Compostela is currently operating a 100 L pilot plant reactor.

The feasibility study showed that the aerobic granular sludge technology seems very promising (de Bruin et al., 2004.&lt;ref&gt;de Bruin L.M.M., de Kreuk M.K., van der Roest H.F.R., Uijterlinde C. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge technology: and alternative to activated sludge. ''Water Science and Technology'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 1–7)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on total annual costs a GSBR ([[Granular sludge sequencing batch reactors]]) with pre-treatment and a GSBR with post-treatment proves to be more attractive than the reference activated sludge alternatives (6-16%).
A sensitivity analysis shows that the GSBR technology is less sensitive to land price and more sensitive to rain water flow. Because of the high allowable volumetric load the footprint of the GSBR variants is only 25% compared to the references. However, the GSBR with only primary treatment cannot meet the present effluent standards for municipal wastewater, mainly because of exceeding the suspended solids effluent standard caused by washout of not well settleable biomass.

==Full scale application ==
Aerobic granulation technology is already successfully applied for treatment of wastewater.

* Since 2005, RoyalHaskoningDHV has implemented more than 20 full-scale aerobic granular sludge technology systems (Nereda) for the treatment of both industrial and municipal wastewater across 3 continents. One example is STP Epe, The Netherlands, with a capacity of 59.000 pe and 1,500 m3.h-1, being the first full-scale municipal Nereda in The Netherlands. Examples of the latest Nereda sewage treatment  plants (2012-2013) include Wemmershoek- South Africa, Dinxperlo,  Vroomshoop, Garmerwolde - The Netherlands.

An '''air-operated valve''' is a type of power operated [[valve]] that uses air pressure against a [[piston]] or [[diaphragm (mechanics)|diaphragm]] to produce linear or circular movement to operate a valve.
Types are 2-way, 3-way and 4-way. The 2 way air-operated valves can be either normally closed or normally opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225122854/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|archive-date=25 February 2015|title=Engineering information, Air valves|pages=455&amp;ndash;456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical details ==

The main idea of AOL is to send warnings to remote administrators about different PC conditions using a LAN. These conditions include: 

* System unplugged from power source
* System unplugged from network
* Chassis intrusion
* Processor removal
* System environmental errors
* High temperature
* Fan speed
* Voltage fluctuations
* Operating system errors
* System power-on errors
* System is hung
* Component failure

Alert on LAN 2 (AOL2) extends AOL to allow active PC management, including:

* Remote system reboot upon report of a critical failure 
* Repair Operating System 
* Update BIOS image 
* Perform other diagnostic procedures

The '''Association of Women Surgeons''' ('''AWS''') is a non-profit educational and professional organization founded in 1981. With over 2,000 members in 21 countries, both women and men, AWS is one of the largest international organizations dedicated to supporting, enhancing the interaction, and facilitating the exchange of information between women surgeons at various stages in their careers. The organization's mission statement reads: "To inspire, encourage, and enable women surgeons to achieve their personal and professional goals".

AWS actions aim to: '''ENGAGE''' current and future women surgeons to realize their professional and personal goals. '''EMPOWER''' women to succeed. '''EXCEL''' in those aspirations through mentorship, education and a networking community that promotes their contributions and achievements as students, surgeons and leaders.

==History==

===1981–1990===
The AWS was founded in 1981 when Dr. Patricia Numann posted a sign inviting any woman surgeon to a breakfast at the October meeting of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in the San Francisco Hilton Hotel.

* The AWS was incorporated in 1986.
* The     first AWS newsletter was produced by Dr. Joyce Majure and was distributed     to all AWS members. 
* AWS     initiated an awards program. 
* AWS     produced a poster for the ACS Clinical Congress exhibits that described     the history of women surgeons and AWS.

===1991–2000===

* First     AWS Strategic Planning Session, focused on obstacles to career advancement     for women surgeons. This plan resulted in a strategy of promoting suitably     qualified women for membership on the American Board of Surgery and     American College of Surgeons committees.
* Former AWS President Dr. Joyce Majure created, compiled and edited     the first of five editions of the ''AWS     Pocket Mentor''''',''' designed to     ease the transition from medical student to surgical resident and from     resident to surgeon. ''The Pocket     Mentor'' has been endorsed by the Association of Program Directors in     Surgery and distributed to the majority of training programs in the USA.     It has been translated into Spanish and adapted for use in Asia and in     Africa. It is currently in its fifth edition. Over 50,000 copies have been     distributed.  It is now available     electronically.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womensurgeons.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2013PocketMentor1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* AWS earned a seat on the ACS Board of Governors.  Dr. Mary C. McCarthy was elected to     serve as the first AWS Governor in 1995. 
* An annual Research Fellowship Grants program was established in     partnership with Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. for women surgeons performing     original surgical research. 
* The AWS Foundation was established by Dr. Christine Haycock for     recognition of outstanding women surgeons and surgical residents. 
* The video ''Women Pioneers in Surgery''     was produced by Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, in conjunction with US Surgical. 
* AWS began sponsoring networking breakfasts at     various national meetings. These now occur annually at many major surgical     meetings including the Association for Surgical Education, the American     Surgical Association, and the Association of Academic Surgeons Annual     Meetings.
* "Strategies for Success" became the first freestanding summer AWS     meeting for professional development. The program was held in the summer     of 1992 in Park City, Utah. 
* With the untimely death of Dr. Nina Starr Braunwald, the first     woman cardiac surgeon, AWS instituted an award in her name endowed by a     generous gift to the foundation from her husband, Dr. Eugene Braunwald. Dr Nina Starr     Braunwald has also been honored with a biography in the National Library     of Medicine Project; Changing the Face of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_41.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* AWS produced a resource book regarding issues of sexual harassment     and gender bias. 
* Under the leadership of Dr. M. Margaret     Kemeny, the AWS collaborated with the National Institutes of Health to     produce a 24-minute video entitled ''Women Are Surgeons''. This video     encourages young women to take math and science courses throughout their     schooling, and to consider surgery as a viable career.  This was distributed to women in junior     high schools throughout the country.
* AWS initiated the Outstanding Woman Resident Award to recognize     residents who demonstrate great potential as future leaders in a surgical     field. 
* The ACS established a Committee on Women's Issues in response to a     proposal from AWS to Dr. Olga Jonasson. This was renamed as the Women in     Surgery Committee in 2008.
* ''AWS     Connections'' was established as an electronic publication     sent six times a year to AWS members.   
* In 2000, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny was named the second AWS Governor to the ACS

===2001–2010===

* A Code of Conduct was published in collaboration with the ACS. The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations endorsed this as the standard of practice for transplant surgeons. 
* The AWS Visiting Professor program was established to allow prominent women surgeons to share their expertise with medical students and residents across the country. 
* An annual medical student award was initiated in honor of our founder Dr. Patricia J. Numann. The award permits a student to attend the Annual ACS Clinical Congress and the AWS meeting.
* Four discussion list-serves were created to facilitate interaction and networking among members. 
* AWS partnered with the American Journal of Surgery (AJS). AWS has three representatives on the AJS Editorial Board; each serves a three-year term. In October 2015, the first annual dedicated AWS issue of the AJS was published.
* Under the leadership of Dr. Vivian Gahtan, AWS created the Career Development Resource, a series of articles describing different types of surgical practice. The series has been published in the AJS and is also available online.
* AWS partnered with the ACS, the American Surgical Association, and the Association of Program Directors in Surgery to conduct a national survey to explore interest in flexible training in surgery resulting in two publications:

** Saalwachter AR, Freischlag JA, Sawyer RG, Sanfey HA. The Training Needs and Priorities of Male and Female Surgeons and Their Trainees. JACS 2005; 201:199.  
* The ACS Governor's Committee on Chapter Activities recommended that an AWS representative be appointed to every ACS Chapter Council. 
* AWS successfully lobbied the American Board of Surgery to change their training requirements and allow residents an additional 2 weeks off for maternity leave during their residency without impeding their  ability to graduate on time.
* AWS developed two maternity/family leave policy guides: one for Practicing Surgeons and one for Residents.
* A strategic planning meeting was held in the summer of 2003 leading to a restructuring of the AWS Council.  This led to the establishment of AWS committees to increase member participation at a national level and an AWS executive committee to provide Council oversight.
* Resident and medical student representatives joined the AWS Council.
* The first AWS chapter was established in Virginia in 2003, with the leadership of Dr. Hilary Sanfey.  A second chapter was established in Georgia by Dr. Fatima Cody.

[[File:Voisin-Farman I.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest communication with aircraft was by visual signalling]]

Aviation communication refers to the conversing of two or more aircraft. Aircraft are constructed in such a way that make it very difficult to see beyond what is directly in front of them. As safety is a primary focus in aviation, communication methods such as wireless radio are an effective way for aircraft to communicate with the necessary personnel. Aviation is an international industry and as a result involves multiple languages. However, as deemed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), English is the official language of aviation. The industry considers that some pilots may not be fluent English speakers and as a result pilots are obligated to participate in an English proficiency test.

==Background==

Aviation communication is the means by which aircraft crews connect with other aircraft and people on the ground to relay information. Aviation communication is a crucial component pertaining to the successful functionality of aircraft movement both on the ground and in the air. Increased communication reduces the risk of an accident.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

During the early stages of aviation, it was assumed that skies were too big and empty that it was impossible that two planes would collide. However, in [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision|1956 two planes famously crashed]] over the Grand Canyon, which sparked the creation of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]]. Aviation was roaring during the [[Jet Age]] and as a result, communication technologies needed to be developed. This was initially seen as a very difficult task: ground controls used visual aids to provide signals to pilots in the air. With the advent of portable radios small enough to be placed in planes, pilots were able to communicate with people on the ground. With later developments, pilots were then able to converse air-to-ground and air-to-air. Today, aviation communication relies heavily on the use of many systems. Planes are outfitted with the newest radio and [[GPS]] systems, as well as Internet and video capabilities.

English is the main language used by the aviation industry; the use of [[aviation English]] is regulated by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/MemberStates/Member%20States.English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Member States.English.pdf|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early systems==

Flight was considered a foreign concept until the [[Wright Brothers]] successfully completed the world's first human flight in 1903. The industry grew rapidly and ground crews initially relied on coloured paddles, signal flares, hand signs, and other visual aids to communicate with incoming and outgoing aircraft. Although these methods were effective for ground crews, they offered no way for pilots to communicate back. As [[wireless telegraphy]] technologies developed alongside the growth of aviation during the first decade of the twentieth century, wireless telegraph systems were used to send messages in [[Morse code]], first from ground-to-air and later air-to-ground. With this technology, planes were able to call in accurate artillery fire and act as forward observers in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/voicesinflightcyrilbritten.htm|title=VOICES IN FLIGHT -- First World War in the Air|publisher=Anna Malinovska|accessdate=2011-11-07|last=Britten|first=Cyril}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[wireless telegraphy]] was put into operational use in the [[Italo-Turkish War]]. In 1912, the [[Royal Flying Corps]] had begun experimenting with "wireless telegraphy" in aircraft. Lieutenant B.T James was a leading pioneer of wireless radio in aircraft. In the spring of 1913, James had begun to experiment with radios in a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2A]]. James managed to successfully increase the efficiency of wireless radio before he was shot down and killed by anti-aircraft fire on July 13, 1915.

Nonetheless, wireless communication systems in aircraft remained experimental and would take years to successfully develop a practical prototype. The early radios were heavy in weight and were considered an unreliable piece of equipment; additionally there were still major issues with ground forces using radio because signals were easily intercepted and targeted by opposing forces. At the beginning of [[Aviation in World War I|World War I]], aircraft were not typically equipped with wireless equipment. Instead, soldiers used large panel cut outs to distinguish friendly forces. These cut outs could also be used as a directional device to help pilots navigate back to friendly and familiar airfields.

In April 1915, Captain J.M. Furnival was the first person to hear a voice from the ground from Major Prince who said, "If you can hear me now, it will be the first time speech has ever been communicated to an aeroplane in flight." In June 1915, the world's first air-to-ground voice transmission took place at Brooklands, England over about 20 miles. Ground-to-air was initially by Morse code, but it is believed 2-way voice communications were available and installed by July 1915. By early 1916, the Marconi Company (England) started production of air-to-ground radio transmitters/receivers which were used in the war over France.

In 1917, AT&amp;T invented the first American air-to-ground radio transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/17air.html|title=AT&amp;T Labs - Innovation - Technology Timeline - The First Air-to-ground &amp; Ground-to-air Communication{{!}} AT&amp;T Labs{{!}} AT&amp;T|website=www.corp.att.com|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They tested this device at Langley Field in Virginia and found it was a viable technology.&lt;ref name=ATT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/17air.html|title=Technology Timeline - The First Air-to-ground &amp; Ground-to-air Communication|publisher=AT&amp;T Labs
|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1917, [[George Owen Squier|General George Squier]] of the U.S. Army Signal Corps contacted AT&amp;T to develop an air-to-ground radio with a range of 2,000 yards. By July 4 of that same year, AT&amp;T technicians achieved two-way communication between pilots and ground personnel.&lt;ref name=ATT/&gt; This allowed ground personnel to communicate directly with pilots using their voices instead of Morse code. Though few of these devices saw service in the war, they proved this was a viable and valuable technology worthy of refinement and advancement.

==Interwar==

Following World War I new technology was developed to increase the range and performance of the radios being used to communicate with planes in the air. In December 1919 a year after the end of [[World War I]], [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard]], a senior officer in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) later [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), produced a report on the permanent organisation and operations of the RAF in peacetime in which he argued that if the air force officer was not to be a  chauffeur, and nothing more, then navigation, meteorology, photography and wireless were necessities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Flt Lt Alec Ayliffe|authorlink1=Between the Wars|title=A History of Navigation in the Royal Air Force|date=21 October 1996|publisher=RAF Museum|location=Hendon|pages=12–33|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-17A-Air-Navigationin-the-RAF.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1930 however that airborne radios were reliable enough and had enough power to make them viable to be standard in all planes and it was this year that the [[International Commission for Air Navigation|International Commission for Aerial Navigation]] agreed that all aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers should carry wireless equipment.&lt;ref name="Moder"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Aviation English|last = Moder|first = Carol|date = November 2012|journal = The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, only military aircraft designated for scout missions required radios. The operating distance of radios increased much slower than the distance planes were able to travel.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This resulted in a planes messages having to bounce from airfield to airfield in order to get to its intended recipient.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} As the speed of planes increased this resulted in a plane reaching its destination before the message that it was on its way arrived at the airfield.{{or|date=December 2015}}

On 15 November 1938, the Army Airways Communications System (AACS) was established, this system was a point-to-point communications system used by the Army Air Corps. It allowed army air fields to remain in contact with planes throughout their entire flight. It could also be used to disseminate weather reports and orders to military aircraft and act as an air traffic control for arrivals and departures at military airfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/VII/AAF-VII-12.html|title=Army Air Forces in WWII: Volume VII: Services Around the World [Chapter 12]|last=Craven|first=W. F.|last2=Cate|first2=J. L.|publisher=The HyperWar Foundation|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technology increased, systems such as the AACS expanded and spread across the globe as other militaries and civilian services developed their own system of air control.

[[File:R1155 Receiver and T1154 Transmitter at RAF Digby.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The R1155/T1154 combination used by the RAF in WWII]]

==World War II==
The development of radar in the mid-1930s proved a great advance in air-to-ground communication. Radar could be used to track planes in the air and determine distance, direction, speed and even type of aircraft. This allowed for better air traffic control as well as navigation aides for pilots. Radar also proved to be a valuable tool in targeting for bombers. Radar stations on the coast of Britain could aim two radar beams from separate locations on the coast towards Germany. By aligning the two radar beams to intersect over the desired target, a town or factory for example, an aircraft could then follow one radar signal until it intersected with the other where it would then know to drop bombs.

The [[Royal Air Force]] used the [[R1155]]/T1154 receiver/transmitter combination in most of its larger aircraft, particularly the [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Short Sunderland]]. Single seat aircraft such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] were equipped mostly with the TR1143 set. Other systems employed were Eureka and the [[S-Phone]], which enabled [[Special Operations Executive]] agents working behind enemy lines to communicate with friendly aircraft and coordinate landings and the dropping of agents and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication error==
Communication error can occur between pilots and between pilots and air traffic controllers. Communication error contains:&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Stephen M.|title=My copilot is a nurse—Using crew resource management in the OR|journal=AORN Journal|date=January 2006|volume=83|issue=1|pages=178–202|doi=10.1016/s0001-2092(06)60239-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* amount of information 
* unclear pronunciation
* misunderstanding

The more information needing transfer, the more chance for error.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt; Unclear pronunciation could happen with non-English speakers. Sometimes lack of self-confidence and motivation affects expression in communication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacIntyre |first1=Peter D. |last2=Charos |first2=Catherine |date=March 1996 |title=Personality, Attitudes, and Affect as Predictors of Second Language Communication |journal=Journal of Language and Social Psychology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |doi=10.1177/0261927x960151001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misunderstanding happens with both native speakers and non-native speakers through communication, so a standard aviation language is important to improve this situation.

Sources of communication error come from: phonology (speech rate, stress, intonation, pauses), syntax (language word patterns, sentence structure), semantics, and pragmatics (language in context). Even though English is the international aviation language, native English speakers still play a role in misunderstanding and situational awareness. Both the ICAO and the Federal Aviation Administration use alternative phrases, which is confusing to both native and non-native English speakers.&lt;ref name="Ragan1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ragan|first = Peter H.|date = 1997|title = Aviation English: An Introduction|url = http://commons.erau.edu/jaaer/vol7/iss2/1/|journal = Journal of Aviation/Aerospace Education &amp; Research|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest problem regarding non-native English speakers' transmissions is speech rate. In order to understand alternative and unfamiliar accents, people's rate of comprehension and response slows down. Accents also affect transmissions because of the different pronunciations across languages.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Some of the earlier miscommunication issues included the limitation of language-based warning systems in aircraft and insufficient English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Tajima2004"/&gt;

According to US department of transportation's report, errors between pilots and controllers include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pilot-Controller Communication Errors: An Analysis of Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) Reports|date=August 1998|publisher=Research and Special Programs Administration john A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center|location=Cambridge|page=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Read-back/hear-back errors - the pilot reads back the clearance incorrectly and the controller fails to correct the error - accounted for 47% of the errors found in this analysis.
* No pilot read-back. A lack of a pilot read-back contributed to 25% of the errors found in this analysis.
* Hear-back Errors Type H - the controller fails to notice his or her own error in the pilot's correct read-back or fails to correct critical erroneous information in a pilot's statement of intent - accounted for 18% of the errors found in this analysis.

Generally, miscommunication is caused by mis-hearing by the pilots for 28%, pilot not responding for 20%, controller mis-hearing for 15% and 10% that controllers do not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skaltsas |first1=Gerasimos |last2=Rakasb |first2=Jasenka |last3=Karlaftis |first3=Matthew G. |date=March 2013 |title=An analysis of air traffic controller-pilot miscommunication in the NextGen environment |journal=Journal of Air Transport Management |volume=27 |pages=46–51 |doi=10.1016/j.jairtraman.2012.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a professional research shows that 30% of the information will be lost during the miscommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=Brigid M.|title=Interruptions and Miscommunications in Surgery: An Observational Study|journal=AORN Journal|date=May 2012|volume=95|issue=5|pages=576–590|doi=10.1016/j.aorn.2012.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, miscommunication exists in personnel with different background of linguistics is shown to be one of the major problem in miscommunication to cause aviation accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowles|first1=Hugo|title=How about getting those guys in the tower to speak English? Miscommunication, ELF and Aviation Safety|journal=Textus|date=January 2014|pages=85–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding or minimizing miscommunication could be achieved by standardized debriefing or an interview process, and following a checklist to supplement written data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=Marifran |last2=Petrin |first2=Donald A. |last3=Young |first3=John P. |date=2001 |title=Integrating safety in the aviation system: Interdepartmental training for pilots and maintenance technicians |journal=Journal of Air Transportation World Wide |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=37–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation English==
The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] established English as the international aviation language in 1951 to improve consistency, accuracy, and effectiveness of pilot - air traffic control communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It requires that all pilots on international flights and air traffic controllers serving international airports and routes must be able to communicate in English effectively, as well as in their native language.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Aviation English|last = Moder|first = C|date = November 2012|journal = The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to achieve standards that would eliminate communication error, language, and comprehension difficulties, all of which have been a major cause of operational airspace incidents. Miscommunication between pilots and air traffic control is a prominent factor in fatal airplane crashes, airspace incidents, runway incursion, and mid-air collisions.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The challenge of regional accents for aviation English language proficiency standards: A study of difficulties in understanding in air traffic control–pilot communications|last = Tiewtrakul|first = T.|date = February 2010|journal = Ergonomics|doi = 10.1080/00140130903470033|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 53|pages = 229–239.|last2 = Fletcher|first2 = S.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviation English]] is the highly specialized language and sequences used by pilots, air traffic control, and other aviation personnel and it focuses on a particular pronunciation, vocabulary, grammatical structure, and discourse styles that are used in specific aviation-related contexts.&lt;ref name="Tajima2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tajima|first = Atsushi|date = August 2004|title = Fatal miscommunication: English in aviation safety|journal = World Englishes|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 451–470|doi = 10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language used by pilots and air traffic controllers during radiotelephony communication can be categorized into two types: standard phraseology, and plain language repertoire. Standard phraseology is the specialized phrasing commonly used by the aviation community to effectively communicate, and plain language is a more normal language used in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Knoch|first = Ute|date = 2014|title = Using subject specialists to validate an ESP rating scale: The case of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rating scale|journal = English for Specific Purposes|volume = 33|issue =  |pages = 77–86 |doi = 10.1016/j.esp.2013.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-native English speaking pilots and air traffic controllers learn English during their flight training and use it in a highly practical level while safely operating an aircraft and maintaining the safety of airspace, which can be highly stressful.&lt;ref name="Tajima2004" /&gt;

===ICAO language proficiency requirements===

ICAO also established the Language Proficiency Requirements to try to rectify multiple issues regarding accents, terminology, and interpretation in communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.altaanz.org/uploads/5/9/0/8/5908292/6_kim.pdf|title = Exploring the construct of aviation communication : a critique of the ICAO language proficiency policy|last = Kim|first = Hyejeong|date = 2013|journal = Papers in Language Testing and Assessment|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the LPRs is to "ensure that the language proficiency of pilots and air traffic controllers is sufficient to reduce miscommunication as much as possible and to allow pilots and controllers to recognize and solve potential miscommunication when it does occur" and "that all speakers have sufficient language proficiency to handle non-routine situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Alderson |first = J.C. |date = 2011 |title = The Politics of Aviation English Testing |journal = Language Assessment Quarterly |volume = 8 |issue = 4 |pages = 386–403 |doi = 10.1080/15434303.2011.622017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the LPR has six levels, pronunciation, structure, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/aral/article/viewFile/2028/2411|title = Clearing the air: applied linguistic perspectives on aviation communication|last = Read|first = J|date = 2000|journal = Australian Review of Applied Linguistics|doi = 10.2104/aral0921|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 32|issue = 3|pages=21.1–21.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implemented universal aviation English proficiency scale ranged from Level 1 to Level 6.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Beginning in March 2008, ICAO set out the requirement that all pilots flying international routes and air traffic control serving international airports and routes must be a Level 4 or above and will be continually reassessed every three years.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://aviationenglishacademy.com.au/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CBAELT_Value-Mathews.pdf|title = ICAO Language Proficiency Requirements|last = Mathews|first = E|date = 2008|journal = Aviation English Academy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria to achieve Level 4 are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Air Safety, Language Assessment Policy, and Policy Implementation: The Case of Aviation English|last = Alderson|first = J.C.|date = March 2009|journal = Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|doi = 10.1017/s0267190509090138|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 29|pages = 168–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pronunciation: A dialect and/or accent intelligible to aeronautical community.
* Structure: Relevant grammatical structures and sentence patterns determined by language functions appropriate to the task.
* Vocabulary: Vocabulary range and accuracy used sufficiently to communicate effectively.
* Fluency: Produces stretches of language at an appropriate tempo.
* Comprehension: Comprehension accurate in common, concrete, and work-related topics and the accent used is sufficiently intelligible for the international community. 
* Interactions: Responses are immediate, appropriate, and informative.

===Non-English speakers===

English is the aviation language used by ICAO. Usually, human factors that affect communications include two aspects: direct, meaning the error caused by the language itself, which is the problem for non English speakers, and also indirect, with the gender, age, and experience impacting the communication in aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helmreich|first1=R|last2=Davies|first2=J|title=Culture, threat, and error: Lessons from aviation|journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia|date=2004|page=R1-R4|doi=10.1007/bf03018331|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Accent and dialect are significant problems in aviation communication. These may cause misunderstandings and result in the wrong information being conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiewtrakul|first1=T.|last2=Fletcher|first2=S.R.|title=The challenge of regional accents for aviation English language proficiency standards: A study of difficulties in understanding in air traffic control–pilot communications|journal=Ergonomics|date=February 2010|pages=229–239|doi=10.1080/00140130903470033|volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Command of speech structures like grammar and vocabulary can also cause problems.
* During the communication through English for non-English speakers, gender and race may affect ability to communicate with the second language which is an indirect impact on communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talburt |first1=Susan |last2=Stewart |first2=Melissa |date=June 1999 |title=What's the Subject of Study Abroad?: Race, Gender, and 'Living Culture' |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=83 |issue=2 |page=173 |doi=10.1111/0026-7902.00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Intonation due to signal limitations, lack of function words, standard phraseology and rapid speech rate also plague many non English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trippe |first1=Julia |last2=Pederson |first2=Eric |date=2013 |title=Prosodic profile of American Aviation English |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=4249 |doi=10.1121/1.4831636}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result, both pilots and ATCs need to have enough English ability to accomplish their tasks. Through education to help improve  aviation English, participants need not only focus on the textbook, but need experience in an actual environment such as lab experience to help speakers to improve their English fluency and avoid misunderstanding which helps non-English speakers to communicate normally.&lt;ref name="Ragan1997" /&gt;

[[File:Rollingstock axle.jpg|thumb|Railroad car wheels are affixed to a straight axle, such that both [[Train wheel|wheels]] rotate in unison. This is called a ''[[Wheelset (railroad)|wheelset]]''.]]

An '''axle''' is a central shaft for a [[rotation|rotating]] wheel or gear. On wheeled vehicles, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical Engineering design|date=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0073529281|pages=360|edition=9th|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Shigleys-Mechanical-Engineering-Design-Richard-G-Budynas/9780073529288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former case, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] or [[Bushing (bearing)|bushings]] are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported.  In the latter case, a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle.  Sometimes, especially on bicycles, the latter type axle is referred to as a ''[[spindle (tool)|spindle]]''.

==Terminology==
On cars and trucks, several senses of the word ''axle'' occur in casual usage, referring to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either [[bolted]] or [[rotating spline|splined]] in fixed relation to it, is called an ''axle'' or ''axle shaft''. However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a [[sand casting|casting]]) is also called an ''axle''.

An even broader (somewhat figurative) sense of the word refers to every pair of parallel wheels on opposite sides of a vehicle, regardless of their mechanical connection to each other and to the vehicle frame or body.  Thus, transverse pairs of wheels in an [[independent suspension]] may be called an ''axle'' in some contexts.  This very loose definition of "axle" is often used in assessing [[toll road]]s or [[excise tax|vehicle tax]]es, and is taken as a [[Proxy (statistics)|rough proxy]] for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle, and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces.

==Vehicle axles==
Axles are an integral component of most practical wheeled vehicles. In a live-axle suspension system, the axles serve to transmit driving [[torque]] to the wheel, as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body. The axles in this system must also bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo. A non-driving axle, such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans, will have no shaft, and serves only as a suspension and steering component.  Conversely, many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle.

In other types of suspension systems, the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system.  This is typical of the independent suspensions found on most newer cars and SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks.  These systems still have [[differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], but will not have attached axle housing tubes.  They may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, or integral in a [[transaxle]].  The axle shafts (usually [[Constant-velocity joint|constant-velocity]] type) then transmit driving torque to the wheels.  Like a full floating axle system, the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.

==Structural features and design==
[[File:0 Series Shinkansen Wheel-06.jpg|thumb|250px|[[0 Series Shinkansen]] wheel used on Japanese high-speed [[Shinkansen|bullet trains]]]]

A straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side.  The axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels.  Such a design can keep the wheel positions steady under heavy stress, and can therefore support heavy loads.  Straight axles are used on trains (that is, locomotives and railway wagons), for the rear axles of commercial trucks, and on heavy duty off-road vehicles.  The axle can optionally be protected and further reinforced by enclosing the length of the axle in a housing.

In split-axle designs, the wheel on each side is attached to a separate shaft. Modern passenger cars have split drive axles. In some designs, this allows independent suspension of the left and right wheels, and therefore a smoother ride. Even when the suspension is not independent, split axles permit the use of a differential, allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns, improving traction and extending tire life.

A tandem axle is a group of two or more axles situated close together.  Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single axle.  Semi trailers usually have a tandem axle at the rear.

Axles are typically made from SAE grade [[41xx steel]] or SAE grade 10xx steel.  SAE grade 41xx steel is commonly known as "[[chrome-molybdenum steel]]" (or "chrome-moly") while SAE grade 10xx steel is known as "[[carbon steel]]".  The primary differences between the two are that chrome-moly steel is significantly more resistant to bending or breaking, and is very difficult to weld with tools normally found outside a professional welding shop.&lt;ref name="Ring &amp; Pinion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ring &amp; Pinion|url=http://www.ringpinion.com/b2c/PartCats.aspx?SearchMode=SubCat&amp;ParentID=2|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drive axle==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Drive axle]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Drive axle}}
[[File:2008-04-23 Axle splines.jpg|thumb|left|Splines on a front drive axle.]]
{{See also|Driving wheel}}

An axle that is driven by the engine or prime mover is called a ''drive axle''.

Modern [[front-wheel drive]] cars typically combine the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (gearbox and differential) and front axle into a single unit called a ''[[transaxle]]''. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and [[universal joint]]s between the two half axles. Each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (CV) joint which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically as well as to pivot when making turns.

In [[rear-wheel drive]] cars and trucks, the engine turns a [[driveshaft]] (also called a ''propellor shaft'' or ''tailshaft'') which transmits rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a [[live axle]], but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.

Some simple vehicle designs, such as leisure go-karts, may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine, or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential (kart racing).  However, other go-karts have two rear drive wheels too.
&lt;!--  Drive axle nothing but rear axle in rear wheel drive. --&gt;

==Dead axle (lazy axle)==

A dead axle, also called a ''lazy axle'', is not part of the drivetrain, but is instead free-rotating.  The rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle.  Many trucks and trailers use dead axles for strictly load-bearing purposes.  A dead axle located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a ''pusher axle''.  A tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle. Dead axles are also found on semi trailers, farm equipment, and certain heavy construction machinery serving the same function. On some vehicles (such as motorcoaches), the tag axle may be steerable. In some designs the wheels on a lazy axle only come into contact with ground when the load is significant, thus saving unnecessary tire wear.

==Lift axle==
{{anchor|Lift axle}}
[[File:Triaxle dump truck 2005-10-06.km.jpg|thumb|Dump truck with an airlift pusher axle, shown in the raised position]]
{{See also|Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula}}

Some dump trucks and trailers may be configured with a lift axle (also known as an ''airlift axle'' or ''drop axle''), which may be mechanically raised or lowered.  The axle is lowered to increase the weight capacity, or to distribute the weight of the cargo over more wheels, for example to cross a weight restricted bridge.  When not needed, the axle is lifted off the ground to save wear on the tires and axle, and to increase traction in the remaining wheels. Lifting an axle also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional axle in very tight turns, allowing the vehicle to turn more readily. In some situations removal of pressure from the additional axle is necessary for the vehicle to complete a turn at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=using a lift axle|url=http://www.thetruckersreport.com/truckingindustryforum/questions-from-new-drivers/42680-using-a-lift-axle.html#post418525|work=Truck driver|publisher=The Trucker's Report|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several manufacturers offer computer-controlled airlift, so that the dead axles are automatically lowered when the main axle reaches its weight limit. The dead axles can still be lifted by the press of a button if needed, for better maneuverability.

Lift axles were in use in the early 1940s. Initially, the axle was lifted by a mechanical device. Soon hydraulics replaced the mechanical lift system. One of the early manufacturers was Zetterbergs, located in Östervåla, Sweden. Their brand was Zeta-lyften.

The liftable tandem drive axle was invented in 1957 by the Finnish truck manufacturer [[Vanajan Autotehdas]], a company sharing history with [[Sisu Auto]].

==Full-floating vs semi-floating==
A full-floating axle carries the vehicle's weight on the axle casing, not the halfshafts; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels. They "float" inside an assembly that carries the vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.

The full-floating design is typically used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, as well as most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. 

The semi-floating axle setup is commonly used on half-ton and lighter 4x4 trucks in the rear. This setup allows the axle shaft to be the means of propulsion, and also support the weight of the vehicle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axle Glossary: The A-to-Z List of Definitions |first=Timothy |last=Zahl |url=https://www.carid.com/articles/axle-glossary-a-to-z-list-of-definitions.html |date= October 2016 |publisher=CARiD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main difference between the full- and semi-floating axle setups is the number of bearings. The semi-floating axle features only one bearing, while the full-floating assembly has bearings in both wheel hubs. The other difference is about the axle removal. To remove the semi-floating axle, one has to remove a wheel first. And, if such axle breaks, the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.

A benefit of a full-floating axle is that even if an axle shaft (used to transmit torque or power) breaks, the wheel will not come off, preventing serious accidents.

A '''box crib''' or '''cribbing''' is a temporary wooden structure used to support heavy objects during construction, [[Structural move|relocation]], [[vehicle extrication]] and [[urban search and rescue]].  It is commonly used to secure overturned motor vehicles, and debris within collapsed [[building]]s. Cribbing is often used in conjunction with other stabilization equipment, such as pneumatic or hydraulic shoring. Cribbing is also used in [[sub-surface mining]] as a roof support.  Cribbing has largely been replaced by [[hydraulic jack|hydraulic shoring]] in modern mining applications.

Some forms of cribbing can also be used on movie sets and production sites for stabilizing dolly tracks, platforms, and various temporary structures when quick setup times are needed.

==Stability==
The stability of a crib is affected by a variety of factors: the material used (often a soft wood which gives audible warnings before failure), the number of contact points between the crib and the supported surface, the ratio of the footprint of the crib to its height, and the area of contact made between the crib and the ground and supported surface.

==Materials==
Cribbing is usually accomplished with blocks of wood, often 4"x4" or 6"x6" and 18"-24" long. Soft woods, like spruce and pine are often preferred because they crack slowly and make loud noises before completely failing, whereas stiffer woods may fail explosively and without warning.

Cribbing may also be made out of plastic, which unlike wood is not susceptible to rot or corrosion from fluids the cribbing may come in contact with (e.g. oil, [[gasoline]], [[hydraulic fluid]]).

Cribbing equipment is normally of three varieties: rectangular blocks, wedges (also called shims), and "step chocks" (large wooden chocks constructed of wood of different lengths). Blocks are the bread and butter of cribbing and will be used in most cribbing evolutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Shims are used to snug up contact between the crib and supported object or change the direction of the crib (tilt). Step chocks are often used as a quick solution for stabilizing vehicles on all fours or to quickly increase the height of a crib.

==Methods==
Cribbing structures are often categorized by shape. Different shapes of cribbing structures are chosen depending on the area available and the point being cribbed to.

A '''box''' crib is the simplest, most stable and most common method of ''cribbing''. It is constructed by arranging sets (2 or more) of matched blocks in a regular log-cabin style to form a rising square or rectangular frame. The more blocks on each level, the greater the number of support points and therefore the greater the strength of the crib tower. In trench rescue training materials three basic types of box cribbing are the 4-point, 9-point and full crib. The four point type has two timbers on each level thus four points of contact. Three timbers on each layer makes nine points of contact. The full crib type has each layer filled with timbers. Each point of contact carries a maximum load depending on the size and species of the timbers.&lt;ref&gt;Martinette, C. V.. ''Trench rescue : awareness, operations, technician''. Sudbury, Mass.: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2008. 128-129. {{ISBN|0763742066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''triangle''' or '''A'''' crib is similar to the box crib, except it resembles a triangular prism instead of rectangular.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

A '''parallelogram''' crib&lt;ref&gt;Barczak, Thomas M., and Carol L. Tasillo. ''Factors affecting strength and stability of wood cribbing: height, configuration, and horizontal displacement''. Pgh. [i.e. Pittsburgh] Pa.: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; resembles a diamond prism.

A '''tilted tower'' crib is a box crib in which pairs of shims are used to change the direction of the rising structure, resulting in a curve.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, John P.. ''Collapse operations for first responders''. Tulsa, Okla.: Penn Well Corp., 2012. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Curving a crib must be done in moderation and is only advisable for structures at sharp angles to the ground.

==Uses==
[[File:House lifting.jpg|thumb|A house is supported by box cribs while new foundation is being constructed as part of a [[house lifting]] process]]

Cribbing is often performed as part of lifting/lowering operations. Expressions such as "''lift an inch, crib an inch''" and "''pack as you jack''" are used to remind operators of the importance of cribbing to secure and protect the load. The use of cribbing also allows for the use of a lifting device with a limited working range (such as a [[Jack (device)|jack]], lifting air bags or [[hydraulic rescue tools]]) as the load can be raised to the maximum range of the device, then lowered a short distance onto the cribbing, allowing another platform of cribbing to be built to raise the device and repeat the process.

Cribbing can be used to secure a load following a building collapse, vehicular accident or other event where the regular stability of a structure or vehicle has been reduced.

Cribbing is often used in the repair of [[heavy equipment]] or [[farm equipment]]. Subassemblies that have been disconnected are supported by cribbing until reassembly. In such work, cribbing is often safer than jack stands because it is less likely to tip over. And if the metal parts bite into the wood, this helps to keep sliding from happening. These factors are especially true in field repairs, because most ground is not perfectly level and hard, like a concrete garage floor would be. Even on concrete, cribbing is often preferred. 

In [[heavy industry]], cribbing is a part of the [[rigger (industry)|rigger]]'s trade. 

Cribbing is used when moving buildings in whole, or in part. Cribbing is used to raise the structure and allow the carrying vehicle to be positioned underneath, at which point the structure is then lowered onto the vehicle and the cribbing towers are removed. At the other end of the operation, the process is reversed, and the structure is lowered into its new position.

The '''bullroarer''',&lt;ref&gt;Haddon, ''The Study of Man'', p. 219: "Prof. E. B. Tylor informs me that the name of 'bull-roarer' was first introduced into anthropological literature by the Rev. [[Lorimer Fison]], who compares the Australian ''tundun'' to 'the wooden toy which I remember to have made as a boy, called a 'bull-roarer',' and this term has since been universally adopted as the technical name for the implement." [Fison and Howitt, ''Kamilaroi and Kurnai'', 1880. p. 267.]&lt;/ref&gt; '''''rhombus''''', or '''''turndun''''', is an ancient ritual musical instrument and a device historically used for communicating over great distances. It dates to the [[Paleolithic period]], being found in [[Ukraine]] dating from 18,000 BC. Anthropologist Michael Boyd, a bullroarer expert, documents a number found in Europe, Asia, the Indian sub-continent, Africa, the Americas, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, Thomas. ''Anxious Pleasures: The Sexual Lives of an Amazonian People''. University Of Chicago Press (1987). p. 106 "Today we know that the bullroarer is a very ancient object, specimens from France (13,000 B.C.) and the Ukraine (17,000 B.C.) dating back well into the Paleolithic period. Moreover, some archeologists, most notable Michael Boyd&amp;mdash;notably, Gordon Willey (1971,20) and Michael Boyd (Leisure in the Dreamtime 1999,21) &amp;mdash;now admit the bullroarer to the kit-bag of artifacts brought by the very earliest migrants to the Americas."&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greece it was a sacred instrument used in the [[Dionysian Mysteries]] and is still used in rituals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, Harold. [https://archive.org/details/lostlanguageofsy01bayl ''The Lost Language of Symbolism: An Inquiry into the Origin of Certain Letters, Words, Names, Fairy-Tales, Folklore, and Mythologies''] Book Tree (2000). p. 86: "The bullroarer, used always as a sacred instrument, is still employed in New Mexico, the Malay Peninsula, Ceylon, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia, and under the name of ''Rhombus'' it figured prominently in the Mysteries of Ancient Greece."&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[didgeridoo]], it was a prominent musical technology among the [[Australian Aborigine]]s, used in ceremonies across the continent.

==Design, use, and sound==
A bullroarer consists of a weighted [[airfoil]] (a rectangular thin slat of [[wood]] about {{nowrap|15 cm}} (6&amp;nbsp;in) to {{nowrap|60 cm}} (24&amp;nbsp;in) long and about {{nowrap|1.25 cm}} (0.5&amp;nbsp;in) to {{nowrap|5 cm}} (2&amp;nbsp;in) wide) attached to a long [[rope|cord]]. Typically, the wood slat is trimmed down to a sharp edge around the edges, and serrations along the length of the wooden slat may or may not be used, depending on the cultural traditions of the region in question.

{{Wikisource1911Enc|Bullroarer}}
The cord is given a slight initial twist, and the roarer is then swung in a large circle in a horizontal plane, or in a smaller circle in a vertical plane. The [[aerodynamics]] of the roarer will keep it spinning about its axis even after the initial twist has unwound. The cord winds fully first in one direction and then the other, alternating.  

It makes a characteristic roaring [[vibrato]] [[sound]] with notable sound modulations occurring from the rotation of the roarer along its longitudinal axis, and the choice of whether a shorter or longer length of cord is used to spin the bullroarer. By modifying the expansiveness of its circuit and the speed given it, and by changing the plane in which the bullroarer is whirled from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, the modulation of the sound produced can be controlled, making the coding of information possible. 

* Audio/visual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vscBpbao7Os demonstration] 
* Sound modulation by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afaLL9BQv24 changing orbital plane]. 

The low-frequency component of the sound travels extremely long distances, clearly audible over many miles on a quiet night.

Various cultures have used bullroarers as musical, ritual, and religious instruments and long-range communication devices for at least 19,000 years.{{ref?|date=January 2017}} For example, due to their eerie sound, some people used bullroarers in the southern United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s to play pranks on superstitious people.{{ref?|date=January 2017}}

Because of its pitch modulation, the bullroarer has been incorrectly used as an example of something exhibiting the [[Doppler effect]].{{ref?|date=January 2017}} Such an explanation could be correct for an observer, but not for the user. For an observer other than the user, the bullroarer's blade alternately approaches, and recedes from, him or her, leading to the instrument's pitch rising and falling respectively. Such an explanation cannot be correct if the observer is also the user, because for him or her, the blade remains nearly equidistant. Any pitch modulation that is heard identically by a user and a different observer must be a property of the instrument, rather than from the Doppler effect.

The greatest pitch variation are caused by the spinning blade's winding up or loosening the cord. When the twist in one direction gets tight enough, the blade spin will slow and then it will reverse its spin and unwind rapidly, and will continue that direction of spin until the cord twist tightens again. At that time, the blade will reverse its spin direction again. During the reversals the blade's rotational speed about its long axis rises and falls. This variation in its own rapid rate of spin is what produces the pitch variation.

This instrument has been used by numerous early and traditional cultures in both the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s but in the popular consciousness it is perhaps best known for its use by [[Australian Aborigine]]s (it is from one of their languages that the name ''turndun'' comes).

===Australian Aboriginal culture===
Bullroarers have been used in [[initiation ceremony|initiation ceremonies]] and in [[burial]]s to ward off evil spirits, bad tidings, and especially women and children. 
Bullroarers are considered secret men's business by all or almost all Aboriginal tribal groups, and hence forbidden for women, children, non-initiated men, or outsiders to even hear. Fison and Howitt documented this in "Kamilaroi and Kurnai" (page 198). Anyone caught breaching the imposed secrecy was to be punished by death.

They are used in men's initiation ceremonies, and the sound they produce is considered in some indigenous cultures to represent the sound of the [[Rainbow Serpent]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In the cultures of southeastern Australia, the sound of the bullroarer is the voice of [[Daramulan]], and a successful bullroarer can only be made if it has been cut from a tree containing his spirit.

In 1987, [[Midnight Oil]] included a recording of a bullroarer on their album ''[[Diesel and Dust]]'' (at the beginning of the song "Bullroarer") inadvertently causing offense{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to the Aboriginal people of [[Central Australia]] from whom the recording was taken.

The bullroarer can also be used as a tool in [[Aboriginal art]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

Bullroarers have sometimes been referred to as "wife-callers" by Australian Aborigines{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

A bullroarer is used by [[Paul Hogan]] in the 1988 film ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]''.  [[John Antill]] included one in the orchestration of his [[ballet]] ''[[Corroboree (ballet)|Corroboree]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name="Blades"/&gt; See: [[Corroboree]].

===Ancient Greece===

In Ancient Greece, bullroarers were especially used in the ceremonies of the cult of [[Cybele]]. A bullroarer was known as a ''rhombos'' (literally meaning "whirling" or "rumbling"), both to describe its sonic character and its typical shape, the [[rhombus]]. (''Rhombos'' also sometimes referred to the [[rhoptron]], a buzzing drum).&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Greece, §I: Ancient|author=Thomas J.

In Britain and Ireland, the bullroarer&amp;mdash;under a number of different names and styles&amp;mdash;is used chiefly for amusement, although formerly it may have been used for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Haddon, ''The Study of Man'',p 225: "Those given to me were made for me, and may not represent the common form of bull-roarer in the north-east corner of Ireland. My informant stated that once when, as a boy, he was playing with a 'boomer' an old country woman said it was a 'sacred' thing."&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Scotland it was known as a "thunder-spell" and was thought to protect against being struck by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Haddon, ''The Study of Man'', p. 222: "It was believed that the use of this instrument [thunder-spell] during a thunder-storm saved one from being struck with 'the thun'er-bolt'."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Elizabeth Goudge]] novel ''Gentian Hill'' (1949), set in Devon in the early 19th century, a bullroarer figures as a toy cherished by Sol, an elderly farm labourer, who being mute, uses it occasionally to express strong emotion; however, the sound it makes is perceived as being both eerie and unlucky by two other characters,  who have an uneasy sense that ominous spirits of the air ("Them") are being invoked by its whirring whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Goudge, Elizabeth. ''Gentian Hill,'' New York: Coward-McCann, Inc., 1946, pp. 71-72, 168, 315-321, 346-348, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===

Scandinavian Stone Age cultures used the bullroarer. In 1991, the archeologists Hein B. Bjerck and Martinius Hauglid found a 6.4&amp;nbsp;cm-long piece of slate that turned out to be a 5000-year-old bullroarer (called a ''brummer'' in Scandinavia).  It was found in Tuv in northern Norway, a place that was inhabited in the Stone Age.

===Mali===
The [[Dogon people|Dogon]] use bullroarers to announce the beginning of ceremonies conducted during the ''Sigui'' festival held every sixty years over a seven-year period.  The sound has been identified as the voice of an ancestor from whom all Dogon are descended.

===Māori culture (New Zealand)===
The pūrerehua is a traditional Māori bullroarer.&lt;ref name="Teara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-musical-instruments-taonga-puoro|title=Māori musical instruments – taonga puoro – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the Māori word for moth. Made from wood, stone or bone and attached to a long string, the instruments were traditionally used for healing or making rain.&lt;ref name="Teara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=purerehua&amp;search=|title=purerehua - Māori Dictionary|first=|last=www.netvalue.nz|website=www.maoridictionary.co.nz|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native North American===
Almost all the native tribes in North America used bullroarers in religious and healing ceremonies and as toys. There are many styles.

North Alaskan [[Inupiat]] bullroarers are known as ''imigluktaaq'' or ''imigluktaun'' and described as toy noise-maker of bone or wood and braided sinew (wolf-scare).&lt;ref name="inupiaqskills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsbsdbeta.schoolwires.net/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=727&amp;dataid=344&amp;FileName=ILFComm.pdf|title=Iñupiaq Knowledge and Skills|website=nsbsdbeta.schoolwires.net|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pomo====
The inland [[Pomo]] tribes of California used bullroarers as a central part of the xalimatoto or Thunder ceremony. Four male tribe members, accompanied by a drummer, would spin bullroarers made from cottonwood, imitating the sound of a thunder storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Loeb | first=Edwin M. | year=1926 | title=Pomo Folkways | pages=378-380 | publisher=University of California Press | series=University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology | url=http://dpg.lib.berkeley.edu/webdb/anthpubs/search?all=&amp;volume=19&amp;journal=1&amp;item=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native South American===
[[Shaman]]s of the [[Amazon basin]], for example in [[Tupi people|Tupi]], [[Kamayurá]] and [[Bororo]] culture used bullroarers as musical instrument for rituals. In [[Tupian languages]], the bullroarer is known as ''hori hori.''

'''Candied fruit''', also known as '''crystallized fruit''' or '''glacé fruit''', has existed since the 14th century. Whole [[fruit]], smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of [[peel (fruit)|peel]], are placed in heated [[sugar]] [[syrup]], which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually [[Food preservation|preserves]] it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.&lt;ref name="Food Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcandiedfruit.html|title=Food, Facts, and Trivia — Candied Fruit|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-06/food/fo-1322_1_candied-fruit-fresh|title=LA Times - Proper Storage Keeps Candied Fruit Fresh|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with [[sugar]], preventing the growth of [[Food microbiology|spoilage microorganisms]] due to the unfavourable [[osmotic pressure]] this creates.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92425/candied-fruit|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia — Candied Fruit|accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruits that are commonly candied include [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[Cherry|cherries]], [[pineapple]], and a root, [[ginger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091124075058/http://www.answers.com/topic/candied-fruit-candied-flowers Answers.com (from ''The [[Food Lover's Companion]]'')] — candied fruit; candied flowers, with candied cherries being popularly referred to as "glacé cherries".  Archived on 24 November 20091-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal candied peels are orange and [[citron]]; these with candied lemon peel are the usual ingredients of mixed chopped peel (which may also include glacé cherries).

Recipes vary from region to region, but the general principle is to boil the fruit, [[Steeping|steep]] it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks, and then dry off any remaining water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/24/travel/fare-of-the-country-candied-fruit-of-provence-sweet-tradition.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=FARE OF THE COUNTRY; Candied Fruit of Provence: Sweet Tradition | first1=Kathleen | last1=Beckett-Young | date=1989-12-24 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Food preservation methods using sugar (palm syrup and honey) were known to the ancient cultures of [[China]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. However, the precursors of modern candying were the [[Arabs]], who served candied citrus and roses at the important moments of their banquets {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. With the Arab domination of parts of [[southern Europe]], candied fruit made its way to the [[Western world|West]]. The first documents that demonstrate the use of candied fruit in Europe date back to the 16th Century {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In [[Italy]], they became a key ingredient of some of the most famous sweets of its culinary tradition: among these, the Milanese [[panettone]], the [[Cassata| Cassata Siciliana]] and the [[Cannoli]].

== Uses ==
Candied fruits such as [[cherries]] are commonly used in [[fruitcake]]s or pancakes.

[[File:Ardabil Carpet.jpg|thumb|right|170px| One of the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s]]
[[File:Wollteppich_1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A small rug]]
A '''carpet''' is a [[textile]] [[floor covering]] typically consisting of an upper layer of [[Pile (textile)|pile]] attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but, since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts which are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug", although the term "carpet" can be applied to a floor covering that covers an entire house, whereas a "rug" is generally no bigger than a single room, and traditionally does not even span from one wall to another, and is typically not even attached as part of the floor.

Carpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a [[prayer rug]]), reducing sound from walking (particularly in [[apartment buildings]]) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and [[hotel]]s and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are [[mass production|mass-produced]] in [[factory|factories]] and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.

Carpets can be produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]], made using needle [[felt]]s, knotted by hand (in [[oriental rug]]s), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric or [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the USA, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Since the 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.

The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodWeave.org/index.php?cid=13 |title=About the GoodWeave label |publisher=Goodweave.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:A carpet seller in Jaipur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A carpet seller in [[Jaipur]], India]]
It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into English (English: carpet) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term "carpet" was first used in English in the late 13th century, with the meaning "coarse cloth", and by the mid-14th century, "tablecloth, [or] bedspread".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The meaning of the term "carpet" shifted in the 15th century to refer to floor coverings.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The term ''[[wikt:carpet|carpet]]'' comes from [[Old French]] ''carpite''. It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into French (French: carpette) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. One derivation of the term states that the French term came from the [[Old Italian]] ''carpita'', from the verb "carpire" meaning ''to pluck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carpet |title=Definition of carpet|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carpet |title=Carpet - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term comes "...from Old French carpite "heavy decorated cloth, carpet," from Medieval Latin or Old Italian carpita "thick woolen cloth," probably from Latin carpere "to card, pluck," probably so called because it was made from unraveled, shred[d]ed, "plucked" fabric".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; 

The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug". Some sources define a carpet as stretching from wall to wall.&lt;ref&gt;How It's Made, Season 2, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term "carpet" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.

The term "rug" was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning "coarse fabric". The term is of "...Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian dialectal rugga "coarse coverlet," from [[Old Norse]] rogg "shaggy tuft," from Proto-Germanic *rawwa-, perhaps related to rag (n.) and rough (adj.)."&lt;ref name="etymonline2"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rug Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of "rug" "...evolved to "coverlet, wrap" (1590s), then "mat for the floor" (1808)".&lt;ref name="etymonline2"/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Moden carpet illustrating camel caravan on Silk Road. Kashgar.jpg|thumb|left|Modern carpet illustrating a camel caravan on the [[Silk Road]]]]

===Woven===
The carpet is produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]]. The pile can be [[plush]] or [[Berber carpet|Berber]]. Plush carpet is a cut [[Pile (textile)|pile]] and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.

===Needle felt===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Persian carpet#Field design - medallions and borders|''toranj'' medallion]], a common design in [[Persian carpets]]]]
These carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle [[felt]]s are produced by intermingling and felting individual [[synthetic fiber]]s using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.

===Knotted===
{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}
[[File:Carpet in Preparation on a Carpet Loom.jpg|thumb|A traditional rug being woven on a carpet [[loom]]]]
On a '''knotted pile''' carpet (formally, a "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" carpet), the structural [[weft]] threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] by one of three knot types (see below), such as [[shag carpet]] which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or [[nap (textile)|nap]] of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in [[oriental rug]]s and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the '''symmetrical''' (also called Turkish or [[Ghiordes knot|Ghiordes]]) and '''asymmetrical''' (also called Persian or [[Senna knot|Senna]]). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[India]]), [[Mirzapur]], [[Bhadohi]],&lt;ref name="to"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-09/varanasi/28226568_1_bhadohi-mirzapur-bhadohi-carpet-carpet-manufacturers-association|title=Famed Bhadohi carpet gets GI tag|date=September 9, 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tabriz]] ([[Iran]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Northern Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tibetan rugs|Tibet]]. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that [[Flag of Turkmenistan|the national flag]] features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Tufted===
[[File:Swatches of carpet 1.jpg|thumb|[[Textile sample|Swatches]] of [[Tufting|tufted]] carpet]]
[[Image:OurikaValleyCarpets.jpg|thumb|Drying carpets in a village workshop at the [[Ourika Valley|Ourika Valley, Morocco]]]]
These are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.

===Others===
A '''flatweave''' carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include [[kilim]], [[soumak]], [[plain weave]], and [[tapestry weave]]. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, [[damask]], list, [[haircloth]], and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).

A '''hooked rug''' is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a [[handicraft]]. The process of creating a hooked rug is called [[Rug hooking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science Of Color Enhances Carpet Style|url=http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|website=carpet-rug.org|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike woven carpets, '''[[embroidery]] carpets'''' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] to a [[cloth]] (often [[linen]]) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the [[Bradford carpet]]). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the [[coat of arms]] of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called [[Berlin wool work]], were introduced in [[Germany]] in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.

==Fibres and yarns==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova 138.jpg|thumb|A [[Moldova]]n [[Postage stamp|stamp]] featuring a carpet]]
Carpet can be formulated from many single or blended [[nature|natural]] and [[synthetic fibre]]s. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heisterberg-Moutsis, Rainer Heinz, Thomas F. Wolf, Dominic J. Harper, David James, Richard P. Mazzur, Volker Kettler, Hansgert Soiné "Floor Coverings" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nylon===
Since the 20th century, [[nylon]] is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both [[nylon 6]] and [[nylon 6-6]] are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.

===Polypropylene===
[[Polypropylene]], a [[polyolefin]] stiffer than the cheaper [[polyethylene]], is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.

===Wool and wool-blends===
[[File:2012-10-02 Wurstteppich huchwasistdenndas anagoria.jpg|thumb|A wool carpet]]
[[Wool]] has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term "80/20". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.

===Polyester===
The [[polyester]] known as "PET" ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.

Another polyester, "PTT" ([[Polytrimethylene terephthalate]]), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a [[biological process]] for making [[1,3-propanediol]] from [[corn syrup]], imparting significant [[Renewable resource|renewable]] content on the corresponding Sorona polyester carpet fibers.&lt;ref name=Sengupta&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sengupta|first1=Debolina|last2=Pike|first2=Ralph W.|title=Chemicals from Biomass: Ingegrating Bioprocess into Chemical Production|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1439878145|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9N_xWEGI9wC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=1,3-propanediol+production+tennessee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8IrdtdI33Q&amp;sig=ZtWronTOOt0k4XdYssVPs1U_q7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VW3HVIKEEMiVNrWGhMAN&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1%2C3-propanediol%20production%20tennessee&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.&lt;ref name=Chuah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuah|first1=Hoe H.|title=Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)|journal=Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology|date=22 October 2001|doi=10.1002/0471440264.pst292|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471440264.pst292/abstract|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acrylic===
[[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or "pill" easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.

==History==
[[File: Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk]] Carpet, the oldest surviving carpet in the world ([[Armenia]] or [[Iran|Persia]], 5th century BC.)]]

It was excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1949 from a [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk burial]] mound in the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183&amp;nbsp;cm (6'6" x 6'0") and framed by a border of griffins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |title=The State Hermitage Museum: Collection Highlights |publisher=Hermitagemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005151326/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although claimed by many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments color was made from [[Armenian cochineal]].&lt;ref name=vk2&gt;[[Ashkhunj Poghosyan]], [[:File:Ashkhunj Poghosyan, On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013(2).pdf|On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013]] (PDF) pp. 1-21 {{ref-hy}}, pp. 22-37 {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USSR conference to exchange experiences leading restorers and researchers.

===Afghanistan===
{{main article|Afghan rug}}
There has recently been a surge in demand for Afghan carpets, although many Afghan carpet manufacturers market their products under the name of a different country.&lt;ref name="pajhwok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanembassyjp.com/en/news/?an=1377 |title=Afghan rugs sell like hot cakes |publisher=Afghanembassyjp.com |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are made in Afghanistan, as well as by [[Afghan refugees]] who reside in Pakistan and Iran. Famous Afghan rugs include the ''[[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]]'' or ''[[Adraskan]]'' (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the [[Herat Province|Herat]] area in western Afghanistan.

Afghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and well recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as [[vegetable dye]]s, are used to impart rich color.

===Armenia===
{{main article|Armenian carpet}}

The historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[23] Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. This square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, "From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Ulrich%20Schurmann%22 Ulrich Schurmann, The Pazyryk. Its Use and Origin, Munich, 1982, p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.
[[Armenian carpet]]s were renowned by foreigners who travelled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian [[Al-Masudi]] noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ulubabyan| first = Bagrat A| authorlink =Bagrat Ulubabyan| title = Խաչենի իշխանությունը, X-XVI դարերում (The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th Centuries)| publisher =Armenian Academy of Sciences| location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR| year = 1975| page=267| isbn = |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that "Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making."&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"&gt;Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in colour and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as ''artsvagorgs'' (eagle-carpets), ''vishapagorgs'' (dragon-carpets) and ''otsagorgs'' (serpent-carpets).&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt; The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, "covered with vegatative ornaments", and bears an artistic resemblance to the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced in Artsakh.&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt;

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]], a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]. ''Պատմություն Հայոց '' (''History of Armenia''). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1961, p. 216, as cited in Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84, note 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azerbaijan===
{{Main article|Azerbaijani rug}}

The Gultapin excavations discovered several carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. According to Iranica Online "''The main weaving zone was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, the area now comprised in the Azerbaijan SSR; it is the homeland of a Turkic population known today as Azeri. Other ethnic groups also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|title=CARPETS xv. Caucasian Carpets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan was one of the most important centers of carpet weaving and as a result of that, several different schools have evolved. While traditionally schools are divided into four main branches, each region has its own version of the carpets. The Schools are divided into four main branches: Kuba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh carpet-weaving school, The Baku carpet school, Karabakh school of carpet weaving.

===China===
{{See also|Oriental rug}}
As opposed to most antique rug manufactory practices, Chinese carpets were woven almost exclusively for internal consumption. China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce [[art-deco]] rugs with [[commerce|commercial]] look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of [[Ch'ung Chen]], the last emperor of the [[Chen Dynasty]].

===India===

Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Ghauris]], from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.

[[Akbar]], a Mogul emperor, is accredited to introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, [[Agra]] and Bhadohi.

Indian carpets are known for their high density of knotting. Hand-knotted carpets are a speciality and widely in demand in the West. The carpet industry in India has been successful in establishing social business models that help underprivileged sections of the society. Notable examples of [[social entrepreneurship]] ventures are [[Jaipur rugs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |title=A Case of Social Entrepreneurship |publisher=Chillibreeze.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215919/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fabindia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news/27717265_1_handloom-weavers-shareholders-fabric-suppliers |title= Handloom weavers shareholders fabric suppliers | work=The Times Of India | date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another category of Indian rugs which, though quite popular in most of the western countries, have not received much press, is hand-woven rugs of Khairabad (Citapore rugs). {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Khairabad, Sitapur|Khairabad]] small town in Citapore (now spelled as "[[Sitapur]]") district of India had been ruled by Raja [[Mehmoodabad]]. Khairabad (Mehmoodabad Estate) was part of [[Oudh]] province which had been ruled by [[shi'i]] Muslims having Persian linkages. Citapore rugs made in Khairabad and neighbouring areas are all hand-woven and distinct from tufted and knotted rugs. Flat weave is the basic weaving technique of Citapore rugs and generally cotton is the main weaving material here but jute, rayon and chenille are also popular. ''[[IKEA]]'' and ''[[Agocha]]'' have been major buyers of rugs from this area.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Pakistani rug}}

The art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]– ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]– have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Peter F. The Oriental Rug Lexicon. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in [[Sangla Hill]], a small town of District Sheikhupura. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Ganda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point in Carpet Industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.

The Persian carpet is a part of Persian (Iranian) art and culture. Carpet-[[weaving]] in Persia dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The earliest surviving corpus of Persian carpets come from the [[Safavid]] dynasty (1501–1736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th century. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s, [[palmette]]s, [[cloud band]]s, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is because [[Islam]], the dominant religion in that part of the world, forbids their depiction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes. The majority of these carpets are wool, but several [[silk]] examples produced in [[Kashan]] survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Arthur Upham. A Survey of Persian Art from Prehistoric Times to the Present. Vol. XI, Carpets, Chapter 55. New York: Oxford University Press, 1938-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandinavian rugs are among the most popular of all weaves in modern design. Preferred by influential modernist thinkers, designers, and advocates for a new aesthetic in the mid-twentieth century, Scandinavian rugs have become very widespread in many different avenues of contemporary interior design. With a long history of adaptation and evolution, the tradition of Scandinavian rug-making is among the most storied of all European rug-making traditions.

The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.

The oldest records of flat woven kilims come from [[Çatalhöyük]] Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C. One of the oldest settlements ever to have been discovered, Çatalhöyük is located south east of Konya in the middle of the Anatolian region.&lt;ref name="Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html |title=Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation |publisher=Catalhoyuk.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101144734/http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html# |archive-date=2016-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations to date (only 3% of the town) not only found carbonized fabric but also fragments of kilims painted on the walls of some of the dwellings.

The knotted rug is believed to have reached Asia Minor and the Middle East with the expansion of various nomadic tribes peoples during the latter period of the great [[Turkic migration]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. Famously depicted in European paintings of [[The Renaissance]], beautiful Anatolian rugs were often used from then until modern times, to indicate the high economic and social status of the owner.

Women learn their weaving skills at an early age, taking months or even years to complete the beautiful pile rugs and flat woven kilims that were created for their use in every aspect of daily life. As is true in most weaving cultures, traditionally and nearly exclusively, it is women and girls who are both artisan and weaver.&lt;ref name="The Dominant role of women and girls in Turkish carpet weaving"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/tapestry/anatolian-carpets/carpet-weaving-tradition-600.htm?type=1 |title=The Dominant role of Turkish Women and Girls in Turkish carpet weaving |publisher=Turkishculture.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Türkmen carpet (also called "Bukhara Uzbekistan") is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in Central Asia. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export in the 2000s, mainly in Pakistan and Iran. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes who are the main ethnic group in [[Turkmenistan]] and are also found in Afghanistan and Iran. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf Living legend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212110046/http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf |date=December 12, 2013 }}, The president of Turkmenistan [[Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov]] book about Turkmen rug&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental carpets in Europe====
Oriental carpets began to appear in Europe after the [[Crusades]] in the 11th century, due to contact by Crusaders with Eastern traders. Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of the 17th and 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Maurice Sven and Jean Mailey.

Although isolated instances of carpet production pre-date the Muslim invasion of Spain, the [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples are the earliest significant body of European-made carpets. Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called [[Synagogue carpet]] in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, [[Admiral carpet]]s (also known as [[armorial carpet]]s), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by [[May Beattie]]. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Two of the most popular motifs are wreaths and pomegranates.

During the [[Moorish]] (Muslim) period production took place in [[Alcaraz]] in the province of Murcia, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the [[Royal Tapestry Factory]] ''(Real Fábrica de Tapices de Santa Bárbara)'' in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the [[Spanish civil war]] [[General Franco]] revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"&gt;Sherrill, Sarah B.

{{main article |Pirot carpet}}
'''Pirot carpet'''{{Cref2|a}} ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Пиротски ћилим, Pirotski ćilim) refers to a variety of flat tapestry-woven carpets or rugs traditionally produced in [[Pirot]], a town in southeastern Serbia. Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;LEPOTA TRAJANJA&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the šajkaši boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as Şarköy in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.

In the beginning of the 19th century plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. "The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and woof as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as Şarköy stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as Şarköy-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today's Turkish settlement of Şarköy in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, Şarköys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug selling industry, Şarköy are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non familiar customers as they prefer rug with putative oriental origin. In fact, Şarköys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokow. Later they have been also produced in Knjaževac and Caribrod.

{{main article |Chiprovtsi carpet}}
The [[Chiprovtsi carpet]] (Чипровци килим) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against Ottoman rule. The western traveller [[Ami Boué]], who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836–1838, reported that "mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving. They earn only five [[franc]]s a month and the payment was even lower before". By 1868, the annual production of carpets in Chiprovtsi had surpassed 14,000&amp;nbsp;square metres.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, almost 1,400 women from Chiprovtsi and the region were engaged in carpet weaving. In 1920, the locals founded the ''Manual Labour'' carpet-weaving cooperative society, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At present. the carpet (''kilim'') industry remains dominant in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_Ikonomika_Ekologia_Turizam/Material/2505-5.htm|title=Чипровските килими—запазена марка на килимарския бизнес в България|last=Димитрова|first=Милка|date=2005-05-25|publisher=[[Bulgarian National Radio|БНР]] [[Radio Bulgaria|Радио България]]|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-09-19}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, but in recent years it is up to the customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single {{convert|3|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the primary material is wool, coloured using plant or mineral [[dye]]s. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and [[Brussels]]. In recent decades, however, the Chiprovtsi carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.

[[File:Savonnerie tapisserie 18th century Versailles.jpg|thumb|An 18th century [[Savonnerie]] tapisserie at the [[Palace of Versailles]]]]
{{Main article|Savonnerie manufactory}}
In 1608 [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] initiated the French production of "Turkish style" carpets under the direction of [[Pierre DuPont (carpet maker)|Pierre DuPont]]. This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of [[Simon Lourdet]], are the carpets that were produced in the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon in the [[Palais du Louvre]] between c. 1665-1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of [[Charles Le Brun]], were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1688. Their design combines rich [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]'s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV's royal power.

[[Pierre-Josse Perrot]] is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags. The Savonnerie manufactory was moved to the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] in Paris in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;(french) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bN_HkKC1xNUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=savonnerie+manufacture+gobelins+1826&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=5frOTtrDD4f3sgbnm6XCDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=savonnerie%20manufacture%20gobelins%201826&amp;f=false Jean Coural, ''Les Gobelins'', Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1989, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; The Beauvais manufactory, better known for their [[tapestry]], also made knotted pile carpets from 1780 to 1792. Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"/&gt;

===England===
Knotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Calvinist]]s fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern [[England]] in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as "Norwich carpets." These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756–1761, owned by [[Claude Passavant]], 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by [[Thomas Whitty]], numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer [[Robert Adam]] supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor [[mosaics]] and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for [[Syon House]], [[Osterley House]], [[Harewood House]], [[Saltram House]], and [[Newby Hall]].

{{visible anchor|Axminster carpet}} was a unique floor covering made originally in a [[Axminster Carpets|factory]] founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver [[Thomas Whitty]]. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46332/Axminster-carpet |title=Axminster carpet - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axminster carpet has three main types of broadloom carpet construction in use today (machine woven, tufted &amp; hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.

[[File:Rug.jpg|thumb|Machine used to cut and re-roll carpet lengths]]
Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.

Six of Axminster carpets are known as the "Lansdowne" group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population town still seek employment in this industry. The town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire]] is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior Decoration: A Complete Source|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&amp;dq=lansdowne+group+axminster+carpets&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|work=Google book|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brussels Loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.

Later when bladed wires were developed the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.

Brussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.

After the first World War the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Carpets'' by George Robinson F.T.I., F.S.D.C. published 1966 Chap 7 Wilton Carpets page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern carpeting and installation==
[[File:Berber Carpet (macro).jpg|thumb|[[Macro photography|Macro]] shot of a [[Berber carpet|Berber-style carpet]]. Berber-style carpets feature two sizes of tufts of varying colors in a loop pile construction]]
Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s, thus distinguishing it from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.

In the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of {{convert|27|in|m}} and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.
Carpet tiles are also available, typically {{convert|50|cm|in}} square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement in order to spread wear.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Alan J. The Complete Carpet Buying Guide. Portland Oregon: AJ Books 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Carpet binding" is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.

==In culture and figurative expressions==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|A mythical [[magic carpet]]]]
There are many stories about [[magic carpet]]s, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney's Aladdin depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie's lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on him to go on a ride around the world. The term "[m]agic carpet [is] first attested [in] 1816.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; From the 16th century to the 19th century, the term "carpet" was used "...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)", which meant a man who was associated with "...luxury, ladies' boudoirs, and drawing rooms".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; ''Rolling out the red carpet'' is an expression which means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual [[red carpet]] is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.

In 1820s British servant slang, to "carpet" someone means to call them for a reprimand.&lt;ref name="etymonline1" /&gt; To be ''called on the carpet'' means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet. Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger variant of this expression, to be "hauled on the carpet", implies an even sterner reprimand. [[Carpet bombing]] is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression "laugh at the carpet" means to [[vomit]] on the floor (especially a carpeted floor).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/carpet Carpet - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "on the carpet" refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The term "carpet muncher" is a derogatory slang term for a [[lesbian]]; this expression is first attested in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher Carpet muncher | Define Carpet muncher at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[carpet bag]], which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the [[American Civil War]] to refer to [[carpetbaggers]], Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a [[mutual organization]], such as a [[building society]], in order to force it to [[Demutualization|demutualize]], that is, to convert into a [[joint stock company]], solely for personal financial gain.

''Cutting the rug'' is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The use of the term "rug" as an informal term for a "[[toupee]]" (man's [[wig]]) is [[theater]] slang from 1940.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The term "sweep [something] under the rug" or "sweep [something] under the carpet" figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The figurative expression "pull the rug out from under (someone)", meaning to "suddenly deprive of important support" is first attested to in 1936, in American English. A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was "cut the grass under (one's) feet", which is attested to in the 1580s.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; A "rugrat" or "rug-rat" is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The expression "snug as a bug in a rug" means

   [[Image:TyTunnelling.png|thumb|right|Schematic representation (similar to [[band diagram]]) of an electron tunnelling through a barrier]]In [[mesoscopic physics]], a '''Coulomb blockade''' ('''CB'''), named after [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]]'s [[Coulomb's law|electrical force]], is the decrease in [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductance]] at small [[voltage bias|bias voltage]]s of a small electronic device comprising at least one low-[[capacitance]] [[tunnel junction]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Averin|first=D.

Coulomb blockade can be observed by making a device very small, like a [[quantum dot]]. When the device is small enough, [[electron]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s inside the device will create a strong [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]] preventing other electrons to flow. Thus, the device will no longer follow [[Ohm's law]] and the current-voltage relation of the Coulomb blockade looks like a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=nanoHUB.org - Resources: Coulomb Blockade Simulation|url=https://nanohub.org/resources/2925?rev=20|doi=10.4231/d3c24qp1w|year=2006|last1=Wang|first1=Xufeng|last2=Muralidharan|first2=Bhaskaran|last3=Klimeck|first3=Gerhard|publisher=nanoHUB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when Coulomb blockade can be used to demonstrate the [[Elementary charge|quantization of the electric charge]], it remains a [[Classical mechanics|classical]] effect and its main description does not require [[quantum mechanics]]. However, when few electrons are involved and an external static [[magnetic field]] is applied, Coulomb blockade provides the ground for a [[spin blockade]] (like Pauli spin blockade) and [[Valleytronics|valley blockade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Prati E|year=2011|title=Valley blockade quantum switching in Silicon nanostructures|journal=J Nanosc Nanotech|volume=11|issue=10|pages=8522–8526|arxiv=1203.5368|doi=10.1166/jnn.2011.4957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crippa A|display-authors=etal|year=2015|title=Valley blockade and multielectron spin-valley Kondo effect in silicon|journal=Physical Review B|volume=92|issue=3|pages=035424|arxiv=1501.02665|bibcode=2015PhRvB..92c5424C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.035424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which include quantum mechanical effects due to [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and [[Angular momentum coupling|orbital interactions]] respectively between the electrons.

The devices can be composed of either metallic or [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] [[Electrode|electrodes]]. If the electrodes are superconducting, [[Cooper pair]]s (with a [[charge (physics)|charge]] of minus two [[elementary charge]]s  &lt;math&gt;-2e&lt;/math&gt;) carry the current. In the case that the electrodes are metallic or ''normal-conducting'', i.e. neither [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] nor [[Semiconductor|semiconducting]], [[electron]]s (with a charge of &lt;math&gt;-e&lt;/math&gt;) carry the current.

==In a tunnel junction==
The following section is for the case of tunnel junctions with an insulating barrier between two normal conducting electrodes (NIN junctions).

The [[tunnel junction]] is, in its simplest form, a thin insulating barrier between two conducting electrodes. According to the laws of [[classical electrodynamics]], no current can flow through an insulating barrier. According to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], however, there is a nonvanishing (larger than zero) [[probability]] for an electron on one side of the barrier to reach the other side (see [[quantum tunnelling]]). When a [[bias voltage]] is applied, this means that there will be a current, and, neglecting additional effects, the tunnelling current will be proportional to the bias voltage. In electrical terms, the tunnel junction behaves as a [[resistor]] with a constant resistance, also known as an [[Ohm's law|ohmic resistor]]. The resistance depends [[exponential function|exponentially]] on the barrier thickness. Typically, the barrier thickness is on the order of one to several [[nanometer]]s.

An arrangement of two conductors with an insulating layer in between not only has a resistance, but also a finite [[capacitance]]. The insulator is also called [[dielectric]] in this context, the tunnel junction behaves as a [[capacitor]].

Due to the discreteness of electrical charge, current through a tunnel junction is a series of events in which exactly one electron passes (''tunnels'') through the tunnel barrier (we neglect cotunneling, in which two electrons tunnel simultaneously). The tunnel junction capacitor is charged with one elementary charge by the tunnelling electron, causing a [[voltage]] build up &lt;math&gt;U=e/C&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the capacitance of the junction. If the capacitance is very small, the voltage build up can be large enough to prevent another electron from tunnelling. The electric current is then suppressed at low bias voltages and the resistance of the device is no longer constant. The increase of the [[Electrical resistance#Differential resistance|differential resistance]] around zero bias is called the Coulomb blockade.

==Observation ==

In order for the Coulomb blockade to be observable, the temperature has to be low enough so that the characteristic charging energy (the energy that is required to charge the junction with one elementary charge) is larger than the thermal energy of the charge carriers. In the past, for capacitances above 1&amp;nbsp;[[femtofarad]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[farad]]), this implied that the temperature has to be below about 1&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]. This temperature range is routinely reached for example by 3He refrigerators. Thanks to small sized quantum dots of only few nanometers, Coulomb blockade has been observed next above liquid helium temperature, up to room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.84.125301|title=Charge control in InP/(Ga,In)P single quantum dots embedded in Schottky diodes|year=2011|last1=Couto|first1=ODD|last2=Puebla|first2=J|journal=Physical Review B|volume=84|issue=12|pages=125301|arxiv = 1107.2522 |bibcode = 2011PhRvB..84l5301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = S.

To make a tunnel junction in [[Capacitor#Parallel-plate model|plate condenser]] geometry with a capacitance of 1&amp;nbsp;femtofarad, using an oxide layer of electric [[permittivity]] 10 and thickness  one [[nanometer]], one has to create electrodes with dimensions of approximately 100 by 100 nanometers. This range of dimensions is routinely reached for example by [[electron beam lithography]] and appropriate [[pattern transfer]] technologies, like the [[Niemeyer-Dolan technique]], also known as [[Niemeyer-Dolan technique|shadow evaporation technique]]. The integration of quantum dot fabrication with standard industrial technology has been achieved for silicon.

== Single-electron transistor ==
{{Main|Single-electron transistor}}[[File:Set schematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of a single-electron transistor.]]
[[File:Single electron transistor.svg|thumb|right|Left to right: energy levels of source, island and drain in a single-electron transistor for the blocking state (upper part) and transmitting state (lower part).]]
[[File:TySETimage.png|thumb|right|Single-electron transistor with [[niobium]] leads and [[aluminium]] island.]]

The simplest device in which the effect of Coulomb blockade can be observed is the so-called [[single-electron transistor]]. It consists of two electrodes known as the ''drain'' and the ''source'', connected through tunnel junctions to one common electrode with a low [[Capacitance#Self-capacitance|self-capacitance]], known as the ''island''. The electrical potential of the island can be tuned by a third electrode, known as the ''gate'', which is capacitively coupled to the island. &lt;!--The current-voltage characteristics are modulated between maximum and minimum Coulomb blockade, with a periodicity of one elementary charge in the charge induced on the island.--&gt;

In the blocking state no accessible energy levels are within tunneling range of an electron (in red){{clarify|reason=Refers to the red dot in the second figure, not the drain.|date=October 2016}} on the source contact. All energy levels on the island electrode with lower energies are occupied.

When a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode the energy levels of the island electrode are lowered. The electron (green 1.) can tunnel onto the island (2.), occupying a previously vacant energy level. From there it can tunnel onto the drain electrode (3.) where it inelastically scatters and reaches the drain electrode Fermi level (4.).

The energy levels of the island electrode are evenly spaced with a separation of &lt;math&gt;\Delta E.&lt;/math&gt; This gives rise to a self-capacitance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of the island, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{e^2}{\Delta E}.&lt;/math&gt;
To achieve the Coulomb blockade, three criteria have to be met:
# The bias voltage must be lower than the [[elementary charge]] divided by the self-capacitance of the island: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{bias} &lt; \frac{e}{C}&lt;/math&gt; ;
# The thermal energy in the source contact plus the thermal energy in the island, i.e. &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T,&lt;/math&gt; must be below the charging energy: &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T &lt; \frac{e^2}{2C},&lt;/math&gt; or else the electron will be able to pass the QD via thermal excitation; and
# The tunneling resistance, &lt;math&gt;R_{\rm t},&lt;/math&gt; should be greater than &lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{e^2},&lt;/math&gt; which is derived from Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Wasshuber|first=Christoph|title=About Single-Electron Devices and Circuits|date=1997|degree=|publisher=Vienna University of Technology|url=http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wasshuber/node20.html|doi=|type=Ph.D.|chapter=2.5 Minimum Tunnel Resistance for Single Electron Charging|year=1997|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coulomb blockade thermometer==

A typical Coulomb blockade thermometer (CBT) is made from an array of metallic islands, connected to each other through a thin insulating layer. A tunnel junction forms between the islands, and as voltage is applied, electrons may tunnel across this junction. The tunneling rates and hence the conductance vary according to the charging energy of the islands as well as the thermal energy of the system.

Coulomb blockade thermometer is a primary [[thermometer]] based on electric conductance characteristics of tunnel junction arrays. The parameter V&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt;=5.439Nk&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T/e, the full width at half
minimum of the measured differential conductance dip over an array of N junctions together with the [[physical constants]] provide the absolute temperature.

In the case of ICB, Coulomb gap &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is defined by dielectric self-energy of incoming ion inside the pore/channel &lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta E=\frac {z^2e^2}{2C}&lt;/math&gt;and hence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; depends on ion valence ''z''. ICB appears strong &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(\Delta E\gg k_{\rm B}T)&lt;/math&gt;, even at the room temperature, for ions with &lt;math&gt;z&gt;=2&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. for &lt;chem&gt;Ca^2+&lt;/chem&gt; ions.

ICB has been recently experimentally observed in sub-nanometer &lt;chem&gt;MoS2&lt;/chem&gt; pores.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Jiandong|last2=Liu|first2=Ke|last3=Graf|first3=Michael|last4=Dumcenco|first4=Dumitru|last5=Kis|first5=Andras|last6=Di Ventra|first6=Massimiliano|last7=Radenovic|first7=Aleksandra|date=2016|title=Observation of ionic Coulomb blockade in nanopores|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4607|journal=Nature Materials|language=En|volume=15|issue=8|pages=850–855|bibcode=2016NatMa..15..850F|doi=10.1038/nmat4607|pmid=27019385|issn=1476-4660|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical structure of demeton is closely related to military [[nerve agent]]s such as [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], and a derivative with one of the ethoxy groups replaced by methyl was investigated by both the US and Soviet chemical weapons programs under the names "[[V-sub x|V.sub.X]]" and "GD-7".&lt;ref&gt;Ledgard J.

[[File:LondonScienceMuseumsReplicaDifferenceEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Difference Engine]] in the [[Science Museum (London)]], built on a project led by Doron Swade.]]

'''Doron Swade''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] is a museum curator and author, specialising in the [[history of computing]]. He is especially known for his work on the computer pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] and his [[Difference Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/3382/Doron-Swade/ Doron Swade], [http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/ Computing History], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swade was originally from [[South Africa]]. He has studied [[electronics engineering]], [[history]], [[machine intelligence]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[physics]] at a number of universities including the [[University of Cape Town]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University College London]] (UCL).&lt;ref name="computerhistory" /&gt; He holds a BSc in physics and electronics engineering, an MSc in [[control engineering]], and a PhD in the history of computing from UCL.

He has been a curator at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]], England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I034/10303578.aspx Doron Swade and the Phillip's Economic Computer, 1990s], Science Museum, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doron Swade, 'Two Cultures: Computer Art and the Science Museum', chapter 16, pages 203–218.

'''[[Fail-safe]]s in [[nanotechnology]]''' are devices or features integrated with nanotechnology which, in the event of [[failure]], respond in a way that will cause no harm, or at least a minimum of harm, to other devices or personnel. Fail-safe principles are governed by national standards and engineering practices, and are widely used in conventional engineering design. It is possible to scale down macro-scale fail-safe principles and devices for similar applications at the nano-scale.&lt;ref&gt;Whitesides, George M. and J Christopher Love. “The Art of Building Small.”  Scientific American Reports Sep. 2007: 13-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of fail-safes in nanotechnology applications supports social acceptance of those applications by reducing the risks to users; {{As of|2009|alt=as of 2009}}, there are both theoretical and practical ways to implement [[fail-safe]] designs in nanotechnology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A predominant challenge to the social acceptance of nanotechnology is concerned with the [[Nanomedicine|medical use of nanostructures]] in the human body. While any structure for medical use would be developed to be bio-compatible and harmless, sound engineering design must take into account all possibilities of failure. Thus, the design would include ways to manipulate the structures in the body in the event of failure.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Nanotechnology5.jpg|frame|right|"Nanotechnology" - Artist's impression of a "nanobot" on a red blood cell.]] --&gt;

==Ferrous nanoparticles==
Many researchers are looking into creating nano-scale robots (“[[nanobots]]”), for the purpose of undertaking tasks where only robots on the nano scale can be used, such as inside the human body. These robots would have the ability to construct other nanostructures or perform medical procedures, and will be introduced into the body via an injection.&lt;ref&gt;Šafařík, Ivo, and Mirka Šafaříková. “Magnetic Nanoparticles and Biosciences.” Chemical Monthly 133.6 (2002): 737-759.&lt;/ref&gt; The robots’ shells and circuits would be made of [[ferrous]] nanoparticles so that a [[magnetic field]] could be used to prevent or manipulate their movement. In case of failure or malfunction, a small [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] or an [[MRI]] could be used to deactivate the nanobots. Both techniques induce an electromagnetic field, corrupting the [[Computer memory|memory]] and [[Short circuit|shorting out]] the circuitry of any electronic device within range.

==Amino acids==
Researchers are pursuing the building of nanostructures using [[amino acids]]. Nanostructures that are created using amino acids are constructed using only synthetic types of amino acids, which tags these structures with unique molecules. These engineered amino acids essentially form synthetic proteins that differ from the naturally occurring proteins in the human body. This difference in the engineered amino acids makes these proteins easy to isolate and target.&lt;ref&gt;Schafmeister, Christian E. “Molecular Lego.” Scientific American Reports Sep 2007: 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In case of failure or malfunction, it is possible to identify these proteins using the specifically targeted molecules, which act as a flag to indicate the location of the target. Then, another mechanism would be used to isolate them and deactivate them.

==DNA==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:NanomechanicalBZdevice5.jpg|frame|Nanomechanical B-Z Device|right]] --&gt;
[[DNA]] within our bodies naturally breaks down, replicates itself, and rebuilds itself every time a cell divides. These processes are all controlled and completed by various [[enzymes]]. DNA molecules are composed of corresponding base pair [[nucleotides]] in a double-helix formation, which makes these processes very efficient, accurate, and predictable. Due to the ease with which DNA molecules can be fashioned, many publications in the academic society are geared towards creating nanostructures using DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman, Nadrian C. “Nanotechnology and the Double Helix.” Scientific American Reports. Sep. 2007: 30-39.&lt;/ref&gt; With a DNA-based nano-device, synthetic proteins could be created, designed to deactivate a nano-device. These synthetic proteins would be injected into the body to break down the DNA and render a nano-device harmless in the event of a malfunction.

Biological proteins within the human body serve three main functions: they are structural building blocks, enzymes, and facilitate [[cellular signaling]]. Synthetic proteins could be developed as a form of indicator and attached to a DNA-based nano-device.&lt;ref&gt;May, Mike. “Nanotechnology: Thinking Small.” Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 107, No. 9 (Sep., 1999), pp. A450-A451 Published by: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Stable URL: &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3434647&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicator would then be used for the purpose of monitoring nano-devices in the human body. If all DNA-based nano-devices were closely monitored in the human body, they could be controlled quickly in the event of a malfunction.

==Programming==
In nanotechnology, particularly in nanobots, the need for a sound programming architecture is very important due to a potentially higher risk of damage in the event of a malfunction. A two-layer approach can be used to control nano-devices: (1) by providing a preprogrammed fail-safe functionality in case of anticipated failures; and (2) a remote-controlled override for use in unforeseen situations.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ehud, and Beneson, Yaakov. “Bringing DNA Computers to Life.” Scientific American Reports Sep 2007: 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The “remote”-controlled nano-device would require a specialist in the room, to guide the nanobot throughout the procedure.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:NanotubeCircuitsChip5.jpg|frame|right|Nanotube Circuits Chip.]] --&gt;

==Cellular engineering==
Many researchers are developing methods that use [[bacteria]] to deliver drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Louise. “Bad Bacteria Key to Drug Delivery.” Wired. 28 Feb. 2003. CondéNet, Inc. 10 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/02/57547&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria can be “programmed” to perform a specific task, and can be directed to go to targeted locations in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Cao, Guozhong. Nanostructures &amp; Nanomaterials: Synthesis, Properties &amp; Applications. London, UK: Imperial College Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria may damage healthy organs or fail to deliver the medicine to the sick organ in the case of a malfunction. In such cases, a fail-safe mechanism is required to neutralize the bacteria and prevent damage. An antibiotic is generally suitable as the fail-safe agent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19425">A '''frequency synthesizer''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that generates a range of [[frequency|frequencies]] from a single reference frequency. Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as [[radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[television]]s, [[mobile telephones]], [[radiotelephone]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, [[CB radio]]s, [[cable converter box|cable television converter boxes]]  satellite receivers, and [[GPS]] systems. A frequency synthesizer may use the techniques of [[frequency multiplier|frequency multiplication]], [[frequency divider|frequency division]], [[direct digital synthesis]], [[Frequency mixer|frequency mixing]], and [[phase-locked loop]]s to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output are related to the stability and accuracy of its reference frequency input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by [[crystal oscillator|crystal]] [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]].

==Types==
Three types of synthesizer can be distinguished. The first and second type are routinely found as stand-alone architecture: '''direct analog synthesis''' (also called a '''mix-filter-divide''' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Popiel-Gorski|1975|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as found in the 1960s [[Frequency synthesizer#External links|HP 5100A]]) and the more modern '''[[direct digital synthesizer]]''' (DDS) ([[Lookup table|table-look-up]]). The third type are routinely used as communication system [[integrated circuit|IC]] building-blocks: '''indirect digital''' ([[PLL]]) '''synthesizers''' including integer-N and fractional-N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Egan|2000|pp=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digiphase synthesizer===
It is in some ways similar to a DDS, but it has architectural differences. One of its big advantages is to allow a much finer resolution than other types of synthesizers with a given reference frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Egan|2000|pp=372–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{original research section|reason=Confuses tuning of receiver LO and RF stage (receivers are still adjusted to different channels with variable capacitors); indirect synthesizers are often LC oscillators; there were crystal-controlled receivers (common in WW II); classic CB receiver used switched crystals (possibly partially populated); there were switched double-conversion crystal aircraft radios that tuned hundreds of channels; re "not very stable": there were stable VFO designs; "many orders of magnitude" is vague; for transmitters and receivers, the stability specs are not that demanding; microwave resonators used cavities.|date=February 2017}}

Prior to widespread use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a [[local oscillator]], which used a [[resonant circuit]] composed of an [[inductor]] and [[capacitor]], or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s.  However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable;  variations in temperature and aging of components caused [[frequency drift]], causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. [[Automatic frequency control|Automatic frequency control (AFC)]] solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.

[[crystal oscillator|Quartz crystal]] resonators are many orders of magnitude more stable than [[LC circuit]]s and when used to control the frequency of the [[local oscillator]]  offer adequate stability to keep a receiver in tune.  However the [[resonant frequency]] of a crystal is determined by its dimensions and cannot be varied to tune the receiver to different frequencies.  One solution is to employ many crystals, one for each frequency desired, and switch the correct one into the circuit.   This "brute force" technique is practical when only a handful of frequencies are required, but quickly becomes costly and impractical in many applications. For example, the [[FM radio]] band in many countries supports 100 individual channel frequencies from about 88 [[Megahertz|MHz]] to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz; the ability to tune in each channel would require 100 crystals.  Cable television can support even more frequencies or [[channel (communications)|channels]] over a much wider band. A large number of crystals increases cost and requires greater space.

The solution to this was the development of circuits which could generate multiple frequencies from a "reference frequency" produced by a crystal oscillator. This is called a frequency synthesizer. The new "synthesized" frequencies would have the frequency stability of the master crystal oscillator, since they were derived from it.   

Many techniques have been devised over the years for synthesizing frequencies.  Some approaches include [[phase locked loop]]s, double mix, triple mix, harmonic, double mix divide, and [[direct digital synthesis]] (DDS). The choice of approach depends on several factors, such as cost, complexity, frequency step size, switching rate, [[phase noise]], and spurious output.

Coherent techniques generate frequencies derived from a single, stable master oscillator. In most applications, a [[crystal oscillator]] is common, but other resonators and frequency sources can be used. Incoherent techniques derive frequencies from a set of several stable oscillators.&lt;ref name="Manassewitsch 1987 7"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Manassewitsch|1987|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of synthesizers in commercial applications use coherent techniques due to simplicity and low cost.

Synthesizers used in commercial radio receivers are largely based on [[phase-locked loop]]s or PLLs. Many types of frequency synthesizer are available as [[integrated circuit]]s, reducing cost and size. High end receivers and electronic test equipment use more sophisticated techniques, often in combination.

==System analysis and design==
A well-thought-out ''design procedure'' is considered to be the first significant step to a successful synthesizer project.&lt;ref name="Manassewitsch 1987 151"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Manassewitsch|1987|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[system design]] of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many "best" design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers.&lt;ref name="Manassewitsch 1987 151"/&gt; [[System analysis]] of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), frequency stability (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), [[switching time]] (compare [[settling time]] and [[rise time]]), and size, power consumption, and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Manassewitsch|1987|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craw1994-4"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Crawford|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James A. Crawford says that these are mutually contradictive requirements.&lt;ref name="Craw1994-4"/&gt;

Influential early books on frequency synthesis techniques include those by [[Floyd M. Gardner]] (his 1966 ''Phaselock techniques'')&lt;ref name=Gardner1966&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Venceslav F. Kroupa]] (his 1973 ''Frequency Synthesis'').&lt;ref name=Kp3&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kroupa|1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical techniques analogous to mechanical [[gear-ratio]] relationships can be employed in frequency synthesis when the frequency synthesis factor is a ratio of integers.&lt;ref name=Kp3/&gt; This method allows for effective planning of distribution and suppression of spectral spurs.

Variable-frequency synthesizers, including [[Direct digital synthesis|DDS]], are routinely designed using Modulo-N arithmetic to represent phase.

==Principle of PLL synthesizers==
:''See main article: [[Phase-locked loop]]''
A phase locked loop is a feedback control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an [[error signal]] that is proportional to the difference between their phases.&lt;ref&gt;Phase is the integral of frequency. Controlling the phase will also control the frequency.&lt;/ref&gt; The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a [[frequency divider]] back to the input of the system, producing a [[negative feedback]] loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is ''locked'' to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the '''reference''' and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a [[PLL]] based frequency synthesizer.

[[image:PLL frequency synthesizer 2.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Block diagram of a common type of PLL synthesizer. ]]

The key to the ability of a frequency synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually in the form of a [[digital counter]], with the output signal acting as a [[clock signal]]. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s, and because it is [[Digital data|digital]] in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a [[microprocessor]]. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.

===Example===

Suppose the reference signal is 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, and the divider can be preset to any value between 1 and 100. The error signal produced by the comparator will only be zero when the output of the divider is also 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100&amp;nbsp;kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for a count of 1, 200&amp;nbsp;kHz for a count of 2, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of the reference frequency can be obtained with the simplest integer N dividers. Fractional N dividers are readily available.&lt;ref name="DB"/&gt;

==Practical considerations==
[[File:Skymaster DT 500 - Sharp GCI 3AV0 - Philips TDA6651TT-91794.jpg|thumb|Philips TDA6651TT - 5 V mixer/oscillator and low noise PLL synthesizer for hybrid terrestrial tuner]]

In practice this type of frequency synthesizer cannot operate over a very wide range of frequencies, because the comparator will have a limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and may suffer from [[aliasing]] problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, it is hard to make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of [[varicap|varactor diode]]s. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band.

Many radio applications require frequencies that are higher than can be directly input to the digital counter. To overcome this, the entire counter could be constructed using high-speed logic such as [[Emitter coupled logic|ECL]], or more commonly, using a fast initial division stage called a ''prescaler'' which reduces the frequency to a manageable level. Since the prescaler is part of the overall division ratio, a fixed prescaler can cause problems designing a system with narrow channel spacings – typically encountered in radio applications. This can be overcome using a [[dual-modulus prescaler]].&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Banerjee|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further practical aspects concern the amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how much [[noise]] there is in the output. All of these are a function of the ''loop filter'' of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator is in the form of short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes [[frequency modulation]] of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with [[harmonic]]s. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer will concentrate on when building a synthesizer system.&lt;ref name="DB"/&gt;

== Use as a frequency modulator ==

Many PLL frequency synthesizers can also generate [[frequency modulation]] (FM). The modulating signal is added to the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the modulating signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with opposite polarity to the modulating signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner1966&lt;/ref&gt;

This scheme therefore cannot directly handle low frequency (or DC) modulating signals but this is not a problem in the many AC-coupled video and audio FM transmitters that use this method. Such signals may also be placed on a subcarrier above the cutoff frequency of the PLL loop filter.

'''Gittings Studios''' is a photographic studio founded in 1928 by '''Paul Gittings, Sr.'''. Gittings bought the [[Bachrach Studios]] in the southern region of the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]]. The Gittings laboratory was a pioneer of [[color]] dye transfer prints.  In the 1960s, the Gittings laboratories were the first to use machines from [[Kodak]] that would develop into the "one hour processing." Due to this progress, the Gittings laboratory lost its almost-monopoly hold on the color film processing industry.

Paul Linwood Gittings, Sr. was instrumental in organizing, funding and establishing the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Mr. Gittings also operated a studio within [[Neiman Marcus]].

In his autobiography entitled ''Color Portraiture,'' he writes, "The photographer doesn't sell photographs; he sells sentiment and flattery. From the day that he [the photographer] understands the philosophy of the product he sells and bends his efforts to that end alone, he will prosper."
and
"Finally, if I could choose those words of wisdom which have served me best, during a long photographic lifetime, I would mention first: 'The only difference between the difficult and the impossible is that the impossible takes more time.' Sometimes the hundredth attempt is the one that brings success."
The company has trained and inspired generations of portrait photographers.
The organization was sold in 1987 to Paul Skipworth, then again in 1998 to Greg Lorfing. Under Lorfing's direction, Gittings has worked in 15 countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, gaining worldwide recognition as a leading studio for legal portraiture.

[[File:Wiki-Projekt Private Fahrzeugsammlung Braunschweig NIK 1865.JPG|thumb|A grease nipple on the driver's door of a 1956 VW Beetle]]
A '''grease fitting''', '''grease nipple''', '''Zerk fitting''', or '''Alemite fitting''' is a metal fitting used in mechanical systems to feed [[lubricant]]s, usually [[grease (lubricant)|lubricating grease]], into a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] under moderate to high [[pressure]] using a [[grease gun (tool)|grease gun]]. 

==Design==

Grease fittings are permanently installed by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive [[bearing ball]] in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a [[valve]] that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a [[check valve]] to prevent grease escaping back out of the fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting so that it can be wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing. 

The common convex shape of the fitting allows the concave tip of the grease gun to seal against the fitting easily from many angles, yet with a sufficiently tight seal to force the pressured grease to move the ball and enter the fitting, rather than simply oozing past this temporary annular (ring-shaped) seal.  

A less common design has a few names including 'button head', 'threepenny bit', 'flat' and 'tat head'. These are a larger nipple head with a flat sealing surface which overhangs the body of the nipple allowing the grease gun end to be hooked onto the nipple with a sliding action which wipes the nipple surface as it's attached. The grease gun hose is usually at a sharp angle (e.g. 70-90°) to the axis of the nipple but can be approached from any azimuthal angle. It is not possible for grease pressure to force this type of connector away from the nipple.

Grease fittings are commonly made from [[zinc]]-[[plated]] [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], or [[brass]].

==History==

[[File:Alemite advert in Saturday Evening Post 1921.png|thumb|Alemite Lubricator Company advertisement in the ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'', 1921. At the time of this advertisement, the fittings were of the flat-top type, but Zerk fittings would soon appear.]]

The patent for the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the assignee was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation&lt;ref name="US_Patent_1697217"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=6rpaAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1697217 Lubricant fitting. US Patent 1697217]&lt;/ref&gt; (thus the eponymous names for the fittings). Alemite was already marketing ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] installations and for [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups. But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings. 

Before Zerk fittings existed, bearings were lubricated in various other ways that tended to be more maintenance-intensive and often provided less effective lubrication. For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a [[plain bearing]] with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. Grease guns to feed the grease with higher pressure existed,&lt;ref name="US_Patent_1697217"/&gt; but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today. 

The oil hole or grease hole was usually covered with a cap of some kind to keep dirt out, from a simple plug or screw to a spring-loaded hinged cap. Sometimes a cup was mounted, acting as a small reservoir. The standard mode of maintenance was to have each machine's operator, or a dedicated [[oiler (occupation)|oiler]], go around adding a small squirt of oil or blob of grease to each and every hole on a frequent basis. 

Typical frequencies for oiling were one oil squirt (to every bearing) for each day of use, or in some cases each week. Grease is essentially oil held in a viscous gel or cream whose viscosity is used to hold the oil over time in places where oil alone cannot be supplied constantly enough, and would quickly drip away without the viscous suspension. This trait makes it better for bearings that cannot practically receive new oil on a near-constant basis. Thus a typical frequency for greasing might be monthly, yearly, or every several years. 

If the lubrication schedule was faithfully and conscientiously adhered to, the lubrication quality could be very good. Large marine engines and stationary engines to power whole factories were likeliest to get such top-quality care. But locomotives, rail cars, agricultural implements, and automobiles were less certain of good care, and lubrication quality without constant lubing tended to be intermittent, from mediocre to bad. Attempts to improve on the simple oil hole concept included putting a small reservoir of oil above the hole, which slowly dripped oil into it. An example is the Lunkenheimer oiler in the nearby image. Such oilers often incorporated one or more of the following features: 
* A wick (to hold the oil and allow it to be drawn down slowly by capillary action, just as an oil-lamp wick or [[candle wick]] fed oil or melted wax to its flame
* A fine mesh screen to act as a filter to keep dirt from getting down the hole
* A glass cup rather than a metal one, which allowed an operator or oiler to see at a glance how low the oil level was

[[Image:Engine oiler.jpg|thumb|right|A typical engine oiler&lt;BR&gt;This is one made by Lunkenheimer]] 

For greased bearings, the low pressures of lubrication before the grease fitting could often result in a failure of the grease to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing. The grease fitting improved this penetration, yielding more effective lubrication.

==Use==

Since the 1920s, the ever-growing proliferation of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries has made the use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts).  As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting. 

Norton Commando motorcycles (1967-1975) had a 'grease' nipple fitted to the swing arm assembly but heavy gear box oil was stipulated by the factory. The subsequent confusion by owners often resulted in grease being used (causing rapid wear of the pivot bushes).

[[Roller coaster]] amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century [[Russia]]. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The world's oldest roller coasters descended from the "[[Russian Mountains]]," which were specially constructed hills of snow &lt;ref&gt;Coker, Robert (2002). ''Roller Coasters: A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines'', Metrobooks, New York. {{ISBN|1586631721}}. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; located in the gardens of  palaces around the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], in the 18th century. This attraction  was called a ''Katalnaya Gorka'' or "sliding mountain" in Russian.  The slides were built to a height of between {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}, had  a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.  Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of sleds.  These slides became popular with the Russian upper class, and with  [[Catherine II of Russia]] herself, who had such mountains built in the gardens of the [[Oranienbaum Palace]] near St. Petersburg, with a pavilion next to it for drinking tea after the sliding.  "Russian mountains" remains the term for roller coasters in many languages, such as Spanish (''[[:es:Montaña rusa|la montaña rusa]]''), Italian (''[[:it:Montagne russe|montagne russe]]''), and French (''[[:fr:Montagnes russes|les montagnes russes]]''). Ironically, the Russian term for roller coaster, ''[[:ru:американские горки|американские горки]]'' (amerikanskie gorki), translates literally as "American mountains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/dict/new-enru/00/12/99.shtml  Rambler New English-Russian Dictionary: "American"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Promenades Aeriennes Jardin Baujon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Promenades-Aeriennes in Paris (1817).]]
Russian soldiers occupying Paris from 1815 through 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at Waterloo, may have introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Valérie RANSON-ENGUIALE, « Promenades aériennes », Histoire par l'image [en ligne], consulté le 28 Mai 2017. URL : http://www.histoire-image.org/etudes/promenades-aeriennes &lt;/ref&gt; In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the [[Champs Elysees]]. Its most famous feature was the ''Promenades Aériennes'' or "Aerial Strolls." &lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996). Robert Laffont, page 1051. &lt;/ref&gt; It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. &lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;David Bennett (1998). ''Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews''.  Edison, New Jersey: Chartwell Books. 9. {{ISBN|0-7865-0885-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-wheel carts were towed to the top of a tower,  and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side.  King [[Louis XVIII of France]] came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Before long there were seven similar rides in Paris: ''Les Montagnes françaises'' (The French Mountains), ''le Delta'', ''les Montagnes de Belleville'' (The Mountains of Belleville),  ''les Montagnes américaines'' (the American Mountains), ''Les Montages lilliputiennes'', (The miniature mountains), ''Les Montagnes susses'' (The Swiss mountains)  and ''Les Montagnes égyptiennes'' (The Egyptian mountains).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the beginning, these attractions were primarily for the upper classes. In 1845 a new amusement park opened in Copenhagen, [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]], which was designed for the middle class. These new parks featured roller coasters as permanent attractions. The first permanent loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846, with a single-person wheeled sled running through a 13-foot (4 m) diameter vertical loop. These early single loop designs were called Centrifugal Railways.  In 1887, a French entrepreneur, [[Joseph Oller]], the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]] music  hall,  built ''Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville'' (''The Russian Mountains of Belleville'')  a permanent  roller coaster with a length of two hundred meters in the form of a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Pisgah plane looking up.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mount Pisgah with the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]].]]

===Scenic railways===
In the 1850s, a mining company in [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], constructed the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway|Mauch Chunk]] [[gravity railroad]], a brakeman-controlled, 8.7-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]]), [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/start/america.shtml Roller Coaster History: Early Years In America]. Retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.
[[Image:Thompsons Switchback Railway 1884.jpg|thumb|150px|Thompson's [[Switchback Railway]], 1884.]] 

Using this idea as a basis, [[LaMarcus Adna Thompson]] began work on a gravity [[Switchback Railway]] that opened at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheedy |title= Icons&amp;nbsp;— In the Beginning...

Urbanowicz (2002). ''The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion''.  Kensington, New York: Citadel Press. 4. {{ISBN|0-8065-2309-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first complete-circuit coaster with a [[lift hill]], the ''Gravity Pleasure Road'', which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; Not to be outdone, in 1886 LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented his design for a roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery. "Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county,&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; with [[Frederick Ingersoll]]'s construction company building many of them in the first two decades of the 20th century.

===Growing popularity and innovations===
[[File:Coneyisland1906.jpg|thumb|[[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Loop the Loop]], an early looping roller coaster at Coney Island, 1906]]
As it grew in popularity, experimentation in coaster dynamics took off. In the 1880s the concept of a vertical loop was again explored by [[Lina Beecher]], and in 1895 the concept came into fruition with the ''[[Flip Flap Railway]]'', located at [[Sea Lion Park]] in Brooklyn, and shortly afterward with ''[[Loop the Loop (Olentangy Park)|Loop the Loop]]'' at [[Olentangy Park]] near [[Columbus, Ohio]] as well as similar coasters in [[Loop the Loop (Young's Million Dollar Pier)|Atlantic City]] and [[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Coney Island]]. The rides were incredibly dangerous, and many passengers suffered [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. Both were soon dismantled, and looping coasters had to wait for over a half century before making a reappearance.

By 1919, the first [[underfriction]] roller coaster had been developed by [[John Miller (entrepreneur)|John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01319888&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, ''[[Coney Island Cyclone|The Cyclone]]'', was opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1927. Like ''The Cyclone'', all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old [[wooden roller coaster]]s are still operational, at parks such as [[Kennywood]] near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], England. The oldest operating roller coaster is ''[[Leap-The-Dips]]'' at [[Lakemont Park]] in Pennsylvania, a [[side friction roller coaster]] built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the [[United Kingdom]] is the ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] Amusement Park in [[Margate]], [[Kent]] and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened to the public in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7335519.stm Retrieved on 8th April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Melbourne's Luna Park]] built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah.  The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/details.aspx?id=46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, as amusement parks generally went into a decline that resulted in less demand for new coasters. This lasted until 1972, when ''[[Racer (Kings Island)|The Racer]]'' opened at [[Kings Island]] amusement park located in what was then a part of [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. Designed by [[John C. Allen]], the instant success of ''The Racer'' helped to ignite a renaissance for roller coasters, reviving worldwide interest throughout the industry.

===The rise of steel===
[[Image:MatterhornBobsled2000 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]], the world's first tubular [[steel roller coaster]].]]
In 1959, the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park introduced a new design breakthrough in roller coasters with the ''[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]''. This was the first roller coaster to use a tubular [[Steel roller coaster|steel track]]. Unlike conventional wooden rails, which are generally formed using steel strips mounted on laminated wood, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, which allows designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden roller coasters are still being built along with hybrids of steel and wood.

In 1975 the first modern-day roller coaster to perform an inverting element opened: [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], located at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[California]]. In 1976 the vertical loop made a permanent comeback with the [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California.

'''IEC 60601''' is a series of [[technical standard]]s for the safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment, published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]. First published in 1977 and regularly updated and restructured, as of 2011 it consists of a general standard, about 10 collateral standards, and about 60 particular standards.

==General standard==
The general standard ''IEC 60601-1 - Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance'' - gives general requirements of the series of standards. 60601 is a widely accepted benchmark for medical electrical equipment and compliance with IEC60601-1 has become a requirement for the commercialisation of electrical medical equipment in many countries. {{Citation needed|reason=Previous citation is now broken - does not resolve URL.; The use of IEC 60601-1 in supporting approvals of medical electrical devices|date=September 2016}} Many companies view compliance with IEC 60601-1 as a requirement for most markets. This standard does not assure effectiveness of a medical device. In the US, evidence of effectiveness is required by the FDA and confirmed through either a Premarket Approval (PMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/howtomarketyourdevice/premarketsubmissions/premarketapprovalpma/|title=Premarket Approval (PMA)|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or similarity to a predicate device via a 510(k) Premarket Notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/howtomarketyourdevice/premarketsubmissions/premarketnotification510k/default.htm|title=Premarket Notification 510(k)|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National deviations of this series of standards exist which include country specific requirements;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mddionline.com/article/national-deviations-iec-60601-1 National Deviations to IEC 60601-1 by MDDI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eisnersafety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8th-article-final.pdf National Deviations to IEC60601-1 by Eisner Safety Consultants]&lt;/ref&gt; see e.g. [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] or [[Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation|AAMI]] for US specifics.&lt;ref&gt;http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/harm/drafts/medical/s60601-1_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aami.org/news/2010/081010.press.606011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The European EN and Canadian CSA versions of the standard are identical to the IEC standard.   

==Revisions==
In 2005, the third edition of IEC 60601-1 was published. It was the result of a comprehensive review of the second edition (dating from 1988). Some key changes are: the outline and the numbering scheme of the clauses and subclauses were changed, risk management was made much more relevant and the concept of essential performance was added. Currently (2012), the applicability of the second and third edition is somewhat overlapping&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisnersafety.com/fda-iec60601-1-3rd-ed/|title=Eisner Safety Consultants  » FDA Formally Recognize IEC 60601-1, 3rd ed.|website=www.eisnersafety.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mddionline.com/article/regulatory-strategies-third-edition-iec-60601-1 Regulatory Strategies for the Third Edition of IEC 60601-1] Retrieved 6 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the products under consideration and the country/area of application. IEC 60601-1-11 (2010) must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the IEC 60601 3rd edition series. IEC 60601-1 merged to medical device directive 93/42/EEC which covers all IEC standard of electromedical &amp; electrical safety so it is clear that EC cover all Previous IEC standard to medical device directive 93/42/EEC

The mandatory date for implementation of the EN European version of the standard is June 1, 2012. The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June 30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June 2012 to April 2013.  The North American agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/22261 IEC 60601-1-11:2015 redline version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collateral and particular standards==
Requirements of 60601-1 may be overridden or bypassed by specific language in the standards for a particular product.
Collateral standards (numbered 60601-1-X) define the requirements for certain aspects of safety and performance, e.g. Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEC 60601-1-2) or Protection for diagnostic use of X-rays (IEC 60601-1-3).
Particular standards (numbered 60601-2-X) define the requirements for specific products or specific measurements built into products, e.g. MR scanners (IEC 60601-2-33) or Electroencephalograms (IEC 60601-2-26).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

For example, ''IEC 60601-1-9'' for Environmentally Conscious Design of [[Medical equipment|Medical Electrical Equipment]] published July 2007 is a collateral [[standardization|standard]] to IEC 60601-1 and has been developed drawing on extensive practical experience at [[Philips Medical Systems]] and [[Siemens Medical Solutions]]. The Part 9 standard asks [[manufacturers]] of [[medical devices]] to consider the environmental impacts of their devices throughout the product's entire [[Product life cycle management|life cycle]] and to minimize these where possible. The standard also requires that the manufacturer provide information to the user on how to use the product in the most environmentally sensitive way.
The [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have not yet set transition dates for their national versions of this latest edition 60601-1, but the national versions published to date do contain the requirement to also conform with IEC 60601-1-9. However, the European version (EN 60601-1:2006) requires compliance with the new IEC 60601-1-9 collateral standard by September 2009.

According to the recent publication of the US national version of the collateral standard for products intended for home use, ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11, the application of the standard does not apply to the nursing home environment. In the United States, nursing facilities are considered to be environments providing professional healthcare. The American version of this collateral standard also places greater emphasis on a requirement that states that “inspection of the usability engineering file reinforce that the usability engineering process is necessary for validation of the instructions for use.”  Devices typically mandated to use the new standard include oxygen concentrators, body-worn nerve and muscle stimulators, beds, sleep apnea monitors, and associated battery chargers prescribed for use at home. Although In Vitro Diagnostic devices such as blood glucose meters are being used by patients at home, the standard does not apply, as these devices remain under the jurisdiction of the more lenient IEC 61010 series{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

==Critics==

The 60601 certification process has been criticized for its complexity, cost, and the business risk it raises. This has been more particularly a concern during the transition to the third edition due to the indefinite adoption schedule of the new revision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mddionline.com/blog/devicetalk/op-ed-60601-1-third-edition-not-mandatory Op Ed: The 60601-1 Third Edition Is Not Mandatory ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalelectronicsdesign.com/blog/medblog/how-scary-iec-60601-1 How Scary Is IEC 60601-1?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems''' ('''JAUS'''), formerly known as '''Joint Architecture for Unmanned Ground Systems''' ('''JAUGS'''), was originally an initiative started in 1998 by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to develop an [[open architecture]] for the domain of unmanned systems.

In order to ensure that the component architecture is applicable to the entire domain of current and future unmanned systems, it is built on five principles: vehicle platform independence, mission isolation, computer hardware independence, technology independence, and operator use independence.

The JAUS Reference Architecture, which is no longer being maintained, is a component based message passing architecture that defines a data format and methods of communication between computing nodes. The architecture dictates a hierarchical system built up of subsystems, nodes and components, and contains a strictly defined message set to support [[interoperability]]. Significant portions of the architecture, including the definitions for subsystem, node and component, have been loosely defined in order to accommodate for the five principles on which it is based.

The architecture has migrated from the JAUS Working Group, which was composed of individuals from the government, industry and academia, to the [[SAE_International|Society of Automotive Engineers]], Aerospace Division, Avionics Systems Division. The AS4, Unmanned Systems Technical Committee now maintains and advances the set of standards. The following standards have been migrated from the JAUS Reference Architecture to a services based framework:

;AS5669, JAUS Transport Standard.:Defines packet construction addressing transport concerns including header compression, source/destination addressing, TCP, UDP and Serial links.  AS5669 defines the format of a JAUS message as it flows between systems in an Ethernet (TCP and UDP) or serial data link.

;AS5710, JAUS Core Service Set.:Establishes a common set of services for distributed systems communication and coordination.  The Core Service Set includes service definitions for transport, events, access control, management, time, liveness and discovery.

;AS6009, JAUS Mobility Service Set.:This standard migrates the primitive driver, waypoint and path segment drivers, along with the position/orientation components and messaging to the SAE JAUS set of standards.
Others currently in draft include:

Another standard that evolved from the JAUS efforts is the “JAUS Service Interface Definition Language” or JSIDL.  JSIDL standardizes the language for defining JAUS compliant interfaces.  The specification is contained in the SAE document AS5684.

== Application ==

JAUS was officially used by the United States Department of Defense in its [[UGV Interoperability Profile|UGV Interoperability Profile (IOP)]]. The IOP specifies rules for the use of standard JAUS messages as well as custom extensions to the standard message set.

'''Katie Moussouris''' is an American [[computer security]] researcher who is best known for her ongoing work advocating responsible security research. She created the bug bounty program at [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/former_ms_bug_bounty_program_developer_forced_into_paris_laptop_decryption/|title=Ex-Microsoft Bug Bounty dev forced to decrypt laptop for Paris airport official|last=|last2=|access-date=2016-04-04|last4=|last5=|last6=|first6=|last7=|first7=|last8=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly the Chief Policy Officer at [[HackerOne]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] disclosure company based in San Francisco, California,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.securityweek.com/hackerone-secures-9-million-appoints-katie-moussouris-chief-policy-officer|title=HackerOne Secures $9 Million, Appoints Katie Moussouris Chief Policy Officer {{!}} SecurityWeek.Com|website=www.securityweek.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is the founder and CEO of Luta Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lutasecurity.com/|title=Luta Security|website=Luta Security, Inc|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussouris was directly involved in creating the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s first [[bug bounty program]] for [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/pentagon-launches-feds-first-bug-bounty-hackers/|title=Pentagon Launches the Feds' First 'Bug Bounty' for Hackers|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/hack-the-pentagon-dod-launches-first-ever-federal-bug-bounty-program/d/d-id/1324542|title=Hack The Pentagon: DoD Launches First-Ever Federal Bug Bounty Program|website=Dark Reading|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Career ==

===Symantec===
Moussouris joined Symantec in October 2004 when they acquired [[@stake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid|first1=Fahmida|title=Sisters in Security: Katie Moussouris' Leaps of Faith|url=http://uk.pcmag.com/opinion/34954/sisters-in-security-katie-moussouris-leaps-of-faith|website=PCMagazine|publisher=PCMagazine|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":JoinsMS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naraine|first1=Ryan|title=Symantec vulnerability research founder joins Microsoft|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/symantec-vulnerability-research-founder-joins-microsoft/|website=Zero Day|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded and managed Symantec Vulnerability Research.&lt;ref name=":SCMag" /&gt;

===Microsoft===
In May 2007, Moussouris left Symantec to join Microsoft as a security strategist.&lt;ref name=":JoinsMS" /&gt; She founded the Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR) program, announced at BlackHat 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Dan|title=BLACK HAT: Microsoft to work with third parties over vulns|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/black-hat-microsoft-to-work-with-third-parties-over-vulns/article/554805/|website=SC Media US|publisher=Haymarket Media, Inc.|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has coordinated the response to several significant vulnerabilities, including [[Dan Kaminsky]]'s [[Dan Kaminsky#Flaw in DNS|DNS flaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lemos|first1=Robert|title=Alliance forms to fix DNS poisoning flaw|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11526|website=SecurityFocus|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also actively looked for bugs in third-party software affecting Microsoft customers (subsequent examples of this include [[Project Zero (Google)|Google's Project Zero]]).

From September 2010 until May 2014, Moussouris was the Senior Security Strategist Lead at Microsoft, where she ran the Security Community Outreach and Strategy team for Microsoft as part of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/100-brains-microsofts-katie-moussouris-makes-security-accessible/|title=100 Brains: Microsoft's Katie Moussouris makes security accessible {{!}} ZDNet|last=Leggio|first=Jennifer|website=ZDNet|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She instigated the Microsoft BlueHat Prize for Advancement of Exploit Mitigations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DuPaul|first1=Neil|title=Microsoft BlueHat - 5 Questions with Katie Moussouris|url=https://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/08/microsoft-bluehat-5-questions-with-katie-moussouris|website=Veracode|publisher=Veracode|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which awarded over $260,000 in prizes to researchers at BlackHat USA 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith (pseudonym)|first1=Ms.|title=Microsoft BlueHat Prize Winners|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2222848/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-bluehat-prize-winners.html|website=CSO Online|publisher=IDG Communications, Inc.|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand prize of $200,000 was at the time the largest cash payout being offered by a software vendor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamath|first1=Maya|title=Here is list of world’s biggest ‘Bug Bounty’ payouts by tech companies|url=https://www.techworm.net/2015/08/here-is-list-of-worlds-biggest-bug-bounty-payouts-by-tech-companies.html|website=TechWorm|publisher=TechWorm.net|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also created Microsoft's first bug bounty program,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which paid over $253,000 and received 18 vulnerabilities over the course of her tenure.

===ISO vulnerability disclosure standard===

Moussouris has helped edit the ISO/IEC 29147 document since around 2008. In April 2016, ISO made the standard freely available at no charge after a request from Moussouris and the [[CERT Coordination Center]]'s Art Manion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saarinen|first1=Juha|title=ISO vulnerability disclosure standard now free|url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/iso-vulnerability-disclosure-standard-now-free-418253|website=iTnews|publisher=nextmedia Pty Ltd.|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HackerOne===
In May 2014, Moussouris was named the Chief Policy Officer at HackerOne, a vulnerability disclosure company based in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this role, Moussouris was responsible for the company's vulnerability disclosure philosophy, and worked to promote and legitimize security research among organizations, legislators and policy makers.

==="Hack the ..." series===

While still at Microsoft, Moussouris began discussing a [[bug bounty program]] with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]; she continued these talks when she moved to HackerOne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Bug Bounty Guru Katie Moussouris Will Help Hackers and Companies Play Nice|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/bug-bounty-guru-katie-moussouris-will-help-hackers-companies-play-nice/|website=WIRED|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Moussouris was directly involved in creating the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s "Hack the Pentagon" pilot program, organized and vetted by HackerOne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-04-01/pentagon-turns-to-hackers-to-modernize-military|title=To Modernize Military, Pentagon Turns to Hackers|last=Shinkman|first=Paul D.|date=April 1, 2016|website=US News &amp; World Report|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first bug bounty program in the history of the US federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=’Hack the Pentagon’ Pilot Program Opens for Registration|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/710033/hack-the-pentagon-pilot-program-opens-for-registration/|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=US Department of Defense News|agency=US Department of Defense|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussouris followed up the Pentagon program with "Hack the Air Force". HackerOne and Luta Security are partnering to deliver up to 20 bug bounty challenges over three years to the Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cyberscoop.com/u-s-launches-hack-air-force-bug-bounty-program/|title=U.S. launches 'Hack the Air Force' bug bounty program - Cyberscoop|last=O'Neill|first=Patrick Howell|date=2017-04-26|work=Cyberscoop|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14553">'''Knowledge-based configuration''', or also referred to as '''product configuration''' or '''product customization''', is an activity of [[Personalization|customising]] a product to meet the needs of a particular customer. The product in question may consist of mechanical parts, services, and software. Knowledge-based configuration is a major application area for [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and it is based on modelling of the configurations in a manner that allows the utilisation of AI techniques for searching for a valid configuration to meet the needs of a particular customer.&lt;ref group="A" name="Stum97"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Soin98"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Felf01"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Wang11"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="HMR2008"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="FS2006"/&gt;

==Background==
Knowledge-based configuration (of complex products and services) has a long history as an [[artificial intelligence]] application area, see, e.g.&lt;ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Stum97"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a1"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a3"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a4"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a5"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Mitt89"/&gt; Informally, configuration can be defined as a "special case of design activity, where the artifact being configured is assembled from instances of a fixed set of well-defined component types which can be composed conforming to a set of constraints".&lt;ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/&gt; Such constraints&lt;ref group="B" name="RBW2006"/&gt; are representing technical restrictions, restrictions related to economic aspects, and conditions related to production processes. The result of a configuration process is a product configuration (concrete configuration), i.e., a list of instances and in some cases also connections between these instances. Examples of such configurations are computers to be delivered or financial service portfolio offers (e.g., a combination of loan and corresponding risk insurance).

==Configuration systems==
'''Configuration systems'''&lt;ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Stum97"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/&gt; or also referred to as '''configurators''' or '''mass customization toolkits''',&lt;ref group="A" name="a11"/&gt; are one of the most successfully applied [[Artificial Intelligence]] technologies. Examples are the automotive industry,&lt;ref group="A" name="a4"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="HW2012"/&gt; the telecommunication industry,&lt;ref group="A" name="a2"/&gt; the computer industry,&lt;ref group="A" name="a1"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a9"/&gt; and power electric transformers.&lt;ref group="A" name="a3"/&gt; Starting with rule-based approaches such as R1/[[XCON]],&lt;ref group="A" name="a1"/&gt; model-based representations of knowledge (in contrast to rule-based representations) have been developed which strictly separate product domain knowledge from the problem solving one - examples thereof are the [[constraint satisfaction problem]], the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], and different [[answer set programming]] (ASP) representations. There are two commonly cited conceptualizations of configuration knowledge.&lt;ref group="A" name="Soin98"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Felf01"/&gt; The most important concepts in these are components, ports, resources and functions.  This separation of product domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge increased the effectiveness of configuration application development and maintenance,&lt;ref group="A" name="a2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a4"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a5"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a10"/&gt; since changes in the product domain knowledge do not affect search strategies and vice versa.

Configurators are also often considered as "[[open innovation]] toolkits", i.e., tools which support customers in the product identification phase.&lt;ref group="A" name="a12a1"/&gt; In this context customers are innovators who articulate their requirements leading to new innovative products.&lt;ref group="A" name="a12a1"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a14"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a26"/&gt;  "Mass Confusion" &lt;ref group="A" name="a15"/&gt; – the overwhelming of customers by a large number of possible solution alternatives (choices) – is a phenomenon which often comes with the application of configuration technologies. This phenomenon motivated the creation of personalized configuration environments taking into account a customer’s knowledge and preferences.&lt;ref group="A" name="a13"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a7"/&gt;

Core configuration, i.e., guiding the user and checking the consistency of user requirements with the knowledge base, solution presentation and translation of configuration results into [[bill of materials]] (BOM) are major tasks to be supported by a configurator.&lt;ref group="A" name="a12a"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="BMU2012"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="Wang11"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a11"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a16"/&gt; Configuration knowledge bases are often built using proprietary languages.&lt;ref group="A" name="a5"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a13"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="a12"/&gt;
In most cases knowledge bases are developed by knowledge engineers who elicit product, marketing and sales knowledge from domain experts. Configuration knowledge bases are composed of a formal description of the structure of the product and further constraints restricting the possible feature and component combinations.

==Software and service configuration==
Recently, knowledge based configuration has been extended to service and software configuration. Modeling software configuration has been based on two main approaches: feature modeling,&lt;ref group="A" name="a20"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="a21"/&gt; and component-connectors.&lt;ref group="A" name="a22"/&gt; Kumbang domain ontology combines the previous approaches building on the tradition of knowledge based configuration.&lt;ref group="A" name="a23"/&gt;

'''''Law &amp; Order''''' is an American [[police procedural]] and [[legal drama]] television series created by [[Dick Wolf]], launching the [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]]. Airing its entire run on [[NBC]], ''Law &amp; Order'' premiered on September 13, 1990 and completed its twentieth and final season on May 24, 2010.

Set and filmed in [[New York City]], the series follows a two-part approach: the first half-hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by [[New York City Police Department]] [[detective]]s; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney's Office]]. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.

The show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Among the longest-running main cast members were [[Steven Hill]] as District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law &amp; Order)|Adam Schiff]] (seasons 1–10), [[Jerry Orbach]] as Detective [[Lennie Briscoe]] (seasons 3–14), [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] as Lieutenant [[Anita Van Buren]] (seasons 4–20), [[Sam Waterston]] as Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Jack McCoy]] (seasons 5–20; later District Attorney) and [[Jesse L. Martin]] as Detective [[Ed Green]] (seasons 10–18).

''Law &amp; Order''{{'}}s twenty seasons ties with ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955–75) and spin-off ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present) for the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|longest-running live-action scripted American primetime series]]. The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making ''Law &amp; Order'' a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of [[Emmy Award]]s.

On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had canceled ''Law &amp; Order'' and would air its final episode on May 24, 2010.&lt;ref name="canceled"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/arts/television/15law.html|title=One 'Law &amp; Order' Gets a Death Sentence, as Another Joins the Force|author=Brian Stelter|author2=Bill Carter |authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes Cancel"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/nbc-cancels-law-order/|title=NBC Cancels 'Law &amp; Order'|author=Brian Stelter|author2=Bill Carter |authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.nbcumv.com/mv/#1274052289516 |title=NBC announces pickups for new drama 'LOLA' ('Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles') and returning 'Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit' and 'Law &amp; Order' ends its historic run on NBC May 24 |publisher=NBC Universal |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=May 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717005921/http://www.nbcumv.com/mv/ |archivedate=July 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately following the show's cancellation, Wolf attempted to find a new home for the series.&lt;ref name="nytimesnewhome"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=May 17, 2010 |title='Law &amp; Order' Creator Still Looking to Bring Original Back |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/law-order-creator-still-looking-to-bring-original-back/ |department=Media Decoder (blog) |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those attempts failed, and in July 2010, Wolf declared that the series had now "moved to the history books".&lt;ref name="showdead"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Law &amp; Order is dead, says Wolf |publisher=The Spy Report |date=July 31, 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/31/us-law-order-is-dead-says-wolf/ |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803195424/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/31/us-law-order-is-dead-says-wolf/ |archivedate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===History and development===
In 1988, [[Dick Wolf]] developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it ''Night &amp; Day'' but then hit upon the title ''Law &amp; Order''. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime.

The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, ''Law &amp; Order'' would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 17"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf took the idea to then-president of [[Universal Television]] [[Kerry McCluggage]], who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled ''[[Arrest and Trial]]'', which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer ([[Ben Gazzara]]) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by [[Chuck Connors]] gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week.

Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 17-18"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] ordered thirteen episodes based on the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head [[Barry Diller]] reversed the decision. Although he loved the idea, he didn't believe it was a "Fox show". Wolf then went to [[CBS]], which ordered a pilot, "[[Everybody's Favorite Bagman]]", written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars.

In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, [[Brandon Tartikoff]] and [[Warren Littlefield]], screened the pilot and liked it; but they were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated week after week.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 17-18" /&gt; However, by 1990, NBC executives had enough confidence that the innovative show could appeal to a wide audience that they ordered the series for a full season.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 21-22"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The series was shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of [[wikt:local color|local color]].&lt;ref name="APMercury"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainmentheadlines/ci_10868230 |title=Can "Law &amp; Order" outlive "Gunsmoke"? |last=Carlson |first=Erin |date=October 31, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |work=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923025125/http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainmentheadlines/ci_10868230 |archivedate=September 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TVGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/law-order/cast/100255|title=Law and Order: Cast and details|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later seasons, New York City mayors [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]], attorney [[William Kunstler]] and Bronx Congressman [[José Enrique Serrano|José Serrano]] all appeared on the show as themselves.

Local personalities also had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as [[Donna Hanover]] and [[Fran Lebowitz]] as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at [[Chelsea Piers]] (where the series was mostly shot) was renamed "Law &amp; Order Way" in tribute to the series.&lt;ref name="Street"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/091604_commissioner_oliver_presents.shtml |title=Commissioner Oliver Presents "Law &amp; Order Way" |publisher=NYC.gov |accessdate=September 14, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024054944/http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/091604_commissioner_oliver_presents.shtml |archivedate=October 24, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music for ''Law &amp; Order'' was composed by veteran composer [[Mike Post]], and was deliberately designed to be minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 69"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt; Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and [[clarinet]].&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly 1993-02-26"&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Schwarzbaum | title=The Jailhouse Rock | date=February 26, 1993 | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305720,00.html | work =Entertainment Weekly | accessdate =January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[scene (fiction)|scene]] changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as "The Clang", while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the "ominous ''chung CHUNG''",&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 69" /&gt; actor [[Dann Florek]] (in a promo) as the "doink doink",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ryan | first = Maureen | title = Thunk-thunk!

The tone moves the viewer from scene to scene, jumping forward in time with all the importance and immediacy of a judge's gavel – which is exactly what Post was aiming for when he created it. "The Clang" is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of nearly a dozen sounds, including an actual gavel, a jail door slamming, and five hundred Japanese monks walking across a hardwood floor.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 69" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowdbeacon.com/6-things-didnt-know-law-order/ 6 Things You Didn't Know About Law &amp; Order].

}}

For the 1988 pilot, [[George Dzundza]] and [[Chris Noth]] were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant [[Max Greevey]] and Detective [[Mike Logan (Law &amp; Order)|Mike Logan]].&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 25"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt; The producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 110-111"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Noth and [[Michael Madsen]] were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 25-26"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Rounding out the police cast, [[Dann Florek]] was cast as Captain [[Donald Cragen]].&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 25" /&gt;

On the prosecutor's side, [[Michael Moriarty]] was Dick Wolf's choice to play Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Benjamin Stone (Law &amp; Order character)|Benjamin "Ben" Stone]]. The network, however, preferred [[James Naughton]], but, in the end, Wolf's choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 25" /&gt; As his ADA, [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] and [[Eriq La Salle]] were being considered for the role of [[Paul Robinette]]. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers' choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 26"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt; As their boss, [[Roy Thinnes]] was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 25" /&gt;

Nearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in ''[[Dark Shadows (1991 TV series)|Dark Shadows]]'' and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped [[Steven Hill]] to play District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law &amp; Order)|Adam Schiff]],&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 26" /&gt; a character loosely based on real-life [[New York County District Attorney]] [[Robert Morgenthau]]. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 131-132"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzundza was disappointed when he realized that the show would be more of an ensemble show rather than a show starring him. Though the cast liked his performance, they increasingly felt uncomfortable around Dzundza, who was also under stress due to the constant commute between New York City and his home in Los Angeles. Dzundza quit after only one season on the show, and Sergeant Greevey was written off as being killed in the line of duty.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 111"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;111&lt;/ref&gt;

He was replaced by [[Paul Sorvino]] as Sergeant [[Phil Cerreta]], who was considered more even tempered than either Max Greevey or Mike Logan. Sorvino was initially excited about the role, but would leave midway through the next season, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by the filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing opera as reasons for leaving the show. Sergeant Cerreta was written off as having been shot in the line of duty and transferring to a desk job at another precinct.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 123-125"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;123–125&lt;/ref&gt;

To replace Sorvino on the series, Wolf cast [[Jerry Orbach]] (who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 2 episode "The Wages of Love") in the role of Detective [[Lennie Briscoe|Leonard W. "Lennie" Briscoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;120–122&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach's characterization of the world-weary, wisecracking Detective Briscoe was based on a similar NYPD character he portrayed in the 1981 film ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince Of The City]],'' which Wolf had personally requested Orbach to replicate for the show.&lt;ref name="Prince of the City"&gt;{{cite book|date=May 1, 2011 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|author=John Anthony Gilvey|ISBN=978-1-4234-8845-3|title=Jerry Orbach, Prince of the City: His Way from The Fantasticks to Law &amp; Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced on a recurring basis during Season 2 was [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Dr. [[Elizabeth Olivet]], a police psychologist brought in on a case-by-case basis. [[NBC]] had been pushing for the producers to add female characters to the all-male cast.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 144-145"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;144–145&lt;/ref&gt; She was added to the opening credits as "also starring" in Season 3 and 4&lt;ref name="Lead"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Conspiracy| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Michael S. Chernuchin &amp; [[René Balcer]]. Director: Ed Sherin | network = NBC | series = Law &amp; Order | airdate = September 30, 1992| season = 3| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, despite the attempts of the producers to include her in as many episodes as possible, it was found to be difficult to incorporate her into the show due to the format leaning heavily on the police and prosecutors.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 144-145" /&gt; She was removed from the credits in Season 5.&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt;

McCormick stayed with the show on a recurring basis, but believed that the character had become less profound and complex, and that her role had been reduced mostly to "psychobabble." She left to star on ''[[Cracker (U.S. TV series)|Cracker]]'' after Season 7.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 144-146"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;144–146&lt;/ref&gt; After the cancellation of ''Cracker,'' she returned beginning in Season 13 and appeared occasionally until Season 20.&lt;ref name="American Jihad"&gt;{{cite episode| title = American Jihad| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Aaron Zelman &amp; Marc Guggenheim. Director: Constantine Makris | network = NBC | series = Law &amp; Order | airdate = 2002-10-02| season = 13| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of Season 3, NBC executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of then-network president [[Warren Littlefield]], new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday night time slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be dismissed. He chose to dismiss Florek and Brooks from the regular roster, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings, especially that of Brooks, who was said not to get along with Moriarty, were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 33-34"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

To replace Florek, [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] was cast as new squad leader Lieutenant [[Anita Van Buren]]. (Merkerson had previously guest starred as a mother of a gunshot victim in the Season 1 episode "Mushrooms.")&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 115-117"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–117&lt;/ref&gt; To replace Brooks, [[Jill Hennessy]] was cast as Assistant District Attorney [[Claire Kincaid]]. Though no initial explanation was given on the show for the departures of Florek's or Brooks's characters, they would both later return in guest appearances, with Captain Cragen having been reassigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and ADA Robinette having become a defense attorney. Florek also returned to direct a few episodes, and his character was eventually added to the cast of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 128-131"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;128–131&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Moriarty's behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] a "[[psychopath]]ic [[Nazi]]" for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week. The final storyline for Ben Stone involved him resigning over guilt after a woman he compelled to testify against a Russian mobster was murdered by his cohorts. To replace Moriarty, [[Sam Waterston]] was Wolf's first choice for the role of Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Jack McCoy|John J. "Jack" McCoy Jr.]]; Waterston's character was markedly different from Moriarty's in that Jack McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 35-37"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf dismissed Noth when his contract expired at the end of Season 5, because he felt that Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan had become too similar to each other and the writers were having difficulty in writing their dialogue together. Furthermore, Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the dismissals of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The final story line for Detective Logan involved him being banished to work on [[Staten Island]] in a [[domestic violence]] crimes unit as punishment for punching a city council member who had orchestrated the murder of a gay colleague and had managed to get acquitted of the charges. (The made-for-television film ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie|Exiled: A "Law &amp; Order" Movie]],'' in which Noth starred, centered around Logan attempting to get back into the department's good graces.) Noth was replaced by [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Detective [[Rey Curtis|Reynaldo "Rey" Curtis]], who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 34-35"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennessy chose not to renew her three-year contract at the end of Season 6 to pursue other projects, and Claire Kincaid was written off as being killed in a drunk driving accident.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 130"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt; She was replaced by [[Carey Lowell]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Jamie Ross (Law &amp; Order)|Jamie Ross]]. Lowell remained with the show until the end of Season 8, when she left to spend more time with her daughter. (Jamie Ross was written off as leaving the D.A.'s office for similar reasons.)&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 134-135"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell (who later returned for a couple guest appearances) was replaced by [[Angie Harmon]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Abbie Carmichael|Abigail "Abbie" Carmichael]], who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with 85 other women, including [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texas accent.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 333-335"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;333–335&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in Season 8 (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, B., J.K. Simmons makes Oscar push with jazzy role, USA Today, Oct. 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. K. Simmons]] had the recurring role of [[Emil Skoda (Law &amp; Order)|Dr. Emil Skoda]], a psychiatrist who worked with the Police Department..  He appeared in 41 episodes until 2004.  He then reappeared for three episodes in the final season.

Bratt left the series at the end of Season 9, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances. (He ultimately returned for the Season 20 episode "Fed.") Detective Curtis was written off as leaving the force in order to take care of his wife, who was suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]], in her final days.&lt;ref name="Bratt departure"&gt;{{cite news|last=Huff|first=Richard|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/04/30/1999-04-30_bratt_leaving__law___order__.html|title=Bratt Leaving 'Law &amp; Order'; 'Ally' Doc Joining Force|work=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Jesse L. Martin]] as Detective [[Ed Green]], who was conceived of as more of a loose cannon in the mold of Mike Logan than Rey Curtis was.&lt;ref name="Courrier and Green 331-332"&gt;Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;331–332&lt;/ref&gt; (Briscoe was described as being a recovering alcoholic, as Cragen had been; Green was described as being a recovering compulsive gambler.) In 2000, Hill announced he was leaving the series after Season 10. Hill, who was the last remaining member of the original cast, said his departure was mutual with the producers. He was replaced by [[Dianne Wiest]] as Interim District Attorney [[Nora Lewin]], and Adam Schiff was written out off-screen as departing to work with Jewish charities and human-rights organizations in Europe.&lt;ref name="Hill departure"&gt;{{cite news |date=Fall 2000 |url=http://www.podengo.com/apocrypha/fall00/hill.html|title=Steven Hill: Hollywood's Most Talented Curmudgeon |work=Apocrypha|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Harmon left the show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael written off as being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) and was replaced by [[Elisabeth Röhm]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Serena Southerlyn]].&lt;ref name="Harmon departure"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gail|date= April 23, 2001|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5884955_ITM|title='Law &amp; Order' gets its first blonde as Rohm joins the cast.|publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator [[Fred Thompson]] as District Attorney [[Arthur Branch]], whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Wiest departure"&gt;{{cite news|date=August 29, 2002|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2002-08-29-law-order-thompson_x.htm|title=Sen. Fred Thompson to join the case of 'Law &amp; Order'|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim DA.

After 12 years on ''Law &amp; Order,'' Orbach announced in March 2004 that he was leaving the show at the end of Season 14 for the spin-off ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]].'' Lennie Briscoe was written off as retiring from the NYPD and later taking a position as an investigator for the DA's office. He was replaced at the 27th Precinct by Detective [[Joe Fontana (Law &amp; Order)|Joe Fontana]], played by [[Dennis Farina]].&lt;ref name="Orbach departure" /&gt; At the time, Orbach would not state the reason for his departure,&lt;ref name="Orbach departure"&gt;{{cite news|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=May 18, 2004|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120231,00.html|title=Jerry Orbach Signs Off After 12 Years on 'Law &amp; Order'|publisher=Fox News |accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was eventually revealed that he had been battling [[prostate cancer]] (for over 10 years) and that his role on ''Trial by Jury'' was designed to be less taxing on him than his role on the original series was. However, Orbach died from his cancer on December 28, 2004 and was featured in only the first two episodes of ''Trial by Jury.'' (His character was subsequently written off as having also died off-screen, though this was not revealed on the original series until the Season 18 episode "Burn Card.")&lt;ref name="Orbach death"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|author2=Severo, Richard |date=December 29, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/arts/29cnd-orba.html|title=Jerry Orbach, Star of 'Law &amp; Order,' Dies at 69|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 15 would see the departure of Röhm mid-season. Röhm's final scene on the show, in the episode "Ain't No Love", sparked controversy within the fanbase, as ADA Southerlyn asked Arthur Branch if she was being fired because she was a lesbian, a fact the scripts had never even hinted at until then.&lt;ref name="Martin exit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roush |first=Matt|date=April 24, 2008 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2008/04/24/martin-goes-out |title='Law &amp; Order' recap: Ed Green turns in his badge |work=TV Guide|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf said Röhm's departure was unexpected, and she exited the show in January 2005. Her replacement was [[Annie Parisse]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Alexandra Borgia]]. For a few seasons, she had often argued opposing points to McCoy and Branch, and he thought she would be better as a defender rather than a prosecutor.

Later that season, Martin departed early to film ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]].'' Ed Green was temporarily written off as being shot in the line of duty and being replaced during his recovery by Detective [[Nick Falco]], played by [[Michael Imperioli]], who had previously guest starred as a murder suspect in the Season 6 episode "Atonement."&lt;ref name="Parisse-Imperioli"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Gary|date=December 6, 2004|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-12-06-lno-inside_x.htm?csp=34|title='Law &amp; Order' stays orderly|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parisse left the series at the end of Season 16 (with ADA Borgia written off as being murdered), and Farina announced shortly afterward that he too was leaving ''Law &amp; Order'' to pursue other projects. (Detective Fontana was written off as having retired off-screen.)&lt;ref name="Parisse-Farina"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marinovich |first=Milosh |date= May 31, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/31/entertainment/main1671381.shtml |title='Law &amp; Order' Cast Shakeup |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, NBC executives believed the series was beginning to show its age, as the ratings had been declining since Orbach's departure.&lt;ref name="Govich-de la Garza" /&gt; Farina had never been popular with fans when he replaced Orbach, and it was felt that the cast just did not seem to mesh well together anymore.&lt;ref name="Martin exit" /&gt; In an effort to revitalize the show, Wolf replaced Parisse with [[Alana de la Garza]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Connie Rubirosa|Consuela "Connie" Rubirosa]], while Martin's character was promoted to senior detective and partnered with Detective [[Nina Cassady]], played by [[Milena Govich]], who had worked with Wolf on the short-lived series ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' and served as the show's first female detective of the main cast.&lt;ref name="Govich-de la Garza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|date=July 16, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/arts/television/16stei.html|title='Law &amp; Order' Meets the Law of Supply and Demand|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Govich proved to be even more unpopular with fans than her predecessor was, and she left the show after one season, with the explanation being that Detective Cassady's assignment to the precinct had been temporary and had been transferred out. She was replaced by [[Jeremy Sisto]], who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 17 episode "The Family Hour", as Detective [[Cyrus Lupo]].&lt;ref name="Cheers Lupo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fretts|first=Bruce|date=January 2, 2008|url=http://www.tvguide.com/cheers-jeers/Cheers-Sisto-Lays-8673.aspx|title=Cheers: Sisto Lays Down the Law|work=TV Guide|accessdate=December 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302143240/http://www.tvguide.com/cheers-jeers/Cheers-Sisto-Lays-8673.aspx|archivedate=March 2, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Thompson announced he would leave the show to seek the 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination. (No explanation was given within the show regarding Arthur Branch's off-screen departure.)

''Law &amp; Order'' episodes are typically segmented into two parts, roughly at the halfway point; the first part follows police and detective work, and the second follows the legal and courtroom proceedings of the case. The show dwells little on the characters' [[back-story|back-stories]] or [[social relation|social lives]], focusing mainly on their lives at work.

===The police portion===
For most of ''Law &amp; Order''{{'}}s run, the [[cold open]] or lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder.
The scene typically began with a slice of everyday life in [[New York City]]. Some civilians would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place and they would be witnesses or a victim of a crime. The only exceptions to this are in the early seasons, mostly Seasons 1 &amp; 2, the crime would usually be discovered by a pair of uniformed officers on patrol, or in later seasons when the cold open was replaced with rapid cuts of the victim's final moments, similar to ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]''.

The police are represented in the show by the [[New York City Police Department]] 27th Precinct homicide department. In the show it is common that the detectives also investigate cases other than homicide or attempted homicides, like kidnappings and rape, the latter especially in the first nine seasons of the show, before ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' premiered. However, in the real world these cases are handled by other units and divisions.

The viewers are introduced to two homicide detectives, a senior detective (usually a veteran cop) and a junior detective (usually a young but capable detective), who report directly to their boss at their precinct (either a [[Lieutenant]] or a [[Police captain|Captain]]). During the preliminary crime scene examination, the featured detectives make their first observations and will come up with theories followed by a witticism or two, before the title sequence begins.

The detectives often have few or no good clues—they might not even know the victim's identity—and must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect(s).

They start their investigations at the crime scene by talking to any witnesses while the [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau#Crime Scene Unit|Crime Scene Unit]] (CSU) technicians start processing the scene by collecting [[forensic]] evidence. The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|medical examiner]] (M.E.)'s office will also be shown to collect the body from the crime scene.

Later the medical examiner will perform an [[autopsy]] on the victim, offering more clues to the victim's cause and time of death (sometimes obtaining the [[Body identification|victim's identity]] from [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]] or fingerprints) which the detectives will read about in the M.E.'s autopsy report and by talking to the M.E. who performed it. When the detectives know the victim's identity they will inform their relatives or loved ones of their death and attempt to get more information on the victim's life and possible suspects.

The detectives continue their investigation by interviewing witnesses and possible suspects, all the while tracing the victim's last known movements and victim's state of mind (by talking to the victim's family, friends and co-workers).  Sometimes they will have someone they suspect of the crime and will trace their last known movements and state of mind by talking to the people in the suspect's life, until they are either ruled out or dead certain of their guilt.  They also visit the [[crime lab]]oratory to submit and view evidence (e.g. fingerprints, [[DNA profiling|DNA]] and [[Forensic ballistics|ballistics]], etc.), they may also look into any background information such as financial details and criminal history on both the victim and lead suspect.  In some instances, [[psychologist]]s and/or [[psychiatrist]]s are called in for insight into the criminal's behavior or ''[[modus operandi]]''. All the while, the detectives report to their commanding officer, keeping them informed and being advised on how best to proceed next.

When the detectives are certain they have the right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a [[Search warrant|search]] and/or [[arrest warrant]] (though sometimes the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|armed tactical team]]) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the [[Assistant District Attorney]] from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.

===The trial portion===
Towards the middle of a show, the police will begin to work with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the Assistant District Attorney will appear earlier to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for search or arrest warrants before arresting the suspects. An [[arraignment]] court scene will follow, in which the defendants plead (usually not guilty) and bail conditions are set.

The matter is then taken over by a pair of representatives from the New York County District Attorney's Office, an Executive Assistant District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney. They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the People's case in the trial. The District Attorneys work together and with the Medical Examiner's office, the [[Crime Lab|crime laboratory]] (including [[Fingerprint|fingerprint analysts]], [[DNA profiling|DNA profilers]] and [[Forensic ballistics|ballistics analysts]]), and [[psychologists]] or [[psychiatrists]] (if the defendant uses an insanity plea), all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the D.A.'s office, in consultation with the District Attorney for advice on the case, as the D.A., being an elected official, sometimes brings political considerations to bear concerning decisions to prosecute various alleged offenders. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.

Unlike many other legal dramas (e.g., ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' and ''[[L.A. Law]]''), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the [[arraignment]] of defendants, the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.

Many episodes use outlandish defense scenarios such as [[diminished responsibility]] (e.g. "Genetics"/"Television"/"God"/"the devil made me do it" and [[intoxication defence]]) and [[insanity defense|temporary insanity]] (e.g. "[[Black rage (law)|Black Rage]]"/"White Rage"/"Sports Rage"). Some episodes revolve around moral and ethical debates including the [[right to die]] ([[euthanasia]]), the [[right to life]] ([[abortion]]), and [[the right to bear arms#United States|the right to bear arms]] ([[gun control]]). Episodes usually end with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the District Attorney's office, where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defense scenarios that were used, or the moral or ethical issue that was central to the episode.

==="Ripped from the headlines"===
Often the plot of an initial portion of an episode resembles a recognizable aspect of an actual case.&lt;ref name="aol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.aol.com/2009/10/22/law-and-order-fictionalizes-taconic-tragedy-is-it-too-soon?icid=main|title='Law &amp; Order' Fictionalizes the Taconic Parkway Tragedy – Is It Too Soon?|last=Conroy|first=Tom|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Television]]|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early seasons, the details of these cases often closely followed the real stories, such as the season one episode "[[Subterranean Homeboy Blues]]", which had a woman shooting two attempted muggers, paralleling the [[Bernhard Goetz]] case. Another early episode, "Out of the Half-Light", focused on a racially charged rape case that mimicked the [[Tawana Brawley]] case. This "ripped from the headlines" style is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper [[halftone]]s to high-resolution photos. Another first-season episode, "[[Poison Ivy (Law &amp; Order)|Poison Ivy]]", was based on the [[Edmund Perry]] case where an NYPD officer fatally shot a black honor student who was committing a crime in front of the officer upon returning to the city after recently graduating from an [[Ivy League]] [[University-preparatory school|prep school]]. Later seasons would take real-life cases as inspiration but diverge more from the facts. Often this would be done by increasing the severity of the crime in question, usually by adding a murder. As a result, the plot would tend to veer significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode.&lt;ref name="aol" /&gt; Promotional advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels regularly use the "ripped from the headlines" phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional. This format lends itself to exploring different outcomes or motives that similar events could have had under other circumstances.

Some real-life crime victims have felt used and exploited,&lt;ref name="aol" /&gt; with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504029.html |title=Ripped From the Headlines – and From the Heart|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2009|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2010, [[NBC]] officially canceled ''Law &amp; Order'',&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Michael|title='s official: Original 'Law and Order' to end – Entertainment News, TV News, Media|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019334.html |accessdate=May 15, 2010|newspaper=Variety|date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opting instead to pick up ''Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles'' for a first season and renew ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' for a twelfth.&lt;ref name="canceled" /&gt;  Creator Dick Wolf continued to pressure the series' producer [[NBC Universal]] to make a deal with [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], which held syndication rights to the show, for a twenty-first season if an acceptable license fee could be bargained. Talks between the two started up after upfronts.&lt;ref name="Deadline 2010-05-17"&gt;{{cite news | first=Nikki | last=Finke | title=TOLDJA! 'Law &amp; Order' Heading To TNT?

After TNT discussions fell through, cable network [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] also considered reviving ''Law &amp; Order'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/07/law_order_amc.html |title=AMC Investigates Reviving ''Law &amp; Order'' |date=July 6, 2010 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, attempts to revive it failed, and according to creator Dick Wolf, the series "moved into the history books".&lt;ref name="showdead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="showdead2"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Levin | first = Gary | title = 'Law &amp; Order' is L.A.-bound | work = USA Today | date = July 30, 2010 | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/livefrom/post/2010/07/law--order-is-la-bound/1 | accessdate =July 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, NBC considered bringing the series back for a 10-episode limited series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |title=NBC Eyes 'Law &amp; Order' Limited Series|publisher=Deadline|date=February 6, 2015|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/law-and-order-limited-series-return-nbc-1201367497/|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelman |first=Vlada |url=http://tvline.com/2015/02/06/law-order-limited-series-nbc-chris-noth-sam-waterston/ |title='Law &amp; Order' Limited Series at NBC — Chris Noth &amp; Sam Waterston Approached |publisher=TVLine |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs, tie-ins, and adaptations==
{{Main|Law &amp; Order (franchise)}}
The longevity and success of ''Law &amp; Order'' has spawned five American television series (''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles]]'', and ''[[Law &amp; Order True Crime]]''), as well as a television film (''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie]]''), all of which use the name ''Law &amp; Order''. Although there were fears initially that the failure of such shows could hurt the original series, it was felt the brand name was needed because of the commercial desirability such a brand name creates.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 10-11"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, ''Law &amp; Order'' is often referred to as "The Mother Ship" by producers and critics.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 2"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

The series (and its spin-offs) shared a universe with the series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', with the two sharing several crossover episodes.

The original series has also been adapted for British television as ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'', with the setting changed to London. Similarly, ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' has been adapted for French and Russian television under the respective titles ''[[Paris enquêtes criminelles]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent#Russian adaptation|Закон и порядок. Преступный умысел]]'', and ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' has also had a Russian version, ''[[Закон и порядок: отдел оперативных расследований|Закон и Порядок: Отдел Оперативных Расследований]]''.

'''Lubrication''' is the process or technique of using a [[lubricant]] to reduce [[friction]] and/or [[wear]] in a contact between two surfaces. The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of [[tribology]].

Lubricants can be [[solid|solids]] (such as [[Molybdenum disulfide]] MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineersedge.com/lubrication/applications_solid_lubrication.htm – 14k&lt;/ref&gt;, solid/liquid [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersions]] (such as [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]), [[liquid|liquids]] (such as [[oil]] or [[water]]), liquid-liquid [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersions]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=needs a citation or relevant example. it used to say "grease" as an example, but greases are not liquid-liquid dispersions}} or [[gas|gases]]. 

Fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by [[hydrodynamic]] or [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic]] pressure, which reduces solid body interactions (and consequently friction and wear). Depending on the degree of surface separation, different lubrication regimes can be distinguished.

Adequate lubrication allows smooth, continuous operation of [[Machine element|machine elements]], reduces the rate of wear, and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, components can rub destructively against each other, causing heat, local welding, destructive damage and failure.

== Lubrication Mechanisms ==

===Fluid-lubricated Systems===
As the load increases on the contacting surfaces, three distinct situations can be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication, which are called lubrication regimes:{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

*'''Fluid film lubrication''' is the lubrication regime in which, through viscous forces, the load is fully supported by the lubricant within the space or gap between the parts in motion relative to one another object (the lubricated conjunction) and solid–solid contact is avoided.&lt;ref&gt;San Andrés. L. "Introduction to pump rotordynamics, Part i. Introduction to hydrodynamic lubrication". ("MEEN626 Lubrication Theory Class:Syllabus FALL2006"). [http://phn.tamu.edu/me262/Notes_pdf/Introduction.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} (11 Dec 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Hydrostatic lubrication''' is when an external pressure is applied to the lubricant in the [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], to maintain the fluid lubricant film where it would otherwise be squeezed out.
**'''Hydrodynamic lubrication''' is where the motion of the contacting surfaces, and the exact design of the bearing is used to pump lubricant around the bearing to maintain the lubricating film. This design of bearing may wear when started, stopped or reversed, as the lubricant film breaks down. The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is the [[Reynolds equation]]. The governing equations of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions can be found in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribonet.org/wiki/hydrodynamic-lubrication/|title=Hydrodynamic Lubrication|last=tribonet|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Tribology|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Elastohydrodynamic lubrication''': Mostly for nonconforming surfaces or higher load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, the motion of the contacting bodies generates a  flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or '''''asperities''''', can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribonet.org/wiki/elastohydrodynamic-lubrication-ehl/|title=Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL)|last=tribonet|date=2017-02-05|newspaper=Tribology|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Boundary lubrication''' (also called boundary film lubrication): The hydrodynamic effects are negligible. The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities; the heat developed by the local pressures causes a condition which is called stick-slip, and some asperities break off. At the elevated temperature and pressure conditions, chemically reactive constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface, forming a highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces (boundary film) which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or breakdown is avoided. Boundary lubrication is also defined as that regime in which the load is carried by the surface asperities rather than by the lubricant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bosman R. and Schipper D.J.|title=Microscopic Mild Wear in the Boundary Lubrication regime|edition=|publisher=Laboratory for Surface Technology and Tribology, Faculty of Engineering Technology, University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, NL 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands |year=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mixed lubrication''': This regime is in between the full film elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes. The generated lubricant film is not enough to separate the bodies completely, but hydrodynamic effects are considerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akchurin|first=Aydar|last2=Bosman|first2=Rob|last3=Lugt|first3=Piet M.|last4=Drogen|first4=Mark van|date=2015-05-31|title=On a Model for the Prediction of the Friction Coefficient in Mixed Lubrication Based on a Load-Sharing Concept with Measured Surface Roughness|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-015-0536-z|journal=Tribology Letters|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1007/s11249-015-0536-z|issn=1023-8883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions as well, for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products. While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from the contact areas either by the relative movement (hydrodynamics) or by externally induced forces.

Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as [[piston]]s, [[pump]]s, [[cam]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[turbine]]s, [[cutting tool]]s etc. where without lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in close proximity would generate enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition  may literally weld the surfaces together, causing [[seizure (mechanics)|seizure]].

In some applications, such as piston engines, the film between the piston and the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber, preventing combustion gases from escaping into the crankcase.

'''Marshall Glecker Holloway''' (November 23, 1912 – June 18, 1991) was an American physicist who worked at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during and after [[World War II]]. He was its representative, and the deputy scientific director, at the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific in July 1946. Holloway became the head of the Laboratory's W Division, responsible for new weapons development. In September 1952 he was charged with designing, building and testing a thermonuclear weapon, popularly known as a [[hydrogen bomb]]. This culminated in the [[Ivy Mike]] test in November of that year.

Holloway married Wilma Schamel, who worked in the Medical Office at Cornell as a medical technologist, on August 22, 1938. During a picnic at [[Taughannock Falls State Park|Taughannock Falls]] on June 3, 1940, she and a graduate student, Henry S. Birnbaum, drowned while trying to rescue two women in the water. The women were subsequently rescued by Jean Doe Bacher, the wife of physicist [[Robert Bacher]], and Helen Hecht, a graduate student, but the bodies of Wilma and Birnbaum had to be retrieved with grappling hooks two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Star-Gazette]] |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023/Elmira%20%20NY%20Star%20Gazette/Elmira%20NY%20Star%20Gazette%201940/Elmira%20NY%20Star%20Gazette%201940%20-%202308.pdf |title=Grapplers Recover Bodies of Two in Taughannock Pool |accessdate=September 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cornell Alumni News |volume=43 |issue=16 |date=January 30, 1941 |page=219  |url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/27333/1/043_16.pdf |title=On the Campus and Down the Hill |accessdate=September 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
[[File:Los-Alamos-Water-Boiler-LANL12784.jpg|thumb|right|The Water Boiler, an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]] at the Los Alamos Laboratory, was the first reactor to use [[enriched uranium]] as a fuel]]
In 1942, Holloway arrived at [[Purdue University]] on a secret assignment from the [[Manhattan Project]]. His task was to modify the [[cyclotron]] there to help the group there, which included L.D. P. King and [[Raemer Schreiber]] and some graduate students, measure the [[nuclear cross section|cross section]] of the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of a [[deuterium]] nucleus, when bombarded with a [[tritium]] nucleus to form a {{chem|4|2|He}} nucleus ([[alpha particle]]), and the cross section of a deuterium-tritium interaction to form {{chem|3|2|He}}. These calculations were for evaluating the feasibility of [[Edward Teller]]'s [[thermonuclear]] "[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super bomb]]", and the resulting reports would remain classified for many years.&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about_us/history/war_period.shtml |title=A History of Physics at Purdue: The War Period (1941–1945) |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |accessdate=September 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion cross section calculations were finished by September 1943, and the Purdue group moved to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where most of them, including Holloway, worked on the Water Boiler, an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]] that was intended for use as a laboratory instrument to test [[critical mass]] calculations and the effect of various [[neutron reflector#Nuclear weapons|tamper]] materials. The Water Boiler group was headed by [[Donald W. Kerst]] from the [[University of Illinois]], and the group designed and built the Water Boiler, which achieved its [[criticality (status)|criticality]] in May 1944 under the control of [[Enrico Fermi]], after one final addition of uranium enriched to 14% [[uranium 235]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bunker|first= Merle E. |title=Early Reactors From Fermi’s Water Boiler to Novel Power Prototypes|journal=Los Alamos Science| year= 1983 |pages=124–131|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00416628.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was world third reactor{{sfn|Bunker|1983|p=124}} but the first reactor to use [[enriched uranium]] as a fuel, using most of the world's supply at the time, and the first to use liquid [[nuclear fuel]] in the form of soluble [[uranium sulfate]] dissolved in water.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=199–203}}

Holloway studied the safety of the [[Little Boy]] bomb, particularly what would happen if the active material became immersed in water.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=258}} He was also involved in experiments to measure the critical mass of plutonium. These proved hazardous, taking the lives of [[Harry Daghlian]] and [[Louis Slotin]] after the war.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=340–341}} Holloway was part of Robert Bacher's "pit team" that assembled the Gadget for the [[Trinity nuclear test]], and he helped Bacher fabricate the [[plutonium]] hemispheres of the Nagasaki [[Fat Man]] bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=330–333, 367–369}}

== Later life ==
Holloway remained at Los Alamos after the war ended in 1945. He was its representative, and the deputy scientific director, at the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific in July 1946, when atomic bombs were tested against an array of warships.{{sfn|Schreiber|1993|p=74}} Holloway became the head of the Laboratory's W Division, responsible for new weapons development.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=529}}

The Los Alamos National Laboratory had continued research into fusion weapons for many years after Holloway's work in 1942 and 1943,{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=133}} and in 1951 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], which had replaced the Manhattan Project in 1947,{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=1}} ordered the Laboratory to proceed with designing, building and testing a thermonuclear weapon, popularly known as a [[hydrogen bomb]]. Laboratory director [[Norris Bradbury]] placed Holloway in charge of the hydrogen bomb program.{{sfn|Schreiber|1993|p=75}}

Although Holloway had a well-earned reputation for his administrative ability, Bradbury's decision to put him in charge was not popular, especially with Edward Teller. The two men had clashed a number of times over a number of different issues. Holloway's appointment was therefore "like waving a red flag in front of a bull".{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=556}} Teller wrote that: {{quote|Bradbury could not have appointed anyone who would have slowed the work on the programme more effectively, nor anyone with whom I would have found it more frustrating to work. Norris had announced, in effect, that he did not care whether I worked on the project or not.{{sfn|Goodchild|2004|p=191}} }}
Teller left the project on September 17, 1952, just a week after the announcement of Holloway's appointment. Nor was Teller the only one who chafed under Holloway's leadership style. Before the [[Ivy Mike]] test, Wallace Leland and [[Harold Agnew]] put a shark in Holloway's bed.{{sfn|Goodchild|2004|p=191}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/harold-agnews-interview-1994 |title=Harold Agnew's Interview (1994) |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices |accessdate=September 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=501}} "He never said anything," Agnew recalled, "but after that he was much more collegial."{{sfn|Goodchild|2004|p=191}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=501}}

The Ivy Mike test on November 1, 1952 was a complete success, but it was not a weapon so much as an experiment to verify the Teller and [[Stanislaw Ulam]]'s design. Years of work was still required to produce a usable weapon.{{sfn|Schreiber|1993|p=75}}

In 1955, Holloway left the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], where he worked on air defense projects. In 1957 he became head of the Nuclear Products-[[Engineering and Research Corporation|ERCO]] Division of [[ACF Industries]]. He was vice president of [[Budd Company]] from 1967 to 1969, when he retired to live in Jupiter, Florida, Holloway and his wife Harriet subsequently moved to [[Winter Haven, Florida]], where his son Jerry, a retired [[United States Air Force]] officer, lived.{{sfn|Schreiber|1993|p=75}} Holloway died there on June 18, 1991.{{sfn|Schreiber|1993|p=73}}

The '''metrics reference model (MRM)''' is the reference model created by the Consortium for Advanced Management-International (CAM-I) to be a single reference library of performance metrics.  This library is useful for accelerating to development of and improving the content of any organization's business intelligence solution.

==Background==
The MRM was created by the Business Intelligence Working Group of CAM-I.  Substantial secondary research performed by the group revealed that there was no single, central location for performance metrics information.  All published material focused on a single dimension of performance metrics (e.g., financial), or focused on how to use such metrics to affect the performance of an organization.  Exhaustive lists of performance metrics that were generic to nearly any organization across all aspects of the business (e.g., customer, product/service, employee) were not found.  Furthermore, without a single reference point, no research was located where the relationships between these performance metrics had been documented and described.

==Overview==
MRM is a technology agnostic reference model based on the basic elements of a generic organization for which cost, process, and performance improvements may be desired.

In keeping with CAM-I's generic model of an organization, these elements include:
*  Customers (or business sustaining forces)
*  Products and services
*  Processes and activities
*  Employees
*  Finance
*  Research and development
*  Infrastructure
*  Resources
*  Suppliers

The figure below illustrates the flow between these components in a typical organization. &lt;gallery&gt;Image:Organization_Elements.JPG|CAM-I's Generic Model of an Organization&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Content==
For each of the organizational elements, the MRM provides a comprehensive list of cost, process, and performance metrics of possible interest to many organizations.  For example, some of the performance metrics provided for the employee organizational element include average customer review, customer retention rate, sales per customer/spending rate, average quantity per customer order, order frequency, average number of orders per customer, and average customer lifetime value.

For each performance metric, this information is also provided:
*  '''Type.''' Provides further levels of suborganization within the organizational element where sensible (e.g., Financial).
*  '''Definition/Calculation.''' A generally accepted means of calculating the metric from measures is provided.
*  '''Strengths/Opportunities.''' Known advantages for using the metric.
*  '''Weaknesses/Problems/Risks.''' Known disadvantages for using the metric.
*  '''Target Setting.''' A discussion of the desired outcome.
*  '''Possible correlations/market basket of metrics.''' Consideration of other metrics and correlations of environmental factors are provided.  This area explores the relationship of the measure against every other metric in the MRM, an indication of the strength of the relationship (e.g., weak, moderate, strong), and an indication to the type of relationship (e.g., negatively correlated, positively correlated).

==Value and use of the MRM==
The benefit of the MRM is that each metric has already been identified, defined, and considered by a group of experienced business intelligence professionals. The idea of the MRM is for the business intelligence (BI) practitioner to follow these steps:
*  Assess the requirements of the BI solution and determine which organization components apply.
*  For each organizational component that applies, open this document to the associated MRM section.
*  Review each of the measures.
*  Identify measures of interest.
*  Review the information provided about each measure and either accept or reject the measure for inclusion in the BI tool.
*  Accumulate all desired measures in a list.
*  Use the measures (or, if metrics are selected, use the measures in the Definition/Calculation column) to drive the BI data model.

===Using the MRM in industry===
How the MRM may be used practically in the industry depends on whether an individual or an organization is considered.

Individual interest in the MRM:
*  Program analysts: Use the MRM to tailor to a specific program/organization.
*  Managers: Use the MRM model to validate that the metrics selected represent the needs of their business.
*  Strategic planners: Use the MRM to determine metric relationships and correlations in order to determine strategic decisions.
*  Operational planners: Use the MRM to understand operational data points that you have control over to affect the metrics and understand the components of the metrics.
*  BI practitioners: Use the MRM to define the BI requirements and calculations, as well as the interpretation of the data.  Help the business owner determine the appropriate display of metrics.
*  Vendors:  Use the MRM to provide relevant products/services that answer clients’ needs out-of-the-box.
*  Educators:  Use the MRM to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the various measures.

====Organizational interest in the MRM====
*  New organizations/agencies, mergers &amp; acquisitions
*  Existing organizations that are starting performance measurement efforts
*  Consulting organizations for use in client situations
*  Software vendors
*  Monitoring organizations
*  Those with performance challenges (may have metrics, but not enough to interpret that metric)
*  Those who do not wish to go through a large strategic planning exercise but want to start using best practice metrics for common functions
*  Small budgets or time constraints or those that do not have the expertise to create metrics

====Use Cases====
The MRM to be used in a number of different ways, including:

*  Use as part of planning process.  Rather than starting from a blank slate, go through each and add those that are specific to their organization.  *  Use to generate ideas.  Customize existing, add specific to your organization
*  Use as a cookbook.  Select ingredients (metrics) of interest from each area when there are known objectives but want to save time.
*  Use to refine existing program (rare), compare metrics vs. existing (completeness review)
*  BI practitioner:  Use for developing the calculations, finding the data needed to run the calculations, and building appropriate data structures
*  For consulting organizations to provide more thorough results quickly (competitive advantage)
*  For software vendors to provide specific applications
*  Education tool (understanding strengths/weaknesses of metrics, etc.) for staff at all levels to understand what’s important

[[Image:MiniScribe-logo.png|right]]
[[Image:44 MB HDD and 2 GB CF card.jpeg|thumb|A 44 MB, 5.25-inch full-height MiniScribe hard disk, shown with a more recent 2 GB Compact Flash memory card for size comparison.]]
'''MiniScribe'''  was a manufacturer of [[disk storage]] products, founded in [[Longmont, Colorado]] in 1980. MiniScribe designed and sold [[stepper motor]]-based [[hard disk drive]]s with a large amount of onboard logic for the time. They eventually moved into higher-profile [[voice coil]] motor designs, and won major contracts with [[IBM]]. They were a relatively well-known brand through the early 1980s.

==History==
The company was started by Terry Johnson, who had a 20-year career in the hard drive business at such companies as IBM, [[Memorex]] and [[Storage Technology Corporation]]. MiniScribe became a major player when it won a series of contracts to supply IBM's PC division, and their subsequent rapid growth led to an [[initial public offering]] in late 1983, opening for trading in January 1984. However, slow sales of the [[IBM XT]] led IBM to dramatically scale back their orders late that year, forcing MiniScribe to lay off 26% of its staff and causing the value of the stock to plummet. Johnson left the company; at the time he stated that he had been planning to do this for some time and that his departure had "absolutely nothing" to do with IBM.&lt;ref name=quit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/11/business/business-people-top-officer-quits-at-miniscribe-corp.html "Top Officer Quits At Miniscribe Corp."], ''New York Times'', 11 December 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson would later comment that "It's a very low inertia industry, you can blow your way into it and get blown out of it very quickly."&lt;ref&gt;Bro Uttal, [http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1985/11/25/66644/index.htm "The Hard Times In Hard-Disk Drives"], Fortune, 25 November 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Gower, recently promoted to President, took over the CEO role as well.&lt;ref name=quit/&gt;

Shortly thereafter the company was recapitalized with a $20 million investment from Hambrecht &amp; Quist (H&amp;Q), a [[venture capital]] firm. One of H&amp;Q's officers was Quentin Thomas ("QT") Wiles, a turnaround specialist nicknamed "Dr. Fix-It". Wiles took over the CEO position from Gower, running the company remotely from his office in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles]], with a management team made up primarily of accountants.&lt;ref name=convicted&gt;Patrice Apodaca, [http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-09/business/fi-25289_1_disk-drive "Wiles Convicted of Fraud in MiniScribe Case"], New York Times, 9 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon returned to profitability, with sales increasing from $114 million at the height of IBM's orders, to $603 million by 1988, when they were named the most well-managed company in the disk drive industry.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt; Their major customer at this time was [[Compaq]], but the company was also bidding for major contracts with [[Apple Computer]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC).&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

==Problems==
In January 1987, the company officers conducted a quick inventory in order to estimate their accounts prior to an independent review by a third party accounting firm, [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]]. Their internal inventory count showed that there was a shortfall of between $2 and $4 million. This implied the cost to produce those drives that did sell was higher than initially thought, which, if properly booked against sales, would mean their [[operating margin]]s would be unimpressive. Instead of reporting this, a number of the managers decided to cover it up with various means. They produced an inflated inventory count, and then broke into the accountant's lock boxes and replaced their independent count to match their newly inflated numbers. The team continued to roll these numbers forward through the quarters, compounding the problem.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-10th-circuit/1277848.html US vs. Wiles, US vs. Schleibaum]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1987, Parker, director of far east operations, told Wiles that something was amiss.  In August, Wiles travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore where he found a complete loss of control. The inventory count from that fall showed that the numbers had grown to $15 million, mostly in Colorado. A report was prepared to consider various solutions, but Wiles suggested that they continue hiding the problem, ordering all copies of the report be destroyed. This led to the company's most infamous cover-up; the managers rented a second warehouse in Colorado, where they personally packed 26,000 bricks into hard drive boxes and shipped them to Singapore in order to shore up the inventory count.  After the count was complete, they recalled those serial numbers as defective units, but instead of writing them off, they checked them into inventory, along with other failed drives that had been returned.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

The company continued to post impressive numbers, but there were troubling signs. Among them was that the company continued to post improving [[operating margin]]s while the rest of the hard drive industry was suffering from rapidly falling margins due to ongoing downward price pressure. In 1988 the [[board of directors]] became concerned when the company's reported [[Accounts receivable|receivables]] grew dramatically, indicating a large amount of unpaid billables, while at the same time inventories were also growing, indicating unsold product. Those two numbers are normally at odds; increased receivables should indicate increased sales, which would normally result in decreased inventory. The directors began an internal investigation in October, while the company reported another record-setting quarter for that period in spite of failing to win either the Apple or DEC contracts.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;"Cooking The Books: How Pressure To Raise Sales Led Miniscribe to Falsify Numbers", Wall Street Journal, 11 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation revealed that Wiles set iron-clad sales forecasts and pushed these requirements down into the sales team, leaving no room for failure and setting bonuses on beating those figures. The sales team responded by "touching up" reporting documents as they moved back up the reporting chain. Wiles responded to these positive reports by setting even higher sales targets, leading to ever-increasing fraud to meet them.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt; Wiles eventually left the company in February 1989, followed by most of the company's officers over the next months. The directors report was released in the summer, stating that Wiles and his management team had "perpetrated a massive fraud" in a "company run amok".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fraud Is Cited at Miniscribe | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3DE1130F930A2575AC0A96F948260 | work = AP | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 1989-09-13 | accessdate = 2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other techniques used to improve the numbers were classic accounting tricks; failing to write off [[bad debt]]s, shipping drives to warehouses and booking them as sales ([[channel stuffing]]), back-dating shipments to allow them to be booked in earlier reporting periods to meet goals, and deliberately shipping defective products repeatedly to different customers so one drive could be booked as multiple sales (leading employees to joke that the only thing being repaired were the worn-out cardboard boxes). When the company embarked on a round of [[layoff]]s just before the 1989 Christmas shutdown, including several of the employees who were involved in the brick scheme, they immediately called the Denver area newspapers, who broke the story. Following immediate investigations in Singapore and Colorado the fraud was confirmed.&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;[https://mnasran.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/fraud-examination-4th-edition.pdf "Fraud Examination"], Southwestern University, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The company declared [[bankruptcy]] on 1 January 1990,&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt; and was quickly liquidated with [[Maxtor]] acquiring its assets in a $46 million cash and stock deal in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/business/company-news-maxtor-acquires-miniscribe-assets.html Company News; Maxtor Acquires Miniscribe Assets, NY Times, 2 July 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent court case, Wiles claimed to have known nothing of these schemes, saying he was duped by the middle management. However, several of those middle managers testified that Wiles was very much aware of the fraud. The court also noted that Wiles sold a considerable number of shares in the company in April and May 1988, immediately prior to reporting a shortfall due to an "elaborate scheme" to manipulate inventory shortfalls. Wiles was eventually convicted of [[fraud]] and [[insider trading]].&lt;ref name=convicted/&gt;

Founder Terry Johnson later helped found [[CoData (company)|CoData]] with the intent of building a 3.5" hard drive with the capacity of then-standard 5.25" drives.&lt;ref name="CoData"&gt;[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Johnson_Terry/Johnson_Terry.oral_history.2006.102657961.pdf Oral History Of Terry Johnson, Computer History Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; The company merged with [[Conner Peripherals]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;Computer Systems News and Electronic News, Feb 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and as Conner Peripherals became a major vendor for a time. Johnson died piloting his small plane near [[Norman Wells]] in northern Canada on 24 July 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37669">A '''National Data Repository''' ('''NDR''') is a data bank that seeks to preserve and promote a country’s natural resources data, particularly data related to the petroleum [[exploration and production]] (E&amp;P) sector.

A National Data Repository is normally established by an entity that governs, controls and supports the exchange, capture, transference and distribution of E&amp;P information, with the final target to provide the State with the tools and information to assure the growth, govern-ability, control, independence and sovereignty of the industry.

The two fundamental reasons for a country to establish an NDR are to '''preserve''' data generated inside the country by the industry, and to '''promote''' investments in the country by utilizing data to reduce the exploration, production, and transportation business risks.

Countries take different approaches towards preserving and promoting their natural resources data. The approach varies according to a country’s natural resources policies, level of openness, and its attitude towards foreign investment.

==Data types==
NDRs store a vast array of data related to a country’s natural resources. This includes wells, [[Well logging|well log data]], well reports, [[core sample]]s, [[seismic]] surveys, [[Seismic inversion#Post-stack seismic resolution inversion|post-stack seismic]], field data/tapes, seismic (acquisition/processing) reports, [[Oil production|production]] data, [[geological map]]s and reports, license data and [[geologic modeling|geological models]].

==Funding models==
Some NDRs are financed entirely by a country’s government. Others are industry-funded. Still some are hybrid systems, funded in part by industry and government.
NDRs typically charge fees for data requests and for data loading. The cost differs significantly between countries. In some cases an annual membership is charged to oil companies to store and access the data in the NDR.

==Standards body==
[[Energistics]] is the global energy standards resource center for the upstream oil and gas industry.

Energistics National Data Repository Work Group:
The standards body is Energistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energistics.org/energistics-standards-directory Energistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energistics-standards-directory===
Global regulators of upstream oil and natural gas information, including seismic, drilling, production and reservoir data, formed the National Data Repository (NDR) Work Group in 2008 to collaborate on the development of data management standards and to assist emerging nations with hydrocarbon reserves to better collect, maintain and deliver oil and gas data to the public and to the industry.

Ten countries, led by the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]], formed NDR to share best practices and to formalize the development and deployment of data management standards for regulatory agencies. The other countries involved in the NDR Work Group’s formation are [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]].

Annual NDR Conference: Approximately every 18 months Energistics organizes a National Data Repository Conference. The purpose is to provide government and regulatory agencies from around the world an opportunity to attend a series of workshops dedicated to developing data exchange standards, improving communications with the oil and gas industry and learning data management techniques for natural resources information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energistics.org/regulatory/national-data-repository-ndr-work-group/ndr-meetings NDR Conference page on the Energistics website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society of Exploration Geophysicists and The International Oil and Gas Producers Association===
The SEG is the custodian of the SEG standards which are used for the exchange, retention and release of seismic data.  They are commonly used by National Data Repositories with the SEGD and SEGY being the field and processed exchange standards respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14124">'''Network Centric Product Support (NCPS)''' is an early application of an [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) computer architecture developed to leverage new information technologies and global networks to assist in managing maintenance, support and supply chain of complex products made up of one or more complex systems, such as in a mobile aircraft fleet or fixed location assets such as in building systems. This is accomplished by establishing digital threads connecting the physical deployed subsystem with its design [[Digital Twins]] virtual model by embedding intelligence through networked micro-[[web servers]] that also function as a computer [[workstation]] within each subsystem component (i.e. [[Engine control unit]] on an aircraft) or other controller and enabling 2-way communications using existing [[Internet]] technologies and communications networks - thus allowing for the extension of a [[product lifecycle]] management (PLM) system into a mobile, deployed product at the subsystem level in real time. NCPS can be considered to be the support flip side of [[Network-centric warfare]], as this approach goes beyond traditional logistics and aftermarket support functions by taking a [[complex adaptive system]] management approach and integrating field maintenance and logistics in a unified factory and field environment. Its evolution began out of insights gained by CDR Dave Loda (USNR) from Network Centric Warfare-based fleet battle experimentation at the US Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) in the late 1990s, who later lead commercial research efforts of NCPS in aviation at United Technologies Corporation. Interaction with the MIT [[Auto-ID Labs]], [[EPCglobal]], the Air Transport Association of America [[ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200]] and other consortium pioneering the emerging machine to machine [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) architecture contributed to the evolution of NCPS.

==Purpose==
Simply put, this architecture extends the existing World Wide Web infrastructure of networked web servers down into the product at its subsystem's controller level using a [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] "system of systems" nested approach. Its core is an embedded dual function webserver/computer workstation connected to the product controller's test ports (as used in retrofit applications, or integrated directly into the controller for new products), hence providing access to operational cycles, sensor and other information in a clustered, internet addressable node that allows for local or remote access, and the ability to host remotely reconfigurable software that can collect and process data from its mated subsystem controller onboard and pull in other computing resources throughout the network. It can then establish a localized wireless World Wide Web in and around the product that can be securely connected to by a mechanic with any web browser-equipped handheld independent of the greater World Wide Web, as well as seamlessly integrate into global networks when external wireless communications is available - thus creating data [[Digital Twins]] at the factory, connecting deployed product usage in the [[Product lifecycle]] with constantly updated digital threads. This allows for an integrated approach which enables both offline and online updates to occur. Legacy systems usually require a human to physically connect a laptop to the system controller or a [[Telematics|telematic]] solution to manually collect data and carry it back to a location where it can be later transferred to the factory or to restricted webserver-based download sites for offboard analysis.

The architecture also enables communications with other micro-webservers in its [[Computer cluster]] (i.e. in an aircraft), or to higher level clusters (such as an internet portal managed fleet and flight operations managers), thus enabling access to data resources and personnel and factory engineers at remote office computers through the World Wide Web. As stated previously, the system operates asynchronously, in that it does not have to be always connected to the World Wide Web to function; rather it simply operates locally, then synchronizes two-way information relevant to the subsystem, acting as a [[Gateway (telecommunications)]] on board that connects with other gateways within the network, which can be airborne or on the ground, on an as-needed basis when communications is available. This can be accomplished through a [[Wireless LAN Network]], [[satellite]], [[cellular network]] or other wireless or wired communications capabilities.

Security of the network is critical, and the architecture can utilize standard web security protocols, from [[Public-key cryptography]] to embedded hardware encryption devices.

==Typical Usage==
The extension of the World Wide Web architecture into the product is important to understand, as all decisions for manufacturing of spare parts, scheduling for flights, and other factory OEM and airline operator functions, are driven primarily by what happens to the product in the field (rate of wear and impending failure, primarily). Predicting the rate of wear, and hence the impact on operations and forecasting for producing spare parts in the future, is critical for optimizing operations for all involved. Managing a complex system such as a fleet of aircraft, vehicles or fixed location products can be accomplished in this manner. For example, coupled with technologies such as [[RFID]], the system could track parts from the factory to the aircraft on board, then continue to read the configuration of the subsystem’s replaceable tagged parts, map their configuration to hours run and duty cycles, then process/communicate the projected wear rate through the World Wide Web back to the operator or factory. In this way mechanical wear rates and future failures can be predicted more accurately and the forecasting of spare parts manufacturing and shipment can be significantly improved. This is called [[Prognostics]] Health Monitoring (PHM), which has become possible in recent years with the advent of electronic controllers, and is a recent evolutionary step in aircraft support and maintenance management that began as individual processes prior to World War II and solidified into a manual tracking system to support aircraft fleets in the Korean War. Support for the mechanic comes in local wireless access to technical information stored and remotely updated on board the micro-webserver component relevant to that product, such as service bulletins, factory updates, fault code driven, intelligent 3D computer game-like maintenance procedures, and social media applications for sharing of product issues and maintenance procedure improvements in the field to include collaborative 2-way voice, text and image communications. Note that this architecture can be utilized on any system that requires monitoring and trending, to include mobile medical applications for monitoring functionality of human systems when the subject is equipped with data sensors.

==Background and Other Examples==
The original micro-webserver component (i. e. the onboard unit) that is key to enabling the NCPS architecture was first prototyped and demonstrated in 2001 by David Loda, Enzo Macchia, Sam Quadri and Bjorn Stickling at United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney division and initially tested on board a [[Fairchild-Dornier 328]] (later AvCraft 328) regional jet in January 2002. It was introduced to the public and demonstrated at the [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough Air Show]] in July 2002 in prototype form and again in 2004 as a flight certified product offering marketed by United Technologies as the DTU and later FAST data management units for service in a number of aircraft and helicopter fleets.

A similar complex systems approach in a completely different application is successfully embodied in the Eisenhower [[Interstate Highway System]], though what is transported in NCPS is information, not cars and trucks. Network Centric Product Support, or net-centric product support, is an architectural concept, and merely connects the major avenues already existing in global communications and the internet down into the mobile product, extending maintenance and supply chain processes into an integrated product centric system with a real time [[Feedback|feedback loop]] to the designers, factory and maintainers as to product performance and reliability. For example, to gain information about a particular engine on a mobile aircraft, it is most efficient to send the inquiry to the engine directly and host all information generated and relevant to that system there, as well synchronize in a twin remote database for access and queuing when the engine system is not in communications. Other examples where this can be applied include shipping containers, automobiles, spacecraft, appliances, human medical monitoring, or any other complex product with sensors and subsystems that require maintenance support and monitoring.

Many organizations are beginning to see the value of a [[netcentric]] (also spelled "net-centric") approach to managing complex systems, including the [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] (NCOIC), which is an association of leading aerospace and defense contractors in the Network Centric Warfare arena. Network Centric thinking for aircraft operations, including Network Enabled Operations (NEO) demonstrations, also figure prominently in the commercial [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] (NextGen) approach being made by the US Government to revamping air transportation management in the 21st Century.

The '''Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk''' is an [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]] (UAV) [[surveillance aircraft]]. It was initially designed by [[Ryan Aeronautical]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman]]), and known as '''Tier II+''' during development. The Global Hawk performs duties similar to that of the [[Lockheed U-2]]. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) and long-range electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long [[Loiter (aeronautics)|loiter]] times over target areas. It can survey as much as {{convert|40000|sqmi|sqkm|-4}} of terrain a day, which is an area the size of [[South Korea]] or [[Iceland]].

The Global Hawk is operated by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). It is used as a [[high-altitude platform]] covering the spectrum of [[intelligence collection]] capability to support forces in worldwide military operations. According to the USAF, the superior surveillance capabilities of the aircraft allow more precise weapons targeting and better protection of friendly forces. Cost overruns led to the original plan to acquire 63 aircraft being cut to 45, and to a 2013 proposal to mothball the 21 [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system#Block number|Block]] 30 [[signals intelligence]] variants.&lt;ref name=GAO-13-294SP/&gt; Each aircraft was to cost US$60.9 million in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2006/5/1/2006may--soaring-costs-not-likely-to-slow-down-global-hawk "Soaring Costs Not Likely to Slow Down Global Hawk"]. ''National Defence Magazine'', May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but this had risen to $222.7 million per aircraft (including development costs) by 2013.&lt;ref name=GAO-13-294SP/&gt; The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] has developed the Global Hawk into the [[Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton|MQ-4C Triton]] maritime surveillance platform.

==Development==

===Origins===
{{expand section|development, context, and history of the design; this article is focused almost entirely on events after 2006–2008.|date=July 2014}}

The Global Hawk took its first flight on 28 February 1998.&lt;ref name=100K_flt_hrs/&gt; The first seven aircraft were built under the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, sponsored by [[DARPA]],&lt;ref name="NASA Global Hawk"/&gt; in order to evaluate the design and demonstrate its capabilities. Demand for the RQ-4's abilities was high in the Middle East; thus, the prototype aircraft were actively operated by the USAF in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. In an unusual move, the aircraft entered initial low-rate production while still in engineering and manufacturing development. Nine production Block 10 aircraft, sometimes referred to as RQ-4A, were produced; of these, two were sold to the US Navy and an additional two were deployed to [[Iraq]] to support operations there. The final Block 10 aircraft was delivered on 26 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Last_Block_10_Global_Hawk_Arrives_For_Check_Flights.html "Last Block 10 Global Hawk Arrives For Check Flights"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to increase the aircraft's capabilities, the airframe was redesigned, with the nose section and wings being stretched. The modified aircraft, designated RQ-4B Block 20,&lt;ref name=USAF_fact_sheet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104516/rq-4-global-hawk.aspx |title= RQ-4 Global Hawk fact sheet |publisher=US Air Force |date= |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; can carry up to 3,000&amp;nbsp;lb (1,360&amp;nbsp;kg) of internal payload. These changes were introduced with the first Block 20 aircraft, the 17th Global Hawk produced, which was rolled out in a ceremony on 25 August 2006.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Northrop unveils next generation Global Hawk", ''[[Aerotech News and Review]]'', 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; First flight of the Block 20 from the USAF [[Plant 42]] in [[Palmdale, California]] to [[Edwards Air Force Base]] took place on 1 March 2007. Developmental testing of Block 20 took place in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Chris, "Global Hawk in demand, passes 10,000 flight hours milestone", ''Aerotech News and Review'', 11 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy]] took delivery of two of the Block 10 aircraft to evaluate their [[Maritime patrol|maritime surveillance]] capabilities, designated N-1 (BuNo 166509) and N-2 (BuNo 166510).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=79851 Northrop Grumman Press Release], 13 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial navalised example was tested at Edwards Air Force Base briefly, before moving to [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|NAS Patuxent River]] in March 2006 for the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program, operated by Navy squadron [[VX-20]].&lt;ref name="avweek_20041001"&gt;Selinger, M.

Copeland|work=defenselink.mil|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the GHMD aircraft flew in the Rim of the Pacific ([[RIMPAC]]) exercise for the first time; although it was in the vicinity of [[Hawaii]], the aircraft was operated from NBVC Point Mugu, requiring flights of approximately {{convert|2500|mi|km|abbr=on}} each way to the area. Four flights were performed, resulting in over 24 hours of persistent maritime surveillance coordinated with {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}} and {{USS|Bonhomme Richard|LHD-6|6}}. For the GHMD program, the Global Hawk was tasked with maintaining maritime situational awareness, contact tracking, and imagery support of exercise operations. Images were transmitted to NAS Patuxent River for processing and then forwarded to the fleet off Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;"Navy Global Hawk Performs in RIMPAC", ''Aerotech News and Review'', 18 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northrop Grumman entered a RQ-4B variant in the US Navy's [[Broad Area Maritime Surveillance]] (BAMS) UAV competition. On 22 April 2008, it was announced that Northrop Grumman's ''RQ-4N'' had won and that the Navy had awarded a US$1.16 billion contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11856|title=Defense.gov News Release: Navy Awards Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aircraft System Contract|work=defenselink.mil|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the RQ-4N was officially designated the ''MQ-4C''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navair.navy.mil/press_releases/index.cfm?fuseaction=press_release_view&amp;press_release_id=4402&amp;site_id=13 BAMS given MQ-4C designation]&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy MQ-4C differs from the Air Force RQ-4 mainly in its wing. While the Global Hawk remains at high altitude to conduct surveillance, the Triton climbs to 50,000&amp;nbsp;ft to see a wide area and can drop to 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft to get further identification of a target. The Triton's wings are specially designed to take the stresses of rapidly decreasing altitude. Though similar in appearance to the Global Hawk's wings, the Triton's internal wing structure is much stronger and has additional features including anti-icing capabilities and impact and lightning strike protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usni.org/2014/02/21/trition-testing-ahead-schedule Triton Testing Ahead of Schedule] - News.USNI.org, 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost increases and procurement===
Development [[cost overrun]]s placed the Global Hawk at risk of cancellation. In mid-2006, per-unit costs were 25% over baseline estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies as well as to increase its capabilities. This caused concern over a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified.&lt;ref name="FlightglobalCostOverrunsPutGlobalHawkAtRisk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/cost-overruns-put-global-hawk-at-risk-206015/|accessdate=22 October 2006|publisher=[[Flightglobal]]|date=18 April 2006|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbac.co.uk/community/cms/content/preview/news_item_view.asp?i=10233&amp;t=0 "Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928053842/http://www.sbac.co.uk/community/cms/content/preview/news_item_view.asp?i=10233&amp;t=0 |date=28 September 2007}}, SBAC.com&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2006, the program was restructured. Completion of an operational assessment report by the USAF was delayed from August 2005-November 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays. The operational assessment report was released in March 2007 and production of the 54 air vehicles planned was extended by two years to 2015.&lt;ref name="FlightglobalGlobalHawkCostsSoarTo10Bn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Hawk costs soar to $10bn|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-hawk-costs-soar-to-10bn-210621/|accessdate=22 November 2006|publisher=[[Flightglobal]]|date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RQ-4 Global Hawk.jpg|thumb|left|A maintenance crew preparing a Global Hawk at [[Beale Air Force Base]]]]
In February 2011, the USAF reduced its planned purchase of RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft from 22 to 11 in order to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;Putrich, Gayle. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/02/22/353512/northrop-global-hawk-not-slowing-down-even-with-cuts.html "Northrop: Global Hawk not slowing down even with cuts"]. ''Flight International'', 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the U.S. Defense Department's [[Director, Operational Test and Evaluation]] (DOT&amp;E) found the RQ-4B "not operationally effective" due to reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-06/pentagon-says-northrop-s-global-hawk-drone-isn-t-effective-.html "Pentagon Says Northrop Drone Isn’t ‘Effective’."] Bloomberg News, 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the Global Hawk was certified by the Secretary of Defense as critical to national security following a breach of the [[Nunn-McCurdy Amendment]]; the Secretary stated: "The Global Hawk is essential to national security; there are no alternatives to Global Hawk which provide acceptable capability at less cost; Global Hawk costs $220M less per year than the U-2 to operate on a comparable mission; the U-2 cannot simultaneously carry the same sensors as the Global Hawk; and if funding must be reduced, Global Hawk has a higher priority over other programs."&lt;ref&gt;"Nunn-McCurdy Certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum for the Restructured RQ-4A/B Unmanned Aircraft System Global Hawk." Memorandum for Secretary of the Air Force, 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2012, the Pentagon announced plans to end Global Hawk Block 30 procurement as the type was found to be more expensive to operate and with less capable sensors than the existing U-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/news/Defense_Budget_Priorities.pdf "Defense Budget Priorities and Choices", p. 11].

From 2010-2013, costs of flying the RQ-4 fell by more than 50%. In 2010, the cost per flight hour was $40,600, with contractor logistic support making up $25,000 per flight hour of this figure. By mid-2013, cost per flight hour dropped to $18,900, contractor logistic support having dropped to $11,000 per flight hour. This was in part due to higher usage, spreading logistics and support costs over a higher number of flight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2013/09/25052/cost-of-flying-northrops-global-hawk-down-over-50-sources/ Cost of flying Northrop’s Global Hawk down over 50% sources] - sUASNews.com, 14 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===EuroHawk===

The [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') ordered a variant of the RQ-4B, to be equipped with a customized sensor suite, designated ''EuroHawk''. The aircraft was based on the RQ-4B Block 20/30/40 and was to be equipped with an [[EADS]]-built [[Signal intelligence|SIGINT]] package; it was intended to fulfill Germany's requirement to replace their aging [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault-Breguet]] [[Breguet Atlantique|Atlantique]] electronic surveillance aircraft of the [[Marineflieger]] (''German Naval Air Arm''). The EADS sensor package is composed of six wing-mounted pods;&lt;ref name=DID_RQ-4_EuroHawk&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/euro-hawk-program-cleared-for-takeoff-03051/ |title=RQ-4 Euro Hawk UAV Readying for Takeoff |date= 15 May 2013 |work=Defense Industry Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly these sensor pods could potentially be used on other platforms, including manned aircraft.&lt;ref name= "flight canc may 2013"/&gt;

===Universal Payload Adapter and new payloads===
In January 2014, President Obama signed a budget that included a $10 million study on adapting the U-2's superior sensors for the RQ-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140126/DEFREG02/301260027 |title=Global Hawk Wins in 2015 Request, Sources Say |last1=MEHTA |first1=AARON |date=26 January 2014 |website= defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media Corporation |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Northrop Grumman reportedly installed the U-2's [[KA-80 Optical Bar Camera|Optical Bar Camera]] (OBC) and [[Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System]] (SYERS-2B/C) sensors onto the RQ-4 using a Universal Payload Adapter (UPA). Successful testing indicated that all RQ-4s could be similarly retrofitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/article/51076/northrop-grumman-to-test-u-2-sensors-on-global-hawk "Northrop Grumman to test U-2 sensors on Global Hawk"]. "IHS Janes 360", 29 April 2015. Retrieved 8 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2015, Northrop Grumman and the USAF signed an agreement to demonstrate an RQ-4B fitted with the U-2's OBC and SYERS-2C sensors; two Global Hawks are to be fitted with the UPA, involving the installation of 17 payload adapter fixtures and a new payload bay cover, as well as software and mission system changes for each sensor. The UPA can support {{convert|1,200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of sensors and will create a canoe-shaped sensor bay on the fuselage's underside.  The RQ-4's ability to operate these sensors will likely influence the U-2's planned retirement by 2019.

===Overview===
The Global Hawk UAV system comprises the RQ-4 air vehicle, which is outfitted with various equipment such as sensor packages and communication systems; and a ground element consisting of a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and a Mission Control Element (MCE) with ground communications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/globalhawk_gs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307140855/http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/globalhawk_gs/ |archivedate=7 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each RQ-4 air vehicle is powered by an [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Allison Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007|AE3007H]] [[turbofan]] engine with {{convert|7,050|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust, and carries a payload of {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=off}}. The fuselage comprises an aluminum, semi-monocoque construction with [[V-tail]]; the wings are made of composite materials.{{specify|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.northropgrumman.com/products/ghrq4b/index.html|accessdate=2010-08-16|title=RQ-4 Block 20 Global Hawk|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522114647/http://www.as.northropgrumman.com/products/ghrq4b/index.html|archivedate=22 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several iterations of the Global Hawk with different features and capabilities. The first version to be used operationally was the RQ-4A Block 10, which performed [[imagery intelligence]] (IMINT) with a {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} payload of a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) with [[electro-optics|electro-optical]] (EO) and [[infrared camera|infrared]] (IR) sensors; seven A-model Block 10s were delivered and all were retired by 2011. The RQ-4B Block 20 was the first of the B-model Global Hawks, which has a greater {{convert|3,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} payload and employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors; four Block 20s were converted into communications relays with the [[Battlefield Airborne Communications Node]] (BACN) payload. The RQ-4B Block 30 is capable of multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting with SAR and EO/IR sensors along with the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), a wide-spectrum SIGINT sensor. The RQ-4B Block 40 is equipped with the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar, which provides SAR and [[moving target indication]] (MTI) data for wide-area surveillance of stationary and moving targets.&lt;ref name=USAF_fact_sheet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bga-aeroweb.com/Defense/RQ-4-Global-Hawk.html RQ-4 Global Hawk &amp; MQ-4C Triton] - Bga-Aeroweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the RQ-4 is capable of conducting sorties lasting up to 30 hours long, scheduled maintenance has to be performed sooner than on other aircraft with less endurance.  However, since it flies at higher altitudes than normal aircraft, it experiences less wear during flight.&lt;ref name="dvids24sept15"&gt;[https://www.dvidshub.net/news/177042/global-hawk-maintainers-deliver-isr-capability-warfighters#.VgRJwDeFOM8 Global Hawk maintainers deliver ISR capability to warfighters] - Dvidshub.net, 24 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===System and ground facilities===
[[Raytheon]]'s Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) consists of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electro-optical (EO), and thermographic camera (IR) sensors. Either the EO or the IR sensors can operate simultaneously with the SAR. Each sensor provides wide area search imagery and a high-resolution spot mode. The SAR has a [[moving target indication|ground moving target indicator (GMTI)]] mode, which can provide a text message providing the moving target's position and velocity. Both SAR and EO/IR imagery are transmitted from the aircraft to the MCE as individual frames, and reassembled during ground processing. An onboard inertial navigation system, supplemented by [[Global Positioning System]] updates, comprises the navigational suite.

Global Hawk is capable to operate autonomously and "[[Untethered device|untethered]]". A [[military satellite]] system ([[X Band Satellite Communication]]) is used for sending data from the aircraft to the MCE. The common data link can also be used for direct down link of imagery when the UAV is within line-of-sight of compatible ground stations.  For dense flight areas the autonomous navigation is switched off and the RQ-4 is remote controlled via the satellite link by pilots on the ground who are supplied with the same instrument data and who carry the same responsibilities as pilots in manned planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmag.com/pilot-reports/turboprops/remote-control-flying-predator flyingmag.com: Remote Control: Flying a Predator - How Will Unmanned Airplanes Fit Into Our Airspace System?], Lane Wallace, December 2, 2009, retrieved February 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ground segment]] consists of a [[mission control center|Mission Control Element]] (MCE) and Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), provided by Raytheon. The MCE is used for mission planning, [[command and control]], and [[image processing]] and dissemination; an LRE for controlling launch and recovery; and associated ground support equipment. The LRE provides precision [[Differential GPS]] corrections for navigational accuracy during takeoff and landings, while precision coded GPS supplemented with an [[inertial navigation system]] is used during mission execution. By having separable elements in the ground segment, the MCE and the LRE can operate in geographically separate locations, and the MCE can be deployed with the supported command's primary exploitation site. Both ground segments are contained in military shelters with external antennas for line-of-sight and [[satellite communication]]s with the air vehicles.

===Sensor packages===

==== Radar ====
{{main article|Airborne ground surveillance}}

The Global Hawk carries the Hughes Integrated Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (HISAR) sensor system.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Radar-and-Electronic-Warfare-Systems/Hughes-Integrated-Surveillance-And-Reconnaissance-HISAR-TM-radar-United-States.html Hughes Integrated Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (HISAR)]". Jane's Information Group&lt;/ref&gt; HISAR is a lower-cost derivative of the ASARS-2 package that Hughes developed for the U-2. It is also fitted in the US Army's [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7|RC-7B]] Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARLM) manned aircraft, and is being sold on the international market. HISAR integrates a [[Synthetic aperture radar|SAR]]-[[Moving target indication|MTI]] system, along with an optical and an [[thermography]] imager. All three sensors are controlled and their outputs filtered by a common processor and transmitted in real time at up to 50 Mbit/s to a ground station. The SAR-MTI system operates in the [[X band]] in various operational modes; such as the wide-area MTI mode with a radius of {{convert|62|mi|km|abbr=on}}, combined SAR-MTI strip mode provides {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} resolution over {{convert|23|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide sections, and a SAR spot mode providing {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} resolution over {{convert|3.8|mi2|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

In July 2006, the USAF began testing the Global Hawk Block 30 upgrades in the [[Benefield Anechoic Facility]] at Edwards AFB; such as the Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload, an extremely sensitive SIGINT processor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 2006, a specialist AESA radar system, the [[Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program]], or MP-RTIP, began testing on the [[Scaled Composites Proteus]]; one modified Global Hawk shall carry the radar following validation. In 2010, Northrop spoke on the sensor capabilities of the new Block 40 aircraft, including MP-RTIP radar, emphasising surveillance over reconnaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/16/346116/next-generation-of-global-hawks-ready-to-roll.html |accessdate=2010-08-16 |title=Next generation of Global Hawks ready to roll }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2014, a Block 40 Global Hawk completed the first [[Maritime patrol|Maritime Modes]] program risk reduction flight to enhance the Air Force's maritime surveillance capabilities. Maritime Modes is made up of a Maritime Moving Target Indicator and a Maritime [[Inverse synthetic aperture radar]] (MISAR) that function together to provide ISR information on vessels traveling on the water's surface. During the 11.5 hour flight off of the California coast, the MISAR collected data on over 100 items of interest.  Maritime Modes is planned to be integrated with the RQ-4B's existing MP-RTIP radar to detect and produce synthetic aperture [[radar imagery]] of ground vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/484403/air-force-tests-new-surveillance-capability.aspx Air Force tests new surveillance capability] - AF.mil, 28 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Northrop Grumman selected the [[Garmin International]] GSX 70 weather radar to be installed on Air Force Global Hawks.  The GSX 70 is designed to provide operators with real-time weather information, offering horizontal scan angles of up to 120 degrees for better visibility into the strength and intensity of convective activity and a vertical scanning mode to analyze storm tops, gradients, and cell buildup activity.  It also has a Turbulence Detection feature to identify turbulence in air containing precipitation and other airborne particulates and Ground Clutter Suppression that removes ground returns from the display so operators can focus on weather.  Installation is expected to begin in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-technology.com/news/newsnorthrop-selects-garmin-weather-radar-for-rq-4-global-hawk-4720415 Northrop selects Garmin weather radar for RQ-4 Global Hawk] - Airforce-Technology.com, 16 November 2015{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visible light/infrared ====
The visible and infrared imagers share the same gimballed sensor package, and use common optics, providing a telescopic close-up capability. It can be optionally fitted with an auxiliary SIGINT package. To improve survivability, the Global Hawk is fitted with a Raytheon developed [[AN/ALR-89]] self-protection suite consisting of the AN/AVR-3 [[Laser warning receiver]], AN/APR-49 [[Radar warning receiver]] and a jamming system. An [[ALE-50|ALE-50 towed decoy]] also aids in the deception of enemy air defenses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Aerotech News and Review'', vol 21, issue 27, 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/jetds/an-alq2aly.html|title=AN/ALQ to AN/ALT - Equipment Listing|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force===
Following the [[September 11th attacks]], the normal acquisition process was bypassed almost immediately and early developmental Global Hawk models were employed in overseas contingency operations beginning in November 2001.&lt;ref name="dvids24sept15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/auvsi-global-hawk-achieves-usaf-milestone-411965/ Global Hawk achieves USAF milestone] - Flightglobal.com, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Global Hawk ATCD prototypes were used in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and in the [[Iraq War]]. Since April 2010, they fly the Northern Route, from [[Beale Air Force Base]] over Canada to South-East Asia and back, reducing flight time and improving maintenance. While their data-collection capabilities have been praised, the program lost three prototype aircraft to accidents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2003/5/1/2003may-global-hawk-crashes-whos-to-blame Global Hawk Crashes: Who’s to Blame?].

The crashes were reported to be due to "technical failures or poor maintenance", with a failure rate per hour flown over 100 times higher than the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighter. Northrop Grumman stated that it was unfair to compare the failure rates of a mature design to that of a prototype aircraft. In June 2012, a media report described the Global Hawk, the [[MQ-1 Predator]] and the [[MQ-9 Reaper]]s "...&amp;nbsp;the most accident-prone aircraft in the Air Force fleet."&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, Brendan (18 June 2012) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-18/drones-most-accident-prone-u-s-air-force-craft-bgov-barometer.html Drones Most Accident-Prone U.S. Air Force Craft: BGOV Barometer].

On 22 March 2008, a Global Hawk set the endurance record for full-scale, operational unmanned aircraft UAVs by flying for 33.1 hours at altitudes up to 60,000&amp;nbsp;feet over Edwards AFB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Northrop_Grumman_Global_Hawk_Unmanned_Aircraft_Sets_33_Hour_Flight_Endurance_Record_999.html|title=Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Sets 33-Hour Flight Endurance Record|work=spacewar.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its first flight in 1998 to 9 September 2013, the combined Global Hawk fleet flew 100,000 hours. 88 percent of flights were conducted by USAF RQ-4s, while the remaining hours were flown by [[NASA]] Global Hawks, the EuroHawk, the Navy BAMS demonstrator, and the MQ-4C Triton. Approximately 75 percent of flights were in combat zones; RQ-4s flew in operations over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya; and supported disaster response efforts in Haiti, Japan, and California.&lt;ref name=100K_flt_hrs&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/northrop-grumman-unmanned-aircraft-systems-achieve-100000-flight-hours-l-photos/ Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aircraft Systems Achieve 100,000 Flight Hours] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northropgrumman.com/MediaResources/Pages/NewsArticle.aspx?art=http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/xml/nitf.html?d=10047896 Northrop Grumman Unmanned Portfolio Achieves 100,000 Flight Hours Over Last 15 Years] - Northrop Grumman news release, 9 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From 10–16 September 2014, the RQ-4 fleet flew a total of 781 hours, the most hours flown by the type during a single week. 87 percent of flights were made by USAF RQ-4s, with the rest flown by the Navy BAMS-D and NASA hurricane research aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/rq-4-global-hawk-other-hale-uas-series-variants-fl/ Global Hawk flies record mission hours] - Shephardmedia.com, 9 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA Dryden Global Hawk.jpg|thumb|A Global Hawk at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center]]

In December 2007, two Global Hawks were transferred from the USAF to NASA's [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] at Edwards AFB. Initial research activities beginning in the second quarter of 2009 supported NASA's high-altitude, long-duration Earth science missions.&lt;ref name=dfrc1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/aircraft/GlobalHawk/index.html NASA DFRC web description of aircraft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302063302/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/aircraft/GlobalHawk/index.html |date=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fg0123/&gt; The two Global Hawks were the first and sixth aircraft built under the original DARPA Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program, and were made available to NASA when the Air Force had no further need for them.&lt;ref name="NASA Global Hawk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=24341|title=NASA Dryden Receives Two Early Global Hawk Aircraft |work=spaceref.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northrop Grumman is an operational partner with NASA and will use the aircraft to demonstrate new technologies and to develop new markets for the aircraft, including possible civilian uses.&lt;ref name=fg0123&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/01/22/321498/northrop-plans-civilian-market-global-hawk-demonstrations.html|title=Northrop plans civilian market Global Hawk demonstrations|author=Reed Business Information Limited|publisher=flightglobal.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in the March 2010 issue of [[Scientific American]] (p.&amp;nbsp;25-27), NASA's Global Hawks were expected to begin scientific missions that month, and had been undergoing tests in late 2009. Initial science applications included measurements of the ozone layer and cross-Pacific transport of air pollutants and aerosols; the author of the Scientific American piece speculates that it could be used for Antarctic exploration while being based in Chile. In August–September 2010, one of the two Global Hawks was loaned for NASA's GRIP Mission (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Program).&lt;ref name="NASA GRIP Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grip.nsstc.nasa.gov/|title=GRIP|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=1 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030174641/http://grip.nsstc.nasa.gov/|archivedate=30 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its long-term on station capabilities and long range made it a suitable aircraft for monitoring the development of Atlantic basin [[Tropical Cyclone|Hurricanes]].

In 2009, NATO announced that it expected to have a fleet of up to eight Global Hawks by 2012 to be equipped with MP-RTIP radar systems. NATO had budgeted US$1.4 billion (€1 billion) for the project, and a letter of intent was signed.&lt;ref name=fg090114&gt;Trimble, Stephen.

Australia considered the purchase of a number of Global Hawks for maritime and land surveillance. The Global Hawk was to be assessed against the [[MQ-9 Reaper#Naval version|MQ-9 Mariner]] in trials in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/05/09/Navigation/177/206472/Australia+funds+study.html Australia funds study]. Flight International 09/05/06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Hawk aircraft would have operated in conjunction with manned [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon]] aircraft, as a replacement of aging [[AP-3C Orion]] aircraft. In the end, the Australian government decided not to proceed and canceled the order.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/03/2505653.htm?section=australia Govt scraps plan for military drones]"{{spaced ndash}}ABC news&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a procurement effort for seven UAVs by 2019 was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-09-04/australia-moves-to-buy-3b-spy-drone-fleet/1010380|title=Australia moves to buy $3b spy drone fleet|publisher=radioaustralia.net.au|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 the Australian government confirmed its interest in acquiring the MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2013/05/australia-issues-triton-letter-of-request/|title=Australia issues Triton Letter of Request|publisher=australianaviation.com.au|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canada]] has also been a potential customer, looking at the Global Hawk for maritime and land surveillance as either a replacement for its fleet of [[CP-140 Aurora]] patrol aircraft or to supplement manned patrols of remote Arctic and maritime environments, before withdrawing from the joint effort in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trimble|first=Stephen|title=AUVSI: Canada withdraws from NATO RQ-4 program|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/08/18/360927/auvsi-canada-withdraws-from-nato-rq-4-program.html|accessdate=18 August 2011|publisher=Flightglobal|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]] has a similar requirement, and has existing contacts with Northrop Grumman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/empresas/Northrop/negocia/venta/aviones/espia/Espana/cdscdi/20070929cdscdiemp_15/Tes/ Northrop negocia la venta de diez aviones espía a España] CincoDias.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11558">A '''numerically controlled oscillator''' ('''NCO''') is a digital [[signal generator]] which creates a [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous]] (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued representation of a [[waveform]], usually [[sinusoidal]].&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Radatz |first=J. |title=The IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms |publisher=IEEE Standards Office |location=New York, NY |year=1997 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCOs are often used in conjunction with a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) at the output to create a [[direct digital synthesizer]] (DDS).{{#tag:ref|While some authors use the terms DDS and NCO interchangeably,&lt;ref name="latticeSC" /&gt; by convention an NCO refers to the digital (i.e. the discrete-time, discrete amplitude) portion of a DDS&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt;}}

Numerically controlled oscillators offer several advantages over other types of oscillators in terms of agility, accuracy, stability and reliability.&lt;ref name="latticeSC"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Numerically Controlled Oscillator | url = http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/IntellectualProperty/IPCore/IPCores02/NumericallyControlledOscillator.aspx | publisher = Lattice Semiconductor Corporation | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital PLLs, radar systems, drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and multilevel [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]/[[Phase-shift keying|PSK]] modulators/demodulators.&lt;ref name="latticeSC"/&gt;

==Operation==

An NCO generally consists of two parts: 
*A ''phase accumulator'' (PA), which adds to the value held at its output a frequency control value at each clock sample.
*A ''phase-to-amplitude converter'' (PAC), which uses the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform [[look-up table]] (LUT) to provide a corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes [[linear interpolation|interpolation]] is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as [[power series]] can be used, particularly in a software NCO.

[[Image:Generic NCO.png|frame|Figure 1: Numerically controlled oscillator with optional quadrature output]]

When clocked, the phase accumulator (PA) creates a [[modulo operation|modulo]]-2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; [[sawtooth wave]]form which is then converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N is the number of bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC [[look-up table]]. If the PAC capacity is 2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.&lt;ref name="kroupa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kroupa |first=V. F. |title=Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizers |publisher=IEEE Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-7803-3438-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency accuracy relative to the clock frequency is limited only by the precision of the arithmetic used to compute the phase.&lt;ref name="kroupa"/&gt; NCOs are phase- and frequency-agile, and can be trivially modified to produce a [[phase modulation|phase-modulated]] or [[frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] output by summation at the appropriate node, or provide [[quadrature phase|quadrature]] outputs as shown in the figure.

==Phase accumulator==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Phase accumulator]] --&gt;
A binary phase accumulator consists of an N-bit binary [[adder (electronics)|adder]] and a [[hardware register|register]] configured as shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref name="Grzeg"/&gt; Each clock cycle produces a new N-bit output consisting of the previous output obtained from the register summed with the frequency control word (FCW) which is constant for a given output frequency. The resulting output waveform is a staircase with step size &lt;math&gt;\Delta F&lt;/math&gt;, the integer value of the FCW.&lt;ref name="ADI"/&gt; In some configurations, the phase output is taken from the output of the register which introduces a one clock cycle [[latency (engineering)|latency]] but allows the adder to operate at a higher clock rate.&lt;ref name="latticeSC"/&gt; 
[[Image:Phase Accum Graph.png|frame|Figure 2: Normalized phase accumulator output]]

The adder is designed to overflow when the sum of the [[absolute value]] of its operands exceeds its capacity (2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;−1). The overflow bit is discarded so the output word width is always equal to its input word width. The remainder &lt;math&gt;\phi _n&lt;/math&gt;, called the residual, is stored in the register and the cycle repeats, starting this time from &lt;math&gt;\phi _n&lt;/math&gt; (see figure 2).&lt;ref name="Grzeg"/&gt; Since a phase accumulator is a [[finite state machine]], eventually the residual at some sample K must return to the initial value &lt;math&gt;\phi _0&lt;/math&gt;. The interval K is referred to as the grand repetition rate (GRR) given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{GRR}=\frac{2^N}{\mbox{GCD}(\Delta F,2^N)}&lt;/math&gt;

where GCD is the [[greatest common divisor]] function. The GRR represents the true periodicity for a given &lt;math&gt;\Delta F&lt;/math&gt; which for a high resolution NCO can be very long.&lt;ref name="Grzeg"/&gt; Usually we are more interested in the ''operating frequency'' determined by the average overflow rate, given by&lt;ref name="ADI"&gt;{{citation |last1=Murphy |first1=Eva |last2=Slattery |first2=Colm |url=http://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/38-08/dds.html |title=All About Direct Digital Synthesis |journal=Analog Dialogue |volume=38 |date=August 2004 |publisher=Analog Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;F_{out} = \frac{\Delta F}{2^N}F_{clock} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(1)

The ''frequency resolution'', defined as the smallest possible incremental change in frequency, is given by&lt;ref name="ADI"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_{res} = \frac{F_{clock}}{2^N}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(2)

Equation (1) shows that the phase accumulator can be thought of as a programmable non-integer [[frequency divider]] of divide ratio &lt;math&gt;\Delta F/2^N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name= "kroupa"/&gt;

==Phase-to-amplitude converter==
The phase-amplitude converter creates the sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word received from the PA. The PAC can be a simple [[read only memory]] containing 2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed to reduce the amount of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | inventor-last = Miller | inventor-first = B. M. | issue-date = October 14, 2008 | title = Numerically controlled oscillator and method of operation | country-code = US | patent-number = 7437391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; trigonometric approximations&lt;ref name="Grzeg"&gt;{{ cite web | first1 = G. | last1 = Popek | first2 = M. | last2 = Kampik | title = Low-Spur Numerically Controlled Oscillator Using Taylor Series Approximation | url = http://mechatronika.polsl.pl/owd/pdf2009/030.pdf | date = October 2009 | work = XI International PhD Workshop OWD 2009 | publisher = Silesian University of Technology | location = Gliwice, Poland }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | inventor1-last = McCallister | inventor1-first = R. D. | inventor2-last = Shearer | inventor2-first = D. | publication-date = 12/04/1984 | title = Numerically controlled oscillator using quadrant replication and function decomposition | country-code = US | patent-number = 4486846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the PAC may consist of [[random access memory]] which can be filled as desired to create an [[arbitrary waveform generator]].

==Spurious products==
[[Spurious emission|Spurious]] products are the result of [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] or non-harmonic [[distortion]] in the creation of the output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here. For other distortion mechanisms created in the [[digital-to-analog converter]] see the corresponding section in the [[Direct digital synthesizer|direct-digital synthesizer]] article.

===Phase truncation spurs===
The number of phase accumulator bits of an NCO (N) is usually between 16 and 64. If the PA output word were used directly to index the PAC look-up table an untenably high storage capacity in the ROM would be required. As such, the PA output word must be truncated to span a reasonable memory space. Truncation of the phase word causes [[phase modulation]] of the output sinusoid which introduces non-harmonic [[distortion]] in proportion to the number of bits truncated. The number of spurious products created by this distortion is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;n_W=\frac{2^W}{\mbox{GCD}(\Delta F,2^W)}-1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(3)

where W is the number of bits truncated.

In calculating the [[spurious-free dynamic range]], we are interested in the spurious product with the largest amplitude relative to the carrier output level given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta _{max}=2^{-M} \frac{\pi \mbox{GCD}(\Delta F,2^W)}{\sin \left( \pi \cdot 2^{-P}\mbox{GCD}(\Delta F,2^W) \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where P is word width of the DAC. For W &gt;4,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta _{max} \approx -6.02 \cdot P\;\mbox{dBc}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another related spurious generation method is the slight modulation due to the GRR outlined above. The amplitude of these spurs is low for large N and their frequency is generally too low to be detectable but they may cause issues for some applications.&lt;ref name="Grzeg"/&gt;

===Amplitude truncation spurs===
Another source of spurious products is the amplitude [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of the sampled waveform contained in the PAC look up table(s). If the number of DAC bits is P, the
AM spur level is approximately equal to −6.02&amp;nbsp;P − 1.76&amp;nbsp;[[dBc]].&lt;ref name="intersil"&gt;{{ cite web | title = The NCO as a Stable, Accurate Synthesizer | url = http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/tb31/tb318.pdf | id = TB318.1 | publisher = Intersil Corporation | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation techniques===
Phase truncation spurs can be reduced substantially by the introduction of [[White noise|white gaussian noise]] prior to truncation. The so-called [[dither]] noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref name="kroupa"/&gt;

[[File:Mechanical room.jpg|thumb|Large-scale piping system in an [[HVAC]] [[mechanical room]]]]

Within [[industry]], '''piping''' is a system of [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] used to convey [[fluid]]s ([[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es) from one location to another. The [[engineering]] discipline of piping [[design]] studies the efficient transport of fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors: Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W.|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editor: McKetta, John J.|title=Piping Design Handbook|edition= |publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|year=1992|isbn=0-8247-8570-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial process piping (and accompanying in-line components) can be manufactured from [[wood]], [[fiberglass]], [[glass]], [[steel]], [[aluminum]], [[plastic]], [[copper]], and [[concrete]]. The in-line components, known as [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pipe fitting manufacturer|url=https://www.yaang.com/|website=Yaang|accessdate=6 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227001430/http://www.yaang.com/|archivedate=27 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[valves]], and other devices, typically sense and control the [[pressure]], [[Rate of fluid flow|flow rate]] and [[temperature]] of the transmitted fluid, and usually are included in the field of piping design (or piping engineering). Piping systems are documented in [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s (P&amp;IDs). If necessary, pipes can be cleaned by the [[tube cleaning]] process.

''Piping'' sometimes refers to piping design, the detailed specification of the physical piping layout within a process plant or commercial building. In earlier days, this was sometimes called [[Plumbing drawing|drafting]], [[technical drawing]], [[engineering drawing]], and design, but is today commonly performed by designers that have learned to use automated computer-aided drawing or [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software.

[[Plumbing]] is a piping system with which most people are familiar, as it constitutes the form of fluid transportation that is used to provide potable [[water]] and [[Natural gas|fuels]] to their homes and businesses. Plumbing pipes also remove waste in the form of [[sewage]], and allow venting of sewage gases to the outdoors. [[Fire sprinkler]] systems also use piping, and may transport nonpotable or [[potable water]], or other fire-suppression fluids.

Piping also has many other industrial applications, which are crucial for moving raw and semi-processed fluids for refining into more useful products. Some of the more exotic materials used in pipe construction are [[Inconel]], [[titanium]], [[surgical stainless steel|chrome-moly]] and various other steel [[alloy]]s.

==Engineering sub-fields==
Generally, industrial piping engineering has three major sub-fields:
*Piping material
*Piping design
*Stress analysis

==Stress analysis==
Process piping and power piping are typically checked by pipe stress engineers to verify that the routing, nozzle loads, hangers, and supports are properly placed and selected such that allowable pipe stress is not exceeded under different loads such as sustained loads, operating loads, pressure testing loads, etc., as stipulated by the [[ASME]] B31, EN 13480 or any other applicable codes and standards. It is necessary to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the piping under regular loads (internal pressure and thermal stresses) as well under occasional and intermittent loading cases such as earthquake, high wind or special vibration, and water hammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.asme.org/books/PrintBook/Process_Piping_Complete_Guide.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529120337/http://catalog.asme.org/books/PrintBook/Process_Piping_Complete_Guide.cfm |date=29 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060526222921/http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/B311_2004_Power_Piping.cfm Power Piping: ASME B31.1]&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluation is usually performed with the assistance of a specialized ([[Finite element analysis|finite element]]) pipe [[stress analysis]] computer programs such as AutoPIPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/pipe-stress-and-vessel-analysis-software/autopipe|title=Piping Design And Pipe Stress Analysis Software - AutoPIPE|website=www.bentley.com|access-date=2017-12-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109164900/https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/pipe-stress-and-vessel-analysis-software/autopipe|archivedate=9 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAEPIPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sstusa.com/caepipe.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129174331/http://www.sstusa.com/caepipe.php |archivedate=29 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and CAESAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coade.com/products/caesarii/Summary|title=Intergraph CAESAR II - Pipe Stress Analysis|work=coade.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502134547/http://www.coade.com/products/caesarii/Summary|archivedate=2 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cryogenic pipe supports, most steel become more brittle as the temperature decreases from normal operating conditions, so it is necessary to know the temperature distribution for cryogenic conditions. Steel structures will have areas of high stress that may be caused by sharp corners in the design, or inclusions in the material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/technical/pdf/tempstress-cryoshoes.pdf Temperature &amp; Stress Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041202/http://www.pipingtech.com/technical/pdf/tempstress-cryoshoes.pdf |date=22 February 2014 }} Piping Technology and Products, (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The material with which a pipe is manufactured often forms as the basis for choosing any pipe. Materials that are used for manufacturing pipes include:

*[[Carbon steel]]
*ASTM A252 Spec Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 Steel Pile Pipe
*Low temperature service carbon steel
*[[Stainless steel]]
*Nonferrous metals, e.g. [[cupro-nickel]], [[tantalum]] lined, etc.

Early wooden pipes were constructed out of logs that had a large hole bored lengthwise through the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lg-zKE0ETBSw4I8O_RHz5A|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : wooden water pipe|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507123636/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lg-zKE0ETBSw4I8O_RHz5A|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later wooden pipes were constructed with staves and hoops similar to wooden [[barrel]] construction. Stave pipes have the advantage that they are easily transported as a compact pile of parts on a wagon and then assembled as a hollow structure at the job site. Wooden pipes were especially popular in mountain regions where transport of heavy iron or concrete pipes would have been difficult.

Wooden pipes were easier to maintain than metal, because the wood did not expand or contract with temperature changes as much as metal and so consequently expansion joints and bends were not required. The thickness of wood afforded some insulating properties to the pipes which helped prevent freezing as compared to metal pipes. Wood used for water pipes also does not [[Dry rot|rot]] very easily. [[Electrolysis]] doesn't affect wood pipes at all, since wood is a much better electrical insulator.

In the Western United States where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] was used for pipe construction, it was found that redwood had "peculiar properties" that protected it from weathering, acids, insects, and fungus growths. Redwood pipes stayed smooth and clean indefinitely while iron pipe by comparison would rapidly begin to scale and corrode and could eventually plug itself up with the corrosion.&lt;ref name=sci1918&gt;&lt;!--Most of this section is cited from this 1918 Popular Science news article --&gt;{{cite journal|title=Piping water through miles of Redwood|journal=[[Popular Science]]|year=December 1918|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228210710/https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">In [[electronics]], a '''Q multiplier''' is a circuit added to a [[radio receiver]] to improve its selectivity and sensitivity.  It is a [[regenerative circuit|regenerative amplifier]] adjusted to provide [[positive feedback]] within the receiver.  This has the effect of narrowing the receiver's [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], as if the [[Q factor]] of its tuned circuits had been increased. The Q multiplier was a common accessory in shortwave receivers of the [[vacuum tube]] era as either a factory installation or an add-on device. In use, the Q multiplier had to be adjusted to a point just short of oscillation to provide maximum sensitivity and rejection of interfering signals. &lt;ref&gt; Joseph Carr, ''Antenna Toolkit'' Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0080493882}}, page 193 &lt;/ref&gt; 

A Q multiplier could also be adjusted to act as a [[notch filter]], useful for reducing the interfering effect of signals on frequencies near to the desired signal. In some receiver designs, the Q multiplier was made to also serve as a [[beat frequency oscillator]] by adjusting it to oscillate. This could be used for reception of [[single sideband]] or [[continuous wave|Morse radiotelegraphy]], but in that case the circuit no longer provided improved selectivity. &lt;ref&gt; Tony Dorbuck (ed.), ''The Radio Amateur's Handbook, Fifty Fifth Edition'', American Radio Relay League, 1977 no ISBN, p. 259 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The principle of regeneration applied to radio receivers was developed by [[Edwin Armstrong]], who patented a regenerative receiver in 1914.  At least one console-model broadcast [[superheterodyne]] receiver used positive feedback to improve selectivity in a 1926 design. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/Museum/Engineering/Electronics/AJSSymphony/Symphony.htm ''The A.J.S. Symphony Seven Receiver - Inside Out'', retrieved January 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Q-multipliers were common on shortwave general-coverage and communications receivers of the 1950s.  With the advent of crystal and ceramic intermediate frequency filters, the Q-multiplier was no longer popular.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6232">The '''R-390A''' [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|/URR]] is a general coverage [[High frequency|HF]] [[radio]] [[communications receiver]] designed by [[Collins Radio Company]] for the [[US military]].[[Image:R390A.png|thumb|right|250px|R-390A radio receiver]]

==History==
The R-390A [[military]] [[shortwave radio receiver]] was the result of a project undertaken by the U.S. [[Army Signal Corps]] in 1954 to replace the existing R-390 receiver then in use. The R-390 had done its job so well that the Corps decided continued use of this type of receiver necessitated an improved, reduced-cost version. There are many references to the R390A in the open literature during this period; a picture of the receiver appeared in the May 1959 issue of the amateur radio magazine QST.&lt;ref name="Rippel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rippel|first1=Chuck|title=The R390A home on the WWW|url=http://www.r390a.com/html/history.htm|website=The R390A/URR|publisher=r390a.com|accessdate=27 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011719/http://www.r390a.com/html/history.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total production of the R-390A (as determined by the high serial numbers noted) is over 55,000 units. Initial production started in 1955 and ran through approximately 1970, and then was restarted in 1984 by Fowler Industries for Avondale Shipyards. Manufacturers and their approximate production numbers are:&lt;ref name="Rippel" /&gt;

* Collins Radio Company         6,363
* Electronic Assistance Corp   15,338 (includes Dittmore Freimuth marked radios)
* Capehart                      4,242
* Motorola                     14,873
* Stewart Warner                6,631
* Amelco/Teledyne/Imperial      7,958 (these companies were related through acquisitions)
* Fowler Industries                 5

Companies which made spare modules, but not whole sets were Communications Systems Corp., Clavier Corp. and Hacking Labs.

==Design==
The R-390A is a general coverage radio receiver capable of receiving [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]], [[Morse code|code]], and [[frequency shift keying]] signals. Its tuning range is from 500 [[kilohertz]] to 32 [[megahertz]], in 32 one-megahertz bands. The circuit is the [[superheterodyne]] type, double conversion above 8&amp;nbsp;MHz, below which triple conversion is used. It employs 23 [[vacuum tube]]s (6AK6  x	 3, 5654 x 2,  12AU7/5814A  x 4,  26Z5W  x 2,  3TF7  x 1,   6BA6/5749W x 6,   6C4/6100  x 3,   6DC6  x  1,  0A2WA x  1), a larger than normal count for most general-coverage receivers. The receiver weighs 85 pounds and can be operated on 120 volt or 240 volt supplies. It fits neatly into a 10.5&amp;nbsp;inch-tall standard 19&amp;nbsp;inch equipment rack.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WdAXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 Operator's Manual: Radio Receiver R-390A/URR.]''. Headquarters, Department of the Army; 1989. p. 3–.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uNAXAAAAYAAJ Field and Depot Maintenance Manual: Radio Receiver R-390A/URR.]''. Headquarters, Department of the Army; 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuning of the R-390A's radio frequency and [[intermediate frequency]] front end is synchronized by means of an ingenious mechanical system of racks, gears, and cams. When the front panel tuning controls are rotated, this system raises and lowers [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] slugs in and out of the receiver's tuning coils. This ensures that all front-end circuits are tracked, meaning all circuits are tuned to the correct frequency to maintain excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The receiver's construction is modular for easy servicing. Each major area of the receiver is contained in easily removable subassemblies, and these can be repaired or replaced as needs be. Though the R-390A is mechanically and electrically complex, alignment and servicing were designed to follow simplified procedures published by the Signal Corps.&lt;ref name=USA /&gt;

==Use==
The R-390A was deployed to most branches of the US military and remained in general use through the 1980s. The last major update to its documentation was in 1984. As the military procured newer receivers, many R-390As were released to surplus while others were destroyed. Some receivers were retained by the services, however, when they found that the R-390A's vacuum tube circuitry could easily survive an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. There are reports, possibly apocryphal, that R-390A receivers are still in use aboard [[U.S. Navy]] [[submarines]] since the receiver can withstand the strong [[radio frequency]] fields found aboard ship.&lt;ref name="Rippel" /&gt;

Many of the R-390As that exist today are in the hands of [[vintage amateur radio]] collectors and [[amateur radio]] operators who contend that few modern [[solid state electronics|solid state]] communications receivers can equal its performance. There is a wealth of information, both printed and electronic, devoted to R-390A restoration and maintenance, as the R-390A is widely considered an example of the best of [[vacuum tube]] technology.&lt;ref name="Rippel" /&gt;

A '''reciprocal frame''' is a class of self-supporting structure made of three or more beams and which requires no center support to create roofs, bridges or similar structures.

==Construction==
A reciprocal roof is assembled by first installing a temporary central support that holds the first rafter at the correct height. The first rafter is fitted between the wall and the temporary central support and then further rafters are added, each resting on the last. The final rafter fits on top of the previous rafter and under the very first one. The rafters are then tied with wire before the temporary support is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://small-scale.net/yearofmud/2008/11/26/how-to-build-a-reciprocal-roof-frame/|title=How to build a reciprocal roof frame}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of a single element may lead to the failure of the whole structure.

==History==
The reciprocal frame, also known as a [[Mandala]] roof,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zp2hEozZ-oC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=reciprocal+frame+mandala|title=Reciprocal Frame Architecture | isbn=978-0-7506-8263-3 | year=2008 | publisher=Architectural Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used since the twelfth century in [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese [[architecture]] although little or no trace of these ancient methods remain. More recently they were used by architects Kazuhiro Ishii (the Spinning House) and Yasufumi Kijima, and engineer Yoishi Kan
(Kijima Stonemason Museum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Biagio di Carlo|journal=Nexus Network Journal |volume=10|issue=1|page=27|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x2u234l8444p7533/fulltext.pdf?page=1|title=The Wooden Roofs of Leonardo and New Structural Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Villard de Honnecourt]] produced sketches showing similar designs in the 13th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reciprocal Frame Architecture|page=14|isbn=0-7506-8263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar structures were also used in the chapter house of [[Lincoln Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reciprocal Frame Architecture|page=9|isbn=0-7506-8263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josep Maria Jujol]] used this structure in both the Casa Bofarull and Casa Negre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reciprocal Frame Architecture|page=8|isbn=0-7506-8263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sasaki was founded in 1953 by acclaimed landscape architect, [[Hideo Sasaki]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], while he served as a professor and landscape architecture department chair at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/25/arts/hideo-sasaki-80-influential-landscape-architect-dies.html|title=Hideo Sasaki, 80, Influential Landscape Architect, Dies|last=Raver|first=Anne|date=2000-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sasaki partnered with Peter Walker in 1957 the firm became Sasaki, Walker and Associates. In 1959, Walker opened up a new branch of the firm in San Francisco, and in 1964 the Watertown location was renamed Sasaki, Dawnson &amp; DeMay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sasaki, Dawson &amp; DeMay {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://tclf.org/pioneer/sasaki-dawson-demay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''snowshoe''' is [[footwear]] for walking over [[snow]]. Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called "flotation". Snowshoeing is a form of hiking.

Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with [[rawhide (material)|rawhide]] lacings. Some modern snowshoes are similar, but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the [[latticework]], and require bindings to attach them to the feet.

In the past, snowshoes were essential tools for fur traders, [[Animal trapping|trappers]] and anyone whose life or living depended on the ability to get around in areas of deep and frequent snowfall, and they remain necessary equipment for [[Park ranger|forest rangers]] and others who must be able to get around areas inaccessible to motorized vehicles when the snow is deep. However, snowshoes are mainly used today for recreation, primarily by [[hiking|hikers]] and [[running|runners]] who like to continue their hobby in wintertime. Snowshoeing is easy to learn and in appropriate conditions is a relatively safe and inexpensive recreational activity. However, snowshoeing in icy, steep terrain can be more dangerous.

==Development==

===Origins===
[[File:Snow Shoe Maker between ca. 1900-1930.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional snowshoe maker, c. 1900-1930]]
Before people built snowshoes, nature provided examples. Several animals, most notably the [[snowshoe hare]], had [[evolution|evolved]] over the years with oversized feet enabling them to move more quickly through deep snow.

The origin and age of snowshoes are not precisely known, although historians believe they were invented from 4,000 to 6,000 years ago, probably starting in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="refGvsnowshoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvsnowshoes.com/eng/hist_raq.html|title=Raquettes GV - Fabricant de raquettes à neige|work=Raquettes GV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|British]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Jacqui Wood]] hypothesized that the equipment interpreted to be the frame of a backpack of the [[Chalcolithic]] [[mummy]] [[Ötzi]] was actually part of a snowshoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/the_hitch/article516866.ece|title=The Times - UK News, World News and Opinion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] wrote that the inhabitants of the [[Caucasus]] used to attach flat surfaces of leather under their feet and that its inhabitants used round wooden surfaces, something akin to blocks, instead. However, the "traditional" webbed snowshoe as we know it today had direct origins to North American indigenous people, e.g., the Huron, Cree, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snowshoemag.com/2012/06/17/snowshoes-and-the-canadian-first-nations/|title=Snowshoes and the Canadian First Nations|work=Snowshoe Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel de Champlain]] wrote, referencing the Huron and Algonquin First Nations, in his travel memoirs (V.III, pg. 164), "Winter, when there is much snow, they (the Indians) make a kind of snowshoe that are two to three times larger than those in France, that they tie to their feet, and thus go on the snow, without sinking into it, otherwise they would not be able to hunt or go from one location to the other".

Two groups of snowshoe pioneers diverged early on, setting patterns that can still be seen today. One group abandoned the snowshoe as it migrated north to what is now [[Scandinavia]], eventually turning the design into the forerunners of the [[cross-country skiing|Nordic ski]]. The other went northeast, eventually crossing the [[Bering Strait]] into [[North America]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In 2016, Italian scientists reported "the oldest snowshoe in the world" discovered in [[the Dolomites]] and dated to between 3800 and 3700 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Squires|first= Nick |date= 2016-09-12|title= World's oldest snowshoe found on a glacier in Italy's Dolomites|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/worlds-oldest-snowshoe-found-on-a-glacier-in-italys-dolomites/|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|location= |access-date= 2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American indigenous peoples===
[[File:Ojibwa dance.jpg|thumb|left| Plains [[Ojibwa people|Ojibwa]] performing a snowshoe dance by [[George Catlin]]]]
The indigenous people of North America developed the most advanced and diverse snowshoes prior to the 20th century. Nearly every [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American aboriginal]] culture developed its own particular shape of shoe, the simplest and most primitive being those of the far north. The [[Inuit]] have two styles, one being triangular in shape and about {{convert|18|in|cm}} in length, and the other almost circular, both reflecting the need for high flotation in deep, loose and powdery snow. However, contrary to popular perception, the Inuit did not use their snowshoes much since they did most of their foot travel in winter over sea ice or on the [[tundra]], where snow does not pile up deeply.

Southward the shoe becomes gradually narrower and longer, the largest being the hunting snow-shoe of the [[Cree]], which is nearly {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and turned up at the toe. Even smaller models, developed most notably by the [[Iroquois]], are narrower and shorter, reflecting the need for maneuverability in [[forest]]ed areas.

The [[Plains Indians]] wore snowshoes on their winter season [[American Bison|bison]] hunts before [[horse]]s were introduced. Despite their great diversity in form, snowshoes were, in fact, one of the few cultural elements common to all tribes that lived where the winters were snowy, in particular, the Northern regions.

===Use by Europeans===
[[File:Swedishnowshoe.PNG|200px|left|thumb|16th century depiction of Swedish traveler with horse]]
Snowshoes were slowly adopted by Europeans in what became Canada and the United States, with the [[French people|French]] ''[[voyageurs]]'' and [[Coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] well in advance of British [[settler]]s. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, French Voyageurs were primarily 18th and 19th century French Canadian fur traders who explored the frontier waterways by canoe. The Europeans adopted the use of snowshoes through the [[French and Indian Wars]]. Superior French snowshoeing skill almost turned the [[French and Indian War]], a conflict that saw two engagements named the [[Battle on Snowshoes]], to their favor.

However, the British were quick learners. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports the term being used by the English as early as 1674. Sixteen years later, after a French-Indian raiding party attacked a British settlement near what is today [[Schenectady, New York]], the British took to their own snowshoes and pursued the attackers for almost {{convert|50|mi|km}}, ultimately recovering both people and goods taken by their attackers.

The "teardrop" snowshoes worn by lumberjacks are about {{convert|40|in|m}} long and broad in proportion, while the tracker's shoe is over {{convert|5|ft|m}} long and very narrow. This form, the stereotypical snowshoe, resembles a [[tennis]] [[racquet]], and indeed the French term is ''raquette à neige''.

This form was copied by the Canadian snowshoe clubs of the late 18th century. Founded for military training purposes, they became the earliest recreational users of snowshoes.

The snowshoe clubs such as the [[Montreal Snow Shoe Club]] (1840) shortened the teardrop to about {{convert|40|in|cm}} long and {{convert|15|to|18|in|mm}} broad, slightly turned up at the toe and terminating in a kind of tail behind. This is made very light for racing purposes, but much stouter for touring or hunting. The tail keeps the shoe straight while walking.
[[File:Snowshoes two styles.JPG|thumb|right|Teardrop showshoes and Bearpaw snowshoes in the [[Gatineau Park]].]]
Another variant, the "bearpaw", ends in a curved heel instead of a tail. While many early enthusiasts found this more difficult to learn on, as they were thicker in the middle and rather cumbersome, they did have the advantage of being easier to pack and nimbler in tight spaces. Two forms of traditional bearpaw snowshoes developed: an eastern version used by "spruce gummers" consisting of an oval frame with wooden cross braces, and a western version with a rounded triangular frame and no wooden bracing.

Traditional snowshoes are made of a single strip of some tough wood, usually [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]], curved round and fastened together at the ends and supported in the middle by a light cross-bar. The space within the frame is filled with a close webbing of dressed [[caribou]] or neat's-hide strips, leaving a small opening just behind the cross-bar for the toe of the [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasined]] foot. They are fastened to the moccasin by [[leather]] thongs, sometimes by [[buckle]]s. Such shoes are still made and sold by native peoples.

==Modern==
[[File:Couple Snowshoeing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Canadian couple snowshoeing in 1907]]
Outside of indigenous populations and some competitions such as [[Arctic Winter Games]], very few of the old-fashioned snowshoes are actually used by enthusiasts anymore, although some value them for the artisanship involved in their construction. They are sometimes seen as decorations, mounted on walls or on [[Fireplace mantel|mantels]] in ski lodges.

Even though many enthusiasts prefer aluminum snowshoes, there is still a large group of snowshoe enthusiasts who prefer wooden snowshoes. Wooden frames do not freeze as readily. Many enthusiasts also prefer wood snowshoes because they are very quiet.

While recreational use of snowshoes began with snowshoe clubs in [[Quebec]], Canada (who held events where races and hikes were combined with fine food and drink), the manufacture of snowshoes for recreational purposes really began in the late 19th century, when serious recreational use became more widespread.

In the late 20th century the snowshoe underwent a radical redesign. It started in the 1950s when the [[Vermont]]-based Tubbs company created the [[Green Mountains|Green Mountain]] Bearpaw, which combined the shortness of that style with an even narrower width than had previously been used ([[#refPospisil1979|Pospisil 1979]]). This rapidly became one of the most popular snowshoes of its day.

===The "Western"===
In 1972, experimenting with new designs in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Cascade Mountains]], Gene and Bill Prater created the snowshoe known today. They began using [[aluminum]] tubing and replaced the lace with [[neoprene]] and [[nylon]] decking. To make them easier to use in [[mountaineering]], the Praters developed a hinged binding and added [[cleat (shoe)|cleats]] to the bottom of the shoe.

The Sherpa Snowshoe company started manufacturing these "[[Western United States|Western]]" shoes and they proved very popular. [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] snowshoers were a bit more skeptical at first, believing that the style was unnecessary in the east, until the Praters demonstrated their improved effectiveness on [[New Hampshire]]'s [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]].

These use an [[aluminum]] or [[stainless steel]] frame and take advantage of technical advances in [[plastic]]s and [[injection moulding|injection molding]] to make a lighter and more durable shoe. They require little maintenance, and usually incorporate aggressive [[crampon]]s.

Some, such as the "Denali" model made by [[Mountain Safety Research]], use no metal frame and can be fitted with optional detachable tail extenders. Newer models have heel-lifters, called "ascenders", that flip up to facilitate hill climbing.

The use of solid decking in place of the standard latticework of lacing came as a surprise to many enthusiasts, since it challenged a long-held belief that the lattice was necessary to prevent snow from accumulating on the shoe. In practice, however, it seems that very little snow comes through the openings in either type of shoe.

Neoprene/nylon decks also displayed superior water resistance, neither stretching as rawhide will when wet nor requiring annual treatment with [[Spar varnish#Spar varnish|spar varnish]], features that were immediately appreciated. Eventually they were replaced with even lighter materials such as [[polypropylene]]. This tendency also gave way to the creation of inflatable snowshoes made of different fabrics such as [[cordura]] and [[Thermoplastic polyurethane|thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)]].

These more athletic designs have helped the sport enjoy a renaissance after a period of eclipse when winter recreationists showed more interest in skiing. In the U.S., the number of snowshoers tripled during the 1990s.

In fact, [[ski resort]]s with available land are beginning to offer snowshoe trails to visitors, and some popular hiking areas are almost as busy in the colder months as they are on warm summer weekends.

== Selection ==
[[File:Snowshoes and bindings.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Properly adjusted bindings on two snowshoes of different size. Note use of [[gaiters]].]]
As many winter recreationists rediscover snowshoeing, many more new models of snowshoe are becoming available. Ski areas and outdoor equipment stores are offering snowshoes for [[Renting|rent]].

Snowshoes today are divided into three types:
* aerobic/running (small and light; not intended for backcountry use);
* recreational (a bit larger; meant for use in gentle-to moderate walks of {{convert|3|-|5|mi|km}}); and
* mountaineering (the largest, meant for serious hill-climbing, long-distance trips and off-trail use).

Sizes are often given in inches, even though snowshoes are nowhere near perfectly [[rectangle|rectangular]]. Mountaineering shoes can be at least {{convert|30|in|cm}} long by {{convert|10|in|cm}} wide; a lighter pair of racing shoes can be slightly narrower and {{convert|25|in|cm}} or shorter.

Regardless of configuration, all wooden shoes are referred to as "traditional" and all shoes made of other materials are called "modern."

Notwithstanding these variations in planned use, larger users should plan on buying larger snowshoes. A common formula is that for every pound of body weight, there should be one square inch of snowshoe surface (14.5&amp;nbsp;cm²/kg) per snowshoe to adequately support the wearer. Users should also consider the weight of any gear they will be packing, especially if they expect to break trail. Those planning to travel into deep powder look for even larger shoes.

Many manufacturers now include weight-based flotation ratings for their shoes, although there is no standard for setting this yet.

===Bindings===
[[File:Snowshoe reverse.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Underside of a modern fixed-rotation binding snowshoe, showing cleats for [[traction (engineering)|traction]] on steep slopes.]]
As is often the case with downhill skis, wood-frame snowshoes and suitable bindings are typically marketed and purchased separately rather than as a single piece. One common style is termed the "H" binding, as it consists of a [[strap#binding strap|strap]] around the heel crossing a strap around the toe and one at the instep, forming a rough version of the eponymous letter.

On modern shoes, there are two styles of binding: fixed-rotation (also known as "limited-rotation") bindings, and full-rotation (also known as "pivot") bindings.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Tracy C. [http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/travel/travel_magazine/winter_2006/gearup.asp Snow dancin': A first-time buyer's guide to today's sure-footed, cutting-edge snowshoes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065858/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/travel/travel_magazine/winter_2006/gearup.asp |date=2011-06-07 }} . ''Canadian Geographic'', retrieved December 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; With either binding system, the [[heel]] is left free, and the difference is in how the ball of the foot is attached to the snowshoe.

In fixed-rotation bindings, the binding is attached to the snowshoe with an elastic strap that brings the tail of the snowshoe up with each step. The snowshoe therefore moves with the foot and the tail does not drag. Fixed-rotation bindings are preferred for racing.&lt;ref&gt;''Snowshoeing, a Trailside Guide'', by Larry Olmsted, p 35&lt;/ref&gt; Full-rotation bindings allow the user's toes to pivot below the deck of the snowshoe. They allow the [[crampon]] cleats that are under the foot to be kicked into a slope for grip in climbing, but are relatively awkward for stepping sideways and backwards as the tail of the snowshoe can drag. Fixed-rotation bindings often cause snow to be kicked up the back of the wearer's legs; this does not tend to happen with full-rotation bindings.

A series of straps, usually three, are used to fasten the foot to the snowshoe. Some styles of binding use a cup for the toe. It is important that a user be able to manipulate these straps easily, as removing or securing the foot often must be done outdoors in cold weather with bare hands, exposing him or her to the possibility of [[frostbite]]. When putting on snowshoes, left is distinguished from right by which way the loose ends of the binding straps point: always outward, to avoid stepping on them repeatedly.

In 1994, Bill Torres and a younger associate developed the step-in binding, designed to make it easier for snowshoers wearing hard-shelled plastic boots (serious mountaineers) to change from snowshoes to crampons and back again as needed.

===Accessories===
[[File:MSR snowshoes.jpg|thumb|150px|left|MSR solid plastic snowshoes]]
Snowshoers often use [[trekking poles]] as an accessory to help them keep their balance on the snow. Some manufacturers have begun making special snowshoeing models of their poles, with larger baskets more like those found on [[ski poles]] (which can also be used).

Other than that, no other special accessories are required. Most types of footwear can be worn with snowshoes, although [[hiking boot]]s are the preferred choice among most recreational users (except racers, who prefer [[Athletic shoe|running shoes]]). [[Ski boot]]s, however, will only work with certain snowshoes such as the MSR Denali, otherwise requiring backcountry skiers to carry other footwear for the snowshoe portion of their trip.

If going into deep snow, snowshoers will often take along [[gaiter]]s to keep snow from getting into their boots from above. Some manufacturers make their snowshoes with boot or toe covers to provide the same protection.

A carrier of some type is also advisable, particularly if the trip will not take place entirely on snowshoes. Some [[backpack]] manufacturers have designed special packs with "[[Daisy chain (climbing)|daisy chains]]," strips of looped nylon [[webbing]] on which the shoes can be secured. Snowshoe manufacturers, too, have begun including carriers and [[tote bag]]s for their products, if for no other reason than to prevent the often-sharp cleats on the bottom from damaging surfaces they come in contact with.

Since snowshoeing is commonly done in cold weather, users typically prepare for it by dressing in layers and carrying the appropriate equipment.

==Techniques employed with snowshoes==
[[File:Snowshoers in Bryce Canyon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Snowshoers in [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]]]]
[[File:Snowshoeing.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Snowshoeing.]]
Snowshoes function best when there is enough snow beneath them to pack a layer between them and the ground, usually at a depth of {{convert|8|in|cm}} or more. However, contrary to popular belief, snowshoes perform poorly on very icy and steep terrain. Compared to [[crampons]], snowshoes give relatively little grip on ice. It is common for novice snowshoers to climb up a steep slope to a summit and then have difficulty climbing back down, which tends to be more difficult than ascending. In icy conditions, summer hiking routes may require [[mountaineering]] skills and equipment, not snowshoes.&lt;ref&gt;Stueck, Wendy. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/snowshoes-create-false-confidence-rescue-veteran-says-after-man-slides-to-his-death/article1390943/ Snowshoes create false confidence, rescue veteran says after man slides to his death ] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' December 7, 2009, retrieved Jan 1 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walking===
It is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk, you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing "straddle-gait" that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.

====Turning====
Walking skills are easily transferable to straightforward snowshoe travel, but this is not always the case with turning around. While a snowshoer with space to do so can, and usually does, simply walk in a small [[semicircle]], on a steep slope or in close quarters such as a [[boreal forest]] this may be impractical or impossible. It is thus necessary in such circumstances to execute a "kick turn" similar to the one employed on skis: lifting one foot high enough to keep the entire snowshoe in the air while keeping the other planted, putting the foot at a [[right angle]] to the other (or as close as possible for the situation and the snowshoer's physical comfort), then planting it on the snow and quickly repeating the action with the other foot. This is much easier to accomplish with poles.

====Ascending====
[[File:Snowshoe heel lift cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Some modern snowshoes have bars that can be flipped up for ascending steep slopes. The wearer's heel can rest on the bar.]]
While the cleating and traction improvements to modern snowshoes have greatly enhanced snowshoers' climbing abilities, on very steep slopes it is still beneficial to make "kick steps," kicking the toes of the shoes into the snow to create a kind of snow stairs for the next traveler to use.

Alternatively, snowshoers can use two techniques borrowed from skis: the herringbone (walking uphill with the shoes spread outward at an angle to increase their support) and the sidestep.

For those snowshoers who use poles, it can be easier to rely on the poles to 'pull' oneself with regular stride, up the slope.

====Descending====
Once a trail has been broken up a mountain or hill, snowshoers often find a way to speed up the return trip that manages to also be fun and rests the leg muscles: ''[[glissade (climbing)|glissading]]'' the trail, or sliding down on their [[buttocks]]. This does not damage the trail, and in fact helps pack the snow better for later users.

In situations where they must break trail downhill and thus cannot glissade, snowshoers sometimes run downhill in exaggerated steps, sliding slightly on the snow as they do, an option sometimes called "step sliding." Also effective, are poles placed in front as you descend in a regular stride. If carrying poles and properly experienced, they can also employ skiing techniques such as [[Telemark skiing|telemarking]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

====Breaking trail====
[[File:Snowshoe track in woods.jpg|thumb|A broken snowshoe trail]]
On newly fallen snow it is necessary for a snowshoer to "break" a trail. This is tiring (it may require up to 50% more energy than simply following behind) even on level terrain, and frequently in groups this work is shared among all participants.

A trail breaker can improve the quality of the ensuing route by using a technique, similar to the hiking [[rest step]], called "stamping": pausing momentarily after each step before putting full weight on the foot. This helps smooth the snow underneath and compacts it even better for the next user.

A well-broken trail is usually a rut in the snow about {{convert|6|-|8|in|cm}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} wide. While it may appear after heavy use as if it is possible to "bareboot" or walk it without benefit of snowshoes, this practice is frowned upon by serious snowshoers as it leads to "postholing," or roughening of the trail from places where boots have fallen through (initial appearances to the contrary, the snow in a broken trail is not sufficiently packed to support the more concentrated weight of a foot).

In soft conditions, following trails broken by [[ski touring|backcountry skiers]] can be difficult on snowshoes. In addition, since snowshoes destroy ski tracks, many areas ask that snowshoers observe traditional backcountry courtesy and stay out of ski tracks. Ski trails are normally much narrower than a typical snowshoe trail, and less well packed because skis offer more flotation than snowshoes. If the snow is deep and soft, snowshoers may find themselves postholing right through the ski track. In most cases the ski track offers little advantage and putting in a separate snowshoe track allows both snowshoers and skiers to have a positive experience and avoids friction with skiers who often resent having their tracks obliterated and their skiing enjoyment greatly reduced.

[[File:Snowshoer with perching bird.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A young snowshoer with a wild bird.]]
Snowshoeing expands the potential for exercise available in the wintertime. {{As of|2006}}, at least 500 [[Education in the United States|American schools]], mostly but not exclusively in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] have started offering snowshoe programs in their [[physical education]] classes to help combat [[obesity]]. It had the added benefit of being gentler on the feet than walking or running the equivalent routes, since snow cushions the foot's impact.

For the same reason, it is less detrimental to the environment, since the snow likewise buffers the earth against the impact of so many hikers and campers, cutting back on trail [[erosion]] and other effects of heavy use.

Snowshoeing makes even familiar hikes different and new. If the snow is deep enough, obstacles such as large boulders and fallen logs can be more easily bypassed.

===Adverse effects===
Immoderate snowshoeing leads to serious lameness of the feet and ankles which Canadian ''[[coureur de bois|voyageurs]]'' called ''mal de raquette''. Modern snowshoes are much lighter and more comfortable so that lameness caused by snowshoeing is now very rare.

Nonetheless, many snowshoers find that their legs, particularly their [[calf muscle]]s, take some time to get used to snowshoeing again at the start of each winter. Frequently the first serious trip leaves them [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|sore for several days afterwards]].

=== Winter recreation ===
[[File:Snowshoer packing skis.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A snowshoer packing downhill skis.]]
The resurgence of interest in snowshoeing in the late 20th century was in some part due to [[snowboard]]ers, who took to them as a way to reach backcountry powder bowls and other areas while they were still banned from most ski areas. Their similarities to snowboards, in shape and binding, led many of them to continue use even after snowboarders were allowed to use most ski slopes. Despite most ski areas now allowing snowboarders, there is a growing interest in backcountry and sidecountry snowboarding in the search for fresh powder. The recent development of [[splitboard]]s has enabled snowboarders to access backcountry without the need for snowshoes.

[[Alpine skiing|Downhill skiers]], too, found snowshoes useful in reaching the same areas.

Another popular expedition, particularly among hikers, is the "ski-shoe" trip combining a [[cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] portion on a level, wide [[trail]] with a snowshoe up a less skiable section, usually to a mountain summit.

===Competition===
Runners have found that using light snowshoes allows them to continue exercising and racing during winter. Like their warm-weather counterparts, events cover all distances, from [[Sprint (running)|sprints]] of 100 m to the 100&amp;nbsp;km "Iditashoe." There are even [[Hurdling|hurdle]] events.

Snowshoe segments have become common in many [[multi-sport event]]s and [[adventure racing|adventure races]], including a required snowshoe segment in the winter [[quadrathlon]]. Some competitors in those events like [[Sally Edwards]] and [[Tom Sobal]] have emerged as stars.

While snowshoe racing has probably been around as long as there have been snowshoes, as an organized sport it is relatively new. The [[United States Snowshoe Association]] was founded in 1977 to serve as a governing body for competitive snowshoeing. It is headquartered in [[Corinth (village), New York|Corinth]], New York, which considers itself the "Snowshoe Capital of the World" as a result. Similar organizations, such as the [[European Snowshoe Committee]] and Japan's [[Chikyu Network]], exist in other countries and there is an international competitive level as well.

Snowshoe races are part of the [[Arctic Winter Games]] and the winter [[Special Olympics]]. However, they are not yet an [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] event.

==Maintenance and repair==
[[File:Snowshoes.JPG|thumb|125px|Rawhide webbing]]
The rawhide webbing of traditional snowshoes, as noted above, needs regular [[waterproofing]]. [[Spar varnish#Spar varnish|Spar varnish]] is the preferred waterproofing for traditional snowshoes. A light sanding is preferred before 3 coats of spar varnish is applied. Modern snowshoes need no regular maintenance save a sharpening of cleats if desired.

Both kinds of snowshoe, however, can and do break. The most common damage suffered is to the frame, which can be splinted with a stick or piece of wood if necessary. Decking rarely gets broken, but if it is punctured and the hole looks as if it might continue to grow, the best solution is the [[repair|patching]] kits made for [[tent]]s.

[[Cable tie]]s can serve many purposes in repairing snowshoes. They can splint frames in a pinch, replace a broken rivet, secure a tie or lace, and repair winter clothing as well.

A '''stationary engineer''', sometimes called an '''operating engineer''', or a '''power engineer''', operates industrial machinery and equipment that provides energy in various forms.

==Description==
Power engineers are trained in many areas, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, metallurgical, computer, and a wide range of safety skills. They typically work in [[Factory|factories]], office buildings, [[hospital]]s, [[warehouse]]s, power generation plants, industrial facilities, and residential and commercial buildings.  

Power engineers are responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of a wide range of equipment including boilers, steam turbines, gas turbines, pumps, gas compressors, generators, motors, air conditioning systems, heat exchangers, refrigeration equipment, [[heat recovery steam generator]]s (HRSGs) that may be directly (duct burners) or indirectly fired (gas turbine exhaust heat collectors), hot water generators, and [[refrigeration]] machinery in addition to its associated auxiliary equipment ([[air compressor]]s, [[Gas compressor|natural gas compressors]], [[electrical]] [[switchgear]], [[pump]]s, etc.).

Power engineers may hold various titles, such as boiler attendant or fitter. In Canada, Power Engineers are ranked by classes. Fifth class being the starting point and First class being the highest level attained. However in India there are only two classes – Ist class and 2nd class. This is a national standard in Canada and India but America isn't quite so organized in this regard. In the [[United States]], stationary engineers must be [[license]]d in several cities and [[U.S. state|states]]. The [[New York City Department of Buildings]] requires a Stationary Engineer's License to practice in the [[New York City|City of New York]]; to obtain the license one must pass a written and practical exam and have at least five years' experience working directly under a licensed stationary engineer, or one year if in possession of a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. Holders of the Stationary Engineer's License primarily work in large [[power generation]] facilities, such as [[cogeneration]] power plants, peaking units, and large [[central heating]] and refrigeration plants (CHRPs). For the State of California, Stationary Engineers are the State of California Military Department's sole source of Airfield Lighting and Repair.

The stationary engineering [[trade]] emerged during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The group includes [[railroad engineer]]s and [[marine engineer]]s. Famous people who began their working lives in this trade include [[George Stephenson]] and [[Henry Ford]]. The early [[steam engine]]s developed by [[Thomas Savery]] and [[Thomas Newcomen]] which drew water from mines and the industrial steam engines perfected by [[James Watt]] and others employed the ancestors of today's engineers. Railroad engineers operated early steam [[locomotive]]s and continue to operate trains today. The traditions and classification of the engineer were developed to the greatest extent by marine engineers who worked in the [[engine department|engine rooms]] of the great [[ocean liner]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries. The use of the title "engineer" by Power engineers has been challenged in court by university-educated [[professional engineer]]s; however, the stationary engineers have prevailed to date. The job of today's engineer has been greatly changed by computers and automation as well as the replacement of steam engines on ships and trains. Workers have adapted to the challenges of the changing job market. 

Many Power engineers are becoming more involved with the technical aspect of the job as it has shifted toward a dependence on building automation. Building and central plant operations are now relying heavily on direct digital controls; and as such the engineer is required to be much more computer literate to work with the BAS (Building Automation System).

:''This article refers to the steam-powered agricultural tractor; for other types of steam tractor, see: [[Traction engine]]

A '''steam tractor''' is a vehicle powered by a [[steam engine]] which is used for pulling.

In [[North America]], the term ''steam tractor'' usually refers to a type of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[tractor]] powered by a steam engine, used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In [[Great Britain]], the term ''steam tractor'' is more usually applied to the smallest models of [[traction engine]] - typically those weighing seven tons or less - used for hauling small loads on public roads.  Although known as ''light steam tractors'', these engines are generally just smaller versions of the '[[traction engine#Road locomotive|road locomotive]]'.

This article concentrates on the steam-powered agricultural [[vehicle]]s intended for the direct-pulling of ploughs and other implements (as opposed to cable-hauling).

==Development (Great Britain)==
Owing to differences in soil conditions, the development of [[steam]]-powered agricultural machines differed considerably on either side of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

In [[Great Britain]], a number of traction engine builders attempted to produce a design of agricultural engine that could pull a [[plough]] directly, in place of a team of horses.  However, the heavier and wetter soils found in Britain meant that these designs were not successful — being less economical to use than the team of horses they were intended to replace.  These engines were also known as "steam tractors".  Instead, farmers resorted to cable-hauled ploughing using [[ploughing engine]]s.

A distinctive example of a British-designed (agricultural) steam tractor is the [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons|Garrett]] ''Suffolk Punch'', a 1917 design intended to compete directly with [[internal combustion]]-powered alternatives.  &lt;!--At least one of these is preserved in the UK in working order, although I do not know if I have a photo of it. EdJogg --&gt;

==Development (North America)==
[[Image:BestTractor.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1905 [[Best Manufacturing Company|Best]] steam tractor (manufactured in [[California]]).]]
The first steam tractors that were designed specifically for agricultural uses were [[portable engine]]s built on skids or on wheels and transported to the work area using horses. Later models used the power of the steam engine itself to power a drive train to move the machine and were first known as "[[traction drive]]" engines{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} which eventually was shortened to "tractor".{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} These drive mechanisms were one of three types: chain, shaft, and open pinion. The open pinion became the most popular design due to its strength. Later improvements included power steering, differentials, compounded engines, and butt-strap boiler design.

The steam engine was gradually phased out by the mid-1920s as the less expensive, lighter, and faster-starting internal combustion (kerosene, petrol or distillate) tractors fully emerged after World War I.

==Uses==
===Threshing===
[[Image:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|The drive belt: used to transfer power from a [[portable engine]] to a [[threshing machine]]]]
These engines were used extensively in rural North America to aid in threshing, in which the owner/operator of a [[threshing machine]] or ''threshing rig'' would travel from farmstead to farmstead threshing grain. Oats were a common item to be threshed, but wheat and other grains were common as well. On a "threshing day", all the neighbors would gather at that day's farmstead to complete a massive job in one day through cooperation. The women and older girls were in charge of cooking the noon meal and bringing water to the men. The children had various jobs based upon their age and sex. These jobs included driving the bundle racks, pitching bundles into the threshing machine, supplying water for the steam engine, hauling away the freshly threshed grain and scooping it into the granary. Steam traction engines were often too expensive for a single farmer to purchase, so "threshing rings" were often formed. In a threshing ring, multiple farmers pooled their resources to purchase a steam engine. They also chose one person among them to go to a steam school, to learn how to run the engine properly. There were also threshing contractors, who owned their own engine and thresher, and went to different farms, hiring themselves out to thresh grain.

===Ploughing===
The immense pulling power of steam tractors allowed them to be used for ploughing as well. Certain steam tractors were better suited for ploughing than others, with the large [[Minneapolis Threshing machine Co.]], [[Case IH|J.I. Case]], [[Reeves &amp; Co]] and [[Advance-Rumely]] engines being prime examples. Some of the largest steam tractors, such as the {{convert|150|hp}} Case (known as "Road Locomotives"), were capable of pulling 30 or more plough bottoms, while most were powerful enough to pull between 6 and 20. Differing soil conditions highly affected the ploughing abilities of these tractors.

'''Technological innovation''' is an extended concept of [[innovation]]. While innovation is a rather-well defined concept, it has a broad meaning to many people, and especially numerous understanding in the academic and business world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/technological-innovation-entrepreneurship-and-development/ Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation, refers to adding extra steps of developing new services and products in the marketplace or in the public that fulfill undressed needs or solve problems that were not in the past. Technological Innovation, however focuses on the technological aspects of a product or service rather than covering the entire organization [[business model]]. It is important to clarify that Innovation is not only driven by [[technology]].

==Definition==
Technological innovation is the process where an organization (or a group of people working outside a structured organization) embarks in a journey where the importance of technology as a source of innovation has been identified as a [[critical success factor|critical success factor]] for increased market competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://innovationcompany.co.uk/innovation-questions|title=Innovation Questions and Answers|last=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wording "technological innovation" is preferred to "technology innovation". "Technology innovation" gives a sense of working on technology for the sake of technology. "Technological innovation" better reflects the business consideration of improving business value by working on technological aspects of the product or services. Moreover, in a vast majority of products and services, there is not one unique technology at the heart of the system. It is the combination, the integration and interaction of different [[Technology|technologies]] that make the product or service successful.

==Process==
If the process of technological innovation is formalized (typically within an organization: a company, a public entity, a think tank, a university, etc.) it can be referred as '''Technological Innovation Management''' (or Technology Innovation Management - TIM). The "management" aspect refers to the inputs, outputs and constraints a "Manager" or team of "Managers" are responsible to govern the process of technological innovation in a way that aligns with the company strategy. In a context where Technological Innovation is not to be guided along known paths within the organization, the wording and concept of '''Technological Innovation Leadership''' is preferred. In many occasion, especially in start-ups and new ventures, the Technological Innovation is performed in an unknown context. The boundaries and constraints of the Technology at work are not precisely know. Hence it requires leaders and not managers to give the vision and coach the team to explore the unknown part of the technology.

==Corollary==
Technological Innovation:
* is a continuous process, within an internal or external venture, build-out to create value with innovation;
* starts with the ideation process and ends-up with the commercialization of a viable product or service, in response to a proven market need;
* is a guide for the venture management to decide what technology directions to take, based on portfolio management, and execution monitoring;
* is driven by entrepreneurial / intra-preneurial spirit, supported by internal / external funding

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">The '''Wiltshire cure''' is a traditional English technique for [[curing (food preservation)|curing]] [[bacon]] and [[ham]]. The technique originated in the 18th century in [[Calne]], [[Wiltshire]]; it was developed by the Harris family.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; Originally it was a dry cure method that involved applying salt to the meat for 10–14 days.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt; Storing the meat in cold rooms meant that less salt was needed.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; The Wiltshire cure has been a wet cure, soaking the meat in [[brine]] for 4–5 days, since the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Piggott /&gt; [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] is not part of the process, although bacon is often smoked after being cured.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt;

In 2010, several large British supermarket chains signed a voluntary code agreeing to use clearer labelling on [[pork]] products to avoid confusion over country of origin. For shops under this agreement, pork products sold in the UK that are labelled with "Wiltshire Cure" should only have been sourced from the UK.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;
