He was the teacher of Daniel ben Perachiah, whom he assisted in the translation from the Spanish into Hebrew of [[Abraham Zacuto]]'s ''Almanach perpetuum'' (1543), and [[Moses Almosnino]], whom he assisted in his (unpublished) Hebrew translation of [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]'s ''[[De sphaera mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Olga|last=Borovaya|title=The Beginnings of Ladino Literature: Moses Almosnino and His Readers|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0253025524|lccn=2016024515|page=68|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gsSCDgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almosnino's ''Bet Elokim''—an astronomical work which draws on [[Georg von Peuerbach]]'s ''Theorica planetarium''—also contains work by Afia at the end.&lt;ref name=bodies&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Jewish Bodies and Renaissance Melancholy: Culture and the City in Italy and the Ottoman Empire|first=Eleazar|last=Gutwirth|title=The Jewish Body: Corporeality, Society, and Identity in the Renaissance and Early Modern Period|editor1-first=Maria|editor1-last=Diemling|editor2-first=Giuseppe|editor2-last=Veltri|location=Leiden|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2009|isbn=978-90-04-16718-6|pages=57–92|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Jewish_Body.html?id=m1Lh-FwFrXIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidi Bel Abbas''' or '''Sidi Ahmed abu al-Abbas al-Khazraji as-Sabti''' ([[Ceuta]] 1129 - [[Marrakesh]] 1204) is the patron saint of [[Marrakesh]], in the Islamic tradition. He is also one of the "Seven Saints" (Sabʿatou Rijal) of the city. His festival was founded by [[Abu Ali al-Hassan al-Yusi]] at the instigation of [[Moulay Ismael]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Cornell. ''Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1998, "The Power of Compassion: The Imitanda of Abu'l-Abbas as-Sabti", p.&amp;nbsp;79&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Abbas was born in [[Ceuta]], but moved to Marrakesh in 1145-6, during the final weeks of the [[Almohad]] siege of the city. For a number of years he lived in a cave on the hill of Igilliz outside Marrakesh, only coming into town on Fridays for the communal prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Cornell. ''Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1998, "The Power of Compassion: The Imitanda of Abu'l-Abbas as-Sabti", p.&amp;nbsp;79&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Almohad]] sultan [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] was a disciple of al-Abbas. He asked him to come and live in the city and provided him a house, a hostel for his disciples as well as a [[madrasa]] for study. Teaching was maintained by the sultan's own funds. Whenever [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] visited al-Abbas he made a point of behaving in a humble manner and acting "as a servant".&lt;ref&gt;Chniber, ''Les murmures de la palmeraie'', Volume 39 of Écritures arabes, Editions L'Harmattan, 1988, {{ISBN|978-2-7384-0075-8}}, {{ISBN|978-2-7384-0075-8}}, page 162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1535SMh4u0gC online books]&lt;/ref&gt;

To al-Abbas, every act of human mercy (''rahma'') evoked a merciful response from the all-merciful God (''ar-Rahim''). Al-Abbas summed up his theory of reciprocity with the maxim: "[Divine] Being is actualised by generosity" (al-wujud yanfa ilu bi'l-jud). The Andalusian philosopher [[Ibn Rushd]] visited al-Abbas several times in [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, ''Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

When al-Abbas died in 1204, he was buried at the graveyard of Sidi Marouk, near Bab Taghzout.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dar-sirr.com/sultans.html ''Moroccan Sultans and Sufis'' retrieved 24 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1605, the [[Saadian]] sultan [[Abou Fares Abdallah|Abu Faris]] erected a mausoleum for al-Abbas, hoping that the saint's power would help him recover from his epilepsy. In 1998, sultan [[Hassan II]] improved the sanctuary. It is also the place of his [[zawiyya]].

Al-Abbas's hagiography, ''Akhbar Abi'l-Abbas as-Sabti'', written by [[Yusuf al-Tadili|Abu Ya’qub Yusuf ibn Yahya at-Tadili]], was in part composed by al-Abbas himself and contains many autobiographical passages.

'''André Van Lysebeth'''  (October 10, 1919 – January 28, 2004) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[yoga]] instructor and author whose books about yoga have been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/857500.Andr_Van_Lysebeth |title= 
André Van Lysebeth|publisher= goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for a quintessential book on human sexuality he took thirty years of his life to write, 'Tantra: The Cult of the Feminine'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885723.Tantra |title= Tantra, The Cult of the Feminine|publisher= goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
André Van Lysebeth worked most of his life in a publishing house, in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. He is one of the first Westerners to have practiced and taught yoga. Soon enough, he heard about a famous Indian yoga teacher, [[Swami Sivananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When World War II was over, he traveled to India by car (from Belgium) with his wife and his children. In Rishikesh, he met [[Shivananda]] and attended his classes in his yoga institute, today known as the [[Sivananda Ashram]]. Upon André's return to Europe, he opened a yoga studio and became a yoga instructor. 

During the following years, he went back to the school of his Master several times, again driving his car all the way to India and then, as the flights became cheaper, by plane. He became a popular teacher and wrote a book, "Yoga Self-Taught". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1984563.Yoga_Self_Taught/|title= Yoga Self-Taught|publisher= Weiser Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was published in Paris in 1968 and became a yoga bestseller.

In the seventies, he started a new project, "the Yoga Vacation", that consisted in holidaying in a pleasant place, such as in a quiet resort in Spain or in Italy, and twice a day or more meeting for a [[yoga]] practice, a [[pranayama]] practice or another suchlike practice. This became popular and led him to a new project, "the Yoga Teacher Training". In turn, these trainings became popular and André Van Lysebeth became one of the most influential teacher of teachers in Europe. In the yoga field, everybody knew him. 

From then to his death, he kept teaching yoga classes and teacher training courses during the year and animating yoga vacations during the summertime. But it isn't all yet: he published a yoga magazine every month all by himself and sold it to his numerous students. This magazine was simply called "Yoga". He wrote it singlehandedly from 1968 to 2004.

Shivananda wasn't his only yoga teacher. He met and learned with countless others he met during one of his trips to India, where he went at least once a year from 1950 to his death. Among the other teachers, let us mention [[K. Pattabhi Jois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ashtangayoga.info/ashtangayoga/tradition/way-to-the-west/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">'''Animal machine''' or '' Bête machine'' (Fr., animal-machine), is a philosophical notion from [[Descartes]] who held that animals were machines unable to think. This implied a fundamental difference between animals and humans (cf. [[Man a Machine|L'homme Machine]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist3.xml;chunk.id=dv3-17 MAN-MACHINE FROM THE GREEKS TO THE COMPUTER], from ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Now this theory is strongly challenged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Chapouthier]], "Le respect de l’animal dans ses racines historiques : de l’animal-objet à l’animal sensible", Bull. Acad. Vet. France, 2009, vol. 162 (1), p.5-12 (in french)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Arai Hakuseki'''|新井 白石|extra=March 24, 1657 – June 29, 1725}} was a [[Confucianist]], [[scholar-bureaucrat]], academic, administrator, writer and politician in Japan during the middle of the [[Edo period]], who advised the ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ienobu]].&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon. (2006).

'''Hakuseki''' (白石) was his pen name. His father was a [[Kururi Domain|Kururi]] [[han (country subdivision)|han]] samurai '''Arai Masazumi''' (新井 正済).

==Biography==
Hakuseki was born in [[Edo]] and from a very early age displayed signs of [[genius]]. According to one story, at the age of three Hakuseki managed to copy a Confucian book written in [[Kanji]], character by character. Because he was born on the same year as the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] and because he was hot tempered and his brow would crease looking like 火 or "fire", he was affectionately called ''Hi no Ko'' (火の子) or ''child of fire''. He was a retainer of [[Hotta Masatoshi]], but after Masatoshi was assassinated by [[Inaba Masayasu]], the [[Hotta clan]] was forced to move from [[Sakura Domain|Sakura]] to [[Yamagata Domain|Yamagata]] then to [[Fukushima Domain|Fukushima]] and the domain's income declined. Hakuseki offered to leave, becoming a ''[[rōnin]]'' and studied under Confucianist [[Kinoshita Junan|Kinoshita Jun'an]]. He was offered a post by the largest ''han'', that of [[Kaga Domain]], but he offered the position to a fellow samurai.

In 1693, Hakuseki was called up to serve by the side of [[Manabe Akifusa]] as a "brain" for the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and shogun [[Tokugawa Ienobu]]. He went on to displace the official [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi]] advisers to become the leading confucianist for Ienobu and [[Tokugawa Ietsugu]]. While some of Hakuseki's policies were still carried out after Ienobu's death, after the 6th shogun, Tokugawa Ietsugu, died and [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]'s rule began, Hakuseki left his post to begin his career as a prolific writer of Japanese history and Occidental studies.

He was buried in [[Asakusa]] (current day [[Taitō, Tokyo]]), Hoonji temple but was later moved to [[Nakano, Tokyo]], Kotokuji temple.

Under the top [[Rōjū]], [[Abe Seikyo]], with strong support from Ienobu, he launched [[Shōtoku no chi]], a series of economic policies designed to improve the shogunate's standing. By minting new and better quality currency, inflation was controlled. Calculating from trade records, Hakuseki deduced that fully 25% of gold and 75% of silver in Japan had been spent on trades with foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totman|first1=Conrad|title=Early Modern Japan|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-20356-3|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned that Japan's national resources were at risk, he implemented a new trade policy, the ''Kaihaku Goshi Shinrei'' (海舶互市新例), to control payments to Chinese and Dutch merchants by demanding that instead of precious metals, products like silk, porcelain, and dried seafoods should be used for trading. However, the beneficial effects of this policy were limited as the trade of precious metals from [[Tsushima Domain|Tsushima]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] was uncontrolled by the ''[[bakufu]]''.

He also simplified rituals for welcoming the [[Joseon]] dynasty's ambassadors, in the face of opposition from the Tsushima Confucianist [[Amenomori Hōshu]].

==Constitutional policy==
Hakuseki applied the [[mandate of heaven]] to both the emperor and the ''[[shōgun]]''.  Since there had been no revolution to change Japan's basic institutions, he argued that the shogun was subordinate to the emperor and that in showing good governance, moral fortitude and respect to the emperor a shogun proved that he held [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].  He also traced Tokugawa family roots back to the [[Minamoto clan]] and thus to a line of imperial descent in order to show that Ieyasu's political supremacy had been fitting.  To strengthen the shogun's power and maintain national prestige he proposed changing the title to koku-ō – nation-king.

==Selected works==
Hakuseki's published writings encompass 237 works in 390 publications in 6 languages and 3,163 library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm  WorldCat Identities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230150412/http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm |date=December 30, 2010 }}: [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79-107683  Arai, Hakuseki 1657–1725]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes treated as a [[Shatkarma|kriya]] or 'cleansing action' along with [[Kapalabhati (Hatha Yoga)|kapalabhati]] to clear the airways in preparation for other pranayama techniques. Bhastrika involves a rapid and forceful inhalation and exhalation powered by the movement of the diaphragm. The movement of air is accompanied by an audible sound. One inhale and exhale equals one round of bhastrika &lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Light on Yoga. (1995) p. 449 {{ISBN|0-8052-1031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may be repeated for many consecutive rounds. [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] explains that the similar "process or kriyā of ''kapālabhāti'' is a milder form of Bhastrikā Prāṇāyāma.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Light on Yoga. (1995) p. 450 {{ISBN|0-8052-1031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]] describes the process: "inhale and exhale quickly ten times like the bellows of the blacksmith. Constantly dilate and contract. When you practise this Pranayama a hissing sound is produced. The practitioner should start with rapid expulsions of breath following one another in rapid succession. When the required number of expulsions, say ten for a round, is finished, the final expulsion is followed by a deepest possible inhalation. The breath is suspended as long as it could be done with comfort. Then deepest possible exhalation is done very slowly. The end of this deep exhalation completes one round of Bhastrika".&lt;ref&gt;Saraswati, Sri Swami Sivananda (2013-06-14). The Science of Pranayama (Kindle Locations 861-865).

'''Body &amp; Brain''' (also known as '''''Dahn Hak''''' or '''''Dahnhak'''''), formerly called '''Dahn Yoga''', is a business  founded in 1985 by [[Ilchi Lee]] that teaches a [[Korea]]n physical exercise system called Dahn Yoga. In Korean, ''dahn'' means "primal, vital energy", and ''hak'' means "study of a particular [[theory]] or [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name="DYB"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dahn Yoga Education |title=Dahn Yoga Basics |publisher=Healing Society |year=2006 |isbn=1-932843-17-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; News sources have described its exercises as "a blend of yoga, tai chi, and martial arts exercises". Dahn Yoga is taught through for-profit and non-profit studios as well as community centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=345896&amp;paper=72&amp;cat=104 |title=Lake Braddock Students Learn How To Give Back |publisher=Connectionnewspapers.com |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilchi Lee's brain education is considered pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="Goldacre" /&gt;

== Training methods ==
[[Image:CenterPhoto3(vyW-11945).jpg|thumb|People practicing Dahn yoga at a Body &amp; Brain Center.]]
According to ''Dahn Yoga Basics'', a book published by Dahn Yoga Education, Dahn Yoga has "three unique characteristics": "the mastery and use of energy", "enhancing the body-brain connection", and "self-managed, holistic health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dahn Yoga Education |title=Dahn Yoga Basics |publisher=Healing Society |year=2006 |pages=15–16 |isbn=1-932843-17-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice draws upon traditional notions of ki, also known as chi or [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dahn Yoga Education |title=Dahn Yoga Basics |publisher=Healing Society |year=2006 |pages=21–29 |isbn=1-932843-17-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical class begins with what is called "Meridian Stretching" exercise, which is believed to stimulate the energy in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dahn Yoga Education |title=Dahn Yoga Basics |publisher=Healing Society |year=2006 |page=45 |isbn=1-932843-17-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these stretching exercises, practitioners normally follow a sequence of postures. Classes often include elements of meditation, as well.&lt;ref name="DYB"/&gt;

An article by three physicians from [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] published in the ''Journal of General Internal Medicine'' reported the conclusions of a 3-month study of community-based mind-body training methods. The study surveyed 171 adults enrolled at various Body &amp; Brain Centers in the [[New York City]] area. All of the participants had taken ten or fewer classes at the beginning of the study.  The article concludes that participants reported "moderate improvements after 3 months of practice" with increased scores "in all [of the surveyed] domains of health-related quality of life, fewer depressive symptoms, less trait anxiety, and greater self-efficacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee SW |author2=Mancuso CA |author3=Charlson ME |title=Prospective study of new participants in a community-based mind-body training program |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=760–5 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15209590 |pmc=1492489 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30011.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain Wave Vibration===

''Brain Wave Vibration'' is promoted as a mental and physical health enhancement technique developed by Ilchi Lee. According to Lee, brain waves are a type of vibration that has a significant effect on a person’s health and outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwavevibration.com/learn/ |title=Learn The Method: Brain Wave Vibration |publisher=Brainwavevibration.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of moving meditation (head-shaking), the technique was described by one Body &amp; Brain instructor: "By shaking your head and vibrating your body, you bring healing energy. You just need to close your eyes and turn your head right and left, right and left, focusing on the center of your brain and keeping a rhythm. Afterwards, you feel very rejuvenated!"&lt;ref name="neighbornewspapers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbornewspapers.com/detail.html?sub_id=165559&amp;edit_result=live&amp;msg=Item+saved |title=Aging Gracefully with Yoga, Humor, and Joy |publisher=Neighbor Newspapers |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of CNN's three-part investigation into controversy and lawsuits surrounding Dahn Yoga, Neurosurgeon [[Dr. Sanjay Gupta]] was asked about testimonials that Brain Wave Vibration "lowered blood pressure, corrected lazy eyes, [and] even reduced symptoms of multiple sclerosis."  Gupta stated that the notion of vibrating the brain or other parts of the body to turn parts of the brain on and off is not grounded in science and that anecdotes are not empirically verifiable.&lt;ref name="transcripts.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1001/08/cnr.06.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a study sponsored by Ilchi Lee's Korean Institute of Brain Science (KIBS) and published in ''Neuroscience Letters'' examined the impact of Brain Wave Vibration training. The study showed subjects who engaged in Dahn Yoga led meditation reported lower levels of stress compared to the control group, which did not practice any sort of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung|first1=Ye-Ha|last2=Kang|first2=Do-Hyung|last3=Jang|first3=Joon Hwan|last4=Park|first4=Hye Yoon|last5=Byun|first5=Min Soo|last6=Kwon|first6=Soo Jin|last7=Jang|first7=Go-Eun|last8=Lee|first8=Ul Soon|last9=An|first9=Seung Chan|last10=Kwon|first10=Jun Soo|title=The effects of mind-body training on stress reduction, positive affect, and plasma catecholamines|journal=Neuroscience Letters|date=26 July 2010|volume=479|issue=2|pages=138–142|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.05.048|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394010006336|accessdate=20 July 2015|pmid=20546836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another KIBS-sponsored study published in ''Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' showed that Brain Wave Vibration meditation reduced stress similarly to Iyengar Yoga and Mindfulness meditation.&lt;ref name="Evidence-Based Complementary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowden|first1=Deborah|last2=Gaudry|first2=Claire|last3=Seung Chan|first3=An|last4=Gruzelier|first4=John|title=A Comparative Randomised Controlled Trial of the Effects of Brain Wave Vibration Training, Iyengar Yoga, and Mindfulness on Mood, Well-Being, and Salivary Cortisol|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=12 September 2011|volume=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/234713|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/234713/|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain Education===
The tradenames ''Brain Education'', and ''Brain Education Systems Training'' (or BEST), refer to a set of exercises developed and promoted by Ilchi Lee subsequent to his "Brain Respiration" and "Dahnhak."  According to Body &amp; Brain's Web site, after more than 27 years of practice, Lee had developed a system of exercises, breathing, and stretches “to activate the natural healing rhythms of the brain and body.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dahnyoga.com/classes_services/brain_education |title=Classes combining Yoga, Tai chi, Meditation |publisher=Dahn Yoga |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brain Education is described as consisting of five separate steps: brain sensitizing, brain versatilizing, brain refreshing, brain integrating, and brain mastering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Dr. [[Ben Goldacre]] of the U.K. lambasted Ilchi Lee's brain education claims as [[pseudoscience]] in his [[The Guardian|Guardian]] column "Bad Science" in 2004.&lt;ref name="Goldacre"&gt;Goldacre, Ben (October 28, 2004). [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/oct/28/badscience.science "brain sensitising"] ''Bad Science column, Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1985 the first Dahn Yoga Center opened in downtown [[Seoul]].  By 1990, fifty locations were teaching Dahn Yoga in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/dahn_yoga_video/history/prweb8202558.htm |title=Dahn Yoga Video Introduces History and Growth of Dahn Yoga Founded by Ilchi Lee |date=2011-03-12 |publisher=[[PR Web]], [[Dahn Yoga]] |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1991, the first U.S. Dahn Yoga Center was opened in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  In 1997 the [[Sedona]] Ilchi Meditation Center (SIMC) was established, hosting specialized programs open to Dahn yoga members for a fee.  Over the next ten years Dahn yoga focused on expanding its operations globally.

The Dahn Yoga Foundation was created in 2006, offering classes for free or at reduced rates in senior centers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&amp;p_theme=oktb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(Fremont's%20Holy%20Family%20sisters%20enjoy%20yoga%20class)%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Fremont's%20Holy%20Family%20sisters%20enjoy%20yoga%20class%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no Fremont's Holy Family sisters enjoy yoga class].

In late 2015, Dahn Yoga changed its name to Body &amp; Brain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bodynbrain.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
There have been accusations that the organization operates a manipulative "[[cult]]" that uses [[coercive persuasion]] and [[Mind control|thought reform]] methods to create deeply devoted Dahn masters (teachers) who persuade others to devote all their time, energy, and money to Body &amp; Brain programs, events, and ceremonies, and to become loyal Dahn masters themselves.

In 2002, a former Body &amp; Brain employee filed a civil lawsuit in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[California]], for Unfair Business Practices and Undue Influence against Seung Heun Lee, et al. The case was reportedly settled out of court with no admission of guilt.

Several popular media outlets reported on the plaintiffs' allegations, including [[Glamour Magazine]], [[WE tv]], and [[CNN]]; [[WBZ-TV|WBZ Channel 4 News]] in Boston interviewed two of the claimants on June 11, 2009.

On January 5, 2010, [[CNN]] broadcast a critical report about the organization with interviews of former Brain &amp; Body members alleging severe physical, mental and [[financial abuse]] by Brain &amp; Body personnel and staff, including one former member stating she was coerced into donating funds to the organization by taking out student loans totalling over US$40,000. Allegations were dismissed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona August 25, 2010.

[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Magazine]] published an article in March 2010 entitled "The Yoga Cult" alleging that "Dahn's calling itself 'yoga' is just a marketing ploy to enhance its appeal to Americans;" that instead it is a mind control cult designed to part people from their money. According to the article, the group brought in $30 million in the U.S. in 2009 and charges as much as $100,000 for a seminar.

An article in [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] in July 2009 contained similar allegations against Body &amp; Brain. It reported allegations by former members that they were pressured to train to become paid “Dahn Masters,” paying up to $10,000 each for workshops that lasted as long as three weeks. If students could not afford the training, the article states, they were encouraged to take out loans and carry credit card debt. Plaintiffs in a suit against the group claim that once they became "Dahn Masters" they were then given recruitment and revenue quotas that had them working up to 120 hours per week.

=== Wrongful Death Suit ===
Among other media reports, a 2006 [[CBS]] news report and the [[Village Voice]] described a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit filed against Body &amp; Brain's founder and related entities. According to the lawsuit, Julia Siverls, 41, died in 2003 from [[heat stroke]] and [[dehydration]] during a master training hike at the Ilchi Meditation Center in [[Sedona]]. The lawsuit also accuses the Lee of "breaking wage and immigration laws, evading taxes and sexually abusing female disciples." According to a document filed by the Southern District of New York of the United States District Court, the case was dismissed on August 1, 2008.

'''Catholic Charismatic Renewal''' is a spiritual movement within the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] that incorporates aspects of both Catholic and [[Charismatic Movement]] practice. It is influenced by some of the teachings of [[Protestantism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] with an emphasis on having a personal relationship with [[Jesus]] and expressing the gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=csordas/&gt;

Parishes that practice charismatic worship usually hold [[prayer meeting]]s outside of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and feature such gifts as [[prophecy]],  [[faith healing]], and [[glossolalia]]. In [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], a Catholic church describes charismatic worship as "uplifted hands during songs and audible praying in tongues." It further distinguishes a charismatic congregation as one that emphasises complete surrender to Jesus in all parts of life, obedience to both the [[Gospel]] and Catholic teaching, as well as Christ-centred friendships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc.net/lansing/ctk/welcome/index.html Christ the King Catholic Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507192431/http://www.rc.net/lansing/ctk/welcome/index.html |date=2006-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Surely there are better authorities on this than a single church in Ann Arbor, Michigan|date=August 2016}}

Perceptions of the Charismatic movement vary within the Catholic Church. Proponents hold the belief that certain ''charismata'' (a Greek word for "gifts") are still bestowed by the Holy Spirit today as they were in [[Early Christianity]] as described in the [[Bible]]. Critics accuse Charismatic Catholics of misinterpreting, or in some cases violating, Church teachings on worship and liturgy. [[Traditional Catholicism|Traditional Catholics]], in particular, argue that charismatic practices shift the focus of worship away from reverent communion with Christ in the [[Eucharist]] and towards individual emotions and non-liturgical experiences as a substitute.

==Theological foundations==
[[File:El Greco 006.jpg|thumb|right|Pentecost by [[El Greco]]]]
Renewal advocates believe that the [[charism]]s identified in [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s writings, especially in {{bibleverse||Romans|12:6-8|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12-14|NRSV}}, and {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:11-12|NRSV}}, continue to exist and to build up the Church (see [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], §2003). The nine charismatic gifts considered extraordinary in character include: faith, expression of knowledge and [[wisdom]], miracles, the gift of [[Glossolalia|tongues]] and their interpretation, prophecy, discernment of spirits and healing.({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:8-10|NRSV}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2003.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 2nd ed., §2003 (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; These gifts are related to the traditional seven gifts of the Holy Spirit described in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:1-2|NRSV}} (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, as listed in Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1831). The nine charismatic gifts in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:8-10|NRSV}} are also related to the [[spiritual works of mercy|spiritual]] and [[corporal works of mercy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2447.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 2nd ed., §2447 (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other references to charisms in the Catechism of the Catholic Church include §§688, 768, 799-801, 890, 951, 1508 ([[charism of healing]]) and 2035.  The belief that spiritual gifts exist in the present age is called [[Continuationism]].

==Origins==
In search of a Spiritual experience, professors from [[Duquesne University]], a Catholic university in Pittsburgh, attended the Congress of the Cursillo movement in August 1966. While visiting, they were introduced to the book entitled ''[[The Cross and the Switchblade]]'', which emphasized the Holy Spirit and the Spirit’s charisms. This book became the focus of their studies and further led them to pursue the Holy Spirit.

In January 1967, professors Ralph Keifer and Patrick Bourgeois attended a prayer meeting where they ultimately received the [[baptism in the Holy Spirit]]. The following week, Keifer laid hands on other Duquesne professors, and they also had an experience with the Spirit.  Then, in February, during a gathering of Duquesne University students at The Ark and The Dove Retreat Center north of Pittsburgh, more people asked Keifer to pray over them. This led to the event at the chapel where they too received the Holy Spirit and [[Glossolalia|spoke in tongues]], as well as many other students who were present in the chapel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Catholic Pentecostalism|last = Laurentin|first = Rene|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company|year = 1977|isbn = 0385121296|location = New York|pages = 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keifer sent the news of this event to the University of Notre Dame, where a similar event later occurred, and the Renewal began to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charisma and Community|last = Neitz|first = Mary Jo|publisher = Transaction|year = 1987|isbn = 0887381308|location = New Jersey|pages = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==
Adherents of the movement formed prayer groups called covenant communities. In these communities, members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities was the Word of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world.&lt;ref name=csordas&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global religion and the re-enchantment of the world: The case of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal|last = Csordas|first = Thomas J.|date = September 2007|journal = Anthropological Theory |volume=7 |number=3 |doi=10.1177/1463499607080192 |pmid = |pages = 295–314}}&lt;!--|access-date = 27 January 2016 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the covenant institutions, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal also experienced international development due to missionary priests who experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit while visiting the United States and implemented their own such services when they returned home. The International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services had a significant role in the guidance of this form of expansion.&lt;ref name=csordas/&gt;

==Catholic Charismatic Renewal today==

[[File:Tarxien erwieh.jpg|thumb|left|Praise and Worship during a CCR Healing Service.]]
As of 2013, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal exists in over 230 countries in the world and 120 [[List of primary local government units of the Philippines|primary local government units of the Philippines]], with over 160 million members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2269/the_charismatic_renewal_and_the_catholic_church.aspx  Nucci, Alessandra. "The Charismatic Renewal and the Catholic Church", ''The Catholic World Report'', May 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Renewal also cooperate with non-Catholic ecclesiastical communities and other Catholics for ecumenism, as encouraged by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html Pope John Paul II, "Ut Unum Sint", §40, May 25, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charismatic element of the Church is seen as being evident today as it was in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic communities conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to be felt, and [[healing]]s and [[miracle]]s are said to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maranathamalta.com/ Marana tha' Malta]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a [[personal relationship with Jesus Christ]]; a one-to-one relationship with [[Jesus]] is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what [[The Lord]] is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the [[Fruit of the Spirit]] in {{bibleverse||Galatians|5:22-23|NRSV}}, this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. [[Conscience]] is seen as an alternative voice of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell &amp; Montague, ''Christian Initiation and Baptism in the Holy Spirit: Evidence from the First Eight Centuries'', Michael Glazier Books, 1990.

===CCR Golden Jubilee 2017===
In response to the invitation of Pope Francis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146656297 |title=Video of Pope's Invitation,|accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICCRS and Catholic Fraternity are organizing together the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Golden Jubilee event in 2017. The event began on May 31 and celebrations continued until Pentecost Mass on June 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrgoldenjubilee2017.org/|title=Homepage of the event |accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction from the Church hierarchy==
[[File:John Paul II Medal of Freedom 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Pope John Paul II]]
The initial reaction to the movement by the Church hierarchy was cautiously supportive. Some initially supported it as being a harbinger of [[ecumenism]] (greater unity of Gospel witness among the different Christian traditions). It was thought that these practices would draw the Catholic Church and Protestant communities closer together in a truly spiritual ecumenism. Today, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal enjoys support from most of the Church's hierarchy, from the Pope to bishops of dioceses around the world, as a recognized ecclesial movement.&lt;ref name=hisp/&gt;&lt;ref name=frat/&gt;&lt;ref name=iccro/&gt;&lt;ref name=pent/&gt;

Four popes have acknowledged the movement: [[Pope Paul VI]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Benedict XVI]], and [[Pope Francis]].{{citation needed|reason=No specific reference for Pope Francis in this article.|date=January 2016}}  Pope Paul VI acknowledged the movement in 1971 and reaffirmed it in 1975.&lt;ref name=csordas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Preferential Option for the Spirit: The Catholic Charismatic Renewal in Latin America's New Religious Economy|last = Chesnut|first = R. Andrew|date = 2003|journal = Latin American Politics and Society|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that the movement brought vitality and joy to the Church but also mentioned for people to be discerning of the spirits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pope John Paul II was also supportive of the Renewal and was in favor of its conservative politics.&lt;ref name=csordas/&gt; He (as well as then-Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI) acknowledged good aspects of the movement while urging caution, pointing out that members must maintain their Catholic identity and communion with the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=hisp&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/CSSR/Current/2008/Sobrino%20-%20Church%20&amp;%20P.A..pdf|title = Hispanics and the Future of the Catholic Church in the United States|accessdate = 1 May 2015|page = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623072810/http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/CSSR/Current/2008/Sobrino%20-%20Church%20%26%20P.A..pdf|archivedate = 23 June 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]], in particular, made a number of statements on the movement.  On November 30, 1990, The Pontifical Council for the Laity promulgated the decree which inaugurated the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships. Brian Smith of Brisbane, elected President of the Executive of the Fraternity, called the declaration the most significant event in the history of the charismatic renewal since the 1975 Holy Year international conference and the acknowledgment it received from Pope Paul VI at that time, saying: "It is the first time that the Renewal has had formal, canonical recognition by the Vatican."&lt;ref name=frat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastornet.net.au/renewal/journal3/commadeu.html |title=Fraternity of Covenant Communities: November 30, 1990 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810153406/http://www.pastornet.net.au/renewal/journal3/commadeu.html |archive-date=2008-08-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] stated &lt;blockquote&gt;At this moment in the Church's history, the Charismatic Renewal can play a significant role in promoting the much-needed defense of Christian life in societies where secularism and materialism have weakened many people's ability to respond to the Spirit and to [[Universal call to holiness|discern God's loving call]]. Your contribution to the re-evangelization of society will be made in the first place by personal witness to the indwelling Spirit and by showing forth His presence through works of holiness and solidarity.&lt;ref name=iccro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccc.garg.com/ccc/articles/John_Paul/John_Paul_001.html |title=Address of Pope John Paul II to the ICCRO Council: March 12, 1992 |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131946/http://ccc.garg.com/ccc/articles/John_Paul/John_Paul_001.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Moreover, during Pentecost 1998, the Pope recognized the essential nature of the charismatic dimension:

"The institutional and charismatic aspects are co-essential as it were to the Church’s constitution. They contribute, although differently, to the life, renewal and sanctification of God’s People. It is from this providential rediscovery of the Church’s charismatic dimension that, before and after the Council, a remarkable pattern of growth has been established for ecclesial movements and new communities."&lt;ref name=pent&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_pc_laity_doc_27051998_movements-speech-hf_en.html Pentecost Address 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Papal Preacher]], [[Raniero Cantalamessa|Rev. Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa]], has written on the topic numerous times since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cantalamessa.org/en/libri.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314180703/http://www.cantalamessa.org/en/libri.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-03-14 |title=P. Raniero Cantalamessa, ofmcap: Bibliography |accessdate=2007-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Charismatic Catholics and their practices have been criticized for distracting Catholics from authentic Church teachings and traditions, especially by making the worship experience more akin to Pentecostal [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignitumtoday.com/2014/01/30/charismatics-context/ Charismatics in Context]. Ignitum Today. Published: 30 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel Rodriguez]], Charismatic services in America simply help in increasing the number of Catholics converting to Pentecostal and evangelical denominations: “If you are involved in a Charismatic service today, in ten years’ time—inevitably—you are going to end up in one of my churches.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21646001-even-religion-america-offers-more-choice-pick-and-mix |newspaper=The Economist |title=Pick and mix |date=March 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church teaches that Christ is [[Real Presence|actually present]] on the altar in the sacrifice of the Mass, when a priest consecrates bread and wine to become [[Eucharist|the body and blood of Jesus]]. Critics of the charismatic movement argue that practices such as faith healing draw attention away from the Mass and the communion with Christ that takes place therein.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Others criticize the movement for removing or obscuring traditional Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix and [[Sacred Heart]]) in favor of more contemporary expressions of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianorder.com/features/features_2003/features_feb03.html |title=Teresa Barrett, "Beware RENEW," ''Christian Order'', February 2003 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief that extraordinary spiritual gifts no longer operate in ordinary circumstances is called [[Cessationism]].

'''Charles De Koninck''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|MSRC}} (29 July 1906 – 13 February 1965) was a Belgian-Canadian [[Thomist]] philosopher and theologian. As director of the Department of Philosophy at the [[Université Laval]] in [[Quebec]], he influenced Catholic philosophy in [[French Canada]] and also influenced Catholic philosophers in [[English Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The author of many books and articles in French and English, he contributed to a variety of philosophical fields including [[natural philosophy]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[political philosophy]], but he also wrote on theology, especially [[Mariology]].

De Koninck was the founder of the so-called Laval School of philosophy, and mentored a number of philosophers, including [[Ralph McInerny]], who published an English translation of De Koninck's collected works.

De Koninck was born in [[Torhout]], [[Belgium]], the son of Louis De Koninck and Marie Verplancke, both natives of Torhout. In 1914, the De Koninck family emigrated to the United States, where Louis De Koninck worked as a builder and contractor in Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref name="Vaughan2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey M. Vaughan|title=Leo Strauss and His Catholic Readers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ls9ZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=11 May 2018|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-3043-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Charles returned to Belgium to complete his education. He first went to school in [[Ostende]], where he studied mainly mathematics, chemistry, and physics, but where he also read widely in Latin, Greek, Dutch, and English Literature.&lt;ref name="BrownCollinson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart Brown|author2=Diane Collinson|author3=Robert Wilkinson|title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|date=10 September 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92796-8|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied philosophy at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], where he became a [[Thomism|Thomist]]. After attending the [[University of Detroit]], he returned to Louvain and earned a doctorate [[summa cum laude]] with a dissertation on Sir [[Arthur Eddington]]'s philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Fortin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest L.

==Career==

In 1934, De Koninck began work at the Université Laval in Quebec, where he became a full professor the following year, a position which he held for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Wallace1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A Wallace|title=The Modeling of Nature: Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of Nature in Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohxdaJqcRf8C&amp;pg=PA227|year=1996|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0860-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1939 and 1956 he was dean of the faculty of philosophy at Laval.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charles-de-koninck/ "Charles De Koninck"].

As member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], De Koninck and his family hosted and entertained many well-known people in their Quebec City residence, among them [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] and his writer-artist wife, [[Consuelo de Saint Exupéry|Consuelo Suncín]] during their five-week stay in the province in the spring of 1942. The De Konincks' eight-year-old son, [[Thomas De Koninck]], whom Saint-Exupéry met, may have served as an inspiration for the extraterrestrial visitor of his well-known [[novella]], ''[[The Little Prince]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Provencher, [http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201503/21/01-4854419-thomas-de-koninck-lhomme-aux-1001-questions.php "Thomas De Koninck: l'homme aux 1001 questions"].

''Global News'', February 15, 2016. By Raquel Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of nature==
De Koninck devoted a good portion of his philosophical work to the philosophy of nature.&lt;ref name="Canada1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Society of Canada|title=Mémoires Et Comptes Rendus de la Société Royale Du Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUyAQAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Royal Society of Canada.|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Koninck's graduate career at Louvain led him to write a dissertation under Fernand Renoirte, himself a philosopher of science, on the philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revue philosophique de Louvain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDnkAAAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Éditions de l'Institut Supérieur de Philosophie.|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation attempted to parlay between classical Thomistic philosophy and Eddington's philosophy of science, shaped by recent developments in relativity theory and quantum theory.

While De Koninck's initial view of the relationship between philosophy and the experimental sciences followed a separatist line akin to that of [[Jacques Maritain]], a later development in his thinking portrayed the modern sciences as "dialectical extensions" of metaphysics and, more proximately, the philosophy of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brungardt (2016), pp. 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his career, De Koninck published articles addressing overlapping issues in classical Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy and quantum indeterminism, the biological sciences, the foundation of mathematical physics, and the philosophy of mathematics. The most accessible introduction to his thought in the philosophy of nature and science are his Whidden Lectures of 1959, published as a collection titled ''The Hollow Universe''. In the three lectures, De Koninck addresses the philosophical foundations, content, and implications of three modern scientific inquiries: modern mathematics ("The World of Symbolic Construction, or Two is One Twice Over"), physics ("Mental Construction and the Test of Experience"), and biology ("The Lifeless World of Biology"). The epilogue to the book, "Reckoning with the Computers," extends the theme of the hollow universe from the realm of mathematics, physics, and biology to the account of man himself. Scholar Leslie Armour maintains that "our place as knowing beings suggests to De Koninck that nature and knowing beings are so designed as to go together, and so designed as to be unintelligible without one another."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Armour, "The Philosophy of Charles De Koninck," in: De Koninck (2008), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Common good" controversy==
Along with [[Henri Grenier]] and Louis Lachance, De Koninck was a prominent Thomist critic of [[personalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie Martin-Hubbard, [http://erudit.org/revue/mensaf/2005/v6/n1/1024255ar.pdf “Incursion personnaliste chez les thomistes canadiens-français des années 1930 et 1940 : l’exemple de François Hertel ”]&lt;/ref&gt; De Koninck's book ''On the Primacy of the Common Good: Against the Personalists'' criticized personalist thinkers for claiming that the common good ought to be subordinate to the private good of persons.&lt;ref name="Guilbeau2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aquinas Guilbeau|title=Charles de Koninck's Defense of the Primacy of the Common Good|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1mwAQAACAAJ|year=2016|publisher=University of Fribourg (Switzerland)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francesca Aran Murphy|title=Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC&amp;pg=PA243|year=2004|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-6238-7|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Koninck did not name the personalists whom he had in mind, but [[Yves Simon]] and  I. Th. Eschmann assumed that he was thinking of [[Jacques Maritain]]. Yves Simon agreed with De Koninck's rejection of the subordination of the common good to the person, but denied that it applied to Maritain. Eschmann, on the other hand, defended the subordination of the common good to the person and claimed that this was in fact taught by Maritain.&lt;ref name="Dewan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Dewan|title=Wisdom, Law, and Virtue: Essays in Thomistic Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RwKiqay4h4C&amp;pg=PA279|year=2008|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-2796-9|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McInerny1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph McInerny|title=Art and Prudence: Studies in the Thought of Jacques Maritain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pnZAAAAMAAJ|date=1 November 1988|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|isbn=978-0-268-00619-8|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convers Francis''' (November 9, 1795 – April 17, 1863) was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister from [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].

==Life and work==
He was born the son of Susannah Rand Francis and Convers Francis, and named after his father. His sister, [[Lydia Maria Child|Lydia Maria]], later became an important reformer.

Francis studied to become a minister at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He was minister of the Watertown, Massachusetts, Unitarian Church from 1819 to 1842. Francis taught [[Theodore Parker]] beginning in 1832 and preached at his ordination ceremony in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 117. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis encouraged Parker when his translations and books were not selling well. He wrote of his "astonishment at your labors and learning", but criticized the recent lack of interest in reading, writing "the cry is all for action—for doing something, not moping over books as they say".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 119. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Francis and Parker joined the [[Transcendental Club]] in the 1830s, an organization which included members such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Margaret Fuller]]. Being one of the elders of the group, in fact the eldest member who was also a moderator of the Club, he influenced other members. Preaching at a time when Unitarians were breaking into sometimes-hostile factions in New England, he wrote that "the condition of things with us in the religious world is anything but pleasant... The cauldron is kept boiling, &amp; all sorts of materials are thrown into it".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 148. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1842, Francis was Parkman Professor of Pulpit Eloquence at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. His books and writings include ''Christianity as a Purely Internal Principle,'' ''[https://archive.org/stream/johneliot00fran#page/n9/mode/2up Life of John Eliot, Apostle to the Indians]'' and ''A Historical Sketch of Watertown'' (1830). He died in 1863, one year after Transcendental Club co-member Henry David Thoreau died.

'''Cora Diamond''' (born 1937)&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/gnd/1025941004/about/html DNB]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[American philosopher]] who works on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of language]], and philosophy and literature. She is currently the Kenan Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the [[University of Virginia]].

==Work==
One of Diamond's most famous articles, "What Nonsense Might Be", criticizes the way that the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] think about nonsense on [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] grounds (see [[category mistake]]). Another well-known article, "Eating Meat and Eating People", examines the rhetorical and philosophical nature of contemporary attitudes towards [[animal rights]]. Diamond's writings on both "early" (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' era) and "late" (''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' era) Wittgenstein have made her a leading influence in the [[New Wittgenstein|New Wittgenstinian]] approach advanced by [[Alice Crary]], [[James F. Conant]], and others.

Diamond has published a collection of essays titled ''The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind.'' She is the editor of ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics: Cambridge 1939,'' a collection of lectures assembled from the notes of Wittgenstein's students [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and R. G. Bosanquet.

''Wittgenstein and the Moral Life: Essays in Honor of Cora Diamond'' (edited by [[Alice Crary]]&lt;ref&gt;http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/wittgenstein-and-moral-life&lt;/ref&gt;) features essays by [[Alice Crary|Crary]], [[John McDowell]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Stanley Cavell]], and [[James F. Conant]], among others.

Diamond received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1957 and her [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] from [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] in 1961.

==Contrast with experience==
One may experience physical objects using the five senses. In contrast, one may counter-experience revelation, a spiritual presence, or an awareness. Feelings of [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] or awe are often indicators of counter-experience.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Kevin (2005) [http://www.pacifica.org.au/volumes/volume18/issue03/poetry-and-revelation-hopkins-counterexperience Poetry and Revelation: Hopkins, Counter-Experience and ''Reductio''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304144024/http://www.pacifica.org.au/volumes/volume18/issue03/poetry-and-revelation-hopkins-counterexperience/ |date=2011-03-04 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5369">In [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], '''culturalism (new humanism''' or '''Znaniecki's humanism''') is the central importance of culture as an organizing force in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-214"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187" /&gt; It was originally coined by the Polish-American philosopher and sociologist [[Florian Znaniecki]] in his book ''[[Cultural Reality]]'' (1919) in English and later translated into Polish as ''kulturalizm''.  Znaniecki had introduced a similar concept in earlier Polish language publications which he described as ''humanism'' (''humanizm'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Znaniecki's culturalism was based on philosophies and theories of [[Matthew Arnold]] ([[Culture and Anarchy]]), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]), [[Henri Bergson]] ([[creative evolutionism]]), [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] ([[philosophy of life]]), [[William James]], [[John Dewey]]  ([[pragmatism]]) and [[Ferdinand C.

Znaniecki was critical of a number of then-prevalent philosophical viewpoints: [[intellectualism]],&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[idealism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Kawecki|chapter=Heroism and Intimacy of Post-modern Morality|editor1=Bo Stråth|editor2=Nina Witoszek|title=The Postmodern Challenge: Perspectives East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2FeRqCaOgoC&amp;pg=PA129|year=1999|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0755-0|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophical realism|realism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt; [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; He was also critical of [[irrationalism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
In response to these criticisms, Znaniecki proposed a new theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"&gt;Sztompka (2002), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; His "culturalism" was an [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] approach aiming to eliminate dualisms such as the belief that nature and culture are opposite realities.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;

This approach allowed him to "define [[social phenomena]] in cultural terms".&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"/&gt; Znaniecki was arguing for the importance of [[culture]], noting that our culture shapes our view of the world and our thinking.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-187-188"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Znaniecki notes that while the world is composed of physical artifacts, we are not really capable of studying the physical world other than through the lenses of culture.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-189"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the fundamental aspects of the philosophy of culturalism are two categories: value and action.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt; [[Elżbieta Hałas]], who calls it an "antithesis to the intellectual dogmas of naturalism", identifies the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;
* "The subject-object dualism must be overcome and thought should be united with reality."
* "Reality is not an absolute order but changes in a creative evolution."
* "All images of the world are relative."
* "It is false to oppose nature and culture or to subordinate culture to nature."
* "Value is the most general category of the description of reality."

Znaniecki's philosophy of culturalism laid the foundation for his larger theoretical system, based around another concept of his, "[[humanistic coefficient]]."&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-55"&gt;Hałas (2010), pp. 55, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Through originally a philosophical concept,&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; culturalism was further developed by Znaniecki to inform his sociological theories.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-51"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Znaniecki's culturalism influenced modern sociological views of [[antipositivism]] and [[antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalism]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"&gt;Sztompka (2002), p. 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Disjunctivism''' is a position in the [[philosophy of perception]] that rejects the existence of [[sense data]] in certain cases. The [[disjunction]] is between appearance and the reality behind the appearance "making itself perceptually manifest to someone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Veridical perception]]s and [[hallucination]]s are not members of a common class of mental states or events.  According to this theory, the only thing common to veridical perceptions and hallucinations is that in both cases, the subject cannot tell, via introspection, whether he is having a veridical perception or not.  Disjunctivists claim this because they hold that in veridical perception, a subject's experience actually presents the external, mind-independent object of that perception.  Further, they claim that in a hallucination there is no external object to be related to, nor are there [[sense-data]] to be a part of the perception.  Thus, disjunctivism is a form of [[naive realism]] or [[direct realism]].

Disjunctivism was first introduced to the contemporary literature by [[J. M. Hinton|Michael Hinton]], and has subsequently been associated with [[John McDowell]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Hinton "Experiences: an inquiry into some ambiguities", (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. McDowell "Criteria, Defeasibility and Knowledge" ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 68 (1982) pp.455-479.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disjunctivists often hold that an important virtue of their view is that it captures the common sense idea that perception involves a relation to objects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;M.G.F Martin, "On Being Alienated" in T. Gendler and J. Hawthorne (eds) ''Perceptual Experience'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1968, '''El Mercado de Los Angeles''' is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles east of the LA River and adjacent to East Los Angeles (an unincorporated portion of the County of Los Angeles often cited as the heart of the Mexican/American community) on the corner of 1st Street and Lorena Street and is accessible by the Metro Gold Line's [[Indiana (Los Angeles Metro station)|Indiana Station]] located two blocks east.  El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. Although El Mercado is themed and represents a space that honors [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican culture]], other Latinos from different ethnicities visit and shop there.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/history.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indoor shopping and meeting place, El Mercado also provides economic agency for Latinos as vendors selling music and films, exotic boots, belts, hats, a jewelry store, Mexican handcrafts, toys, cosmetics and services such as travel and sending money to their natal communities.&lt;ref name="Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barros-Nock|first=Magdalena|title=Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives for Mexican Immigrants: The Case of San Joaquin Valley|journal=Human Organization|date=2 September 2009|volume=68|issue=3|pages=307–317|url=http://sfaa.metapress.com/content/6550852777144576/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through selling and bartering Latino vendors engage in market exchanges that give agency to both the buyer and seller. El Mercado de Los Angeles is a place where Latinos can gather together for social purposes and to enjoy cultural experiences through food, music, and other forms of semiotics such as the paintings on the buildings and a mural of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgen de Guadalupe]] that link them to their native lands.

== Cultural de-territorialization and identity ==
In East Los Angeles, Latinos constitute approximately 97.1% of the population.&lt;ref name="East Los Angeles demographic information"&gt;{{cite web|title=East Los Angeles Demographic Data|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/East-Los-Angeles-California.html|publisher=CityData.com|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy population of Latinos in [[Eastside Los Angeles|East Los Angeles]] demonstrates the appropriation of space due to the process of [[deterritorialization|de-territorialization]]. De-territorialization of culture refers to the weakening relationships between culture and place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deterritorialization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many thought of culture restricted in localized terms, that is cultural was rooted to a particular geographical area, nation, or state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as East Los Angeles proves different, Latinos as cultural subjects, continue to traverse national borders bringing along with them their cultural practices and traditions in different territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorialization on the other hand can be more understood as the process of turning a space into a place, as explained by Clara Irazabal and Ramzi Farhart in their article “Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irazábal|first=Clara|author2=Ramzi Farhat|title=Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|year=2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=207|doi=10.1177/0885412207310146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affirmations of belonging and community space ==
El Mercado is place that allows Latinos to assert their identity to foster a sense of belonging and build an intimate community space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lourdes Gutierrez Nájera explains in her article “Hayandoese: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging” how Yalaltecos communities in Los Angeles affirm their identity and create a sense of ethnic belonging and community through participation in life cycle events and every day practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “Swap meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: a community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods”, Jeffrey Edwin Juarez describes swap meets as regular meeting spaces that people treat as recreation places, much like a park, to spend time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juarez|first=Jeffery Edwin|title=Swap Meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: A community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods|year=2011|page=12|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/69455|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Mercado is a community pace for Latino’s for both local’s and visitors to interact, spend time together and share experiences. One way El Mercado fosters its community space is through its large restaurant located on the third floor popularly known as El Mercadito, which is actually themed in to three different restaurants representing different cities of Mexico that make up the one large restaurant.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt; El Mercadito restaurant is widely used by families and friends as a community space to make reservations for birthday celebrations, wedding receptions, quincenera receptions, and other banquet purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Mercadito Restaurant Directory|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/reservaciones/reservation.html|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic agency at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles serves a significant economic purpose for Latinos in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles region]]. For the customers at El Mercado, the mercado provides affordable items that make shopping accessible for people across income levels. Also importantly, mercados foster relationships between vendors.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherry|first=John F.|title=A Sociocultural Analysis of A Midwestern American Flea Market|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1990|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.1086/208533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between vendors exists, but mercados in general often function as sites of both economic competition and collaboration between vendors within the mercado.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"/&gt; The sense of competition is increased between the relationship between vendor and customer.

At swap meets, or mercados like El Mercado, complex relationships exist between buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf|title=A Naturalistic Inquiry Into Buyer and Seller Behavior at a Swapmeet|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=March 1988|volume=14|issue=4|page=457|doi=10.1086/209128|first1=Russell W.|last2=Sherry, Jr.|first2=John F.|last3=Wallendorf|first3=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercados are less bureaucratic spaces that corporate stores or even independent businesses.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"/&gt; Vendors must apply for a permit at El Mercado, yet the vendors frequently make informal exchanges such as bartering/trading, or bargaining for prices. These informal market exchanges give [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to both the buyer and seller because each have a role in setting the terms of the business transaction. El Mercado de Los Ángeles not only provides cultural significance to the consumers who come to it, but it also provides a space for affordable items and economic negotiation.

== Monetary and cultural remittances at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles offers a variety of services that help send off monetary remittances to [[Latin America]]. The Mercado also provides travel and calling services that help customers participate in the formation of cultural remittances to Latin America.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt;

=== Monetary remittances at El Mercado ===
El Mercado also serves as an important site of cultural and monetary remittances between the United States and [[México]], specifically. This mercado is a site of cultural that is the product of cultural hybridities. It is also a site that actively constructs cultural hybridities in the United States and México. El Mercado offers services to send money back to México securely as well as offering a [[bureau de change|currency exchange]] between [[peso]]s and United States dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are able to send monetary remittance home to México by using the services at the Mercado. These services also assist vendors at the Mercado send some of the profits that they make at the Mercado to family members or communities abroad. These remittances are often directed at families or [[hometown associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sana|first=Mariano|title=Growth of Migrant Remittances from the United States to Mexico, 1990-2004|journal=Social Forces|date=March 2008|volume=86|issue=3|page=1001|doi=10.1353/sof.0.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural remittances at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles also facilitates opportunities to create [[cultural remittances]] for Latino migrants. The mercado offers international calling services and a [[travel agency]] that sells international plane tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services aid the fluid migratory process that physically transports migrants from their countries of origin to the countries of current residence. Along with the physical transportation, the Mercado specializes in transculturated goods and items. Many of the stores specialize in traditional Mexican clothing, books, or films. Yet, these traditional items are presented in a transculturated context, outside of [[México]] or [[Latin America]]. The mercado becomes a transculturated site that participates in cultural remittance when it facilitates the physical circular migration of migrants returning to their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeño Tales of Learning and Turning|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=0415952611|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants returning home bring cultural remittances to the land that they left, and El Mercado de Los Angeles is an important site of this cultural remittance process in Los Angeles.

== Semiotic meaning-making at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles actively produces and shapes culture through a variety of ways. Semiotics describes a series of processes in which meaning is given to the world around humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans interpret visual sensory clues about the world, meaning and culture are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken |first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the mercado, mariachi music and visual murals are two principal ways that semiotic processes produce culture.

=== Mariachi at El Mercado ===
The cultural significance of El Mercado is complemented by presence of semiotic cultural elements such as music and the murals present at El Mercado. Semiotics is a process through which visuals, sounds, and other sensory experiences are given meaning and made socially significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of semiotic meaning-making is present at the mercado, especially through the mariachi restaurants. The third floor of the mercado is composed of three restaurants that are well known for not only the food but the mariachi music that they all play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariachi at El Mercado|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/mariachi-en.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolores Inés Casillas, a theorist who writes about cultural semiotics, considers listening to sound a political practice. She views nostalgic sounds from home countries as a means of remembering the home country while constructing space in the land of migration.&lt;ref name="Casillas 2010 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casillas|first=Dolores|chapter=¡Puuurrrooo MÉXICO!|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/6938122/Puuurrrooo_M%C3%89XICO_Listening_to_Transnationalism_on_U.S._Spanish-language_Radio|title=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America|editor1=Gina M. Perez|editor2=Frank A. Guridy|editor3=Adrian Burgos, Jr.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of political listening supports the idea that El Mercado de Los Angeles is an active sight of cultural production through the visuals and music present at the mercado.

=== Murals at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles website also portrays some of the several [[murals]] that are present at this marketplace. The themed [[mariachi]] restaurants on the third floor provide a visual representation that constructs a cultural space in the heart of [[Los Angeles]]. From the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] inspired dining room to an [[Aztec]] themed dining room, the mercado provides many visions of a traditional ''México lindo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo Gallery|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/photo%20album/photo_album.html|publisher=El Mercadito Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visual forms are not representations of transnational scenes, but of pastoral memories of historical scenes. These pastoral visuals represent an idealized and fond memory of areas throughout Latin America. This space provides meaningful space for the customers of El Mercado de Los Angeles and contributes to the semiotic construction of cultural hybrities at the mercado. The semiotic components of meaning-making affect the Mercado of Los Angeles as a site of economic and cultural significance.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary epistemology''' refers to three distinct topics: (1) the biological evolution of [[cognition|cognitive]] mechanisms in animals and humans, (2) a theory that knowledge itself evolves by [[natural selection]], and (3) the study of the historical discovery of new abstract entities such as abstract number or abstract value that necessarily precede the individual acquisition and usage of such abstractions.

== Cognition in biological evolution ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can refer to a branch of [[epistemology]] that applies the concepts of biological [[evolution]] to the growth of animal and human cognition.  It argues that the mind is in part genetically determined and that its structure and function reflect [[adaptation]], a [[Teleology in biology|nonteleological]] process of interaction between the organism and its environment. A cognitive trait tending to increase [[inclusive fitness]] in a given population should therefore grow more common over time, and a trait tending to prevent its carriers from passing on their genes should show up less and less frequently.

== Growth of knowledge ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to a theory that applies the concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge, and argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific [[theories]], evolve according to selection.  In this case, a theory—like the [[germ theory]] of disease—becomes more or less credible according to changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it.

One of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of scientific theories, but rather that social and methodological processes select those theories with the closest "fit" to a given problem. The mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability to survive future testing. [[Karl Popper]] used [[Newtonian physics]] as an example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to be considered unassailable, but which were nevertheless overturned by [[General relativity|Einstein's insights]] into the nature of [[space-time]]. For the evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally, regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, 1972. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process of discovering new abstract entities ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to the opposite of (onto)genetic epistemology, namely phylogenetic epistemology as the historical discovery and reification of abstractions that necessarily precedes the learning of such abstractions by individuals. Piaget dismissed this possibility, stating

::"The fundamental hypothesis of genetic epistemology is that there is a parallelism between the progress made in the logical and rational organization of knowledge and the corresponding formative psychological processes.  Well, now, if that is our hypothesis, what will be our field of study?  Of course the most fruitful, most obvious field of study would be reconstituting human history: the history of human thinking in prehistoric man. Unfortunately, we are not very well informed about the psychology of [[Neanderthal man]] or about the psychology of Homo siniensis of [[Teilhard de Chardin]].  Since this field of biogenesis is not available to us, we shall do as biologists do and turn to ontogenesis.  Nothing could be more accessible to study than the ontogenesis of these notions. There are children all around us." &lt;ref name=Piaget&gt;Piaget, 1974. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget was mistaken in so quickly dismissing the study of phylogenetic epistemology, as there is much historical data available about the origins and evolution of the various notational systems that reify different kinds of abstract entity.

Popper is considered by many to have given evolutionary epistemology its first comprehensive treatment, though [[Donald T. Campbell]] coined the phrase in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Schilpp, 1974. pp. 412–463&lt;/ref&gt; and Piaget alluded to it in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, 1974, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and described the concept as one of five possible theories in ''The Origins of Intelligence in Children'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.pitt.edu/~strauss/origins_r.pdf p. 14ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Evolutionary suicide''' is an evolutionary phenomenon in which the process of [[adaptation]] causes the population to become [[extinct]]. For example, individuals might be selected to switch from eating mature plants to seedlings, and thereby deplete their food plant's population. Selection on individuals can theoretically produce adaptations that threaten the survival of the population.

Much of the research on evolutionary suicide has used the [[mathematical model]]ing technique [[adaptive dynamics]], in which genetic changes are studied together with [[population dynamics]]. This allows the model to predict how [[population density]] will change as a given [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] invades the population.

Evolutionary suicide has also been referred to as "Darwinian extinction", "runaway selection to self-extinction", and "evolutionary collapse".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The idea is similar in concept to the [[tragedy of the commons]] and the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall]], namely that they are all examples of an accumulation of individual changes leading to a collective disaster such that it negates those individual changes.

Many adaptations have apparently negative effects on population dynamics, for example infanticide by male lions, or the production of toxins by bacteria. However, empirically establishing that an extinction event was unambiguously caused by the process of adaptation is not a trivial task.

== Etymology ==
The English word ''faith'' is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English ''feith'', via Anglo-French ''fed'', Old French ''feid'', ''feit'' from Latin ''fidem'', accusative of ''fidēs'' (trust), akin to ''fīdere'' (to trust).&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith |title=Faith – Define Faith |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of faith development ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler#Stages of Faith}}

[[James W. Fowler]] (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or [[spiritual development]]) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], Erikson, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nancy|last1=Evans |first2=Deanna |last2=Forney |first3=Florence |last3=Guido |first4=Lori |last4=Patton |first5=Kristen |last5=Renn |title=Student Development in College: Theory, Research, and Practice |edition=Second |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0787978099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages of faith ===
# Intuitive-Projective: a stage of confusion and of high impressionability through stories and [[ritual]]s (pre-school period).
# Mythic-Literal: a stage where provided information is accepted in order to conform with [[social norm]]s (school-going period).
# Synthetic-Conventional: in this stage the faith acquired is concreted in the [[belief system]] with the forgoing of personification and replacement with [[authority]] in individuals or groups that represent one's beliefs (early-late adolescence).
# Individuative-Reflective: in this stage the individual critically analyzes adopted and accepted faith with existing systems of faith. Disillusion or strengthening of faith happens in this stage. Based on needs, experiences and paradoxes (early adulthood).
# Conjunctive faith: in this stage people realize the limits of [[logic]] and, facing the paradoxes or [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] of [[personal life|life]], accept the "mystery of life" and often return to the sacred stories and symbols of the pre-acquired or re-adopted faith system. This stage is called negotiated settling in life (mid-life).
# Universalizing faith: this is the "enlightenment" stage where the individual comes out of all the existing systems of faith and lives life with universal principles of compassion and love and in service to others for upliftment, without worries and [[doubt]] (middle-late adulthood (45–65 years old and plus).&lt;ref&gt;Works of [[Daniel Levinson|Daniel J. Levinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=May 2018}}

No hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often{{quantify|date=December 2015}} considered as "not fully" attainable.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, J.W.; Stages of Faith – The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{See also|Role of faith in the Baha'i Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds,&lt;ref&gt;Baha'i World Faith – Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the [[Manifestations of God]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |page=155|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith in Buddhism (''{{lang-pi|saddhā}}'', ''{{lang-sa|śraddhā}}'') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] or ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' (those aiming to become a Buddha).&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gómez|first1=Luis O.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Faith|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=388–9}} Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|author-link=Jacob N. Kinnard|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Worship|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|p=907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=386, 396–7}}

In [[early Buddhism]], faith was focused on the [[Triple Gem]], that is, [[Gautama Buddha]], his teaching (the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the [[Sangha]]). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]].{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5, 81}} A faithful devotee was called [[upasaka and Upasika|''upāsaka'' or ''upāsika'']], for which no formal declaration was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tremblay|first1=Xavier|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|encyclopedia=The spread of Buddhism|title=The spread of Buddhism in Serindia|date=2007|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158306|edition=online|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The notion of diṭṭhi in Theravāda Buddhism : the point of view|date=2004|publisher=[[RoutledgeCurzon]]|location=London|isbn=0-203-01043-4|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31392862/The_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1507847029&amp;Signature=ZGrJoGZcaUjL%2FEaIJ55xwsailIU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf|page=36}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to [[Paññā|wisdom]] and [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=384, 396–7}}

While [[faith in Buddhism]] does not imply "blind faith", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Faith in [[Buddhism]] centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his [[Dharma]] (spiritual teachings), and in his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or [[bodhi]], and [[Nirvana]]. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way of Wisdom The Five Spiritual Faculties|first= Edward |last=Conze|authorlink=Edward Conze|year=1993|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/conze/wheel065.html|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|publisher=[[Buddhist Publication Society]]|isbn=978-9552401107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, [[Buddhist modernism]] in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia or the West, but is understood and defined differently from traditional interpretations.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=378, 429, 444}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Richard F.|authorlink1=Richard F.

{{Main|Faith in Christianity}}
The word translated as "faith" in the New Testament is the Greek word ''πίστις'' (''pístis'') which can also be translated "belief", "faithfulness", and "trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4102. πίστις (pistis) -- faith, faithfulness|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various views in Christianity regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true.&lt;ref name= Wilkin2012&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ten Most Misunderstood Words in the Bible |year=2012 |author=Wilkin, Robert N. |page=221 |publisher=GES |location=Corinth, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. Theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it is a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Then there are numerous views regarding the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in [[Jesus]] brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://redeeminggod.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Faith-and-Good-Works-JD-Myers.pdf (PDF) Jeremy Myers, The Gospel Under Siege: 3 Views on the Relationship Between Faith and Good Works]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of [[God]] and his [[Divine grace|grace]] and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.&lt;ref name= Wuerl2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=a#PPA237,M1 |title=The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, Edition: 5, revised |year=2004 |author=Wuerl, By Donald W. |page=238 |isbn=1-59276-094-5 |accessdate=21 April 2009|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub. Division |location=Huntingdon, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of faith given by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians that respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the apostle writes:

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." — King James Version

"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists." — International Standard Version

“The naive or inexperienced person[is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.” (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only [[fideism]] or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore, Daniel L. 2004. ''Faith seeking understanding: an introduction to Christian theology''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the [[belief|believer]].&lt;ref&gt;Inbody, Tyron. 2005. The faith of the Christian church: an introduction to theology. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations of the New Testament, the word "faith" generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (''pistis'') or to the Greek verb πιστεύω (''pisteuo''), meaning "to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure".&lt;ref name=Thomas1981&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Robert L. |last2=Editor |first2=General |year = 1981 |title= New American standard exhaustive concordance of the Bible: |pages= 1674–75 |isbn= 0-87981-197-8 |publisher= A.J.

==== Christian apologetic views ====
In contrast to noted atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]' view of faith as "blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene. 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is "not blind, but intelligent" and that it "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title= The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year= 2008|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 1-4051-2556-X|page= 33|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]] stated that the Greek word ''pistis'' used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb meaning "to furnish", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robertson|first= Archibald Thomas|title= WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages= Chapter 17|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Price|first= Thomas|title= Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url= http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate= 23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Christian apologist [[John Lennox]] argues that "faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant". He states that "the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind". "The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based." "We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up." "Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lennox|first= John|title= Gunning for God: Why the New Atheists Are Missing the Target|year=2011|publisher=Lion|location=United kingdom|isbn= 0-7459-5322-0|page= 55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kxBRhMYsadwC&amp;dq=faith+defined+as+warranted+based+on+evidence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter S Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterswilliams.com|title=Peter S. Williams|work=peterswilliams.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that "the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence."{{page needed|date=February 2015}} Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as "a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true."

Regarding [[doubting Thomas]] in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that "Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=  Peter S|title= A Faithful Guide to Philosophy: A Christian Introduction to the Love of Wisdom|year= 2013|publisher= Authentic Media|isbn= 1-84227-811-8|pages= Chapter 1.4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DCEVL-8d-J4C&amp;dq=A+Faithful+Guide+To+Philosophy:+A+Christian+Introduction+To+The+Love+Of+Wisdom&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[doubting Thomas]], Michael R. Allen wrote, "Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person ''qua'' person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=The Christ's Faith: A Dogmatic Account|date=2009|publisher=T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology|location=London|isbn=978-0-567-03399-4|page=80}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to {{by whom|date=February 2015}}as ''[[evidentialism]]'', and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called ''classical [[foundationalism]]'', which is accompanied by ''[[deontologism]]'', which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.

They show how this can go too far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Boa|first= Kenneth|author2= Robert M.Bowman|title= Faith Has Its Reasons: Integrative Approaches to Defending the Christian Faith|date= March 1, 2006|publisher= IVP Books|location= USA|isbn= 978-0-8308-5648-0|pages= 253|url= https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Has-Its-Reasons-Integrative/dp/083085648X#reader_083085648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]] deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Plantinga|first= Alvin|title= Warranted Christian Belief|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= USA|isbn= 0-19-513192-4|pages= 250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====

The four-part ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) gives Part One to "The Profession of Faith".  This section describes the content of faith.  It elaborates and expands particularly upon the [[Apostles' Creed]].  CCC 144 initiates a section on the "Obedience of Faith".

In the [[theology]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

Some alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented in a collection of sermons now presented as {{cite book|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/lectures-faith-historical-perspective/lectures-faith-1990-edited-version/lecture-1|title=Lectures on Faith|}}

# Lecture 1 explains what faith is; 
# Lecture 2 describes how mankind comes to know about God; 
# Lectures 3 and 4 make clear the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; 
# Lecture 5 deals with the nature of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; 
# Lecture 6 proclaims that the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things is prerequisite to gaining faith unto salvation; 
# Lecture 7 treats the fruits of faith—perspective, power, and eventually perfection. &lt;ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
[[Ahimsa]], also referred to as [[nonviolence]], is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.

In Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Iman (concept)}}
In Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of [[Islam]] is called "Iman" ({{lang-ar|{{large|الإيمان}}}}), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief.&lt;ref&gt;Farāhī, Majmū‘ah Tafāsīr, 2nd ed. (Faran Foundation, 1998), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Denny, ''An Introduction to Islam, 3rd ed., p. 405''&lt;/ref&gt; A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gLi2X1rzeZIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=build+his+faith+on+well-grounded+convictions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JAAqmVe6FQ&amp;sig=1rwgFIQDOphU5cSSPyGRBFOtACI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisooTPpZrZAhVFtY8KHavTD10Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=build%20his%20faith%20on%20well-grounded%20convictions&amp;f=false|title=Encountering the World of Islam|last=Swartley|first=Keith E.|date=2005-11-02|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=9780830856442|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into [[Jannah|Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|95|6|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hadith of Gabriel, ''Iman'' in addition to ''Islam'' and ''[[Ihsan]]'' form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.

[[Muhammad]] referred to the six articles of faith in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]]: "Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God]."&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 22, (no. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|8|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|9|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in [[Judaism]]. The ''faith in God'' is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the [[Jewish Bible]]. The word translated as "faith" here is the Hebrew word אָמַן which can also be translated "believe", "reliable", and "trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/539.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 539. אָמַן (aman) -- believe, reliable|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know [[God in Judaism|God]] is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=Who God Is|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/who-hashem-is/|work=Audios English 5min:40sec-9min:02sec|publisher=DivineInformation.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm |title=What Is Emunah – Beyond Belief – Essentials |work=chabad.org |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''[[Epikoros|Apikorus]]'' (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true [[knowledge]], true [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]] and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002 /&gt; Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of [[Christian faith]], which is called [[Avodah Zarah]] in Judaism, a minor form of [[idolatry|idol worship]], a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of [[Jewish principles of faith]] which are mandatory for all (observant) [[Jews]].

In the Jewish scriptures trust in God – ''Emunah'' – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 7:9:

{{Quote|text= Know, therefore, that the Lord, your God He is God, the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations.&lt;ref&gt;(The [[Torah]] – A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W. G. Plaut)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Tanakh]]|source={{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|7:9|JPR}}}}

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, [[Orthodox Jew]]s have accepted [[Maimonides]]' Thirteen Principles of Belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html The 13 Principles and the Resurrection of the Dead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208182008/http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html |date=2006-02-08 }} from ''The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb'', Rabbi Shmuel Boteach (Oxford University)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a wide history of this dispute see: Shapiro, Marc: ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Series).)&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional example of ''Emunah'' as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of [[Abraham]]. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For ''emunah'' to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation."&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
{{Main|Sikhism|Five Ks}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the ''Five articles of Faith''. The articles include ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|kaṅghā]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|kaṛā]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment). Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1193703788&amp;ucat=5|title=Sikhism: Five Articles of Faith|work=realsikhism.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemological validity ==
There is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the [[epistemological]] validity of faith&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-065292-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[C.S.

=== Fideism ===
{{Main|Fideism}}
Fideism is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that faith is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|Traditionalism]]. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/|title=Fideism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] offers a similar argument in his lecture ''[[The Will to Believe]].''&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt;&lt;ref name=WillToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |title=1896 |journal=New World |volume=5 |pages=327–347 |url=http://educ.jmu.edu//~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundationalism]] is a view about the structure of justification or [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep/ |title=Foundationalism |author=Poston, Ted |date=10 June 2010 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational" /&gt; Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and [[Theory of justification|justified belief]] are ultimately based upon what are called [[Basic belief|properly basic beliefs]]. This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref name=InternetFoundational /&gt;

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] develop this view.&lt;ref name=Plantinga1983&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |author2=Nicholas Wolterstorff |year=1983 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn=0-268-00964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and [[fideism]] is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=StanfordReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/ |title=The Epistemology of Religion |author=Forrest, Peter |date=11 March 2009 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in ''Warranted Christian Belief'' as a form of [[externalism]] that holds that the [[Theory of justification|justification]] conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.&lt;ref name=Plantinga2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Warranted Christian Belief |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513192-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theistic]] philosophers have defended theism by granting [[evidentialism]] but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a [[probability|mathematical probability]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt; Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]], whose arguments are based on [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell1973&gt;{{cite book |title=The Justification of Religious Belief |last=Basic |first=Mitchell |authorlink=Basil Mitchell (academic) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1979&gt;{{cite book |title=The Existence of God |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.&lt;ref name=Forrest1996&gt;{{cite book |title=God without the Supernatural |last=Forrest |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Forrest (philosopher) |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1997&gt;{{cite book |title=Is there a God? |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor of Mathematics]] and [[philosopher of science]] at [[University of Oxford]] [[John Lennox]] has stated, "Faith is not a leap in the dark; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a commitment based on [[evidence]]… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.” He criticises [[Richard Dawkins]] as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lennox|first=John|title=God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?|publisher=Lion UK|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=May 2018}}

{{quote|Christians hold that their faith does good, but other faiths do harm. At any rate, they hold this about the communist faith. What I wish to maintain is that all faiths do harm. We may define “faith” as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of “faith.” We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups substitute different emotions. Christians have faith in the Resurrection; communists have faith in [[Labor theory of value|Marx’s Theory of Value]]. Neither faith can be defended rationally, and each therefore is defended by propaganda and, if necessary, by war.| Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?}}

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.&lt;ref name="Is Science a Religion?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawkins, Richard |date=January–February 1997 |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science a Religion? |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=American Humanist Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which "claims about the world are likely true". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that [[Muhammad]] (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that [[Joseph Smith]] (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no "built-in corrective mechanism". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as "belief without evidence" or "pretending to know things you don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual for Creating Atheists |author=Peter Boghossian |year=2013 |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |isbn=978-1-939578-09-9 |page=31}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Francisco de Vitoria''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]]}} ({{circa|1483}} – 12 August 1546; also known as '''Francisco de Victoria''') was a Spanish Roman Catholic [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[theology|theologian]], and jurist of [[Renaissance]] Spain. He is the founder of the tradition in [[philosophy]] known as the [[School of Salamanca]], noted especially for his contributions to the theory of [[just war]] and [[international law]]. He has in the past been described by some scholars as one of the "fathers of international law", along with [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]], though contemporary academics have suggested that such a description is [[anachronistic]], since the concept of international law did not truly develop until much later.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Thomas E. (Jr.)|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|year=2005|publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-89526-038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagden&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Vitoria: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=0-521-36714-X|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[jurist]] [[Arthur Nussbaum]] noted that Vitoria was "the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of [[Free trade|freedom of commerce]] and [[freedom of the seas]]."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1947"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Nussbaum|title=A concise history of the law of nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxkQAQAAMAAJ|year=1947|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Vitoria was born {{circa|1483}} in [[Burgos]] or [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and was raised in [[Burgos]], the son of Pedro de Vitoria, of Alava, and Catalina de Compludo, both of noble families.&lt;ref name=Hernandez&gt;[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1325&amp;context=ilj Hernandez O.P., Ramon. "The Internationalization of Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto", translated by Jay J. Aragones, ''Fordham International Law Journal'', Vol. 15, Issue 4, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; As per modern scholarship, he had [[Jewish]] ancestry on his maternal side (the Compludos), being related to famous converts like [[Paul of Burgos]] and [[Alfonso de Cartagena]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos G. Noreña, ''Studies in Spanish Renaissance Thought'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media (2012), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] in 1504, and was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in [[Paris]], where he was influenced by the work of [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. He went on to teach theology from 1516 (under the influences of [[Pierre Crockaert]] and [[Thomas Cajetan]]). In 1522 he returned to [[Spain]] to teach theology at the college of Saint Gregory at [[Valladolid]], where many young Dominicans were being trained for missionary work in the New World. In 1524, he was elected to the Chair of theology at the [[University of Salamanca]], where he was instrumental in promoting [[Thomism]] (the philosophy and theology of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]). Francisco de Vitoria died on 12 August 1546&lt;ref name=Schroeder&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06232a.htm Schroeder, Henry Joseph. "Francis of Vittoria." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 10 Sept. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Salamanca]].

==Defense of Amerindians==
[[Image:Francisco de Vitoria.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco de Vitoria, Statue before San Esteban,
[[Salamanca]]]]
A noted scholar, he was publicly consulted by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Spain. He worked to limit the type of power the Spanish Empire imposed on the Native Peoples. He said, "The upshot of all the preceding is this, then, that the aborigines undoubtedly had true dominion in both public and private matters, just like Christians, and that neither their princes nor private persons could be despoiled of their property on the ground of their not being true owners."&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Vitoria, “The Law of War,” in War and Christian Ethics, ed. Author F. Holmes (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1975), 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; Vitoria denied that the native peoples could be understood as slaves by nature in Aristotelian terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/content/francisco-de-vitoria "Francisco de Vitoria", Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'' ("the law of nations"). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.

In three lectures (relectiones) held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. This had already been the position of Palacios Rubios. Neither the pope nor Charles V had a rightful claim over Indian lives or property. No violent action could be taken against them, nor could their lands or property be seized, unless the Indians had caused harm or injury to the Spanish by violating the latter’s lawful rights.&lt;ref name=Pagden/&gt;

A supporter of the [[just war theory]], in ''De iure belli'' Francisco pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a "just war" were "wholly lacking in the Indies".&lt;ref name=Salas&gt;[http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf Salas Jr., Victor M., "Francisco de Vitoria on the ''Ius Gentium'' and the American Indios", ''Ave Maria Law Review'', 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001651/http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only area where he saw justification for Spanish 
intervention in native affairs was to protect victims seized for human sacrifice, and because of the inherent human dignity of the victims themselves—whose rights were being violated and thus in need of defense.&lt;ref name=Salas/&gt;

[[Thomas Woods|Thomas E. Woods]] goes on to describe how some wished to argue that the natives lacked reason, but the evidence was against this because the natives had obvious customs, laws, and a form of government.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;

The Spaniards were in the practice of invoking in their American conquests the so-called "Requerimiento", a document read to the Indians before the commencement of any hostilities. The "Requerimiento", declared the universal authority of the Pope, and the
authority the Spanish monarchs had received from the Pope over this part of the New World for the purpose of colonizing and evangelizing it. The Indians had to accept the sovereignty of the Spanish monarchs or be compelled to submit by force. Vitoria denied the legitimacy of this document.&lt;ref name=Hernandez/&gt;

His works are known only from his lecture notes, as he has published nothing in his lifetime.  Nevertheless, his influence such as that on the Dutch legal philosopher [[Hugo Grotius]] was significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borschberg|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Borschberg|title=Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese and Free Trade in the East Indies |year=2011|publisher=NUS Press and KITLV Press|location=Singapore and Leiden|isbn=978-9971-69-467-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Relectiones XII Theologicae in duo libros distinctae'' was published posthumously (Antwerp, 1604).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Nys, introduction to Francisco de Vitoria, [http://www.constitution.org/victoria/victoria.txt De Indis et Ivre Belli], English translation of a substantial portion of ''Relectiones XII Theologicae'', available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco de Vitoria's writings have been interpreted by various scholars to support contrary policies.&lt;ref&gt;Franciso Castilla Urbano, ''El pensamiento de Francisco de Vitoria. Filosofía, política e indio Americano'' (Barcelona, Anthropos, 1992) note 5, 317-323]&lt;/ref&gt; Antony Anghie and others argue that Vitoria’s humanitarianism legitimized conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/eci/Publications/Koskenniemi/Zaragoza-10final.pdf Koskenniemi, Martti.

A '''hexagram''' in this context is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines ([[wikt:爻|爻]] yáo), where each line is either [[Yin and yang|Yang]] (an unbroken, or solid line), or [[Yin and yang|Yin]] (broken, an open line with a gap in the center). The hexagram lines are traditionally counted from the bottom up, so the lowest line is considered line one while the top line is line six. Hexagrams are formed by combining the original [[Bagua|eight trigrams]] in different combinations. Each hexagram is accompanied with a description, often cryptic, akin to parables. Each line in every hexagram is also given a similar description.

The Chinese word for a hexagram is [[wikt:卦|卦]] "guà", although that also means trigram.

The term '''''in loco parentis''''', [[Latin]] for "in the place of a parent"&lt;ref name="law.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=in+loco+parentis&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=86&amp;submit1.y=20&amp;submit1=Look+up |title=Law.com Law Dictionary - ''in loco parentis'' |accessdate=2008-09-03 |work= |publisher=Law.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a [[parent]].  Originally derived from English [[common law]], it is applied in two separate areas of the law.

First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the [[student]]s as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name="law.com" /&gt;

Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php An example of family law ''in loco parentis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421152559/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php |date=21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''in loco parentis'' doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of ''[[parens patriae]]'', the psychological parent doctrine, and [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society"&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/inlocoparentis.htm In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary and secondary education==
[[Cheadle Hulme School]], founded in Manchester, England, in 1855, adopted ''in loco parentis'' as its motto, well before the world's first public education act, the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]]. The school was established to educate and care for orphans and children of distressed parents.

{{cn span|date=February 2017|text=''In loco parentis'' had only precedent legal meaning for [[ward of court|wards of court]]. The founding of Cheadle Hulme School, otherwise known as Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks Orphans Schools, became the first time the expression was used with legal standing in the educational field.}}

The first major limitation to this came in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the [[flag of the United States|American flag]].  More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that "conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason - whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior - materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of [[freedom of speech]]."  Adult speech is also limited by "time, place and manner" restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting in loco parentis.

In ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they "must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," allowing schools to forbid conduct that would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school." The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.

In ''[[New Jersey v. T.L.O.]]'' (1985) Justice White wrote:  "In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment."  The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student's legitimate [[expectation of privacy]] and the public school's interest in maintaining order and discipline.   However, in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]'' (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that "[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment" and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is "...inconsistent with its basic educational mission."  Other student issues such as school [[dress code]]s along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court.

Private institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules.  In the [[Kentucky Supreme Court|Kentucky State Supreme Court]] case ''[[Gott v. Berea College]]'' (1913), it was upheld that a "college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government", while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability.

In ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007) Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], concurring with the majority, argued that ''Tinker's'' ruling contradicted "the traditional understanding of the judiciary's role in relation to public schooling," and ignored the history of public education (127 S.Ct. 2634).  He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by ''in loco parentis''.  He cited ''[[Lander v. Seaver]]'' (1859), which held that ''in loco parentis'' allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals.  This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury.  Neither of these were the case with Tinker.

==Higher education==
Though ''in loco parentis'' continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in [[higher education]]. This was not always the case.

Prior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to [[curfew]]s as early as 10:00, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students—especially female students—who were somehow "morally" undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict [[freedom of speech]], on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the [[Free Speech Movement]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Movement and the Sixties |last=Anderson |first=Terry H. |authorlink=Terry H.

The landmark 1961 case ''[[Dixon v. Alabama]]'' was the beginning of the end for ''in loco parentis'' in U.S. higher education.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] found that [[Alabama State University|Alabama State College]] could not summarily expel students without due process.  However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to more legal action for violation of institutional rules.&lt;ref name=bluto&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoover |first=Eric |date=5 September 2008 |title='Animal House' at 30: O Bluto, Where Art Thou? |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Animal-House-at-30-O/28169 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}

On March 17, 1808, [[Napoleon I]] created three decrees&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=S4RCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 Pasinomie, XIV, p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; in a failed attempt to bring equality and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790-1791. The '''Infamous Decree''', the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees´ aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the charging of interest as profit  on loans), it annulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by   restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] initially won allegiance of Jews when in 1797 he emancipated Jews in Ancona, Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation and seven councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim [[Jerusalem]] in 1799 with the help of his army in a letter to a rabbi in [[Jerusalem]], but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute [[Napoleon]]’s change in attitude to [[Napoleon]]’s new attachment to France and his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, he still was an "ardent patriot" of his home island of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York,: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, quite early in the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of [[usury]], in [[Alsace]], as well as of abusing other rights, which were given to them in their emancipation in 1791 under [[Louis XVI]]. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though he desired equality for the Jews, he called them "the most despicable of men" and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] issued an imperial decree in 1806 that suspended payment of debts owed to Jewish moneylenders for one year to warn against usury to the supposedly degenerate Jewish population and called a conference with Jewish leaders. The group he conferred with was dubbed the Great [[Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews, and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first meeting of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] on February 4, 1807 was ceremonial and solemn, the group was largely ineffective as nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great [[Sanhedrin]] was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews in order that the Jewish people might be absorbed into France,&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formantion, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; since Jews were considered substandard citizens&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France rather than to their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actual decree==
After [[Napoleon]]’s emancipation of the Jews he "wanted to mandate what some proponents of emancipation had hoped would happen, namely the total assimilation, or biological fusion of Jews with the rest of the French people."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To mandate the assimilation of Jews into French society, three decrees were issued on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "first two decrees restored order to the informal Jewish communities that had survived the revolution by establishing a hierarchical, centralized organization, under the aegis of the ministry of religions."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two decrees set up the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] which were designed to enforce the decrees. Some of the members also were a part of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] which met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce [[Sanhedrin]] rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government which was monitoring Jewish activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; There was one consistory for every town that contained 2,000 or more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Berkovitz, Jay R. Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infamous Decree, also known as the "third decree," presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless proven innocent, and restricted Jewish commerce and money lending for a period of 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  This decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors, and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. This was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged [[usury]] by Jewish businessmen and to turn these former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage Jews to move into this niche, the Jews were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they "acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions."&lt;ref&gt;The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep tabs on businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated that all business require a patent or license that had to be renewed yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the decree hurt the Jews economically but it changed their military rights.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts (required enlistees of military) couldn’t find replacements for themselves when drafted like other Frenchmen were allowed to do.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the first three decrees, another and final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. This final decree declared that all Jews acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and weren’t allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three decrees were set up to expire after 10 years and would only be continued if renewed after that period. In 1818 [[Louis XVIII]] opted to not renew the decree and thus it ended. [[Louis XVIII]] was thereafter known as the "liberator of Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After effects==
After the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in these areas. Although these changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews continued to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, "Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion." &lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to [[Lycée]], but many Jewish parents neglected their children’s education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; French Jews went to [[Paris]], by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Vyvyan''' (1908–1975) was a British writer, born in [[Sussex]]. Originally trained as an archeologist, he worked with Sir [[Flinders Petrie]] in the Middle East. Vyvyan became known for his study of [[Shakespeare]] and his histories of the [[animal rights]] movement. He was the author of three books on Shakespeare, including ''The Shakespearean Ethic'' (1959), and two on the origins of anti-vivisection activism, ''In Pity and in Anger: A Study of the Use of Animals in Science'' (1969) – which documents the disputes between [[Frances Power Cobbe]] and [[Anna Kingsford]], two prominent 19th-century British activists – and ''The Dark Face of Science'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;For his research into anti-vivisection, see Finsen, Lawrence and Finsen, Susan. ''The Animal Rights Movement in America''. Twayne Publishers, 1994, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his contribution to Shakespearean scholarship in his trilogy, he was offered, but unable to take up, a visiting lectureship at the [[State University of New York]]. He died in Exmouth in 1975.

In French, '''''jouissance''''' means enjoyment, in terms both of rights and property,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; and of sexual [[orgasm]]—the latter  has a meaning partially lacking in the English word "enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jouissance|work=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=602|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poststructuralism]] has developed the latter sense of ''jouissance'' in complex ways, so as to denote a transgressive, excessive kind of pleasure linked to the division and splitting of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Lacanian psychoanalysis ==
English editions of the works of [[Jacques Lacan]] have generally left ''jouissance'' untranslated in order to help convey its specialised usage.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacan first developed his concept of an opposition between ''jouissance'' and the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in his Seminar "The Ethics of Psychoanalysis" (1959–1960). Lacan considered that "there is a ''jouissance'' beyond the pleasure principle"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the partial drive; a ''jouissance'' which compels the subject to constantly attempt to transgress the prohibitions imposed on his enjoyment, to go beyond the pleasure principle.

Yet the result of transgressing the pleasure principle, according to Lacan, is not more pleasure but pain, since there is only a certain amount of pleasure that the subject can bear. Beyond this limit, pleasure becomes pain, and this "painful principle" is what Lacan calls ''jouissance''.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (2002) p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''jouissance'' is suffering (''ethics'')—something which may be linked to the influence of the erotic philosophy of [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], epitomised in Lacan's remark about "the recoil imposed on everyone, in so far as it involves terrible promises, by the approach of ''jouissance'' as such".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. xvi and p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan also linked ''jouissance'' to the [[castration complex]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 319-24&lt;/ref&gt; and to the aggression of the [[death drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (1992) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In his seminar "The Other Side of Psychoanalysis" (1969–1970) Lacan introduced the concept of "surplus-''jouissance''" (French ''plus-de-jouir'') inspired by [[Marx]]'s concept of [[surplus-value]]: he considered ''[[objet petit a]]'' is the excess of ''jouissance'' which has no use value, and which persists for the mere sake of ''jouissance''.

Lacan considered that ''jouissance'' is essentially [[phallic]], meaning that it does not relate to the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" as such. In his seminar "Encore" (1972–1973), however, Lacan introduced the idea of specifically feminine ''jouissance'', saying that women have "in relation to what the phallic function designates of ''jouissance'', a supplementary ''jouissance''...a ''jouissance'' of the body which is...''beyond the phallus''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Mitchell/J. Rose eds., ''Feminine Sexuality'' (1982) p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This feminine ''jouissance'' is ineffable, for both women and men may experience it but know nothing about it.

== In philosophy and literary theory ==
The Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], a known Lacanian theorist, has adopted the term in his philosophy; it may also be seen in the works, both joint and individual, of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], and it plays an important role in the writing of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Roland Barthes]].

In his 1973 [[literary theory]] book ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'', Barthes divides the effects of texts into two: ''plaisir'' (translated as "pleasure") and ''jouissance''. The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between "readerly" and "writerly" texts. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader's position as a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.

For Barthes ''plaisir'' is, "a pleasure... linked to cultural enjoyment and identity, to the cultural enjoyment of identity, to a homogenising movement of the ego."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. "The Death of the Author." Image—Music—Text. Trans. and ed. Stephen Heath. New York: Hill, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] puts it, "''Plaisir'' results, then, from the operation of the structures of signification through which the subject knows himself or herself; ''jouissance'' fractures these structures."&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In feminist theory ==

The French feminist writer [[Hélène Cixous]] uses the term ''jouissance'' to describe a form of women's pleasure or sexual rapture that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of female experience, bordering on mystical communion: "explosion, diffusion, effervescence, abundance...takes pleasure (jouit) in being limitless".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous maintains that ''jouissance'' is the source of a woman's creative power and that the suppression of ''jouissance'' prevents women from finding their own fully empowered voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html Introduction to Cixous&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409090818/http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html |date=2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Popular Culture|author=J. Fiske|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''jouissance'' is explored by Cixous and other authors in their writings on ''[[Écriture féminine]]'', a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s.

Other feminists have argued that [[Freudian]] "hysteria" is ''jouissance'' distorted by patriarchal culture and say that ''jouissance'' is a transcendent state that represents freedom from oppressive linearities. In her introduction to Cixous' ''The Newly Born Woman'', literary critic [[Sandra Gilbert]] writes: "to escape hierarchical bonds and thereby come closer to what Cixous calls ''jouissance'', which can be defined as a virtually metaphysical fulfillment of desire that goes far beyond [mere] satisfaction... [It is a] fusion of the erotic, the mystical, and the political."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sandra M. Introduction. The Newly Born Woman. By Hélène Cixous and Catherine Clement, 1975. Trans. Betsy Wing. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hegelianism}}
'''''Lectures on Aesthetics''''' ('''''LA'''''; {{lang-de|Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik}}, '''''VÄ''''') is a compilation of notes from university lectures on [[aesthetics]] given by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in Heidelberg in 1818 and in Berlin in 1820/21, 1823, 1826 and 1828/29. It was compiled in 1835 by his student [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]], using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art'', trans. T. M. Knox, 2 vols. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Houlgate, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[György Lukács]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Arthur Danto]]. Hegel was himself influenced by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Heidegger calls Hegel's ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' "the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of [[art]] that the West possesses".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Gesamtausgabe'', vol. 5, Frankfurt, 1977, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Hegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls "the beautiful ideal," which he defines most generally as &lt;blockquote&gt;Now when truth in this its external existence [''Dasein''] is present to consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but ''beautiful''. ''Beauty'' is determined as the sensible ''shining'' of the Idea.&lt;ref&gt;(''LA'' 111/''VÄ'' I.151)&lt;/ref&gt;     &lt;/blockquote&gt;This ideal is developed throughout the ''Lectures'' accordance Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]'':
#The first ''universal'' part is devoted to the concept of the artistic ideal.
#The second ''particular'' part examines this ideal as it actualizes itself in three stages:
##Symbolic art, understood to encompass everything before Classical Greek art
##Classical art
##Romantic art, understood to emerge with the advent of Christianity on the world stage
#The third ''singular'' part concerns itself with an examination of each of the five major arts in ascending order of "inwardness":
##[[architecture]]
##sculpture
##[[painting]]
##[[music]]
##poetry

In these second two parts of the ''Lectures'', Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically [[symbol]]ic architecture to the paradigmatically classical [[sculpture]] to the [[romantic poetry|romantic]] arts of painting, music, and [[poetry]]. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it.&lt;!-- Citation? --&gt;

Contrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be "dead." What he says, in a representative statement is, "For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''LA'' 103/''VÄ'' I.141&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks frequently of its "dissolution" [''Auflösung''], not its end [''Ende''], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.

'''''Moralium dogma philosophorum''''' ("Teaching of the philosophers on moral questions") is a [[Latin language|Latin]] work of the 12th century. Its authorship is uncertain: it has been attributed to [[William of Conches]], to [[Walter of Châtillon]] and (less likely) to [[Alan of Lille]]. Parallels exist between this work, the anonymous ''[[Ysagoge in theologiam]]'' (written between 1141 and 1157), and the text ''De virtutibus et vitiis'' by Alan of Lille (written between 1155 and 1165).

'''Mário Ferreira dos Santos''' (January 3, 1907 – April 11, 1968) was a Brazilian philosopher. Born in Tietê, São Paulo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/40336598?sid=21104923661041&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737664 |title=Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia 25 (1):69 - 70 (1969) - P. Stanislavs Ladusãns - Mário Ferreira dos Santos|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira dos Santos was raised in [[Pelotas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and graduated in Law and Social Sciences at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul|Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]].

A prolific writer and thinker, Ferreira dos Santos published in less than fifteen years the 45-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophical and Social Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academus.pro.br/filosofo/marioferreira/esfinge.asp#publicacoes |title=Publicações de Mário Ferreira dos Santos|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

He created a philosophical system called "concrete philosophy." His system was based on the ''méthode des démonstrations géométriques'', with no possibility of disagreement from its assumptions – which he called "theses". The first thesis is the very foundation of his philosophy: "There is something whilst there isn't the absolute nothing", from which he draws other theses through the methods of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academus.pro.br/filosofo/marioferreira/espanhol.asp |title= Carlos Aurélio Mota de Souza - Mário Ferreira dos Santos y su filosofia concreta|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His thought influenced the Latvian-Brazilian Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Stanislavs Ladusãns]] and the Brazilian journalist, essayist, writer and philosopher [[Olavo de Carvalho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/quem-e-filosofo-e-quem-nao-e/|title=Quem é filósofo e quem não é – SAPIENTIAM AUTEM NON VINCIT MALITIA|website=www.olavodecarvalho.org|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ontetic philosophy''' is a speculative systematic philosophy developed by Persian philosopher [[Mahmoud Khatami]]. This system of philosophy is based on a special reduction that is called [[Ontetic Reduction]].

==Ontetic Philosophy==
The word “ontetic” is not an English word; Khatami has coined this word to express his thought most exactly; he did not take it in a sense of “ontologic” nor of “ontic” (and by that, he wishes to differ his discussion from Heidegger’s).[1] For Khatami, ontetic means something more. Ontetic has three constituents which must be considered althgeter as the meaning that this word indicates. Relying on the ancient Persian philosophy, Khatami takes “light” (rushanayi) interpreted as “consciousness” (agahi) which embraces “being”;[2]From other hand, light is ''Tashkiki'', that is, of “a continuous hierarchic structure which can spread both vertically and horizentally”, and this is the idea that is revived by Persian philosopher, Suhravardi the Master of Illumination and theoretically accomplished by Mulla Sadra the founder of Persian Transcendent philosophy. Khatami uses the word “ontetic” to indicate these three elements when are taken together. Ontetic philosophy
is then a philosophy which is based on this idea.
Moreover, ontetic philosophy goes systematic. This philosophy requires its special method and logic, and Khatami has reconstructed the “transcendent method” and developed an “ontetic logic”.[3] To set up the transcendent method, first, Khatami starts from every day experience and reconstructs a method to transcend from this experience by reducing it to its original source step- by- step. This method leads to three continuous levels of human consciousness each of which follow its relevant level of logic. (see [[Ontetic Reduction]])
Being contemplated by philosophy is expressed by man himself, and therefore man's relations with the world, as also with Him, become central for the sphere of philosophy. Man is an acting subject, a free agent, capable of choosing between various ends compatible with the circumstances of his life, and insofar he is responsible for those relations; and, on the other hand, he has an end appointed him by nature which is obligatory upon him as his moral end. A philosophical knowledge of the world, then, must entail a philosophical knowledge or thorough explanation of the reasons of man's duties flowing from his relation to things and to Him.[4]

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Paraphrasing of copyrighted material''' may reduce the probability that a court will find that [[copyright]] has been infringed; however, there have been many cases where a [[paraphrase]] that uses quite different words and sentence structure has been found to infringe on a prior work's copyright.

The acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.

==Legal traditions==

===Early years===
[[File:Zedler - Universal-Lexicon, Band 1 (Titelblatt).jpg|thumb|[[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s right to publish his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon|Universal-Lexicon]]'' was challenged on the grounds that an encyclopedia must always paraphrase other works.]]
An early example of the concept of paraphrasing as a copyright issue arose with [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s application in 1730 for copyright protection in Saxony for his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'', one of the first encyclopedias. 
The publisher of a rival ''General Historical Lexicon'' said that Zedler's ''Universal Lexicon'' would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1891|pp=198}}
On 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory court in [[Dresden]] rejected Zedler's request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine if he reproduced any material from the ''General Historical Lexicon'' in his ''Universal Lexicon''.{{sfn|Order against Zedler}}

Laws on the degree of copying or paraphrasing that is considered permissible have become steadily more restrictive over the years.
In his 2008 book ''Copyright's Paradox'', discussing the conflict between protecting copyright and protecting free speech,  Neil Netanel says, "Yeats [borrowed] from Shelley; Kafka from Kleist and Dickens; Joyce from Homer; and T.S. Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright."{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=31}}
Paraphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission.  This would not be allowed today.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=100}}

Copyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers]].
The [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.
Parliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.
The [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the [[public domain]].
Over the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.{{sfn|Patterson|1993|pp=9ff}}

The Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.{{sfn|Levitsky|1964|p=101}}
By 1991, the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union]] had evolved to give much more protection to the author.
Free use, similar to the English [[common law]] concept of [[fair use]], was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=376}}

===Moral rights===

[[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. 
They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission.  Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. 
Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. 
Even if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.{{sfn|Rajan|2006|p=41-42}}
Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]].{{sfn|Rigamonti|2006|p=355}}
They were included in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=37}}
While the [[United States]] became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of [[copyright law]], which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|pp=30ff}}
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Gibbon]] was more concerned about poor translations of his book than about copyright violations.]]
[[Edward Gibbon]] published the last three volumes of his masterpiece ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.
With a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.
He wrote, "The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author.  The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...."{{sfn|Gibbon|2006|p=171}}

By the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.{{sfn|Winn|2006|pp=126-127}}
Section §43(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.
For any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=30}}
In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'' the British comedy group called ''[[Monty Python]]'' took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. 
The judgement of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] was in favor of ''Monty Python'', finding the cuts might be an "actionable mutilation" that violated the Lanham Act.{{sfn|Lumbard|1976}}

===Fair use===

In the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].
Section §107 of this act set out four "[[fair use]]" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:
*the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
*the nature of the copyrighted work;
*the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
*the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.
Judges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=162ff}}
According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp]]'' (1977), "The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry."{{sfn|Burleson Enterprises|2011}}
Claims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual.  
In ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] said, "the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-30}}
However, the court went on to quote Gorman, ''Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright'' (1982) which said, "[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case."{{sfn|O'Connor|1985}}

[[File:Gerald Ford hearing.jpg|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] at the hearing on pardoning former President [[Richard Nixon]]. When ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published excerpts of Ford's unpublished memoir describing his reason for pardoning Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright was infringed even though Ford was a public figure describing a public event.]]
Use of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=132}}
Parody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.
Although courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' (1994) ruled strongly: "[P]arody has an obvious claim to [[Transformativeness|transformative]] value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one.  We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107."{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=130–131}}

===Unpublished works===

Unpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.
Publication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.
An author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.{{sfn|Heins|Beckles|2005|p=17}}
In ''Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises'' (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that "under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use."{{sfn|Harper &amp; Row 1985}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'', which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over "fair use", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}
This drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public "right to know."{{sfn|McDowell|1987}}
In 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the ''Salinger'' case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished "shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration" of all four fair-use factors.{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-7}}

==Comparison approaches==

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.  Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.
In most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.
A loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.{{sfn|Head|2006|p=243}}
If the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=284}} 
In ''[[See v. Durang]]'' (1983) the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] found "Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying."{{sfn|Browning|Choy|Ferguson|1983}}
But courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.

[[File:LearnedHand1910a.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Learned Hand]] gave a seminal description of the [[idea/expression dichotomy]] in his 1930 judgement on ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]''.]]
Philosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.
In the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words.  
At the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=190}}
Copyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the [[idea/expression dichotomy]].{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=191-192}}
In ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]'' (1930), Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.{{sfn|Rooijen|2010|p=62-63}}
He said:
{{blockquote|Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out.  The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his "ideas," to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended ... Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.{{sfn|Hand|1930}}}}

The plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is "[[substantial similarity]]" between the alleged copy and the prior work.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}} 
In ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co]]'' (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of "total concept and feel", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.{{sfn|Hamley|1970}}
This concept has been used in later cases such as ''[[Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop]]'' (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying "the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization."{{sfn|Meskill|1976}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'' (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.
An extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.
Extrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.
Intrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}
The second test should be made by an "ordinary reasonable person" rather than an expert.{{sfn|Nimmer|2008|p=509}}
Both must be true for an infringement to exist.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}

==Sample court findings==

The ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the "protected expression" is.
A paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the "protected expression" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.
Many court cases have hinged on how "protected expression" is defined and how similarity is determined.
[[File:H. T. Marshall and Martin Thomas Manton in 1915 at the Becker-Rosenthal trial in New York City.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Judge [[Martin Thomas Manton]] ''(pictured, right)'' ruled that even loose paraphrasing may infringe copyright.]]
One of the earliest cases was ''[[Baker v. Selden]]'' (1879).  Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms.  W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=2ff}} 
The Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was "in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system."
The arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=18ff}}

In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.{{sfn|Standler|2009|p=13}}
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the "association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition."{{sfn|American Law Book Company|1939|p=233}}
The court said "The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two."{{sfn|Manton|1929}}

Wainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the ''Transcript'' magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.
In ''Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp'' (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that "news events" cannot be copyrighted, but found that "the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions."
The court said, "What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments."{{sfn|Mishler|1977}}
An example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:
:*Original: "And second, he says that likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which Fiber Divisions losses shrank last year."
:*Paraphrase: "The second development likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which the Fiber Division's losses shrank last year."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=285}} 
[[File:Richard Wright (escritor).jpg|thumb|In ''Wright v. Warner Books'' (1991) the court found that use of paraphrases and sparing excerpts from unpublished work by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] ''(pictured)'' was fair.]]
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'' (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist [[J. D. Salinger]]. As an example, the court cited:
:*Original: "He looks to me like a guy who makes his wife keep a scrapbook for him" 
:*Paraphrase: "[Salinger] had fingered [Wilkie] as the sort of fellow who makes his wife keep an album of press clippings."  
Despite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=287}}
In this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the "amount and substantiality" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=222}}
The court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like "Salinger says," or "he said" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.
The court barred publication.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}

The case of ''[[Wright v. Warner Books]]'' (1991) was superficially similar to ''Salinger''.
[[Margaret Walker]] wrote an unauthorized biography of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], best known for his  books ''[[Native Son]]'' and ''[[Black Boy]]'', 
in which she made "sparing  use" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.
Ellen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and [[Warner Books]], the publisher.{{sfn|Gaines|1992|p=175}}
In one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:
:*Original: "Ellen, Julia, and Rachel will be here on Tuesday: they'll stay for two days.  Don't know what will happen when they get here. I'm hoping for peace and quiet."
:*Paraphrase: "Early in 1960, Wright wrote to Margrit de Sabloniere that Ellen, Julia, and Rachel would be arriving for a two or three day visit. Wright said that he did not know what would happen when they arrived but that he was hoping for peace and quiet."
Despite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.
The paraphrasing was just "straightforward and factual reportage" of the "most basic and banal factual matter."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=286}}

==Exclusions==

There are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.
In this case, the "[[Merger doctrine (copyright law)|merger doctrine]]" comes into play.
The fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.
The merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=288}}
The merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=47}}
However, in 1994 a U.K. judge in ''Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance'' cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that "if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=45}}
[[File:Richard Posner at Harvard University.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued that websites should be legally required to obtain permission before paraphrasing news sources.]]
The term "Scenes a faire" means "obligatory scene", a scene in a play that the audience "has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction."  The term was applied to copyright law in ''[[Cain v. Universal Pictures]]'' (1942), where the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] ruled that "... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=52}}
The concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=54}}
The term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,
or a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=53}}
Another court said "Under the ... doctrine of ''[[scènes à faire]]'', courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea."{{sfn|Iyer|2012|p=53}}
The concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=59}}

==Permission agreements==

Publishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.
In this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement.  
Although paraphrasing may be considered [[fair use]] under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.{{sfn|Stim|2010|p=46}}

Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers.  His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride.  Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.{{sfn|Posner|2009}}

A '''romantic friendship''',  '''passionate friendship''', or '''affectionate friendship''' is a very close but typically non-[[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between [[friend]]s, often involving a degree of physical closeness beyond that which is common in the contemporary [[Western world|Western]] [[Society|societies]]. It may include for example [[holding hands]], [[cuddling]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, giving [[massages]], and sharing a bed, or [[co-sleeping]], without [[sexual intercourse]] or other physical sexual expression.

In historical scholarship, the term may be used to describe a very close relationship between people of the same sex during a period of history when [[homosexuality]] did not exist as a social category. In this regard, the term was coined in the later 20th century in order to retrospectively describe a type of relationship which until the mid 19th century had been considered unremarkable but since the second half of the 19th century had become more rare as [[physical intimacy]] between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|pp=231-313}} Romantic friendship between women in Europe and North America became especially prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of [[female education]] and a new rhetoric of [[sexual difference]].{{sfn|Rupp|2009|p=127}}

The study of historical romantic friendship is difficult because the primary source material consists of writing about love relationships, which typically took the form of love letters, poems, or philosophical essays rather than objective studies.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|ps=&amp;nbsp;''passim.''}} Most of these do not explicitly state the sexual or nonsexual nature of relationships; the fact that homosexuality was taboo in Western European cultures at the time means that some sexual relationships may be hidden, but at the same time the rareness of romantic friendship in modern times means that references to nonsexual relationships may be misinterpreted, as alleged by [[Lillian Faderman|Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz|Coontz]], [[E. Anthony Rotundo|Anthony Rotundo]], [[Douglas Bush]], and others.

===Shakespeare and Fair Youth===
{{Main|Sexuality of William Shakespeare}}

The content of Shakespeare's works has raised the question of whether he may have been bisexual.
Although twenty-six of [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] are love poems addressed to a married woman (the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]"), one hundred and twenty-six are addressed to an adolescent boy (known as the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]]"). The amorous tone of the latter group, which focus on the boy's beauty, has been interpreted as evidence for Shakespeare's bisexuality, although others interpret them as referring to intense friendship or fatherly affection, not sexual love.

Among those of the latter interpretation, in the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, Douglas Bush writes:
{{quotation|Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship and are likely to leap at the notion of homosexuality… we may remember that such an ideal, often exalted above the love of women, could exist in real life, from Montaigne to Sir Thomas Browne, and was conspicuous in Renaissance literature.{{sfn|Crompton|2003|p=379}}{{verify source|date=May 2016}}}}

Bush cites [[Montaigne]], who distinguished male friendships from "that other, licentious [[Greek love]]",&lt;ref&gt;Rollins 1:55; Bush cited Montaigne's 1580 work "On Friendship," in which the exact quote was: "And this other Greeke licence is justly abhorred by our customes." {{harvnb|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of a platonic interpretation.

===Montaigne and Etienne de La Boétie===
The French philosopher [[Montaigne]] described the concept of romantic friendship (without using this English term) in his essay "On Friendship." In addition to distinguishing this type of love from homosexuality ("this other Greek licence"), another way in which Montaigne differed from the modern view&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]'s 1865 essay "On Queen's Gardens" is a good example of the later view that emotionality was a female province; Kate Millet analyzes this essay in ''Sexual Politics'' (1969, 1970, 1990, 2000), University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|0-252-06889-0}}. Many modern books such as Carmen Renee Berry's ''Girlfriends: Invisible Ties'' (1998), Wildcat Canyon Press, {{ISBN|1-885171-20-X}}, argue that intensity in friendship is a female capacity.&lt;/ref&gt; was that he felt that friendship and platonic emotion were a primarily masculine capacity (apparently unaware of the custom of female romantic friendship which also existed):

{{quotation|Seeing (to speake truly) that the ordinary sufficiency of women cannot answer this conference and communication, the nurse of this sacred bond: nor seem their minds strong enough to endure the pulling of a knot so hard, so fast, and durable.{{sfn|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}}}

Lesbian-feminist historian [[Lillian Faderman]] cites Montaigne, using "On Friendship" as evidence that romantic friendship was distinct from homosexuality, since the former could be extolled by famous and respected writers, who simultaneously disparaged homosexuality. (The quotation also furthers Faderman's beliefs that gender and sexuality are [[Social construction|socially constructed]], since they indicate that each sex has been thought of as "better" at intense friendship in one or another period of history.)

===Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed===
{{Main|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}

Some historians have used the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Joshua Speed]] as another example of a relationship that modern people see as ambiguous or possibly gay, but which was most likely{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to have been a romantic friendship. Lincoln and Speed lived together, shared a bed in their youth{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and maintained a lifelong friendship. [[David Herbert Donald]] pointed out that men at that time often shared beds for financial reasons; men were accustomed to same-sex nonsexual intimacy, since most parents could not afford separate beds or rooms for male siblings. Anthony Rotundo notes that the custom of romantic friendship for men in America in the early 19th century was different from that of Renaissance France, and it was expected that men would distance themselves emotionally and physically somewhat after marriage; he claims that letters between Lincoln and Speed show this distancing after Lincoln married Mary Todd.{{r|Rotundo (1985)}} Such distancing is still practiced today.{{sfn|Geller|2001|pp=320–23}}

==Biblical and religious evidence==
Proponents of the romantic friendship hypothesis also make reference to the [[Bible]]. Historians like Faderman and Robert Brain{{sfn|Brain|1976}} believe that the descriptions of relationships such as [[David and Jonathan]] or Ruth and Naomi in this religious text establish that the customs of romantic friendship existed and were thought of as virtuous in the ancient [[Near East]], despite the simultaneous taboo on homosexuality.

The relationship between [[King David]] and [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], son of [[King Saul]], is often cited as an example of male romantic friendship; for example, Faderman uses 2 Samuel 1:26 on the title page of her book: "Your love was wonderful to me, passing the love of women."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 1:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and her [[mother-in-law]] [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] are the female Biblical pair most often cited as a possible romantic friendship, as in the following verse commonly used in same-sex [[wedding]] ceremonies:
{{quotation|Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; where you die I will die, and there will I be buried.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth to Naomi, Ruth 1:15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Faderman writes that women in Renaissance and Victorian times made reference to both Ruth and Naomi and "Davidean" friendship as the basis for their romantic friendships.{{sfn|Faderman|1981|pp=67, 121}}

While some authors, notably [[John Boswell]], have claimed that ecclesiastical practice in earlier ages blessed "same sex unions", the accurate interpretation of these relationships rests on a proper understanding of the mores and values of the participants, including both the parties receiving the rite in question and the clergy officiating at it. Boswell himself concedes that past relationships are ambiguous; when describing Greek and Roman attitudes, Boswell states that "[A] consensual physical aspect would have been utterly irrelevant to placing the relationship in a meaningful taxonomy."{{sfn|Boswell|1995|p=76}} Boswell's own interpretation has been thoroughly critiqued, notably by Brent D. Shaw, himself a homosexual, in a review written for the New Republic:

{{quotation|Given the centrality of Boswell's "new" evidence, therefore, it is best to begin by describing his documents and their import. These documents are liturgies for an ecclesiastical ritual called [[adelphopoiesis]] or, in simple English, the "creation of a brother." Whatever these texts are, they are not texts for marriage ceremonies. Boswell's translation of their titles (akolouthia eis adelphopoiesin and parallels) as "The Order of Celebrating the Union of Two Men" or "Office for Same-Sex Union" is inaccurate. In the original, the titles say no such thing. And this sort of tendentious translation of the documents is found, alas, throughout the book. Thus the Greek words that Boswell translates as "be united together" in the third section of the document quoted above are, in fact, rather ordinary words that mean "become brothers" (adelphoi genesthai); and when they are translated in this more straightforward manner, they impart a quite different sense to the reader.

Such agreements and rituals are "same-sex" in the sense that it is two men who are involved; and they are "unions" in the sense that the two men involved are co-joined as "brothers." But that is it. There is no indication in the texts themselves that these are marriages in any sense that the word would mean to readers now, nor in any sense that the word would have meant to persons then: the formation of a common household, the sharing of everything in a permanent co-residential unit, the formation of a family unit wherein the two partners were committed, ideally, to each other, with the intent to raise children, and so on.

Although it is difficult to state precisely what these ritualised relationships were, most historians who have studied them are fairly certain that they deal with a species of "ritualised kinship" that is covered by the term "brotherhood." (This type of "brotherhood" is similar to the ritualised agreements struck between members of the Mafia or other "men of honour" in our own society.) That explains why the texts on adelphopoiesis in the prayerbooks are embedded within sections dealing with other kinship-forming rituals, such as marriage and adoption. Giovanni Tomassia in the 1880s and Paul Koschaker in the 1930s, whose works Boswell knows and cites, had already reached this conclusion.{{r|Shaw (1994)}}}}

Historian Robert Brain has also traced these ceremonies from Pagan "blood brotherhood" ceremonies through medieval Catholic ceremonies called "gossipry" or "siblings before God," on to modern ceremonies in some Latin American countries referred to as "[[compadre|compadrazgo]]"; Brain considers the ceremonies to refer to romantic friendship.{{sfn|Brain|1976|p=75–107}}

== Romantic friendships in women's colleges ==
As the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American suffrage movement]] succeeded in gaining rights for white middle- and upper-class women, heterosexual marriage became less of a necessity, and many more women went to college and continued to live in female-centric communities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=12|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-women peer culture formed at [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] allowed students to create their own social rules and hierarchies, to become each other's leaders and heroes, and to idolize each other. These idolizations often took the forms of romantic friendships, which contemporaries called "smashes", "crushes" and "spoons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=19|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of "smashing" involved one student showering another with gifts: notes, chocolates, sometimes even locks of hair. When the object of the student's affections was wooed and the two of them began spending all their time together, the "aggressor" was perceived by her friends as "smashed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahli|first=Nancy Ann|date=1979|title=Smashing: Women's Relationships before the Fall|url=|journal=Chrysalis|volume=8|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, "crush" gradually replaced the term "smash", and generally signified a younger girl's infatuation with an older peer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=166|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Susan Van Dyne has documented an "intimate friendship" between Mary Mathers and Frona Brooks, two members of the [[Smith College]] class of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyne|first=Susan Van|date=2016|title="Abracadabra": Intimate Inventions by Early College Women in the United States|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=280–310|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathers and Brooks exchanged tokens of affection, relished time spent alone together, and celebrated an anniversary.

Romantic friendships kindled in women's colleges sometimes continued after graduation, with women living together in "[[Boston marriages]]" or cooperative houses. Women who openly committed themselves to other women often found acceptance of their commitment and lifestyle in academic fields, and felt comfortable expressing their feelings for their same-sex companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=190|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the century, smashes and crushes were considered an essential part of the women's college experience, and students who wrote home spoke openly about their involvement in romantic friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=66|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, however, public opinion had turned against crushes as the American public began to realize that [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] might not be dependent on men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=35|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in 1990s American gay and lesbian subculture==
Several small groups of advocates and researchers have advocated for the renewed use of the term, or the related term [[Boston marriage]], today. Several [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[feminist]] authors (such as [[Lillian Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz]], Jaclyn Geller and Esther Rothblum) have done academic research on the topic;{{sfn|Rothblum|1993}} these authors typically favor the [[social constructionist]] view that [[sexual orientation]] is a modern, culturally constructed concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Faderman's introduction in the 1998 edition of ''Surpassing the Love of Men''; Coontz's ''The Way We Never Were'' has as its thesis the social construction of a variety of family and relationship traditions, whereas Geller advocates for the abolition of marriage and a renewed focus on friendship for feminist reasons ({{harvnb|Geller|2001}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

He is held in the tradition to have been an emanation of [[Manjusri]], the embodiment of the wisdom of all the Buddhas.{{sfn|Pal|(1997)|p=49}}

After that he also known as a great scholar in [[Tibet]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]] and [[India]] and was proficient in the five great sciences of Buddhist philosophy, medicine, grammar, dialectics and sacred Sanskrit literature as well as the minor sciences of rhetoric, synonymies, poetry, dancing and astrology. He is considered to be the fourth Sakya Forefather and sixth [[Sakya Trizin]] and one of the most important figures in the Sakya lineage.

==Early years==

He was born as Palden Dondup at [[Sa'gya County|Sakya]] in the noble family of Jamyanggön (Khön).{{sfn|Penny-Dimri|(1995)||p=71}} This lineage had held the abbotship of Sakya on a hereditary basis since 1073. His father was Palchen Öpoche (1150-1203) and his mother Machig Nyitri Cham. Sakya Pandita was the nephew of [[Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen]] (1147–1216), and became the principal disciple of this prominent scholar.&lt;ref name=tibetgov&gt;The Government of Tibet in Exile. [http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/sakya.html The Sakya Tradition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613081114/http://tibet.com/Buddhism/sakya.html |date=2006-06-13 }}. Retrieved September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was instructed in the [[sutra]]s and [[tantra]]s by Dragpa Gyaltsen and mastered Sanskrit and three Inner Asian languages. Eventually he was initiated as a [[śrāmaṇera]] by his master and given the religious name Künga Gyeltsen.

As a young monk, he visited the prominent [[Kashmir]]i scholar [[Śakya Śri]], who ordained him as a [[bhikkhu|bhikśu]] in 1208, and taught him sutras and mantras. Legend has it that he visited [[Gyirong County|Kyirong]] in [[Nepal]] on his way back, and there defeated a [[brahman]] [[Shastri (degree)|Shastri]] in a debate on logic. He then overcome his opponent in a contest of supernatural powers. As he wanted to show his fellow Tibetans the peculiar dress of Indian Brahmin priests, he brought the Shastri to Tibet where the unlucky loser was killed by the protective deities of the land. The Shastri's head was then tied to a pillar of the great temple in Sakya which remained until modern times.{{sfn|Das|(1970)|pp=97-8}}&lt;ref&gt;According to Townsend, Dominique (2010) "Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen", [http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sakya-Pandita-Kunga-Gyeltsen/2137] this took place later, in 1240.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of Sakya Pandita with Indian learning provided a notably South Asian influence to his scholarship later on. His ordination as bhikśu marked the inception of Sakya as a proper monastic order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Kapstein|Kapstein, Matthew]] (2006) ''The Tibetans''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 110-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He acceded as ''dansa chenpo'' or abbot-ruler of Sakya upon the death of his uncle Dragpa Gyaltsen in 1216.

==Mongol invasion==
{{See also|Mongol conquest of Tibet}}
According to later Tibetan historiography, [[Genghis Khan]] subjugated a king of Tibet in 1206 and then sent a letter to the Sakya abbot. After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, the Tibetans stopped sending tribute. This is, however, a legend without historical foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Petech|Petech, Luciano]] (1990) ''Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Yüan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history''. Rome: IsIMEO, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known, however, that the grandson of Genghis Khan and second son of [[Ögedei Khan]], [[Godan Khan]] was granted an appanage at Liangzhou (present-day [[Wuwei, Gansu]]) in 1239. In 1240 he sent an invasion force under Dorta into Tibet. The [[Mongols]] reached the Phanyul Valley north of [[Lhasa]], killing some 500 monks and destroying and looting monasteries, villages and towns. The Gyal Lhakhang Monastery went up in flames and many monks of the [[Reting Monastery]] were slaughtered by the horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci|Tucci, Giuseppe]] (1949) ''Tibetan painted scrolls''. Rome, Vol. II, p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drigung Monastery]] was saved, ostensibly since the Mongols believed that a sudden avalanche of stones could be attributed to the supernatural powers of the lamas. According to [[Luciano Petech|L. Petech]], the [[Reting Monastery]] itself escaped destruction when Dorta reached [[Damxung County|Dam]], and its abbot suggested the Mongols to contact Sakya Paṇḍita, who was a famous author and religious figure and could represent the Tibetans vis-à-vis the Mongols.&lt;ref name="Petech, Luciano 1990 p. 8"&gt;Petech, Luciano (1990) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to J.Y. Chang, it was rather the Drigung abbot who made the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jiunn Yih (1984) ''A study of the relationship between the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and the Tibetan Sa-skya Sect''. PhD Thesis, Indiana University, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Later chronicles assert that Dorta sent message to Prince Godan and enumerated the four foremost sects and lamas of Tibet: [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]], [[Taklung Monastery|Taklung]], [[Drigung Monastery|Drigung]], and Sakya. Godan drew the conclusion that Sakya Pandita was an important and wise lama who could show the road to salvation, and ordered to send a letter of "invitation" and presents to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fifth Dalai Lama]] (1995) ''A history of Tibet''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, p. 90-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual reason for selecting the Sakya might have been that the sect was specialized in magic rituals that resonated with Mongol beliefs, and was prominent in spreading Buddhist morality. It was also important that Sakya Paṇḍita was a religious hierarch by birth, and thus represented a dynastic continuity useful for the Mongol aim to rule via respected intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1984) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stay at the Mongol court==

In fact, recent research has shown that the letter of summons sent by Godan is a later fabrication.&lt;ref name="Petech, Luciano 1990 p. 8"/&gt; Nevertheless, Sakya Pandita was indeed summoned to come to Godan's royal camp at Liangzhou in 1244. The cleric left Sakya in the company of his two young nephews, the ten-year-old [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa|Phagpa]] and six-year-old Chakna Dorje. As he continually preached sermons along his way he did not arrive at Prince Godan's camp until 1246. There he had to wait for Godan who at the time participated in the [[Kurultai]] where [[Güyük Khan]] was enthroned. Sakya Paṇḍita and Godan first met in early 1247.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Prince Godan of a serious illness, probably [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Thubten Jigme Norbu|Norbu, Thubten Jigme]] and [[Colin Turnbull|Turnbull, Colin]] (1969) ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People''. Chatto &amp; Windus. Reprint: Penguin Books (1987), p. 195, and Townsend, Dominique, "Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen" (2010), [http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sakya-Pandita-Kunga-Gyeltsen/2137], Sakya Paṇḍita, with the help of his nephew, Phagpa, adapted the [[Uighur script]] so that the Buddhist Scriptures could be translated into Mongolian which, until that time, was an unwritten language. This is not clear from more detailed studies which indicate that the new script was developed much later, in the 1260s.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, he was allegedly given "temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [''Trikor Chuksum''] of Central Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the myriarchies were not yet constituted by this time the story is not entirely correct. It should be understood in the sense that Sakya Paṇḍita was used as the main agent of the Mongols in Tibetan affairs. Tibetan historians quote a long letter by his hand to the various clerical and temporal lords in Tibet in 1249. In order to spare Tibet from devastating invasions, he wrote, it was necessary that the local regimes unconditionally accepted Mongol overlordship. A census was to be taken, and the lords must henceforth carry out the administration in consultation with envoys dispatched by Sakya and in accordance with Mongol law.&lt;ref&gt;The letter is accepted as genuine in Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 9, and Van Schaik, Sam (2011) ''Tibet: A history''. New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, p. 77. Jackson, David P. (1987) [http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jts/pdf/JTS_06_02.pdf] argues that it may be authored long after Sakya Paṇḍita's death.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sources keep silent about the actual imposition of Mongol rule in these years. The death of Güyük Khan in 1248 led to internal rivalries in the dynasty of Genghis Khan until the enthronement of [[Möngke Khan]] in 1251. This left Tibetan affairs in a state of limbo for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turrell V. Wylie|Wylie, Turrell V.]], 'The first Mongol conquest of Tibet reinterpreted', in McKay, Alex (ed.), ''The history of Tibet'', Vol. II. London &amp; New York 2003, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and inheritance==
Sakya Pandita died on 28 November 1251, at the age of seventy, in the Trulpaide temple in Liangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 10. According to the legendary account in Das, Sarat Chandra (1970) ''Contributions on the religion and history of Tibet''. New Delhi: Manjusri, p. 98, he died in the city of Gyu-ma.&lt;/ref&gt; As he did not marry, he chose his brother's son Chogyal Phagpa as his heir, and nominated him before his death as the successor to his religious authority by giving him his conch shell and begging bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, pp. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death Phagpa continued his mission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf A. Stein|Stein, R. A.]] (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The conch is one of the [[Ashtamangala]] and the begging bowl was a particular symbol of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the [[śramaṇa]]s.

After Sakya Pandita's death, the new Mongol ruler [[Möngke Khan]] chose to patronize the [[Drikung Kagyu]] while the other main schools were put under the protection of various Mongol princes. Nevertheless, a decree from 1252 stated that the Sakya precepts should be followed in the main. Meanwhile, Phagpa won a position in the court of Möngke's brother [[Kublai Khan]] and became the tantric guru of the prince in 1258. When Kubilai came to power in 1260 he appointed Phagpa ''guoshi'' "preceptor of the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam Van (2011) ''Tibet: A history''. New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began a strong Sakya-Mongol alliance, and the see or ''densa'' ({{bo|w=gdan sa}}) of Sakya became the administrative capital of Tibet in 1264. This lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th [[Sakya Trizin]], [[Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen]], the myriarch [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] of the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]] began to subordinate the Central Tibetan province [[Ü (region)|Ü]], marking the "beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Penny-Dimri, Sandra (1995) "The Lineage of His Holiness Sakya Trizin Ngawang-Kunga." ''The Tibet Journal'', Vol. XX No. 4, Winter 1995, pp. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lineage of the [[Tibet]]an [[Panchen Lama]]s there were considered to be four Indian and three Tibetan [[tulku]]s of [[Amitābha]] before [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]]. The lineage starts with [[Subhuti]], one of the original disciples of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Sakya Paṇḍita is considered to be the second Tibetan emanation of Amitābha in this line.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (paper), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das, Sarat Chandra (1970) ''Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet''.

With his profound knowledge of Indian Buddhism, Sakya Paṇḍita was observant of what was seen as aberrations in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He was suspicious of lamas who promised enlightenment without going through the consecutive stages of Buddhist practices and took a more conservative view. The scholastic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism owes much to him, and his works are still included in the monastic curricula today.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik, Sam (2011), pp. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Logical positivism]] asserts that '''structural semantics''' is the study of relationships between the meanings of terms within a sentence, and how meaning can be composed from smaller elements. However, some [[critical theorists]] suggest that meaning is only divided into smaller structural units via its regulation in concrete social interactions; outside of these interactions, language may become meaningless.&lt;br&gt;
Structural semantics is that branch that marked the modern [[linguistics]] movement started by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] at the break of the 20th century in his posthumous discourse titled "''[[Cours De Linguistique Generale]]''" (A Course in General Linguistics). He posits that language is a system of inter-related units and structures and that every unit of language is related to the others within the same system. His position later became the bedding ground for other theories such as [[componential analysis]] and [[relational predicates]]. Structuralism is a very efficient aspect of Semantics, as it explains the concordance in the meaning of certain words and utterances. The concept of sense relations as a means of semantic interpretation is an offshoot of this theory as well. 

Structuralism has revolutionized semantics to its present state, and it also aids to the correct understanding of other aspects of linguistics. The consequential fields of structuralism in linguistics are sense relations (both lexical and sentential) among others.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oyama's work interrogates the [[nature versus nurture]] debates, and problematizes the conceptual foundations (e.g., assumptions, binaries, and classifications) on which these debates depend. Her notion of a "developmental system" allows us to reevaluate and reintegrate standard dichotomies such as [[Evolutionary developmental biology|development and evolution]], [[Mind-body problem|body and mind]], and stasis and change. Oyama's [[Developmental systems theory]] has had a significant impact in [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], and the [[philosophy of biology]].

The '''Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction''' is a doctrinal distinction made within Tibetan Buddhism between two stances regarding the use of logic and the meaning of conventional truth within the presentation of [[Madhyamaka]].

''Svātantrika'' is a category of Madhyamaka viewpoints attributed primarily to the 6th-century Indian scholar [[Bhāviveka]]. Bhāviveka criticised [[Buddhapalita]]s abstinence from syllogistic reasoning in his commentary on Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p=386, note 12}} Following the example of the influential logician [[Dignāga]], Bhāviveka used autonomous syllogistic reasoning (''svātantra'') syllogisms in the explanation of Madhyamaka. To have a common ground with essentialist opponents, and make it possible to use syllogistic reasoning in discussion with those essentialists, Bhāviveka argued that things can be said to exist conventionally 'according to characteristics'. This makes it possible to take the mere object as the point of departure for the discussion on inherent existence. From there, it is possible to explain how these things are ultimately empty of inherent existence.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=251-257}}

''Prasaṅgika'' views are based on [[Candrakīrti]]'s critique of Bhāviveka, arguing for a sole reliance on ''prasaṅga'', "logic consequence," a method of [[reductio ad absurdum]] which is used by all Madhyamikas, using syllogisms to point out the absurd and impossible logical consequences of holding essentialist views.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} According to Candrakīrti, the mere object can only be discussed if both parties perceive it in the same way.{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=253}}{{refn|group=note|name="mere"}} As a consequence (according to Candrakirti) svatantrika reasoning is impossible in a debate, since the opponents argue from two irreconcilable points of view, namely a mistaken essentialist perception, and a correct non-essentialist perception. This leaves no ground for a discussion starting from a similarly perceived object of discussion, and also makes impossible the use of syllogistic reasoning to convince the opponent.{{refn|group=note|name=non-common perception}}

Candrakīrti's works had no influence on Indian and early Tibetan Madhayamaka, but started to rise to prominence in Tibet in the 12th century. [[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), the founder of the [[Gelugpa]] school and the most outspoken proponent of the distinction, followed Candrakīrti in his rejection of Bhavaviveka's arguments.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=251-259}} According to Tsongkhapa, the Svātantrikas do negate intrinsic nature ultimately, but "accept that things conventionally have intrinsic character or intrinsic nature."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=255}} Tsongkhapa, commenting on Candrakirti, says that he "refute[s] essential or intrinsic nature even conventionally."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=274}} For Tsongkhapa, as well as for the [[Karma Kagyu]] school, the differences with Bhavaviveka are of major importance.{{sfn|Cornu|2001}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

Established by Lama Tsongkhapa, Candrakīrti's view replaced the ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika'' approach of [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788), who synthesized Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddhist logic in a powerful and influential synthesis called ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika''. Śāntarakṣita established Buddhism in Tibet, and his ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika'' was the primary philosophic viewpoint until the 12th century, when the works of Candrakīrti were first translated into Tibetan.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} In this synthesis, conventional truth or reality is explained and analysed in terms of the Yogacara system, while the ultimate truth is presented in terms of the Madhyamaka system.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|p="Shantarakshita's importance [...] Dharmakirti"}} While Śāntarakṣita's synthesis reflects the final development of Indian Madhyamaka and post-dates Candrakīrti, Tibetan doxographers ignored the nuances of Śāntarakṣita's synthesis, grouping his approach together with Bhāviveka's, due to their usage of syllogistic reasonings to explain and defend Madhyamaka.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

After the 17th century civil war in Tibet and the Mongol intervention which put the Gelugpa school in the center of power, Tsongkhapa's views dominated Tibetan Buddhism until the 20th century.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} The [[Rimé movement]] revived alternate teachings, providing alternatives to Tsongkhapa's interpretation, and reintroducing Śāntarakṣita's nuances. For the [[Sakya]] and [[Nyingma]] schools, which participated in the Rimé movement, the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction is generally viewed to be of lesser importance.{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=4}}{{sfn|Cabezon|Lobsang Dargyay|2007|p=278n8}}{{sfn|Cornu|2001}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} For these schools, the key distinction between these viewpoints is whether one works with assertions about the ultimate nature of reality, or if one refrains completely from doing so. If one works with assertions, then that is a Svātantrika approach. Refraining from doing so is a Prāsangika approach.&lt;ref group=web name="AB_self-voidness-and-other-voidness"/&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}}

==Indian Madhyamaka==
{{See also|Two truths doctrine}}

[[Madhyamaka]] originated with the works of 
*[[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE), and his commentators. The Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction can be traced to the following three commentators:
* [[Buddhapālita]] (470 – 550 CE), a minor author in India,{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} whom Tibetan tradition credits as the founder of the Prasangika "school," was an early adopter of [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] and consequentialist methods in his writings, although of a particularly limited form;
* [[Bhāviveka]] (c. 500 – c. 578 CE), who was influenced by the developing Buddhist logic initiated by [[Dignāga]] (c. 480 – c. 540 CE), and used syllogistic reasoning in his commentary on Nagarjuna. He did so to catch up with these developments in Buddhist logic, and prevent Madhyamaka from becoming obsolete.{{sfn|Rizzi|1988|p=4-5}} His criticisms of Buddhapalita are retrospectively imagined as the foundation of the Svatantrika "school";
*[[Candrakīrti]] (c. 600 – c. 650 CE), who defended Buddhapālita against Bhāvyaviveka. Although he "attracted almost no following and made no impact on the development of the Madhyamaka tradition" in India,{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} he became regarded by the Tibetan tradition after 1200 CE as an important proponent of Prāsangika.
* [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788), who synthesized Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddhist logic in a powerful and influential synthesis called ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika''. He established Buddhism in Tibet, and his ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika'' was the primary philosophic viewpoint established there, which reigned superior until the 12th century, when the works of Candrakīrti were first translated into Tibetan.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

The name ''Prasangika'' is derived from {{IAST|Prasaṅga}}, a method of logical inquiry which deconstructs the opponents' argument in debate through the use of unwanted logical consequences. It arises from [[Bhāvaviveka]]'s criticism that Buddhapālita ought not to have relied solely on ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argumentation &amp;mdash;hence the name "Prāsangika", from ''prāsanga'' ("consequence")&amp;mdash;but ought to have set forth "autonomous" (''svātantra'') syllogisms of his own.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=7-14}}{{refn|group=note|Whether a Madhyamaka viewpoint would allow the necessary factual claims, or statements of [[epistemology|epistemological]] principles, for such an argument was the major point in dispute.}}

===Bhāviveka===
[[Bhāviveka]] (c. 500 – c. 578 CE) argued that [[Syllogism|autonomous syllogistic reasoning]] was required when explaining or commenting on Nagarjuna's teachings on voidness or essencelessness.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}{{refn|group=note|Padmakar Translation Group: "[According to Bhavya,] the commentator’s role is not to repeat Nagarjuna’s already superlative performance but to discuss it and to present it skillfully. The task at hand is to resolve the element of doubt intrinsic to the consequentialist method, to deal with possible objections, and generally to facilitate the intellectual comprehension of those who require explanation and who cannot as yet penetrate, directly and unaided, the profound message of the original author. To that extent, it is both necessary and fitting to make positive, explanatory statements."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}}} To be able to use syllogistic reasoning, both parties need to share a common object of discussion at the conventional level. While the various opponents have different opinions on the specifics of their teachings, the ''mere'' objects or ''mere'' forms are commonly appearing to both parties, "enjoy[ing] a certain existence 'according to their characteristics."{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=253}}{{refn|group=note|Padmakara Translation Group: "Bhavaviveka was apparently aware [that, according to the rules of logic, independent syllogisms commit their user to an implicit and compromising acquiescence in the existence of the elements referred to], and we have seen that, in the interests of consistency, his use of the independent syllogism went hand in hand with a view that, on the conventional level, phenomena do indeed enjoy a certain existence 'according to their characteristics.'"{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2012|p=Section "Mipham Rinpoche and the Prasangika-Svatantrika Distinction"}}}}

Bhāviveka criticised Buddhapalita for merely repeating Nagarjuna's ad absurdum approach in his commentary, instead of clarifying Nagarjuna's teachings. According to Bhāviveka, syllogistic reasoning could be used for the sake of clarification.{{refn|group=note|Padmakara Translation Group, Note 12: "Bhavya holds that the consequential arguments of Buddhapalita are not on the same footing as those of Nagarjuna. In both cases, the consequences imply negations that could theoretically be formulated as positive (syllogistic) arguments. The difference between them is that, given what is known to be Nagarjuna's intention (the negation of all four positions of the tetralemma), his negations are to be understood as nonimplicative. But such a concession is not to be granted to the commentator, whose task is to render explicit to the fullest extent the obscurities of the commented text. If the commentator uses consequences (unaccompanied by any positive and clarificatory statement), the resulting negations cannot automatically be regarded as nonimplicative. On the contrary, they are implicative and therefore undesirable in the Madhyamaka context...It is worth noting that it is in Bhavya that the important distinction between implicative and nonimplicative negations first appears.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p=386, note 12}}}} Bhāviveka further argued that Buddhapalita only showed the logical consequences, and incoherence, of the Samkhya's views on causation and inherent existence, but failed to address their arguments against Buddhist critiques. Furthermore, simply negating the opponent's view, without positing one's own position, "leaves room for doubt in the opponent's mind," and is unwarranted.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2012|p="Bhavaviveka objected [...] in the opponent's mind."}}

To facilitate the possibility of discussing Madhyamaka with opponents, Bhāviveka made a provisional division of the two truths, accepting that phenomena exist "according to their characteristics."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="Turning to the question [...] that they appear."}} Bhāviveka made a further distinction in his treatment of ultimate truth or reality. Ultimate truth or reality transcends discursive thought, and cannot be expressed in words. To be able to talk about it anyway, and distinguish it from relative truth or reality, Bhāviveka makes a distinction between the "world-transcending" or "ultimate truth in itself," which is ineffable and beyond words; and the "pure worldly wisdom" or "approximate truth," which can be talked about and points to the "ultimate truth in itself," which has to be personally experienced.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="This division [...] "concordant ultimate""}}

Dreyfus and McClintock observe that Bhāvaviveka was more influential in Indian Madhyamaka than was Candrakirti: "In this regard, Bhāvaviveka should probably be seen as quite successful: apart from Candrakirti and Jayananda, nearly all other Indian Madhyamikas were to follow in his footsteps and embrace autonomous arguments as important tools in their endeavors to establish the supremacy of the Madhyamaka view."{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=8-9}}

===Candrakirti===
[[Candrakirti]] (c. 600 – c. 650 CE) had little impact during his lifetime. The first commentary on his ''Madhyamakavatara'' was written in India in the 11th century, more than 300 years after his death.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} In the 12th century his works were translated in Tibetan, and became highly influential.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

Candrakirti rejected Bhāviveka's criticism of Buddhapālita, and his use of independent logic.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} According to Candrakīrti, the mere object can only be discussed if both parties perceive it in the same way.{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=253}}{{refn|group=note|name="mere"|Chandrakirti, as quoted by Tsongkhapa in the ''Lamrim Chenmo, Volume Three'': "When one party posits something as a probative reason, even though [[Pramana#Buddhism|valid cognition]] may establish it for the one who posits the syllogism, how can that person be certain that valid cognition establishes it for the other party?"{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tsongkhapa, presenting Bhavaviveka's argument: "[According to Bhavaviveka] we must use the ''mere'' eye or ''mere'' form as the subject. Why? Because it must be established as commonly appearing to both parties."{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=253}}}} According to Candrakirti, this is impossible, since the opponents argue from two irreconcilable points of view, namely a mistaken essentialist perception, and a correct non-essentialist perception. This leaves no ground for a discussion starting from a similarly perceived object of discussion, and also makes impossible the use of syllogistic reasoning to convince the opponent.{{refn|group=note|name=non-common perception}} According to Chandrakirti, without a conventionally appearing set of characteristics to designate upon, the Svātantrika would not be able to establish a syllogism.{{refn|group=note|Daniel Cozart: "[For the Svātantrika, if the subject of the debate is not] established as commonly appearing and as demonstrably established objectively, they are not able to prove the modes of the sign in terms of such (a subject) because it is not feasible that there be a predicate of a nonexistent substratum."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel "Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School"|239&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Candrakirti also rejected Bhāviveka's argument that autonomous arguments should be used in commentaries to clarify the original text, noting that Nagarjuna himself, in his auto-commentary on the ''Vigrahavyavartani'', also didn't use autonomous arguments.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

Candrakirti rejected "the use of autonomous arguments, for the very reason that they imply the acceptance (however provisional) of entities.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} According to Chandrakirti, this mode of thinking is a subtle form of grasping at inherent existence: one's mind is still searching for some way to hold on to an essence, self, or identity for conventionally perceived objects.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2012|p=Section "Mipham Rinpoche and the Prasangika-Svatantrika Distinction"}} For Candrakirti, there is no use in explaining the relative truth in any philosophical system; "the relative truth consists simply of phenomena as we observe them, the unanalyzed constituents of the common consensus."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} The only aim of consequential arguments "is to introduce the mind to the direct knowledge of emptiness, not an intellectual understanding of it,"{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} making "no concessions to the spiritually unprepared."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

Candrakirti's criticism was "part of a wider rejection of the logico-epistemological tradition of Dignāga, which he regarded as a misguided attempt to find "philosophical completeness" and a sense of intellectual security that is antithetical to the fundamental insight of Madhyamaka."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} Candrakirti did not reject the use of logic, but it served to demarcate the limits of discursive thought.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} In the absence of any agreement between Madhyamikas and substantialists, ''prasanga'' is the best approach "to indicate the ultimate without making statements that [...] compromise or [...] obscure their own position."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} Since the use of autonomous arguments implies the acceptance of real entities, even if only provisional, they should not be used.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

===Śāntarakṣita===
Born and educated in India, [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) came to the [[Tibetan Empire]] at the instigation of King [[Trisong Detsen]] after Nyang Tingdzin Zangpo had encouraged the King to make the invitation. [[Śāntarakṣita]] came to Tibet sometime before 767 CE. He oversaw the construction of the first Buddhist monastery at [[Samye]] in 787 CE, ordained the first monastics there, had Indian Buddhist texts brought to Tibet, and started the first translation project. He also advised the king to invite [[Padmasambhava]] to come to Tibet. He was also instrumental in the coming of [[Kamalaśīla]] to Tibet, who participated in the so-called "council of Lhasa," which, according to Tibetan tradition, led to the defeat of the Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|chan]] monk [[Moheyan]], and the establishment of Indian Buddhism as the norm for Tibetan Buddhism.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|p="With regard to the role [...] Indian Buddhism"}}

Śāntarakṣita synthesised Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and the logico-epistemological tradition of Dignaga and Dharmakirti. In this synthesis, conventional truth or reality is explained and analysed in terms of the Yogacara system, while the ultimate truth is presented in terms of the Madhyamaka system.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|p="Shantarakshita's importance [...] Dharmakirti"}}

==Tibetan Madhyamaka==

===Divisions prior to the distinction===
When Buddhism was established in Tibet, the primary philosophic viewpoint established there was that of [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788), a synthesis of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddhist logic called ''Yogācāra-Mādhyamika''.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} A common distinction of Madhyamaka teachings was given by [[Jnanasutra]] ({{bo|w=ye shes sde}}, 8th&amp;ndash;9th centuries), a student of Śāntarakṣita:{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="Shantarakshita's disciple Yeshe De [...] that observes them."}} 
# "[[Sautrāntika]] Madhyamika," including Bhāviveka; and
# "[[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] Madhyamaka," including [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Kamalaśīla]], and [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]].

The difference lies in their "acceptance or rejection of extramental phenomena on the conventional level."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} While Bhavaviveka considered material phenomena at the conventional level as to be existent outside the mind, he applied Sautrantika terminology to describe and explain them. Śāntarakṣita rejected this approach, denying "the extramental status of phenomena appearing within the sphere of conventional truth." Instead, he saw conventional phenomena as manifestations of the mind, in line with the Yogacara approach.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="Shantarakshita's disciple Yeshe De [...] that observes them."}}

Candrakirti's works were known in Tibet as early as the 8th century, but "specifically in connection with the logical tradition," when Candrakirti's ''Yuktishashtika'' was translated by Yeshe De (Jnanasutra) and some others.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="One is tempted [...] after Chandrakirti's death."}} The Prāsangika-Svātantrika distinction was possibly invented by the Tibetan translator [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa|Pa tshab nyi ma grags]] (1055-1145), using the terms ''Rang rgyud pa'' and ''Thal 'gyur ba'', which were Sanskritized by modern scholars as ''Svātantrika'' and ''Prāsaṅgika''.{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=3}} According to Dreyfus and McClintock, Tibetan scholars themselves state that the distinction "is a Tibetan creation that was retroactively applied in an attempt to bring clarity and order to the study of contemporary Indian Madhyamaka interpretations."{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|Tsongkhapa commented on this distinction, stating that "since [the use of the terms Prāsangika and Svātantrika agree] with [[Chandrakirti|Chandrakırti’s]] ''Clear Words'' ([[Chandrakirti#Major works|Prasannapada]]), you should not suppose that" it is a Tibetan fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P116&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later Gelugpa scholars as well as Nyingmapas, after Candrakīrti's works were translated in Tibetan in the 12th century,{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} considered both of the above to constitute subdivisions of Svatantrika, however, under the names of 
# "Sautrantika Svātantrika Madhyamaka" 
# "Yogācāra Svātantrika Madhyamaka."

Those various teachers, and their approaches were grouped together due to their usage of syllogistic reasonings to explain and defend Madhyamaka, in disregard of the philosophical nuances of Śāntarakṣita's approach.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

A related doctrinal topic of profound disagreement is between [[Rangtong-Shentong]], which concerns the "nature" of ultimate truth as empty of a self or essence, or as constituting an absolute reality which is "truly existing" and empty of any other, transitional phenomena.{{refn|group=note|This is also related to Rangtong-Shentong the idea of [[Buddha-nature#Tibetan Buddhism|Buddha Nature]]}}

===Lama Tsongkhapa and Gelugpa's dominant view===
{{See also|History of Tibetan Buddhism#Tibetan independence (14th-18th century)|l1=History of Tibetan Buddhism}}

Initially, this new distinction based on Candrakirti's ''Prasannapada'' met with fierce resistance in Tibet, but gained in popularity and was strongly supported by Je Tsongkhapa{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} (1357 – 1419 CE). He became the most outspoken defender of the Svātantrika-Prāsaṅgika distinction, arguing that "the two subschools are separated by crucial philosophical differences, including a different understanding of emptiness and of conventional reality."{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=4}} Tsongkhapa was a powerful personality with a large following, but he too met with a strong resistance, especially within the [[Sakya]] school to which he originally belonged. His critics rejected his interpretation as "inadequate, newfangled, and unsupported by tradition."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} According to those critics, Tsongkhapa had "greatly exaggerated the divergence of view."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

Tsongkhapa's view became the dominant view in the beginning of the 17th century, when [[Gusri Khan]] (1582-1655) ended the civil war in central Tibet, putting the [[5th Dalai Lamai]] in command of the temples in Tibet. This gave the Gelugpa school a strong political power, and the means to effectively ban the writings of Tsongkhapa's critics.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}

====Tsongkhapa's view====
{{Main|Je Tsongkhapa|Prasaṅgika according to Tsongkhapa}}

For Tsongkhapa, the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction centers around the usage of [[Syllogism|autonomous syllogistic reasoning]] to convince opponents of the Madhyamaka point of view, and the implications of the establishment of conventional existence 'according to characteristics'.

Tsongkhapa objected against Bhaviveka's use of [[Syllogism|autonomous syllogistic reasoning]] in explaining voidness or essencelessness.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=251-259}} To be able to use syllogistic reasoning, both parties need to have a common ground onto which those syllogistic reasonings can be applied. This common ground is the shared perception of the object whose's emptiness of inherent existence is to be established. According to Bhaviveka, this shared perception is possible because the perceived objects are mentally imputed (labeled) based on characteristic marks which distinguishes them from other objects.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref group=web name="AB_self-voidness-and-other-voidness"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Alexander Berzin: "[In Svatantrika] [y]ou establish that [something] exists because it can be imputed (or labeled) with a name or concept; that’s what establishes that it exists. But it’s not only that which establishes that it exists, because there are findable characteristic marks on the side of the object which make it what it is, and in conjunction with mental labeling you can establish that it exists. So the relative truth of things: you have these findable characteristic marks. And deepest truth: no such thing as true unimputed existence.&lt;ref group=web name="AB_self-voidness-and-other-voidness"&gt;Alexander Berzin, [https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/lam-rim/vipashyana/self-voidness-and-other-voidness Self-Voidness and Other Voidness]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Prāsaṅgika reject this idea, arguing that "[w]hat establishes that things exist is only that they are imputable, not that they are imputable with a findable characteristic."&lt;ref group=web name="AB_self-voidness-and-other-voidness"/&gt; According to Tsongkhapa, there is no such common ground or shared perception,&lt;!-- **START OF NOTES** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=non-common perception|Candrakirti: "...inaccurate consciousness cannot exist when accurate consciousness is present. So how could the conventional eye, as the subject of a syllogism, exist for an accurate consciousness?"{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=254}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tsongkhapa: "The passage of the ''Clear Words'' that reply to Bhavaviveka show that the subject is not established as appearing in common to the two parties in the debate."{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=254}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tsongkhapa further explains that in non-Prasangika systems, the object as it appears to ordinary consciousness is the object just as it is. According to Tsongkhapa, this is not sufficient for Madhyamikas, since this object as it appears is a mistaken perception: "Since no phenomenon can, even conventionally, have a nature that is established by way of its intrinsic character, there is no valid cognition that establishes such a thing. It is with this in mind that the master Candrakirti refutes the notion of autonomous syllogism."{{sfn|TsongKhapa|2002|p=254}}}}{{refn|group=note|Daniel Cozart: "The meaning of autonomy (rang rgyud, svatantra) is asserted as: the generation of inferential cognition realizing the probandum (bsgrub bya) within the (context of the three modes)[of a syllogism] being established." Therefore, if the subject "on which depend the predicates about which the two parties debate [... does] not exist within being established as commonly appearing and as demonstrably established objectively, they are not able to prove the modes of the sign."

Tsongkhapa holds [[reductio ad absurdum]] of essentialist viewpoints to be the most valid method of demonstrating [[Shunyata|emptiness of inherent existence]], and of demonstrating that conventional things do not have a naturally occurring conventional identity.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=224-267}}&lt;ref group=web name=Sparham&gt;Gareth Sparham (2017), [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tsongkhapa/ Tsongkhapa], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sparham: "Tsongkhapa does not accept svātantra (“autonomous”) reasoning (the fourth point).

This gives Tsongkhapa's philosophy its name *Prāsaṅgika-madhyamaka, i.e., a philosophy of a middle way (between nihilism and eternalism) arrived at through demonstrating the unwelcome consequences (in any given position that presupposes intrinsic existence)."{{r|Sparham|group=web}}}} According to Tsongkhapa, if both people in a debate or discussion have a valid understanding of emptiness already, then autonomous syllogistic arguments could be quite effective. However, in a circumstance where one or both parties in a debate or discussion do not hold a valid understanding, "the debate [should be] founded on what the parties accept as valid. Hence, it is proper to refute opponents in terms of what they accept."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227}} In other words, it is more appropriate to establish a position of emptiness through showing the logical consequences of the incorrect position that the opponent already accepts, than it is to establish emptiness through syllogistic reasoning using premises that the opponent (and perhaps even the proponent) do not fully or deeply understand.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227-228}}

While Tsongkhapa's view met with strong resistance after their introduction,{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p="The brilliance [...] ontological matters."}} his views came to dominate Tibet in the 17th century, with the [[Ganden Phodrang]] government, after the military intervention of the Mongol lord Gusri Khan. He supported the Gelugpa's against the [[Tsangpa]] family, and put the 5th Dalai Lama in charge of Tibet.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|p="Not surprisingly [...] as late as 1975."}} Seminal texts which were critical of Tsongkhapa's views, such as [[Gorampa]]s critic, "ceased to be available and were almost lost."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005}}

===Alternate views and criticism===
According to Dreyfus &amp; McClintock, "many other Tibetan commentators have tended to downplay the significance of any differences."{{sfn|Dreyfus|McClintock|2015|p=4}}

====Nyingma====
In the 19th century the concurring Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya schools joined forces in the [[Rimé movement]], in an attempt to preserve their religious legacy against the dominant Gelugpa school.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p="It is important to situate [...] Gelugpa scholasticism."}} [[Ju Mipham]]'s commentary on Santarakshita's ''Madhyamakalankara'' ("The Adornment of the Middle Way") is an example of this new impetus to older strands of Tibetan Buddhism.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005}} Mipham presents an alternative interpretation of the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction, in which the emphasis is not on "dialectical preferences," (consequential reasoning versus syllogistic reasoning), but on the distinction between the "approximate ultimate truth" and the "actual ultimate truth," just like Bhavaviveka did.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p="When discussing the two [...] a little further."}} According to Mipham, "the authentic Svatantrika is the approach that emphasizes the approximate ultimate, while the Prasangika approach emphasizes the ultimate in itself, beyond all assertions."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005}} His is a gradual approach, starting with sensory experience and the 'realness' of the "things" perceived through them, which are "provisionally accorded a certain existence." From there the approximate ultimate truth is posited, demonstrating that "phenomena cannot possibly exist in the way that they appear," invalidating the conventional reality of appearances. From there, "the ultimate truth in itself, which is completely free from all ssertion, is reached."{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005}} While the Svatantrikas do make assertions about conventional truth or reality, they stay silent on the ultimate in itself, just like the Prasangikas.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p="And with regard [...] no assertions."}}

According to Ju Mipham, Tsongkhapa's approach was seriously flawed.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p="For in Miphams'opinion [...] severely flawed."}} Tsongkhapa's approach leads students in the right direction but will not lead to the true ultimate until they go further.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p=21-24}} Mipham further argues that Tsongkhapa's approach is an excellent Svatantrika approach, because of the way he refutes true establishment instead of objects themselves.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p=21-24}} According to the Padmakara Translation Group, "its presentation of "conventional," as distinct from "true," existence seems very close to the "existence according to characteristics" that Bhavya had ascribed to phenomena on the relative level.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|2005|p=23}}

====Sakya====
The Sakya teacher [[Gorampa]] was critical of Tsongkhapa and his views. One of Gorampa's most important and popular works is ''Distinguishing the Views'' ({{bo|t=ལྟ་བའི་ཤན་འབྱེད|w=lta ba'i shan 'byed}}), in which he argues for his view of [[Madhyamaka]]. He and other Sakya teachers classify themselves as presenting the "Freedom from Proliferation" ({{bo|w=spros bral|t=སྤྲོས་བྲལ་}}) Madhyamaka.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus302"&gt;Dreyfus (2003) p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Gorampa does not agree with Tsonghkapa that the Prasangika and Svatantrika methods produce different results, nor that the Prasangika is a "higher" view. He does also critique the Svatantrika approach as having too much reliance on logic, because in his view the component parts of syllogistic logic are not applicable in the realm of the ultimate. But this critique is constrained to the methodology, and he believed both approaches reach the same ultimate realization.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus302-306"&gt;Dreyfus (2003) pp.302-306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Sakya]]s (following Rongtön and [[Gorampa]]) also hold the position that the distinction between these two schools is merely of a pedagogical nature. With regard to the view of the ultimate truth there is no difference between them.{{sfn|Cabezon|Lobsang Dargyay|2007|p=278n8}}

====Kagyu====
Kagyu and Sakya scholars have argued against the claim that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p=21-24}} According to those critics, there is no difference in the realization of those using the Svatantrika and Prasangika approaches. They also argue that the Svatantrika approach is better for students who are not able to understand the more direct approach of Prasangika, but it nonetheless results in the same ultimate realization.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2005|p=21-24}}

====Gelugpa====
The debate is also not strictly along lineage lines, since there are some non-Gelugpa's who prefer Je Tsongkhapa's points, while a notable Gelugpa, [[Gendün Chöphel]], preferred and wrote about Ju Mipham's interpretation.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://anyenrinpoche.com/madhyamaka.html Shedra class description using Chöpel's text]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2017}}

While Lama Tsongkhapa's approach to Madhyamaka is still viewed as authoritative in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, the 14th Dalai integrates Gelugpa Madhyamaka with Dzogchen views, as did the [[5th Dalai Lama]]. The 14th Dalai Lama has published works like ''The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra'' which seem to be influenced by the views of [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Padmasambhava]], and contain a blend of [[Vajrayana|Tantric theory]], [[Yogacara|Chittamātra]], and Madyamaka-Prasangika.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|Berzin|1997}}

The 14th Dalai Lama also disagrees, echoing sentiments from classical authorities like [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (4th Panchen Lama)]] stating that the credible teachers of the various systems of Buddhist philosophy all "arrive at the same intended point" of realization.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|Berzin|1997|p=235}} However, they also state that this non-denominational position is very difficult to establish through reason.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|Berzin|1997|p=235}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
(in the original French ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ou la politique de Machiavel au XIXe siècle'') is a [[political satire]] written by French [[lawyer|attorney]] [[Maurice Joly]] in protest against the regime of [[Napoleon III]], a.k.a. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870.  It was translated into English in 2002.  Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to [[Norman Cohn|Norman Cohn's]] ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', which identifies it as the main source of the later ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.

The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer [[Lucian]] and introduced into the French [[belles-lettres]] by [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of [[Niccolo Machiavelli]] and [[Charles Montesquieu]] meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.

==Summary==

[[File:M. Joly. Dialogue aux enfers. Title page, 1864.jpeg|thumb|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Dialogue aux enfers, 1864&lt;/div&gt;]]
Joly relates in his 1870 autobiography

&lt;/ref&gt;
and walking by [[Pont Royal]], he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for [[liberalism]]; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for [[despotism]].

Machiavelli claims that he "... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: "... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims "Eternal God, what have you permitted!...".
&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

The book was published anonymously (par un contemporain, ''by a contemporary'') in [[Brussels]] in 1864

&lt;/ref&gt; and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested.  The book was banned.  On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]] in Paris. The second edition of "Dialogues" was issued in 1868 under Joly's name

'''''The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World''''' is a book by [[Tim Harford]] published in 2008 by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="title"/&gt; Harford argues that rational behavior is more widespread than expected in the larger population. He uses economic principles to draw forth the rational elements of supposedly illogical behaviors to illustrate his point.

== Overwhelming gain paradox ==
The '''overwhelming gain paradox''' is a paradox of reasoning that is referred to in the book.&lt;ref name="title"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harford|first=Tim|title=The Logic Of Life|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-6642-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harford illustrates the paradox by the comparison of three potential job offers:
* In Job 1, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will be paid $200.  
* In Job 2, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will have a 1% chance of being paid $200.  
* In Job 3, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will have a 1% chance of being paid $1 billion.

Most people will state that they will choose to work hard in jobs 1 and 3, but not job 2.&lt;ref name="title"/&gt; In Job 1, working hard is obvious because there is a clear reward for doing so.  In Job 2, it seems a bad choice because the likelihood of a reward is so low.  But in Job 3, working hard becomes the preferable choice, because the potential gain is so overwhelming that any chance - no matter how small - of obtaining it is seen as worthwhile.  This appears [[irrational]] and [[paradoxical]], because jobs 2 and 3 are identical 99% of the time.

Harford uses the Overwhelming Gain Paradox to explain the high salaries of certain professionals, such as bankers, executives and entertainers.  He argues that the process of preparing for and getting many of these jobs requires extremely hard work with little or no guarantee of reward - usually due to low market demand, or uncertainty.  Thus, the rewards for these jobs are set high as the result of a rational choice to exploit the overwhelming gain paradox; were it not for this, most jobs in this category would be seen as resembling job 2, making it unlikely anyone would aspire to them at all, or work hard enough to potentially qualify for them.  The exploitation of the paradox also has negative consequences: the resulting high number of aspirants raises levels of competition, and the presence of the paradox amplifies irrational behavior in job hunting; but these are seen as preferable to these jobs attracting no interest at all.

In [[philosophy]] and particularly [[political philosophy]], '''theoreticism''' is the preference for theory over practice (or, more broadly, abstract knowledge over concrete action), or a philosophical position which would lead to such a preference.

The term is often used pejoratively.  In [[Marxist philosophy]], for instance, theoreticism is often identified as a political error, valorizing the efforts of [[academic]] Marxism over those of revolutionary struggle.  [[Louis Althusser]], for instance, criticized his own early work for theoreticism.  In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], theoreticism would be something closer to the over-valuing of [[knowledge]] at the cost of losing a proper appreciation of [[experience]].  [[Martin Heidegger]] claimed this trend was begun by [[Plato]], and that it continued in an "intensification and hardening of 'theoreticism', the drive toward technical and objectifying modes of knowledge and, with it, the oblivion of any more primordial or more reverential kind of existence."

==History==
{{see also|Chinese classics}}
The tradition of a defined group of "classics" in Chinese culture dates at least to the [[Warring States period]], when the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' has [[Confucius]] telling [[Laozi]] "I have studied the six classics—the ''Odes'', the ''Documents'', the ''Rites'', the ''Music'', the '' Changes'', and the ''Spring and Autumn Annals''".&lt;ref&gt;''Zhuangzi'', chapter 14, quoted in {{cite book | title=Writing and authority in early China | first=Mark Edward | last=Lewis | publisher=SUNY Press | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7914-4114-5 | page=276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These six works were thus already considered classics by at least the 3rd century BC, although the ''[[Classic of Music]]'' did not survive the chaos of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] unification of China and was deemed lost during the [[Han dynasty]].  The remaining [[Five Classics]] were traditionally considered to have been edited by Confucius. Records from the late Han and [[Three Kingdoms]] period reference "seven classics", though they do not name them individually.  By the [[Tang dynasty]] references to "nine classics" were common, though the nine works themselves vary depending on the source.  The [[Kaicheng Stone Classics]] (833–837) comprise twelve works (all the above except the ''Mencius'').  By the time of the [[Southern Song|Southern Song dynasty]], the number and specific books in the "thirteen classics" were universally established.  The Thirteen Classics formed the texts used in the [[Imperial examination]]s, and their 600,000+ characters, in effect words, were generally required to be memorized in order to pass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Tuệ Trung Thượng Sĩ''' ({{linktext|慧|中|上|士}}) (1230–1291) was an influential [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhist]] monk and skilled poet of the [[Thiền]] (Zen) tradition during the [[Trần Dynasty|Tran Dynasty]] in [[Vietnam]].  Tue Trung authored treatises on Pure Land and Thien teachings.

==Biography==

In his early years, Tue Trung was the eldest son in a branch of the royal clan of [[Trần Dynasty|Tran]] with the lay name of '''Trần Tung''' (陳嵩). He was the elder brother of the Queen of Vietnam, Nguyên Thánh Thiên Cảm (wife of King [[Tran Thanh Tong]] and mother of King [[Trần Nhân Tông]]), and of the famous general-saint [[Trần Hưng Đạo]].

In the Tran campaigns that confronted the [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Sino-Mongolian invasion]] of [[Kublai Khan]], in 1285 and 1288, Tran Tung was among the generals who repelled the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tài Thư Nguyẽ̂n. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=tue+trung&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=ru History of Buddhism in Vietnam.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the campaigns had concluded, he retreated from worldly activities and became a Buddhist practitioner.

His teacher was a monk named [[Tieu Dao]], a representative of the [[Wu Yantong]] lineage of Buddhism, named for its founder, a student of [[Baizhang Huaihai]] who had come to Vietnam. Tue Trung is considered Tieu Dao's best pupil.&lt;ref&gt;Tài Thư Nguyẽ̂n. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=tue+trung&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=ru History of Buddhism in Vietnam.]&lt;/ref&gt; He would not leave home for monastery, but his vast education and his ability to explain the Buddhist doctrine made him the most famous Buddhist teacher of his time.

In his turn, Tue Trung made his spiritual heir [[Trần Nhân Tông]], the king who after abdication founded the [[Trúc Lâm]] (Bamboo Grove) school, the tradition of Buddhism that is sometimes considered to be the first Vietnamese-born Buddhist tradition.

Via Trần Nhân Tông, Tue Trung is part of the lineage of such modern Buddhist masters as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]].

== Teaching and heritage ==
Being essentially a Chan Buddhist tradition, the teaching of Tue Trung emphasized non-duality up to demonstrative negation of the value of formal meditation and rituals.

Tue Trung's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''The Analects of Tue Trung Thuong Si'', is a Buddhist text written in form of dialogue, which survives to this day. Several of Tue Trung's poems are still cited.

Tue Trung became a legendary master often referred to in Buddhist lectures and literature. The most popular is the example of him stepping on horse's manure in silent reply to the question of the nature of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;for example see Thich Nhat Hanh, Mobi Warren [https://books.google.com/books?id=FvrkoJ2oeiEC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Tue+Trung&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 Hermitage among the clouds.] Parallax Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-938077-56-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-938077-56-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is being actively referred to as a central Vietnamese Buddhist image to this day.&lt;ref&gt;for example see ''Thich Nhat Hanh.''

{{Politics of Uganda}}

The '''Uganda People's Congress''' (UPC)  is a [[political party]] in [[Uganda]].

UPC was founded in 1960 by [[Milton Obote]], who led the country to independence and later served two [[President of Uganda|presidential]] terms under the party's banner. Obote was still party leader when he died in October 2005, although he had previously announced his intention to step down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/28/content_3412655.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party won nine out of 289 elected seats in the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|2006 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/news/latest.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126020702/http://www.monitor.co.ug/news/latest.php |archivedate=2005-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presidential election of the same date, UPC candidate [[Miria Obote]] won 0.8 percent of the vote.

On 14 May 2010, the party elected [[Olara Otunnu]], a former United Nations undersecretary-general for children and armed conflict, to lead the party. He replaced Obote's widow Miria.

== Background ==
The UPC dominated Ugandan politics from independence until 1971, when Milton Obote was overthrown by [[Idi Amin]]. The party returned to power under Obote in 1980 until he was overthrown again in 1985 by [[Tito Okello]]. The history of the UPC is intertwined with the ethnic divide that has plagued Uganda since it was a British [[protectorate]].

== Pre-Independence ==
[[File:Flag of Uganda People's Congress (former).png|left|thumb|200px|Flag of the UPC until 1966, on which the national flag of Uganda is based]]

As independence approached in the 1940s-1950s, it was clear that the [[Baganda]] (the largest ethnic group) wanted extensive autonomy in Uganda, and the [[Buganda]] King's party [[Kabaka Yekka]] ("The King Only") emphasised this desire. However, this was not favoured by most Ugandans of other tribes and amongst some Buganda educated elite who formed an alternative party, the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]], to aspire for national unity. Although unpopular in Buganda, the Democratic Party had widespread support in the rest of the Bantu-speaking South.

Into this void, there emerged an alternative - the [[Uganda National Congress]] (UNC). Although led by a northerner (Milton Obote), the UNC appeared more modernist and accommodating and attracted many southerners particularly in the east. The UNC formed a number of alliances with other parties and emerged as the UPC. The three parties (Kabaka Yekka, UPC, and the Democratic Party) contested the first pre-independence election.

As expected, Kabaka Yekka won most of the seats in Buganda and the UPC won most seats in the north and east. However the Democratic Party (DP) led by [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] emerged as the largest single party. Kiwanuka was on the verge of becoming the first prime minister of independent Uganda when he was thwarted by a surprising alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka.

The [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] was afraid that DP would remove the monarchy in favour of a more modern-looking Uganda. As for the UPC, Milton Obote, realising he had lost the election, saw the alliance as the way to power. In return, Obote offered the Kabaka a ceremonial role in the new administration and the retention of all royal powers. The UPC/KY alliance thus formed Uganda's first government with Milton Obote as prime minister.

== First government ==

The alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka did not last long. After four years in power, Milton Obote ordered a military attack on the Kabaka's palace in 1966. The attack was led by an army officer called [[Idi Amin]]. The Kabaka escaped to London and Obote declared himself President of Uganda. This action more than anything else began the decline of the UPC as a popular party in Uganda. As his unpopularity grew Obote increasingly turned to his Northern home support rather than trying to strengthen the party in the South. The 1969 elections were cancelled and Obote became dictatorial. His government was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin.

== Return to power ==

The UPC returned in 1979 after Idi Amin was overthrown. Obote as leader of the UPC was closely aligned to the Military Junta that had replaced Idi Amin and rather than strengthen the support of the party in the South of Uganda took up a more military approach. The army (traditionally dominated by Northerners) was a brutal machine that carried out numerous atrocities particularly in the South. This polarised the North/South divide with the UPC being perceived more as a Northern party than ever before. Southerners turned to the Democratic Party and a smaller party called the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM) led by a former UPC member, [[Yoweri Museveni]].

In the elections of 1980, there was overwhelming suspicion that the UPC had rigged the result with the help of the Military Junta. This perception was further enhanced when Obote appointed the head of the Military Junta, Paulo Muwanga as his Vice President when the UPC was declared the winner of the elections. A civil war broke out in Uganda when Yoweri Museveni rejected the result and went to the bush to fight the government.

Yoweri Museveni's eventual success was due to the North/South divide that the UPC had helped foster in Uganda. Southerners more than ever before realised that they had to take up arms to protect their rights. In the past most Southerners had despised military careers. When Museveni came to power in 1986, his army was dominated by Southerners particularly from the west.

== 2006 election ==

On November 28, 2005, Obote's widow [[Miria Obote|Miria]] was elected party president. Miria Obote was UPC's presidential candidate in the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|2006 general election]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126020702/http://www.monitor.co.ug/news/latest.php]

The UPC returned to contest the election in 2006, when Museveni restored multi-party elections; however Obote died in exile a few months before. The UPC's traditional heartland in the North appeared uninterested in the UPC without Obote, but still opposed Museveni. This time they turned to Museveni's main opponent Kizza Besyigye (from the South) who led the [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC).

The UPC had failed even to capitalise on its self-created dilemma (appearing to be a Northern party) by not appointing a popular Northern politician to lead the party - instead they opted for Obote's widow (Miria), a Southerner. After the elections, the party suffered many high level defections to Museveni's ruling National Resistance Movement and to the FDC. Miria's election is a source of resentment, and many Ugandans still associate the party with the military excesses of the past. In the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|23 February 2006 parliamentary election]], the party won nine out of 319 seats in the National Assembly.

== New leader ==

The UPC's poor performance in the 2006 elections forced the party to review its place in Ugandan politics. Uganda's political landscape is changing from regional based parties to personality driven politics. The party needed to find a leader with a recognised calibre in politics. The party chose Dr. [[Olara Otunnu]], a former UN under secretary general for children and armed conflict. The election however revealed internal conflicts in the party that are likely to affect its performance at the 2011 elections. Otunnu served under Tito Okello as Foreign Minister and is seen by some as part of the putsch that overthrew the last UPC government in 1985.

Otunnu's main rival at the party elections was [[Milton Obote]]'s son Jimmy Akena, the Member of Parliament for Lira Municipality showing the Obote family still cherishes the party that Obote created.

      <comment>The quote attributed to Steven Robiner lacks evidence for its existence. I find it strange that someone totally unrelated to serious philosophy would make such a claim. After "extensive research" (I spent about 2 hours looking for valid sources) i concluded that this quote is bogus because all the references i could find either didn't had any sources or the only source was wikipedia itself. It looks like this is a fallacious circular reference since all the sources in this section aren't valid.</comment>

In philosophy, '''universality''' is the idea that universal facts exist and can be progressively discovered, as opposed to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). Anti-racism. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain theologies, [[universalism]] is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe, whose being is independent of and unconstrained by the events and conditions that compose the universe, such as entropy and physical locality. 

This article also discusses [[Kantianism|Kantian]] and [[Platonism|Platonist]] notions of "[[universal (metaphysics)|universal]]", which are considered by most philosophers to be separate notions.

When used in the context of ethics, the meaning of ''universal'' refers to that which is true for "all similarly situated individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm|title=Philosophical Dictionary: Ubermensch-Utilitarianism|author=|date=|website=www.philosophypages.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820235357/http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm|archivedate=2007-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rights]], for example in [[natural rights]], or in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], for those heavily influenced by the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its conception of a [[human nature]], could be considered universal. The 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is inspired by such principles.

==Universality in logic==
In logic, or the consideration of valid arguments, a [[proposition]] is said to have universality if it can be conceived as being true in all possible contexts without creating a [[contradiction]]. Some philosophers have referred to such propositions as [[universalizability|universalizable]]. A [[truth]] is considered to be universal if it is logically valid (logical) in and also beyond all times and places. Hence a universal truth is considered logically to transcend the state of the physical universe, whose order is derived from such truths. In this case, such a truth is seen as [[eternity|eternal]] or as absolute. The patterns and relations expressed by [[mathematics]] in ways that are consistent with the fields of logic and mathematics are typically considered truths of universal scope. This is not to say that universality is limited to mathematics, since it is also used in philosophy, theology, and other pursuits.

The [[relativism|relativist conception]] denies the existence of some or all universal truths, particularly ethical ones (as [[moral relativism]]). Though usage of the word ''truth'' has various domains of application, relativism does not necessarily apply to all of them.

==Universality in metaphysics==
{{See also|Universal (metaphysics)}}

In [[metaphysics]], a '''universal''' is a [[type (metaphysics)|type]], a [[property (metaphysics)|property]], or a [[relation (metaphysics)|relation]]. The noun ''universal'' contrasts with ''[[individual]]'', while the adjective ''universal'' contrasts with ''[[particular]]'' or sometimes with ''[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]''. The latter meaning, however, may be confusing since [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegelian]] and [[neo-Hegelian]] (e.g. [[British idealism|British idealist]]) philosophies speak of ''[[concrete universal]]s''.

A universal may have instances, known as its ''particulars''. For example, the type ''dog'' (or ''doghood'') is a universal, as are the property ''red'' (or ''redness'') and the relation ''betweenness'' (or ''being between''). Any particular dog, red thing, or object that is between other things is not a universal, however, but is an ''instance'' of a universal. That is, a universal type (''doghood''), property (''redness''), or relation (''betweenness'') ''[[Substance theory#Inherence|inheres]]'' a particular object (a specific dog, red thing, or object between other things).

[[Platonic realism]] holds universals to be the [[referent]]s of general terms, i.e. the ''[[abstraction|abstract]]'', nonphysical entities to which words like "doghood", "redness", and "betweenness" refer. By contrast, particulars are the referents of proper names, like "Fido", or of definite descriptions that identify single objects, like the phrase, "that apple on the table". By contrast, other metaphysical theories merely use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.

''The [[problem of universals]]'' is an ancient problem in metaphysics concerning the nature of universals, or whether they exist. Part of the problem involves the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to [[ontology|ontological]] theory.

Universal truth is regarded as ontic, i.e. expressing the order of being itself. A universal truth is epistemic only to the extent that its ontic expression is apprehended or discerned in a veridical way, which cannot affect its being in any case. Most ontological frameworks do not consider [[class (philosophy)|classes]] to be universals, although some prominent philosophers, such as John Bigelow, do.
