'''{{mp|2014 YX|49}}''' is a [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] and Uranus [[co-orbital]] first observed on December 26, 2014, by the [[Pan-STARRS|Pan-STARRS survey]].&lt;ref name=mpec/&gt; It is the second known centaur on a [[Trojan (astronomy)|tadpole orbit]] with [[Uranus]], and the fourth Uranus co-orbital discovered after [[83982 Crantor]], [[2011 QF99|{{mp|2011 QF99}}]] and [[(472651) 2015 DB216|(472651) {{mp|2015 DB|216}}]].&lt;ref name="coorbitalstate"/&gt;

Asteroid {{mp|2014 YX|49}} is a temporary {{L4}} [[Uranus trojan|Trojan of Uranus]], the second one ({{mp|2011 QF|99}} was identified first) to be confirmed as currently trapped in such resonant state. This object may have remained as a {{L4}} Uranian Trojan for about 60,000 years and it can continue that way for another 80,000 years. Numerical integrations suggest that it may stay within Uranus’ co-orbital zone for nearly one million years.&lt;ref name="coorbitalstate"/&gt;

Besides being a {{L4}} Uranian Trojan, {{mp|2014 YX|49}} is trapped in the 7:20 [[mean motion resonance]] with [[Saturn]] as well; therefore, this minor body is currently subjected to a three-body resonance.&lt;ref name="coorbitalstate"/&gt; The other known Uranian Trojan, {{mp|2011 QF|99}}, is also in this resonant configuration.

'''Advanced Rayleigh Guided Ground Layer Adaptive Optics System''' (ARGOS) is a multi-star adaptive optics system which is built for use with the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] (LBT).&lt;ref name=argos1&gt;{{cite web|title=ARGOS (Advanced Rayleigh guided Ground layer adaptive Optics System) |url=http://www.lbto.org/LBT%20Website%20General%20Public/Advanced%20Rayleigh%20guided%20Ground%20layer%20adaptive%20Optics%20System.htm |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102160628/http://www.lbto.org/LBT%20Website%20General%20Public/Advanced%20Rayleigh%20guided%20Ground%20layer%20adaptive%20Optics%20System.htm |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

In law and in [[cultural anthropology]], '''affinity''', as distinguished from [[consanguinity]] (blood relationship), is the [[kinship]] relationship that is created or exists between two or more people as a result of someone's [[marriage]]. It is the relationship which each party to a marriage has to the relations of the other partner to the marriage; but does not cover the [[marital relationship]] of the parties to the marriage themselves. Though laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced, nor with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage, "affinity" can sometimes also include kinship by [[adoption]] and [[Stepfamily|step relationship]].

Under the law, such relatives by marriage are known as '''affines'''. More commonly, they are known as {{nowrap|'''in-laws'''}} or '''family-in-law''', as affinity is usually signified by adding {{nowrap|"[[In-law (disambiguation)|-in-law]]"}} to a degree of kinship.{{refn|group=n|This is standard for the closest degrees of kinship—{{nowrap|''father-in-law'',}} {{nowrap|''daughter-in-law'',}} &amp;c.—but is frequently omitted in the case of more extended relations. As ''uncle'' and ''aunt'' are frequently used to refer indifferently to friends of the family, the terms may be used without specifying whether the person is a cognate or affine. Similarly, the spouse of a cousin may not be called a relation at all or may be referenced as a "cousin by marriage".}}

In law, affinity may be relevant in relation to prohibitions on [[incest|incestuous sexual relations]] and in relation to whether particular couples are prohibited from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited vary from country to country, and have varied over time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws. (See, for example, [[Affinity (canon law)|Affinity under canon law]].)

An '''altazimuth''' or '''alt-azimuth mount''' is a simple two-[[coordinate axis|axis]] mount for supporting and rotating an instrument about two [[perpendicular]] axes – one vertical and the other horizontal. Rotation about the vertical axis varies the [[azimuth]] (compass bearing) of the pointing direction of the instrument. Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the [[altitude]] (angle of elevation) of the pointing direction.

These mounts are used, for example, with [[telescope]]s, [[camera]]s, [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]s, [[heliostat]] mirrors, [[solar tracker|solar panel]]s, and [[weapon mount|gun]]s and similar weapons.

Several names are given to this kind of mount, including '''altitude-azimuth''', '''azimuth-elevation''' and various abbreviations thereof. A [[gun turret]] is essentially an alt-azimuth mount for a gun, and a standard camera tripod is an alt-azimuth mount as well.

==Astronomical telescope altazimuth mounts==
When used as an astronomical [[telescope mount]], the biggest advantage of an alt-azimuth mount is the simplicity of its mechanical design. The primary disadvantage is its inability to follow astronomical objects in the [[night sky]] as the [[Earth]] spins on its axis. On the other hand, an [[equatorial mount]] only needs to be rotated about a single axis, at a constant rate, to follow the rotation of the night sky ([[diurnal motion]]). Altazimuth mounts need to be rotated about both axes at variable rates, achieved via [[microprocessor]] based two-axis drive systems, to track equatorial motion. This imparts an uneven rotation to the field of view that also has to be corrected via a [[microprocessor]] based counter rotation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The design also does not allow for the use of mechanical [[setting circles]] to locate astronomical objects although modern [[Setting circles#Digital setting circles|digital setting circles]] have removed this shortcoming.

Another limitation is the problem of [[gimbal lock]] at [[zenith]] pointing.  When tracking at elevations close to 90°, the azimuth axis must rotate very quickly; if the altitude is exactly 90°, the speed is infinite.  Thus, altazimuth telescopes, although they can point in any direction, cannot track smoothly within a "zenith blind spot", commonly 0.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemini.edu/media/factsheets/telescopestructure.html |title=Telescope Structure |publisher=Gemini Observatory |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 0.75 degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.oir.caltech.edu/twiki_oir/pub/Keck/NGAO/NewKAONs/KAON708.pdf |title=Limits to AO Observations from Altitude-Azimuth Telescope Mounts |first=Christopher |last=Neyman |date=February 10, 2010 |page=5 |publisher=W.M.

===Current applications===
Typical current applications of altazimuth mounts include the following.

;Research telescopes
In the [[list of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescopes]], the mass and cost of an equatorial mount is prohibitive and they have been superseded by computer-controlled altazimuth mounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXCMYy0yF5cC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=altazimuth+mounts+have+been#v=onepage&amp;q=altazimuth%20mounts%20have%20been&amp;f=false |first1=Pierre |last1=Léna |first2=François |last2=Lebrun |first3=François |last3=Mignard |title=Observational astrophysics |page=147 |isbn=9783540634829 |date=1998-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple structure of an altazimuth mount allows significant cost reductions, in spite of the additional cost associated with the more complex tracking and image-orienting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawe |first1=J.

;Amateur telescopes
* Beginner telescopes: Altazimuth mounts are cheap and simple to use.
* [[Dobsonian telescope]]s: [[John Dobson (astronomer)|John Dobson]] popularized a simplified altazimuth mount design for [[Newtonian reflectors]] because of its ease of construction; Dobson's innovation was to use non-machined parts for the mount that could be found in any hardware store such as [[plywood]], [[formica (plastic)|formica]], and plastic plumbing parts combined with modern materials like [[nylon]] or [[teflon]].
* "[[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo]]" telescopes: It has often proved more convenient to build a mechanically simpler altazimuth mount and use a [[motion controller]] to manipulate both axes simultaneously to track an object, when compared with a more mechanically complex [[equatorial mount]] that requires minimally complex control of a single motor.

{{Infobox Telescope}}
'''Archeops''' was a balloon-borne instrument dedicated to measuring the [[Cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) temperature anisotropies. The study of this radiation is essential to obtain precise information on the evolution of the [[Universe]]: density, [[Hubble constant]], [[age of the Universe]], etc. To achieve this goal, measurements were done with devices cooled down at 100mK temperature placed at the focus of a warm telescope. To avoid atmospheric disturbance the whole apparatus is placed on a gondola below a helium balloon that reaches 40&amp;nbsp;km altitude.

Archeops has four bands in the millimeter domain (143, 217, 353 and 545&amp;nbsp;GHz) with a high angular resolution (about 15 arcminutes) in order to constrain small anisotropy scales, as well as a large sky coverage fraction (30%) in order to minimize the intrinsic cosmic variance.

== Instrument and flights ==
The instrument was designed by adapting concepts put forward for the High Frequency Instrument of [[Planck Surveyor|Planck surveyor]] (Planck-HFI) and using balloon-borne constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0927-6505(01)00141-4 | first=A. | last=Benoit | year=2002 | title=Archeops: A High Resolution, Large Sky Coverage Balloon Experiment for Mapping CMB Anisotropies | journal=Astropart. Phys. | volume=17 | pages=101–124 | arxiv=astro-ph/0106152 |bibcode = 2002APh....17..101B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Namely, it consists of an open 3He-4He dilution cryostat cooling spiderweb-type [[bolometer]]s at 100 mK; cold individual optics with horns at different temperature stages (0.1, 1.6, 10 K) and an off-axis [[Gregorian telescope]].

The CMB signal is measured by the 143 and 217&amp;nbsp;GHz detectors while interstellar dust emission and atmospheric emission are monitored with the 353 (polarized) and 545&amp;nbsp;GHz detectors.
The whole instrument is bafﬂed so as to avoid stray radiation from the Earth and the balloon.

To cover as far as 30% of the sky, the payload was spinning mostly above the atmosphere, scanning the sky in circles with a fixed elevation of roughly 41 degrees. The gondola, at a ﬂoat altitude above 32&amp;nbsp;km, spins across the sky at a rate of 2 rpm which, combined with the Earth rotation, produces a well sampled sky at each frequency.

Archeops flew for the first time in Trapani (Sicily) with four–hours integration time. Then, the upgraded instrument was launched three times from the Esrange base near Kiruna (Sweden) by the CNES during 2 consecutive Winter seasons (2001 and 2002). The last and best ﬂight on Feb. 7th, 2002 yields 12.5 hours of CMB–type data (at ceiling altitude and by night) from a 19–hours total. The balloon landed in Siberia and it was recovered (with its precious data recorded on–board) by a Franco–Russian team with –40 deg.C. weather.

== Results ==
[[Image:Archeops last flight map.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Archeops CMB map]]
Archeops has linked, for the first time and before [[WMAP]], the large angular scales (previously measured by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]) to the first acoustic peak region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=A. | last=Benoit | year=2003 | title=The Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Power Spectrum measured by Archeops | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=399 | pages=L19 | arxiv=astro-ph/0210305 |bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...399L..19B |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20021850 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=M. | last=Tristram | year=2005 | title=The CMB temperature power spectrum from an improved analysis of the Archeops data | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=436 | pages=785 | arxiv=astro-ph/0411633 |bibcode = 2005A&amp;A...436..785T |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20042416 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its results, inflation motivated cosmologies have been reinforced with a flat Universe (total energy density Ω&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 within 3%).
When combined with complementary cosmological datasets regarding the value of Hubble's constant, Archeops gives constraints on the dark energy density and the baryonic density in very good agreement with other independent estimations based on supernovae measurements and big bang nucleosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=A. | last=Benoit | year=2003 | title=Title: Cosmological constraints from Archeops | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=399 | pages=L25 | arxiv=astro-ph/0210306 |bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...399L..25B |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20021722 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles A. Alluaud''' (4 May 1861, [[Limoges]] – 12 December 1949, [[Crozant]]) was a [[France|French]] [[entomologist]].

The Alluaud family had owned porcelain factories since the 18th century. His great grandfather had been chairman of the ''{{lang|fr|[[Ancienne Manufacture Royale de Limoges]]}}'' and his grandfather, [[François Alluaud]] (1778–1866), was a  porcelain manufacturer, archaeologist, and [[geologist]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] (1796–1875) taught painting to Charles and his brother Eugene.

Charles left Limoges for Paris to supplement his studies but was an undisciplined pupil. The death of his parents enabled him to become an explorer. From 1887 to 1930, he went on many journeys in [[Africa]] ([[Ivory Coast]], [[Madagascar]], [[Kilimanjaro]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Sudan]], the [[Sahara]], [[Niger]]), the [[Canary Islands]], [[Seychelles]] and [[Mascarene Islands]]. He assembled an important collections of insects during his voyages, later giving these to the entomology department of the ''{{lang|fr|[[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]}}''. He was the author of 165 entomological publications. He was president of the ''{{lang|fr|[[Société entomologique de France]]}}'' in 1899 and 1914.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

==Legacy==
[[Emmanuel Drake del Castillo]] (1855–1904) dedicated the plant [[genus]] ''[[Alluaudia]]'' to him.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A genus and three [[species]] of reptiles are named in his honor: ''[[Alluaudina]]'', ''[[Amphiglossus|Amphiglossos alluaudi]]'', ''[[Langaha|Langaha alluaudi]]'', and ''[[Uroplatus|Uroplatus alluaudi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The '''Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights''' ('''CIAAW''') is an international scientific committee of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) under its [[IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division|Division of Inorganic Chemistry]]. Since 1899, it is entrusted with periodic critical evaluation of [[atomic weight]]s of [[chemical element]]s and other cognate data, such as the [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1914/present.html|title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1914 - Presentation|publisher=Nobelprize.org|date=November 11, 1915|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630164517/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1914/present.html|archivedate=June 30, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biennial CIAAW Standard Atomic Weights are accepted as the authoritative source in science and appear worldwide on the [[periodic table]] wall charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100007944|title=IUPAC, Oxford Reference|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922120142/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100007944|archivedate=2013-09-22|df=|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100007944|doi-broken-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of CIAAW Standard Atomic Weights is also required legally, for example, in calculation of calorific value of natural gas (ISO 6976:1995), or in gravimetric preparation of primary reference standards in gas analysis (ISO 6142:2006). In addition, the current definition of [[kelvin]], the SI unit for thermodynamic temperature, makes direct reference to the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen as recommended by CIAAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/CIPM/Allowed/94/CIPM-Recom2CI-2005-EN.pdf|title=Clarification of the definition of the kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature|publisher=BIPM|year=2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626122135/http://www1.bipm.org/cc/CIPM/Allowed/94/CIPM-Recom2CI-2005-EN.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest CIAAW report was published in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juris Meija |author2=Tyler B.

Although the atomic weight had taken on the concept of a constant of nature like the speed of light, the lack of agreement on accepted values created difficulties in trade. Quantities measured by chemical analysis were not being translated into weights in the same way by all parties and standardization became an urgent matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hq7bOBG6YSgC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq| author= E.

Clarke, who was then the chief chemist for the U.S. Geological Survey, was appointed a committee of one to provide the report. He presented the first report at the 1893 annual meeting and published it in January 1894.&lt;ref name="ciaaw-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2004/2601/1_holden.html|title=Atomic Weights and the International Committee—A Historical Review|publisher=Chemistry International|year=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121401532900/http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2004/2601/1_holden.html|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the German Society of Chemistry, following a proposal by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]], appointed a three-person working committee to report on atomic weights. The committee consisted of Chairman Prof. [[Hans Heinrich Landolt|Hans H. Landolt]] (Berlin University), Prof. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (University of Leipzig), and Prof. [[Karl Seubert]] (University of Hanover). This committee published its first report in 1898, in which the committee suggested the desirability of an international committee on atomic weights. On 30 March 1899 Landolt, Ostwald and Seubert issued an invitation to other national scientific organizations to appoint delegates to the International Committee on Atomic Weights. Fifty-eight members were appointed to the Great International Committee on Atomic Weights, including [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke|Frank W. Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;L.M. Dennis, Frank Wigglesworth Clarke (National Academy of Sciences 1932) at [http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/fclark.pdf p.143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015150541/http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/fclark.pdf |date=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large committee conducted its business by correspondence to Landolt which created difficulties and delays associated with correspondence among fifty-eight members. As a result, on 15 December 1899, the German committee asked the International members to select a small committee of three to four members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = H. Landolt | author2 = W. Ostwald | author3 = K.

Clarke (USA), Prof. Karl Seubert (Germany), and Prof. [[Thomas Edward Thorpe]] (UK) were elected, and the International Committee on Atomic Weights published its inaugural report in 1903 under the chairmanship of Prof. Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = F.W.

== Function ==
Since 1899, the Commission periodically and critically evaluates the published scientific literature and produces the Table of Standard Atomic Weights. In recent times, the Table of Standard Atomic Weights has been published biennially. Each recommended standard atomic-weight value reflects the best knowledge of evaluated, published data. In the recommendation of standard atomic weights, CIAAW generally does not attempt to estimate the average or composite isotopic composition of the Earth or of any subset of terrestrial materials. Instead, the Commission seeks to find a single value and symmetrical uncertainty that would include almost all substances likely to be encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Michael E.

== Notable decisions ==
Many notable decisions have been made by the Commission over its history. Some of these are highlighted below.

[[File:Inaugural Atomic Weights report 1903.png|left|thumb|380px|alt=Atomic Weights| The inaugural 1903 report of the International Atomic Weights Commission]]

=== International atomic weight unit: H=1 or O=16 ===
Though Dalton proposed setting the atomic weight of hydrogen as unity in 1803, many other proposals were popular throughout the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, two scales gained popular support: H=1 and O=16. This situation was undesired in science and in October 1899, the inaugural task of the International Commission on Atomic Weights was to decide on the international scale and the oxygen scale became the international standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Theodore William|title=International Atomic Weights|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|date=1900|volume=36|issue=10|pages=171|doi=10.2307/20020992|jstor=20020992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endorsement of the oxygen scale created significant backlash in the chemistry community, and the inaugural Atomic Weights Report was thus published using both scales. This practice soon ceded and the oxygen scale remained the international standard for decades to come. Nevertheless, when the Commission joined the IUPAC in 1920, it was asked to revert to the H=1 scale, which it rejected.

=== Modern unit: &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C=12 ===
With the discovery of oxygen isotopes in 1929, a situation arose where chemists based their calculations on the average atomic mass (atomic weight) of oxygen whereas physicists used the mass of the predominant isotope of oxygen, oxygen-16. This discrepancy became undesired and a unification between the chemistry and physics was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = F.W. Aston | title = The Unit of Atomic Weight | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v128/n3234/abs/128731a0.html | doi = 10.1038/128731a0 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | year = 1931 | volume = 128 | pages = 731 | issue = 3234 | bibcode = 1931Natur.128..731. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140204035157/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v128/n3234/abs/128731a0.html | archivedate = 2014-02-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1957 Paris meeting the Commission put forward a proposal for a carbon-12 scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edward Wichers | title = Report on Atomic Weights for 1956-1957 | doi = 10.1021/ja01549a001 | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1958 | volume = 80 | pages = 4121–4124 | issue = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon-12 scale for atomic weights and nuclide masses was approved by IUPAP (1960) and IUPAC (1961) and it is still in use worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/41803/atomic-weight Encyclopædia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308064056/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/41803/atomic-weight |date=2013-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty of the atomic weights ===
In the early 20th century, measurements of the atomic weight of lead showed significant variations depending on the origin of the sample. These differences were considered to be an exception attributed to lead isotopes being products of the natural radioactive decay chains of uranium. In 1930s, however, [[Malcolm Dole]] reported that the atomic weight of oxygen in air was slightly different from that in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malcolm Dole | title = The Relative Atomic Weight of Oxygen in Water and in Air | doi = 10.1021/ja01315a511 | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1935 | volume = 57 | pages = 2731 | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, [[Alfred Nier]] reported natural variation in the isotopic composition of carbon. It was becoming clear that atomic weights are not constants of nature. At the Commission’s meeting in 1951, it was recognized that the isotopic-abundance variation of sulfur had a significant effect on the internationally accepted value of an atomic weight. In order to indicate the span of atomic-weight values that may apply to sulfur from different natural sources, the value ± 0.003 was attached to the atomic weight of sulfur. By 1969, the Commission had assigned uncertainties to all atomic-weight values.

[[File:IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements 2011.jpg|right|thumb|360px|alt=Atomic Weights|Excerpt of the IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements 2011 showing the interval notation of the standard atomic weights of boron, carbon, and nitrogen]]

=== Interval notation ===
At its meeting in 2009 in Vienna, the Commission decided to express the standard atomic weight of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and other elements in a manner that clearly indicates that the values are not constants of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=mass-migration-chemists|title=Mass Migration: Chemists Revise Atomic Weights of 10 Elements|journal=Scientific American|date=16 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230212706/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=mass-migration-chemists|archivedate=30 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/December/20121001.asp|title=Atomic weights change to reflect natural variations|journal=Chemistry World|year=2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923080131/http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/December/20121001.asp|archivedate=2013-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, writing the standard atomic weight of hydrogen as [1.007 84, 1.008 11] shows that the atomic weight in any normal material will be greater than or equal to 1.007 84 and will be less than or equal to 1.008 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2011/3302/2_coplen.html|title=Atomic Weights: No Longer Constants of Nature|author1=Tyler B.

'''Comparative planetary science''' or '''comparative planetology''' is a branch of [[Outline of space science|space science]] and [[planetary science]] in which different natural processes and systems are studied by their effects and phenomena on and between multiple [[Astronomical object|bodies]]. The planetary processes in question include geology, hydrology, atmospheric physics, and interactions such as impact cratering, space weathering, and magnetospheric physics in the solar wind, and possibly biology, via [[astrobiology]].

Comparison of multiple bodies assists the researcher, if for no other reason than the Earth is far more accessible than any other body. Those distant bodies may then be evaluated in the context of processes already characterized on Earth. Conversely, other bodies (including [[Planetary system|extrasolar ones]]) may provide additional examples, edge cases, and counterexamples to earthbound processes; without a greater context, studying these phenomena in relation to Earth alone may result in low sample sizes and observational biases.

==Background==

The term "comparative planetology" was coined by [[George Gamow]], who reasoned that to fully understand our own planet, we must study others. [[Arie Poldervaart|Poldervaart]] focused on the Moon, stating "An adequate picture of this original planet and its development to the present earth is of great significance, is in fact the ultimate goal of geology as the science leading to knowledge and understanding of earth's history."&lt;ref name="lowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowman |first=P. |title=Exploring Space, Exploring Earth: New Understanding of the Earth from Space Research |date=15 August 2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-89062-5|chapter=6.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Geology and geochemistry==

All terrestrial planets (and some satellites, such as the Moon) are essentially composed of [[silicates]] wrapped around iron cores.&lt;ref name=lowman /&gt;&lt;ref name=murray /&gt; The large outer Solar System moons and Pluto have more ice, and less rock and metal, but still undergo analogous processes.

===Volcanism===

{{main|Volcanism}}

Volcanism on Earth is largely [[lava]]-based. Other terrestrial planets display volcanic features assumed to be lava-based, evaluated in the context of analogues readily studied on Earth. For example, Jupiter's moon [[Volanism of Io|Io displays extant volcanism]], including lava flows. These flows were initially inferred to be composed mostly of various [[Allotropes of sulfur|forms of molten elemental sulfur]], based on analysis of imaging done by the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' probes]].&lt;ref name="Sagan1979"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sulphur flows on Io |journal=Nature |last=Sagan |first=C. |pages=750–53 |volume=280 |issue= 5725|date=1979 |doi=10.1038/280750a0|bibcode = 1979Natur.280..750S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Earth-based infrared studies done in the 1980s and 1990s caused the consensus to shift in favor of a primarily silicate-based model, with sulfur playing a secondary role.&lt;ref name="Spencer1996"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Io on the Eve of the Galileo Mission |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |last=Spencer |first=J. R. |author2=Schneider, N. M.  |pages=125–90 |volume=24 |date=1996 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.24.1.125|bibcode = 1996AREPS..24..125S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the surface of [[Mars]] is composed of various [[basalt]]s considered analogous to Hawaiian basalts, by their [[Spectroscopy|spectra]] and ''in situ'' chemical analyses (including [[Martian meteorites]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Chemtob, S. | author2=Jolliff, B. | title=Silica coatings in the Ka'u Desert, Hawaii, a Mars analog terrain: A micromorphological, spectral, chemical, and isotopic study |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets | volume=115 | issue=E4 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JE003473/full |date=1 April 2010 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1029/2009JE003473 | bibcode=2010JGRE..115.4001C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-mers-04zza.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury and Earth's Moon similarly feature [[Lunar mare|large areas of basalts]], formed by ancient volcanic processes. Surfaces in the polar regions show [[Patterned ground#Polygons|polygonal morphologies]], also seen on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Levy, J. | author2=Marchant, D. | author3=Head, J. | title=Thermal contraction crack polygons on Mars: A synthesis from HiRISE, Phoenix, and terrestrial analog studies | journal=Icarus | volume=206 | issue=1 | date=12 September 2009 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.09.005 | bibcode=2010Icar..206..229L | pages=229–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Permafrost on Mars and Earth | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/IPY/multimedia/ipyimg_20080528.html| accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to basalt flows, Venus is home to a large number of [[pancake dome]] volcanoes created by highly viscous silica-rich lava flows. These domes lack a known Earth analogue. They do bear some morphological resemblance to terrestrial rhyolite-dacite [[lava domes]], although the pancake domes are much flatter and uniformly round in nature.&lt;ref name="PaterLissauer2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Pater|first1=Imke |last2=Lissauer|first2=Jack J.|title=Planetary Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stFpBgAAQBAJ|edition=2nd, revised|date=31 December 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-19569-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=pancake dome: Venus | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/3471/Volcanic-pancake-domes-in-the-elevated-region-Eistla-Regio-on | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unusual Volcanoes on Venus | url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/oldroot/volcanoes/planet_volcano/venus/unusual.html | accessdate= 26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain regions further out in the Solar System exhibit [[cryovolcanism]], a process not seen anywhere on earth. Cryovolcanism is studied through laboratory experiments, conceptual and numerical modeling, and by cross-comparison to other examples in the field. Examples of bodies with cryovolcanic features include [[comet]]s, some [[asteroid]]s and [[Centaur (minor planet)|Centaurs]], [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and possibly [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]].

The trace dopants of Europa's ice are currently postulated to contain sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NASA - Europa's Hidden Ice Chemistry | url=http://nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/europa-ice.html | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is being evaluated via a Canadian sulfate spring as an analogue, in preparation for future Europa probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NASA mission to Jupiter's moon Europa gets boost from Nunavut glacier | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nasa-mission-to-jupiter-s-moon-europa-gets-boost-from-nunavut-glacier-1.2946908 | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Small solar system bodies|Small bodies]] such as comets, some asteroid types, and dust grains, on the other hand, serve as counterexamples. Assumed to have experienced little or no heating, these materials may contain (or be) samples representing the early Solar System, which have since been erased from Earth or any other large body.

Some extrasolar planets are covered entirely in [[Lava planet|lava oceans]], and some are [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] planets, whose star-facing hemisphere is entirely lava.

===Cratering===

{{main|Impact crater}}

The craters observed on the Moon were once assumed to be volcanic. Earth, by comparison, did not show a similar crater count, nor a high frequency of [[Bolide|large meteor events]], which would be expected as two nearby bodies should experience similar impact rates. Eventually this volcanism model was overturned, as numerous Earth craters (demonstrated by e. g., [[shatter cone]]s, [[shocked quartz]] and other [[impactite]]s, and possibly [[Tektite|spall]]) were found, after having been eroded over geologic time. Craters formed by larger and larger ordnance also served as models.  The Moon, on the other hand, shows no atmosphere or hydrosphere, and could thus accumulate and preserve impact craters over billions of years despite a low impact rate at any one time. In addition, more searches by more groups with better equipment highlighted the great number of asteroids, presumed to have been even more numerous in earlier Solar System periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilhelms|first=D.|title=To a Rocky Moon: A geologist's history of lunar exploration|publisher=University of Arizona Press|date=1993|chapter= 1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koerberl|first1=C|title=Craters on the Moon from Galileo to Wegener: A short history of the Impact Hypothesis and Implications for the Study of terrestrial Impact Craters|date=2000|publisher=Kluver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As on Earth, a low [[Crater counting|crater count]] on other bodies indicates young surfaces. This is particularly credible if nearby regions or bodies show heavier cratering. Young surfaces, in turn, indicate atmospheric, tectonic or volcanic, or hydrological processing on large bodies and comets, or dust redistribution or a relatively recent formation on asteroids (i. e., splitting from a parent body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Comparative Cratering Processes | url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/educ/docs/Comparative_Cratering_Processes.pdf | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of the cratering record on multiple bodies, at multiple areas in the Solar System, points to a [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which in turn gives evidence of the Solar System's early history. However, the Late Heavy Bombardment as currently proposed has some issues and is not completely accepted.&lt;ref name=Hartmann_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=W.

One model for Mercury's exceptionally high density compared to other terrestrial planets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Question 1: Why is Mercury so dense? - MESSENGER | url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/why_mercury/q1.html | accessdate=26 April 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904182638/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/why_mercury/q1.html | archivedate=4 September 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the stripping off of a significant amount of crust and/or mantle from extremely heavy bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Why Mercury is a hard orange, not a soft peach | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23534-why-mercury-is-a-hard-orange-not-a-soft-peach.html | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/26447-mercury-composition-giant-impact.html |title=Did Huge Impact Shape Planet Mercury? |work=[[Space.com]] |date=6 July 2014 |author=Jesse Emspak |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601202114/http://www.space.com/26447-mercury-composition-giant-impact.html |archivedate=1 June 2015 |dead-url=no |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differentiation===

{{main|Planetary differentiation}}

As a large body, Earth can efficiently retain its internal heat (from its [[Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism|initial formation]] plus [[radioactive decay|decay]] of its [[radioisotopes]]) over the long timescale of the Solar System. It thus retains a molten [[Planetary core|core]], and has [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]]- dense materials have sunk to the core, while light materials float to form a crust.

Other bodies, by comparison, may or may not have differentiated, based on their formation history, radioisotope content, further energy input via bombardment, distance from the Sun, size, etc. Studying bodies of various sizes and distances from the Sun provides examples and places constraints on the differentiation process. Differentiation itself is evaluated indirectly, by the mineralogy of a body's surface, versus its expected bulk density and mineralogy, or via shape effects due to slight variations in gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Thomas, P., | author2=Parker, J. | title=Differentiation of the asteroid Ceres as revealed by its shape | journal=Nature | volume=437 | date=8 Sep 2005 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1038/nature03938 | pages=224–226|bibcode = 2005Natur.437..224T | pmid=16148926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation may also be measured directly, by the higher-order terms of a body's gravity field as measured by a [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] or [[gravitational assist]], and in some cases by [[libration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Peale, S. | author2=Stanton, R. | title=A Procedure for Determining the Nature of Mercury's core | journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science | volume=37 | pages=1269–1283 | date=2002 |bibcode = 2002M&amp;PS...37.1269P |doi = 10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00895.x |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edge cases include Vesta and some of the larger moons, which show differentiation but are assumed to have since fully solidified. The question of whether Earth's Moon has solidified, or retains some molten layers, has not been definitively answered. Additionally, differentiation processes are expected to vary along a continuum. Bodies may be composed of lighter and heavier rocks and metals, a high water ice and volatiles content (with less mechanical strength) in cooler regions of the Solar System, or primarily ices with a low rock/metal content even farther from the Sun. This continuum is thought to record the varying chemistries of the early Solar System, with refractories surviving in warm regions, and volatiles driven outward by the young Sun.

The cores of planets are inaccessible, studied indirectly by seismometry, gravimetry, and in some cases magnetometry. However, iron and stony-iron meteorites are likely fragments from the cores of parent bodies which have partially or completely differentiated, then shattered. These meteorites are thus the only means of directly examining deep-interior materials and their processes.

[[Gas giant]] planets represent another form of differentiation, with multiple fluid layers by density. Some distinguish further between true gas giants, and [[ice giant]]s further from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boss, A. | title=Formation of gas and ice giant planets | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=202 | pages=513–523 | date=30 September 2002 |bibcode = 2002E&amp;PSL.202..513B |doi = 10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00808-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Lambrechts, M. | author2=Johansen, A. | author3=Morbidelli, A. | title=Separating gas-giant and ice-giant planets by halting pebble accretion | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=572 | date=25 Nov 2014 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201423814 | bibcode=2014A&amp;A...572A..35L | pages=A35|arxiv = 1408.6087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tectonics===

{{main|Tectonics}}

In turn, a molten core may allow plate tectonics, of which Earth shows major features. Mars, as a smaller body than Earth, shows no current tectonic activity, nor mountain ridges from geologically recent activity.  This is assumed to be due to an interior that has cooled faster than the Earth (see geomagnetism below). An edge case may be Venus, which does not appear to have extant tectonics. However, in its history, it likely has had tectonic activity but lost it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Cherkashina, O. | author2=Guseva, E. | author3=Krassilnikov, A. | title=Mapping of Rift Zones on Venus, Preliminary Results: Spatial Distribution, Relationship with Regional Plains, Morphology of Fracturing, Topography and Style of Volcanism | journal=35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | date=15 Mar 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/venus/surface.html | accessdate=26 Apr 2015 |title= The Surface Features of Venus}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible tectonic activity on Venus may still be sufficient to restart after a long era of accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Solomon, S. | title=A Tectonic Resurfacing Model for Venus | journal=LPSC XXIV | date=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Io, despite having high volcanism, does not show any tectonic activity, possibly due to sulfur-based magmas with higher temperatures, or simply higher volumetric fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|last=Davies|first=A.|title=Volcanism on Io|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Vesta's [[fossa (geology)|fossae]] may be considered a form of tectonics, despite that body's small size and cool temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buczowski|first1=D.|last2=Wyrick|first2=D.|last3=Iyer|first3=K.|last4=Kahn|first4=E.|last5=Scully|first5=J.|last6=Nathues|first6=A.|last7=Gaskell|first7=R.|last8=Roatsch|first8=T.|title=Large-scale troughs on Vesta: A signature of planetary tectonics|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=29 Sep 2012|volume=39|issue=18|page=205|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1029/2012gl052959|bibcode=2012GeoRL..3918205B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europa is a key demonstration of outer-planet tectonics.  Its surface shows [[Chaos terrain|movement of ice blocks or rafts]], [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip faults]], and possibly [[diapirs]].  The question of extant tectonics is far less certain, possibly having been replaced by local cryomagmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|last1=Pappalardo|first1=R.|last2=McKinnon|first2=W.|last3=Khurana|first3=K., eds.|title=Europa }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ganymede and Triton may contain tectonically or cryovolcanically resurfaced areas, and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda's]] irregular terrains may be tectonic.

[[Earthquake]]s are well-studied on Earth, as multiple [[seismometer]]s or large arrays can be used to derive quake waveforms in multiple dimensions. The Moon is the only other body to successfully receive a seismometer array; "marsquakes" and the mars interior are based on simple models and Earth-derived assumptions. Venus has received negligible seismometry.

Gas giants may in turn show different forms of heat transfer and mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Li, C. | author2=Ingersoll, A. | title=Moist convection in hydrogen atmospheres and the frequency of Saturn’s giant storms | journal=Nature Geoscience | date=13 Apr 2015 | doi = 10.1038/ngeo2405 | volume=8 | pages=398–403|bibcode = 2015NatGe...8..398L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gas giants show different heat effects by size and distance to the Sun. Uranus shows a net negative heat budget to space, but the others (including Neptune, farther out) are net positive.

===Geomagnetism===

{{main|Magnetosphere}}

Two terrestrial planets (Earth and Mercury) display magnetospheres, and thus have molten metal layers. Similarly, all four gas giants have magnetospheres, which indicate layers of conductive fluids. [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also shows a weak magnetosphere, taken as evidence of a subsurface layer of salt water, while the volume around [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] shows symmetrical effects which may be rings or a magnetic phenomenon. Of these, Earth's magnetosphere is by far the most accessible, including from the surface. It is therefore the most studied, and extraterrestrial magnetospheres are examined in light of prior Earth studies.

Still, differences exist between magnetospheres, pointing to areas needing further research. Jupiter's magnetosphere is stronger than the other gas giants, while Earth's is stronger than Mercury's. Mercury and Uranus have offset magnetospheres, which have no satisfactory explanation yet. Uranus' tipped axis causes its magnetotail to corkscrew behind the planet, with no known analogue. Future Uranian studies may show new magnetospheric phenomena.

Mars shows remnants of an earlier, planetary-scale magnetic field, with [[Plate tectonics#Magnetic striping|stripes as on Earth]]. This is taken as evidence that the planet had a molten metal core in its prior history, allowing both a magnetosphere and tectonic activity (as on Earth). Both of these have since dissipated. Earth's Moon shows localized magnetic fields, indicating some process other than a large, molten metal core. This may be the source of [[lunar swirl]]s, not seen on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Magnetic And Spectral Properties Of Lunar Swirls, And A New Mechanism For Their Formation | url=http://www.planetology.ru/txt/garrickbethell_et_al_20091004_12411.pdf | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geochemistry===

{{main|Geochemistry}}

Apart from their distance to the Sun, different bodies show chemical variations indicating their formation and history. Neptune is denser than Uranus, taken as one piece of evidence that the two may have switched places in the early Solar System. Comets show both high volatile content, and grains containing refractory materials. This also indicates some mixing of materials through the Solar System when those comets formed. Mercury's inventory of materials by volatility is being used to evaluate different models for its formation and/or subsequent modification.

Isotopic abundances indicate processes over the history of the Solar System. To an extent, all bodies formed from the presolar nebula. Various subsequent processes then alter elemental and isotopic ratios. The gas giants in particular have enough gravity to retain primary atmospheres, taken largely from the presolar nebula, as opposed to the later outgassing and reactions of secondary atmospheres. Differences in gas giant atmospheres compared to solar abundances then indicate some process in that planet's history. Meanwhile, gases at small planets such as Venus and Mars have isotopic differences indicating [[atmospheric escape]] processes.{argon isotope ratio planet meteorite}{neon isotope ratio meteorite}

The various modifications of surface minerals, or [[space weathering]], is used to evaluate meteorite and asteroid types and ages. Rocks and metals shielded by atmospheres (particularly thick ones), or other minerals, experience less weathering and fewer [[ion implantation|implantation chemistries]] and [[cosmic ray track]]s. Asteroids are currently graded by their spectra, indicating surface properties and mineralogies. Some asteroids appear to have less space weathering, by various processes including a relatively recent formation date or a "freshening" event. As Earth's minerals are well shielded, space weathering is studied via extraterrestrial bodies, and preferably multiple examples.

[[Kuiper Belt Objects]] display very weathered or in some cases very fresh surfaces. As the long distances result in low spatial and spectral resolutions, KBO surface chemistries are currently evaluated via analogous moons and asteroids closer to Earth.

{{see also|Meteoritics}}

==Aeronomy and atmospheric physics==
Earth's atmosphere is far thicker than that of Mars, while far thinner than Venus'. In turn, the envelopes of gas giants are a different class entirely, and show their own gradations. Meanwhile, smaller bodies show tenuous atmospheres ("surface-bound exospheres"), with the exception of Titan and arguably Triton. Comets vary between negligible atmospheres in the outer solar system, and active [[coma]]s millions of miles across at perihelion. Exoplanets may in turn possess atmospheric properties known and unknown in our star system.

===Aeronomy===

{{main|Aeronomy}}

[[Atmospheric escape]] is largely a thermal process. The atmosphere a body can retain therefore varies from the warmer inner Solar System, to the cooler outer regions. Different bodies in different Solar System regions provide analogous or contrasting examples. The atmosphere of Titan is considered analogous to an early, colder Earth; the atmosphere of Pluto is considered analogous to an enormous comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greaves |first1=J. |last2=Helling |first2=C. |title=Discovery of carbon monoxide in the upper atmosphere of Pluto |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3933.2011.01052.x|arxiv=1104.3014 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.414L..36G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Pluto a giant comet? |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/ICQPluto.html |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence or absence of a magnetic field affects an upper atmosphere, and in turn the overall atmosphere. Impacts of [[solar wind]] particles create chemical reactions and ionic species, which may in turn affect magnetospheric phenomena. Earth serves as a counterexample to Venus and Mars, which have no planetary magnetospheres, and to Mercury, with a magnetosphere but negligible atmosphere.

Jupiter's moon Io creates sulfur emissions, and a [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Role of Io|feature of sulfur and some sodium]] around that planet. Similarly, Earth's Moon has [[Sodium tail of the Moon|trace sodium emissions, and a far weaker tail]]. Mercury also has a [[Atmosphere of Mercury|trace sodium atmosphere]].

Jupiter itself is assumed to have some characteristics of extrasolar [[Super-Jupiter|"super Jupiters"]] and [[Brown dwarf|brown dwarves]].

===Seasons===

Uranus, [[axial tilt|tipped]] on its side, is postulated to have [[Climate of Uranus#Seasonal variation|seasonal effects]] far stronger than on Earth. Similarly, Mars is postulated to have varied its [[axial tilt]] over eons, and to a far greater extent than on Earth. This is hypothesized to have dramatically altered not only seasons but climates on Mars, for which some evidence has been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Orbiter Finds Martian Rock Record With 10 Beats to the Bar|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro-20081204.html|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venus has negligible tilt, eliminating seasons, and a slow, retrograde rotation, causing different diurnal effects than on Earth and Mars.

===Clouds and haze layers===

From Earth, a [[Atmosphere of Venus|planetwide cloud layer]] is the dominant feature of Venus in the visible spectrum; this is also true of Titan. Venus' cloud layer is composed of sulfur dioxide particles, while Titan's is a [[Atmosphere of Titan|mixture of organics]].

The gas giant planets display clouds or belts of various compositions, including ammonia and methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adumitroaie|first1=V|last2=Gulkis|first2=S|last3=Oyafuso|first3=F|title=Ammonia-water solution cloud modeling of gas giant planets via phase equilibrium calculations, in 2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference|date=2014|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation and winds===

Venus and Titan, and to a lesser extent Earth, are superrotators- the atmosphere turns about the planet faster than the surface beneath. While these atmospheres share physical processes, they exhibit diverse characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics in planetary Atmospheric Physics: comparative studies of equatorial superrotation for Venus, Titan, and earth | url=http://www.bu.edu/csp/uv/cp-aeronomy/Zhu_2005.pdf | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadley cell]]s, first postulated and confirmed on Earth, are seen in different forms in other atmospheres. Earth has Hadley cells north and south of its equator, leading to additional cells by latitude. Mars' Hadley circulation is offset from its equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Pateris|first1=I|last2=Lissauer|first2=J|title=Planetary Sciences|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titan, a far smaller body, likely has one enormous cell, flipping polarity from northerly to southerly with its seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rannou|first1=P|last2=Montmessin|first2=F|title=The latitudinal distribution of clouds on Titan|journal=Science|date=Jan 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cloud Heralds Fall at Titan's South Pole|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20130411.html|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atmosphere of Jupiter#Zones, belts, and jets|bands of Jupiter]] are thought to be numerous Hadley-like cells by latitude.

===Storms and cyclonic activity===

The large storms seen on the gas giants are considered analogous to Earth [[Tropical cyclone|cyclones]]. However, this is an imperfect metaphor as expected, due to the large differences in sizes, temperature, and composition between Earth and the gas giants, and even between gas giants.

[[Polar vortex|Polar vortices]] were observed [[Polar vortex#Outside Earth|on Venus and Saturn]]. In turn, Earth's thinner atmosphere shows weaker polar vorticity and effects.

===Lightning and aurorae===

Both [[lightning]] and [[aurorae]] have been observed on other bodies after extensive study at Earth. Lightning has been detected on Venus, and may be a sign of active volcanism on that planet, as [[Dirty thunderstorm|volcanic lightning]] is known on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVIDENCE FOR LIGHTNING ON VENUS|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/evidence/|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightning Strikes Venus|url=http://blogs.agu.org/geospace/2014/12/19/lightning-strikes-venus/|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurorae have been observed on Jupiter and its moon Ganymede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk/~mgaland/ihy/Comparative_Planetary_Auroralogy_v4.pdf |title=Comparative Planetary Auroralogy |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative climatology===

An understanding of the evolutionary histories and current states of the Venus and Mars climates is directly relevant for studies of the past, present and future climates of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Decadal Survey: Comparative Climatology White Paper | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/vexag/ComparativeClimateWhitePaperV3.pdf | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrology==
{{main|Hydrology}}

A growing number of bodies display relict or current hydrological modification. Earth, the "ocean planet," is the prime example. Other bodies display lesser modifications, indicating their similarities and differences. This may be defined to include fluids other than water, such as light hydrocarbons on Titan, or possibly supercritical carbon dioxide on Mars, which do not persist in Earth conditions. Ancient lava flows in turn may be considered a form of hydrological modification, which may be confounded with other fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|last=Leverington|first=D.|title=A volcanic origin for the outflow channels of Mars: Key evidence and major implications |journal=Geomorphology |volume=132 |issue=3–4 |pages=51–75 |date=Sep 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.05.022|bibcode = 2011Geomo.132...51L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Io currently has lava calderas and lakes. Fluid modification may have occurred on bodies as small as Vesta;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scully |first1=J. |last2=Russell |first2=C. |title=Geomorphological evidence for transient water flow on Vesta |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=411 |date=1 Feb 2015|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.12.004 |bibcode=2015E&amp;PSL.411..151S |pages=151–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; hydration in general has been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Sanctis|first1=M.|last2=Combe|first2=J.|last3=Ammanito|first3=E.|last4=Palomba|first4=E.|last5=Longobardo|first5=A.|last6=McCord|first6=T.|last7=Marchi|first7=S.|last8=Capaccioni|first8=F.|last9=Capria|first9=M.|title=Detection of Widespread Hydrated Materials on Vesta by the VIR Imaging Spectrometer on board the Dawn Mission|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=3 Oct 2012|volume=758|issue=2|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/758/2/l36|pages=L36|bibcode = 2012ApJ...758L..36D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If fluids include [[Hydrogeology|groundwater]] and [[Water vapor|vapor]], the [[Extraterrestrial liquid water|list of bodies with hydrological modification]] includes Earth, Mars, and Enceladus, to a lesser extent comets and some asteroids, likely Europa and Triton, and possibly Ceres, Titan, and Pluto. Venus may have had hydrology in its early history, which would since have been [[Crustal recycling|erased]].

Fluid modification and mineral deposition on Mars, as observed by the MER and MSL rovers, is studied in light of Earth features and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duststone on Mars: source, transport, deposition, and erosion |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70044189 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minerals observed from orbiters and landers indicates formation in aqueous conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover Finds Mineral Match|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4361|work=NASA/JPL|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; morphologies indicate fluid action and deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arvidson |first1=R. |last2=Squyres |first2=S. |title=Ancient Aqueous Environments at Endeavour Crater, Mars |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=6169 |date=24 Jan 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1248097|bibcode = 2014Sci...343G.386A |display-authors=etal |pages=1248097 |pmid=24458648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extant Mars hydrology includes [[Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes|brief, seasonal flows on slopes]]; however, most Martian water is frozen into its polar caps and subsurface, as indicated by [[MARSIS|ground penetrating radars]] and [[pedestal craters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|last1=Kadish|first1=S.|last2=Barlow|first2=N.|title=Pedestal Crater Distribution and Implications for a New Model of Formation|date=Jan 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kadish |first1=S. |last2=Head |title=Martian pedestal craters: Marginal sublimation pits implicate a climate-related formation mechanism |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=35 |issue=16 |date=Aug 2008 |doi=10.1029/2008gl034990 |bibcode=2008GeoRL..3516104K}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freezing point depression|Antifreeze mixtures]] such as salts, peroxides, and perchlorates may allow fluid flow at Martian temperatures.

Analogues of Mars landforms on Earth include Siberian and Hawaiian valleys, Greenland slopes, the Columbian Plateau, and various [[Sink (geography)|playas]]. Analogues for human expeditions (e.g. geology and hydrology fieldwork) include Devon Island, Canada, Antarctica, Utah, the Euro-Mars project, and Arkaroola, South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chapman |first1=M. |title=The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mars Analog Research |editor1-last=Clarke |editor1-first=J. |publisher=The Astronautical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon, on the other hand, is a natural laboratory for regolith processes and weathering on anhydrous airless bodies- modification and alteration by meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts, the implantation of solar and interstellar charged particles, radiation damage, spallation, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and so on. Knowledge of the processes that create and modify the lunar regolith is essential to understanding the compositional and structural attributes of other airless planet and asteroid regoliths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon |author=National Research Council |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possibilities include extrasolar planets completely [[Ocean planet|covered by oceans]], which would lack some Earthly processes.

{{see also|Extraterrestrial liquid water|Water on Mars}}

==Dynamics==
{{main|Celestial mechanics}}

Earth, alone among terrestrial planets, possesses a large moon. This is thought to confer stability to Earth's axial tilt, and thus seasons and climates. The closest analogue is the Pluto-Charon system, though its axial tilt is completely different. Both our Moon and Charon are hypothesized to have formed via [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impacts]].

Giant impacts are hypothesized to account for both the tilt of Uranus, and the retrograde rotation of Venus. Giant impacts are also candidates for the Mars ocean hypothesis, and the high density of Mercury.

Most giant planets ([[Moons of Neptune|except Neptune]]) have retinues of moons, rings, ring shepherds, and moon Trojans analogous to mini-solar systems. These systems are postulated to have accreted from analogous gas clouds, and possibly with analogous migrations during their formation periods. The Cassini mission was defended on the grounds that Saturn system dynamics would contribute to studies of Solar System dynamics and formation.

Studies of ring systems inform us of many-body dynamics.  This is applicable to the asteroid and Kuiper Belts, and the early Solar System, which had more objects, dust, and gas.  It is relevant to the magnetospherics of those bodies.  It is also relevant to the dynamics of our galaxy and others.  In turn, though the [[Rings of Saturn|Saturnian system]] is readily studied (by [[Cassini mission|Cassini]], ground telescopes, and space telescopes), the simpler and lower mass ring systems of the other giants makes their explanations somewhat easier to fathom.  The Jupiter ring system is perhaps more completely understood at present than any of the other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miner|first1=E.|last2=Wessen|first2=R.|last3=Cuzzi|first3=J.|title=Planetary Ring Systems|publisher=Springer-Praxis|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asteroid families]] and [[Kirkwood gap|gaps]] indicate their local dynamics.  They are in turn indicative of the Kuiper Belt, and its hypothesized Kuiper cliff.  The Hildas and Jupiter Trojans are then relevant to the Neptune Trojans and Plutinos, Twotinos, etc.

Neptune's relative lack of a moon system suggests its formation and dynamics.  The migration of Triton explains the ejection or destruction of competing moons, analogous to Hot Jupiters (also in sparse systems), and the Grand Tack hypothesis of Jupiter itself, on a smaller scale.

The planets are considered to have formed by accretion of larger and larger particles, into asteroids and planetesimals, and into today's bodies. Vesta and Ceres are hypothesized to be the only surviving examples of planetesimals, and thus samples of the formative period of the Solar System.

[[Planetary transit|Transits]] of Mercury and Venus have been observed as analogues of extrasolar transits. As Mercury and Venus transits are far closer and thus appear "deeper," they can be studied in far finer detail. Similarly, analogues to our asteroid and Kuiper belts have been observed around other star systems, though in far less detail.

==Astrobiology==
{{main|Astrobiology}}

Earth is the only body known to contain life; this results in geologic and atmospheric life signatures apart from the organisms themselves. [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|Methane observed on Mars]] has been postulated but cannot be definitively ascribed as a [[biosignature]]. Multiple processes of non-biological methane generation are seen on Earth as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Müntener|first1=Othmar|title=Serpentine and serpentinization: A link between planet formation and life|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/10/959.full|website=The Geological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Velbel|first1=M|title=Weathering of olivine and pyroxene on Mars: Evidence from missions, meteorites, and terrestrial mineral analogs, in American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2010|date=Dec 2010|publisher=American Geophysical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detection of biomarkers or biosignatures on other worlds is an active area of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosignatures of Fe-oxidizing microbes|url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/our-people/profiles/cschan/biosignatures-of-fe-oxidizing-microbes|website=University of Delaware|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519205846/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/our-people/profiles/cschan/biosignatures-of-fe-oxidizing-microbes|archivedate=19 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although oxygen and/or ozone are generally considered strong signs of life, these too have alternate, non-biological explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NASA's New Carbon Observatory Will Help Us Understand Alien Worlds | url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/nasas-new-carbon-observatory-will-help-us-understand-alien-worlds/ | accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galileo mission, while performing a gravity assist flyby of Earth, treated our planet as an extraterrestrial one, in a test of life detection techniques. Conversely, the Deep Impact mission's High Resolution Imager, intended for examining comets starting from great distances, could be repurposed for exoplanet observations in its EPOXI extended mission.

Conversely, detection of life entails identification of those processes favoring or preventing life. This occurs primarily via study of Earth life and Earth processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lim |first1=D. |title=Pavilion Lake Research Project |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5497.pdf |website=Lunar and Planetary Institute |accessdate=17 May 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is in effect a sample size of one. Care must be taken to avoid observation and selection biases. Astrobiologists consider alternative chemistries for life, and study on Earth [[Extremophile|extremophile organisms]] that expand the potential definitions of habitable worlds.

==Project history==

===Technological background===
[[File:SERT-1 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|150px|left|SERT-1: first [[ion engine]] NASA spacecraft;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html |title=Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched on July 20, 1964.&lt;ref name = "Cybulski"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ronald J. Cybulski |author2=Daniel M. Shellhammer |author3=Robert R. LoveII |author4=Edward J. Domino |author5=Joseph T.

The first working ion thruster in US was built by [[Harold R. Kaufman]] in 1959 at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] in [[Ohio]]. The thruster was similar to the general design of a gridded electrostatic ion thruster with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] as its propellant. Suborbital tests of the engine followed during the 1960s, and in 1964 the engine was tested on a suborbital flight aboard the [[SERT-1 (spaceship)|Space Electric Rocket Test 1]] (SERT 1). It successfully operated for the planned 31 minutes before falling back to Earth.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html |title=Innovative Engines – Glenn Ion Propulsion Research Tames the Challenges of 21st Century Space Travel |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915023928/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html |archivedate=September 15, 2007 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test was followed by an orbital test, SERT-2, in 1970.

[[Deep Space 1]] (DS1), which NASA launched in 1998, demonstrated the long-duration use of a [[xenon]]-propelled ion thruster on a science mission,&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mission design for deep space 1: A low-thrust technology validation mission |author=Rayman, M.D. and Chadbourne, P.A. and Culwell, J.S. and Williams, S.N. |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=45 |issue=4-9 |pages=381–388 |year=1999 |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19098/1/98-0310.pdf |bibcode=1999AcAau..45..381R |doi=10.1016/s0094-5765(99)00157-5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172350/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19098/1/98-0310.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and validated a number of technologies, including the [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]] [[electrostatic ion thruster]], as well as performing a flyby of an asteroid and a comet.&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/090924dawn-FinalCorrex--update5G.pdf |title=Dawn Telecommunications |author=Jim Taylor |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=August 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ion thruster, among the other technologies validated by the DS1 was the [[Small Deep Space Transponder]], which is used on ''Dawn'' for long-range communication.&lt;ref name="Dawn" /&gt;

===Discovery Program selection===
26 proposals were submitted to the [[Discovery Program]] solicitation, with budget initially targeted at 300 million USD.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Three semi-finalists were downselected in January 2001 for a phase-A design study: Dawn, Kepler, and INSIDE Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetoday.net/Summary/7 |title=NASA announces Discovery mission finalists |website=Spacetoday.net |date=January 4, 2001 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2001 NASA selected the Kepler and the Dawn mission for the Discovery program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Reichley |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2001/release_2001_245.html |title=2001 News Releases - JPL Asteroid Mission Gets Thumbs Up from NASA |website=Jpl.nasa.gov |date=December 21, 2001 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both missions were initially selected for a launch in 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

===Cancellation and reinstatement===
The status of the ''Dawn'' mission changed several times. The project was cancelled in December 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ambrosiano |first=Nancy |date=March 28, 2006 |title=NASA's Dawn mission is a go |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/nb.story/story_id/8140 |accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then reinstated in February 2004. In October 2005, work on ''Dawn'' was placed in "stand down" mode, and in January 2006, the mission was discussed in the press as "indefinitely postponed", even though NASA had made no new announcements regarding its status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/ap_060121_dawn_hold.html |title=NASA Asteroid Mission Won't Launch This Year |year=2006 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=March 4, 2006 |first=Alicia |last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2006, ''Dawn'' was again cancelled by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0603/03dawn/ |title=Probe built to visit asteroids killed in budget snarl |year=2006 |publisher=SpaceflightNow.com |accessdate=March 4, 2006 |first=Stephen |last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft's manufacturer, [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], appealed NASA's decision, offering to build the spacecraft at cost, forgoing any profit in order to gain experience in a new market field. NASA then put the cancellation under review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/03/16/asteroid.mission.ap/index.html |title=NASA reviewing canceled mission |date=March 16, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=March 27, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321081642/http://www3.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/03/16/asteroid.mission.ap/index.html |archivedate=March 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 27, 2006, it was announced that the mission would not be cancelled after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/145511main_Dawn_letter.pdf |title=Dawn Mission Reclama |first=Rex |last=Geveden |year=2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.com/news/060327_dawn_mission.html |title=NASA Reinstates Cancelled Asteroid Mission |first=Tariq |last=Malik |date=March 27, 2006 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last week of September 2006, the ''Dawn'' mission's instrument payload integration reached full functionality. Although originally projected to cost US$373 million, cost overruns inflated the final cost of the mission to US$446 million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-043A |title=Dawn |publisher=NASA – National Space Science Data Center |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher T. Russell]] was chosen to lead the ''Dawn'' mission team.

==Scientific background==
[[File:Ceres and Vesta, Moon size comparison.jpg|thumb|200px|Scale comparison of Vesta, Ceres, and Earth's moon]]
The ''Dawn'' mission was designed to study two large bodies in the [[asteroid belt]] in order to answer questions about the formation of the [[Solar System]], as well as to test the performance of its [[ion thruster]]s in deep space.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180907"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCartney |first1=Gretchen |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Wendel |first3=JoAnna |title=Legacy of NASA's Dawn, Near the End of its Mission |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7231 |date=September 7, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres and Vesta were chosen as two contrasting [[protoplanet]]s, the first one apparently "wet" (i.e. icy and cold) and the other "dry" (i.e. rocky), whose [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] was terminated by the formation of [[Jupiter]]. The two bodies provide a bridge in scientific understanding between the formation of [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] and the icy bodies of the Solar System, and under what conditions a rocky planet can hold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/goal_index.asp |title=DAWN Mission Objectives |publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted a new [[IAU definition of planet|definition of planet]] on August 24, 2006, which introduced the term "[[dwarf planet]]" for [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|ellipsoidal]] worlds that were too small to qualify for planetary status by [[Clearing the neighbourhood|"clearing their orbital neighborhood"]] of other orbiting matter. ''Dawn'' is the first mission to study a dwarf planet, arriving at Ceres a few months before the arrival of the ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe at [[Pluto]] in July 2015.

[[File:PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-AnimationFrame25-20150504.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Dawn'' image of Ceres from 13,600 km, May 4, 2015]]
Ceres comprises a third of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Its spectral characteristics suggest a composition similar to that of a water-rich [[carbonaceous chondrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Ceres: Evolution and current state |bibcode=2005JGRE..11005009M |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |issue=E5 |pages=E05009 |author1=Thomas B. McCord |author2=Christophe Sotin |year=2005 |doi=10.1029/2004JE002244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesta, a smaller, water-poor [[achondrite|achondritic]] [[asteroid]] comprising a tenth of the mass of the asteroid belt, has experienced significant heating and [[Igneous differentiation|differentiation]]. It shows signs of a metallic [[Planetary core|core]], a Mars-like density and lunar-like basaltic flows.&lt;ref name=SolarViewsCalvin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vesta.htm |title=Vesta |author=Calvin J. Hamilton |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available evidence indicates that both bodies formed very early in the history of the Solar System, thereby retaining a record of events and processes from the time of the formation of the terrestrial planets. [[Radionuclide]] dating of pieces of meteorites thought to come from Vesta suggests that Vesta differentiated quickly, in three million years or less. Thermal evolution studies suggest that Ceres must have formed some time later, more than three million years after the formation of [[Ca-Al-rich inclusions|CAI]]s (the oldest known objects of Solar System origin).&lt;ref name=SolarViewsCalvin/&gt;

Moreover, Vesta appears to be the source of many smaller objects in the Solar System. Most (but not all) [[Vestoid|V-type]] [[near-Earth asteroid]]s, and some outer main-belt asteroids, have [[spectrum|spectra]] similar to Vesta, and are thus known as ''vestoids''. Five percent of the meteoritic samples found on Earth, the [[HED meteorite|howardite–eucrite–diogenite]] (HED) meteorites, are thought to be the result of a collision or collisions with Vesta.

[[File:Dawn trajectory as of September 2009.png|thumb|200px|right|''Dawn''{{'s}} approximate flight trajectory]]
The ''Dawn'' mission's goal was to characterize the conditions and processes of the Solar System's earliest eon by investigating in detail two of the largest protoplanets remaining intact since their formation.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180907" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Objectives"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mission Objectives |year=2006 |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/goal_index.asp |publisher=[[JPL]] – NASA |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the mission has finished, the data analyses and interpretations will continue for many years. The primary question that the mission addresses is the role of size and water in determining the evolution of the planets.&lt;ref name="Objectives"/&gt; Ceres and Vesta are highly suitable bodies with which to address this question, as they are two of the most massive of the protoplanets. Ceres is geologically very primitive and icy, while Vesta is evolved and rocky. Their contrasting characteristics are thought to have resulted from them forming in two different regions of the early Solar System.&lt;ref name="Objectives"/&gt;

There are three principal scientific drivers for the mission. First, the ''Dawn'' mission can capture the earliest moments in the origin of the Solar System, granting an insight into the conditions under which these objects formed. Second, ''Dawn'' determines the nature of the building blocks from which the terrestrial planets formed, improving scientific understanding of this formation. Finally, it contrasts the formation and evolution of two small planets that followed very different evolutionary paths, allowing scientists to determine what factors control that evolution.&lt;ref name="Objectives"/&gt;

==Specifications==

===Dimensions===
With its [[solar array]] in the retracted launch position, the ''Dawn'' spacecraft is {{convert|2.36|m|ft|sp=us}} long. With its solar arrays fully extended, ''Dawn'' is {{convert|19.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/dawn/spacecraft/ |title=Dawn Mission Overview |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar arrays have a total area of {{convert|36.4|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/nov_2007_meeting/presentations/solar_power.pdf |title=Solar Power for Outer Planets Study |format=PDF |publisher=NASA |author=Scott W.

The Dawn spacecraft was able to achieve a record-breaking level of propulsion from its ion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/|title=Dawn Mission {{!}} Mission|website=dawn.jpl.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA noted three specific areas of excellence:&lt;reF&gt;[https://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*First to orbit two different astronomical bodies (not including Earth).
*[[Solar electric propulsion|Solar-electric propulsion]] record, including a velocity change in space of 25,700 mph (11.49 km/second). This is 2.7x the velocity change by solar-electric ion drive than the past record.
*Achieved 5.9 years of ion engine runtime by September 7, 2018. This amount of runtime equates to 54% of Dawn's time in outer space.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory provided overall planning and management of the mission, the flight system and scientific payload development, and provided the [[ion propulsion system]]. Orbital Sciences Corporation provided the spacecraft, which constituted the company's first interplanetary mission. The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) provided the framing cameras, the [[Italian Space Agency]] provided the mapping [[spectrometer]], and the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] provided the [[gamma ray]] and [[neutron]] spectrometer.&lt;ref name="Rayman 2006 605–616" /&gt;

The spectrometer's VIR spectral frames are 256 (spatial) × 432 (spectral), and the slit length is 64 [[Angular mil|mrad]]. The mapping spectrometer incorporates two channels, both fed by a single grating. A CCD yields frames from 0.25 to 1.0 μm, while an array of HgCdTe photodiodes cooled to about 70K spans the spectrum from 0.95 to 5.0 μm.&lt;ref name="Rayman 2006 605–616" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9668-5 |title=The VIR Spectrometer |year=2010 |last1=Sanctis |first1=M.

During this first interplanetary cruise phase, ''Dawn'' spent 270 days, or 85% of this phase, using its thrusters. It expended less than 72 kilograms of xenon propellant for a total change in velocity of 1.81&amp;nbsp;km/s. On November 20, 2008, ''Dawn'' performed its first [[trajectory]] correction maneuver (TCM1), firing its number 1 thruster for 2 hours, 11 minutes.

===Vesta approach===
As ''Dawn'' approached Vesta, the Framing Camera instrument took progressively higher-resolution images, which were published online and at news conferences by [http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/vesta_dawn_gallery.asp NASA] and [http://www.dawn.mps.mpg.de/index.php?id=10 MPI].

''Dawn'' was scheduled to be inserted into orbit at 05:00 UTC on July 16 after a period of thrusting with its ion engines. Because its antenna was pointed away from the Earth during thrusting, scientists were not able to immediately confirm whether or not ''Dawn'' successfully made the maneuver.

During its time in orbit around Vesta, the probe experienced several failures of its reaction wheels. Investigators planned to modify their activities upon arrival at Ceres for close range geographical survey mapping. The ''Dawn'' team stated that they would orient the probe using a "hybrid" mode utilizing both reaction wheels and ion thrusters. Engineers determined that this hybrid mode would conserve fuel. On November 13, 2013, during the transit, in a test preparation, ''Dawn'' engineers completed a 27-hour-long series of exercises of said hybrid mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_Fills_Out_Ceres_Dance_Card.asp |title=Dawn Fills out its Ceres Dance Card |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415025503/http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_Fills_Out_Ceres_Dance_Card.asp |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2014, ''Dawn''{{'s}} ion thruster unexpectedly ceased firing and the probe began operating in a triggered safe mode. To avoid a lapse in propulsion, the mission team hastily exchanged the active ion engine and electrical controller with another. The team stated that they had a plan in place to revive this disabled component later in 2014. The controller in the ion propulsion system may have been damaged by a [[high-energy particle]]. Upon exiting the safe mode on September 15, 2014, the probe's ion thruster resumed normal operation.&lt;ref name=SafeMode2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_operated_normally.asp |title=Dawn Operating Normally After Safe Mode Triggered |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=September 16, 2014 |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225012242/http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_operated_normally.asp |archivedate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the ''Dawn'' investigators also found that, after the propulsion issue, ''Dawn'' could not aim its main communications antenna towards Earth. Another antenna of weaker capacity was instead temporarily retasked. To correct the problem, the probe's computer was reset and the aiming mechanism of the main antenna was restored.&lt;ref name=SafeMode2014/&gt;

===Ceres approach===
''Dawn'' began photographing an extended disk of Ceres on December 1, 2014,&lt;ref name=dawnjournal1214&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2014/12/29/dawn-journal-december-29/ |title=Dawn Journal |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=December 29, 2014 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with images of partial rotations on January 13 and 25, 2015 released as animations.
Images taken from ''Dawn'' of Ceres after January 26, 2015, exceeded the resolution of comparable images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2014/10/31/dawn-journal-october-31/#sthash.OPRlufJs.dpuf |title=Dawn Journal October 31 |publisher=NASA |date=October 31, 2014 |accessdate=January 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120120112/http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2014/10/31/dawn-journal-october-31/#sthash.OPRlufJs.dpuf |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the failure of two reaction wheels, ''Dawn'' made fewer camera observations of Ceres during its approach phase than it did during its Vesta approach. Camera observations required turning the spacecraft, which consumed precious hydrazine fuel. Seven optical navigation photo sessions (OpNav 1–7, on January 13 and 25, February 3 and 25, March 1, and April 10 and 15) and two full rotation observation sessions (RC1–2, on February 12 and 19) were planned{{update inline|date=December 2015}} before full observation begins with orbital capture. The gap in March and early April was due to a period when Ceres appears too close to the Sun from ''Dawn''{{'s}} vantage point to take pictures safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2015/01/29/dawn-journal-january-29/ |title=Dawn Journal January 29 |publisher=NASA |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 23 to May 9, 2015, ''Dawn'' entered an RC3 orbit (Rotation Characterization 3) at an altitude of {{convert|13,500|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The RC3 orbit lasted 15 days, during which ''Dawn'' alternated taking pictures and sensor measurements and then relayed the resulting data back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2014/02/28/dawn-journal-february-28-2014/ |title=Dawn Journal February 28 |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Marc |last=Rayman |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2015, ''Dawn'' powered its ion engines and began a month-long spiral descent down to its second mapping point, a Survey orbit, three times closer to Ceres than the previous orbit. The spacecraft stopped twice to take images of Ceres during its spiral descent into the new orbit.

On June 6, 2015, ''Dawn'' entered the new Survey orbit at an altitude of {{convert|4,430|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In the new Survey orbit, ''Dawn'' circled Ceres every three Earth days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4582 |title=Ceres Animation Showcases Bright Spots |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey phase lasted 22 days (7 orbits), and was designed to obtain a global view of Ceres with ''Dawn''{{'s}} framing camera, and generate detailed global maps with the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR).

On June 30, 2015, ''Dawn'' experienced a software glitch when an anomaly in its orientation system occurred. It responded by going into [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] and sending a signal to engineers, who fixed the error on July 2, 2015.  Engineers determined the cause of the anomaly to be related to the mechanical gimbal system associated with one of ''Dawn's'' ion engines.  After switching to a separate ion engine and conducting tests from July 14 through July 16, 2015, engineers certified the ability to continue the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4659 |title=Dawn Maneuvering to Third Science Orbit |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=July 17, 2015 |accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2015, ''Dawn'' entered the HAMO orbit (High-Altitude Mapping Orbit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vofoundation.org/blog/dawn-mission-enters-high-altitude-mapping-orbit-over-ceres |title=Dawn Mission Enters High Altitude Mapping Orbit Over Ceres |work=The Catholic Astronomer |publisher=[[Vatican Observatory]] |first=Bob |last=Trembley |date=August 21, 2015 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dawn'' descended to an altitude of {{convert|1,480|km|mi|abbr=on}}, where in August 2015 it began the two-month HAMO phase. During this phase, ''Dawn'' continued to acquire near-global maps with the VIR and framing camera at higher resolution than in the Survey phase. It also imaged in [[Stereoscopy|stereo]] to resolve the surface in 3D.

On October 23, 2015, ''Dawn'' began a two-month spiral toward Ceres to achieve a LAMO orbit (Low-Altitude Mapping Orbit) at a distance of {{convert|375|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Since reaching this fourth orbit in December 2015, ''Dawn'' was scheduled to acquire data for the next three months with its gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND) and other instruments that identified the composition at the surface.&lt;ref name="Dawn Mission Status Updates"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status.html |title=Dawn Mission Status Updates |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having surpassed its mapping objectives, ''Dawn'' climbed to its fifth science orbit of {{convert|1460|km|mi|abbr=on}} beginning on September 2, 2016, to complete additional observations from a different angle.&lt;ref name="nasa20160831"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6608 |title=Dawn Sets Course for Higher Orbit |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=August 31, 2016 |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dawn'' began raising its altitude to its sixth science orbit of {{convert|7200|km|mi|abbr=on}} on November 4, 2016, with a goal of reaching it by December 2016. The return to a higher altitude allowed for a second set of data at this altitude, which improves the overall science quality when added to the first batch. However, this time the spacecraft was placed where it was not spiraling and was orbiting in the same direction as Ceres, which reduced propellant consumption.&lt;ref name="nasa20161118"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6678 |title=New Ceres Views as Dawn Moves Higher |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=November 18, 2016 |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission conclusion==
A flyby of the asteroid [[2 Pallas]] after the completion of the Ceres mission was suggested but never formally considered; orbiting Pallas would not have been possible for ''Dawn'', due to the high inclination of Pallas' orbit relative to Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawnblog.jpl.nasa.gov/2014/12/29/dawn-journal-december-29/#comment-7392 |title=Dawn Journal December 29 |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=January 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the ''Dawn'' project team submitted a proposal to NASA for an extended mission that would have seen the spacecraft break orbit from Ceres and perform a flyby of the asteroid [[145 Adeona]] in May 2019,&lt;ref name="ExtendedMission"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2085288-nasas-dawn-probe-may-visit-third-asteroid-after-ceres-and-vesta/ |title=NASA's Dawn probe may visit third asteroid after Ceres and Vesta |work=New Scientist |first=Govert |last=Schilling |date=April 20, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the science gained from visiting a third asteroid might outweigh the returns from staying at Ceres.&lt;ref name="sfnow20160702" /&gt; NASA's Planetary Mission Senior Review Panel, however, declined the proposal in May 2016.&lt;ref name="pmsr2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/PMSR2016_Report_Final.pdf |title=Report for Planetary Mission Senior Review 2016 |publisher=NASA |first=J.

'''Friability''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|r|aɪ|ə|ˈ|b|ɪ|l|ə|t|i}} {{Respell|FRY|ə|BIL|ə|tee}}), the condition of being '''friable''', describes the tendency of a [[solid]] substance to break into smaller pieces under duress or contact, especially by rubbing. The opposite of friable is '''indurate'''.

Substances that are designated hazardous, such as [[asbestos]] or [[crystal]]line [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], are often said to be friable if small particles are easily dislodged and become airborne, and hence respirable (able to enter human [[lung]]s), posing a health hazard.

Tougher substances, such as [[concrete]], may also be mechanically ground down and reduced to finely divided mineral dust. However, such substances are not generally considered friable because of the degree of difficulty involved in breaking the substance's chemical bonds through mechanical means. Some substances, such as polyurethane foams, show an increase in friability with exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]], such as [[sunlight]].

Friable is sometimes used metaphorically to describe "brittle" personalities who can be "rubbed" by seemingly-minor stimuli to produce extreme emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonparlance.blogspot.ca/2008/01/friable-v-frangible.html|title=The Common Parlance|author=Lauren|work=thecommonparlance.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A friable substance is any substance that can be reduced to fibers or finer particles by the action of a small [[pressure]] or [[friction]], such as rubbing or inadvertently brushing up against the substance. The term could also apply to any material that exhibits these properties, such as:

* [[Ionic bond|Ionically]] [[Chemical bond|bound]] substances that are less than 1&amp;nbsp;kg/[[Litre|L]] in [[density]]
* [[Clay tablet]]s
* [[Cracker (food)|Crackers]]
* [[Mineral wool|Mineral fibers]]
* [[Polyurethane]] (foam)
* [[Aerogel]]

==Geological usage==
''Friable'' and ''indurated'' are terms used commonly in soft-rock [[geology]], especially with [[sandstone]]s, [[mudstone]]s, and [[shale]]s to describe how well the component rock fragments are held together.

Examples:
* Clumps of dried [[clay]]
* [[Chalk]]
* [[Perlite]]

==Medical usage==
The term ''friable'' is also used to describe [[tumor]]s in medicine.  This is an important determination because tumors that are easily torn apart have a higher risk of malignancy and [[metastasis]].

Examples:
* Some forms of [[cancer]], such as [[atrial myxoma]]
* [[Cholecystitis|An inflamed gallbladder]]

==Pharmaceutical usage==
Friability testing is a [[laboratory technique]] used by the [[pharmaceutical industry]] to test the durability of [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] during transit.  This testing involves repeatedly dropping a sample of tablets over a fixed time, using a rotating wheel with a baffle. The result is inspected for broken tablets, and the percentage of tablet mass lost through chipping.  A typical specification will allow a non-zero percentage of chipping, and zero broken tablets.

'''Georgiaite''' is a form or type of [[tektite]]. They are found in part of the 34-million-year-old North American strewnfield coming from the [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]]. Two strewnfields and tektite groups are associated with this impact: the black [[Bediasite]]s in Texas and the green Georgiaites in Georgia.

Georgiaites occur in east-central Georgia, with approximately 1000 specimens found to date.  They are splash-form tektites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/science-medicine/georgiaites#main-content|title=Georgiaites|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PIA08148 (Rhea-Splat).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inktomi is a prominent feature on Rhea, seen here characterized by its light color and butterfly-wing ejecta.]]
'''Inktomi''', also known as '''The Splat''', is a prominent rayed [[impact crater]] {{convert|47.2|km|mi}} in diameter&lt;ref name=info&gt;http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/14671&lt;/ref&gt; located in the southern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]. The crater is named for the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] spider-god [[Iktomi]]&lt;ref name="info"/&gt; and is located at {{coord|14.1|S|112.1|W|globe:rhea_type:landmark|display=inline,title|notes=&lt;ref name="info"/&gt;}}. Inktomi is thought to be the youngest surface feature on Rhea, with estimates ranging from 8 to 280 million years.&lt;ref name=data&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2011/EPSC-DPS2011-919.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and composition==
The rayed ejecta pattern indicates an oblique impact occurred from the west. The impact ejected pure water ice from beneath Rhea's surface creating a region contrastingly lighter than the surrounding regions.&lt;ref name="data" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crater"&gt;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2011/pdf/2249.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analysis of ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]''{{'}}s [[Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer|VIMS]] data revealed clean water ice without impurities at the crater and in its ejecta.&lt;ref name="crater"/&gt; Reassessment of the images from orbit, using additional images taken from Inktomi and its surroundings, confirms a continuous ejecta blanket almost devoid of small craters, thus likely a more geologically recent impact.&lt;ref name="data"/&gt; A 3-dimensional [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] constructed from ''Cassini'' VIMS images shows a hilly crater floor with a prominent but topographically low central peak complex. While regular radial secondaries occur outside of the continuous ejecta blanket associated with the bright rays, clusters of numerous small craters could be identified in the eastern part of the crater floor and in the adjacent continuous ejecta. These small craters were most likely created by material ejected from the Inktomi impact at a steep angle.&lt;ref name="crater"/&gt;

'''Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers''', also abbreviated to '''Isis''', is a specialized software package developed by the [[USGS]] to [[Image processing|process images]] and spectra collected by current and past [[NASA]] planetary missions sent to Earth's Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and other solar system bodies.

==History==
The history of ISIS began in 1971 at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Isis was developed in 1989, primarily to support the [[Galileo (spacecraft)#Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer .28NIMS.29|Galileo NIMS instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, et al., (1997) LPS XXVIII, pp. 387-388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=modern&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/2039.pdf MODERNIZATION OF THE INTEGRATED SOFTWARE FOR IMAGERS], Anderson, J.A.,  Sides, S.C.,  Soltesz, D.L., Sucharski, T.L, and Becker, K.J.,  U.S. Geological Survey, 2255 N Gemini Drive, Flagstaff, AZ, Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004LPI....35.2039A Modernization of the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers], 35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, March 15–19, 2004, League City, Texas, abstract no.2039 Publication Date: 03/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains standard image processing capabilities (such as image algebra, filters, statistics) for both 2D images and 3D data cubes, as well as mission-specific data processing capabilities and cartographic rendering functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/ USGS Isis Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16063">The '''Kendrick mass''' is defined by setting the mass of a chosen molecular fragment, typically CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to an integer value in [[atomic mass units]]. It is different from the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition, which is based on setting the mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope to exactly 12 u. The Kendrick mass is often used to identify homologous compounds differing only by a number of base units in high resolution [[mass spectra]].&lt;ref name='Kendrick 1963'&gt;{{Citation|title=A mass scale based on CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.00000 for high resolution mass spectrometry of organic compounds|journal=[[Anal.

==Definition==
According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as exactly 14 Da, instead of the IUPAC mass of 14.01565 Da.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mopper | first1 = Kenneth | last2 = Stubbins | first2 = Aron | last3 = Ritchie | first3 = Jason D. | last4 = Bialk | first4 = Heidi M. | last5 = Hatcher | first5 = Patrick G. | title = Advanced Instrumental Approaches for Characterization of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter:  Extraction Techniques, Mass Spectrometry, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 419–42 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17300139 | doi = 10.1021/cr050359b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Meija | first1 = Juris | title = Mathematical tools in analytical mass spectrometry | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 385 | issue = 3 | pages = 486–99 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16514517 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-006-0298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert an IUPAC mass of a particular compound to the Kendrick mass, the equation

: &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass} = \textrm{IUPAC~mass} \times \frac{14.00000}{14.01565} &lt;/math&gt;

is used.&lt;ref name="pmid14730994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Headley 2009"&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Headley | first1 =John V. | last2 =Peru | first2 =Kerry M. | last3 =Barrow | first3 =Mark P. | title =Mass spectrometric characterization of naphthenic acids in environmental samples: A review | journal =Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume =28 | issue =1 | pages =121–34 | year =2009 | pmid =18677766 | doi =10.1002/mas.20185| bibcode =2009MSRv...28..121H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Ohta | first1 =Daisaku | last2 =Kanaya | first2 =Shigehiko | last3 =Suzuki | first3 =Hideyuki | title =Application of Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to metabolic profiling and metabolite identification | journal =Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume =21 | issue =1 | pages =35–44 | year =2010 | pmid =20171870 | doi =10.1016/j.copbio.2010.01.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reemtsma 2009"&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Reemtsma | first1 =Thorsten | title =Determination of molecular formulas of natural organic matter molecules by (ultra-) high-resolution mass spectrometryStatus and needs | journal =Journal of Chromatography A | volume =1216 | issue =18 | pages =3687–701 | year =2009 | pmid =19264312 | doi =10.1016/j.chroma.2009.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass in [[dalton (unit)|dalton units]] (''Da'') can be converted to the Kendrick scale by dividing by 1.0011178.&lt;ref name='Kendrick 1963' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Panda | first1 = Saroj K. | last2 = Andersson | first2 = Jan T. | last3 = Schrader | first3 = Wolfgang | title = Mass-spectrometric analysis of complex volatile and nonvolatile crude oil components: a challenge | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 389 | issue = 5 | pages = 1329–39 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17885749 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-007-1583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups of atoms in addition to CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used define the Kendrick mass, for example CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and O.&lt;ref name="Reemtsma 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kim|first1=Sunghwan|last2=Kramer|first2=Robert W.|last3=Hatcher|first3=Patrick G.|title=Graphical Method for Analysis of Ultrahigh-Resolution Broadband Mass Spectra of Natural Organic Matter, the Van Krevelen Diagram|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=75|issue=20|pages=5336–44|year=2003|pmid=14710810|doi=10.1021/ac034415p }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Nizkorodov|first1=Sergey A.|last2=Laskin|first2=Julia|last3=Laskin|first3=Alexander|title=Molecular chemistry of organic aerosols through the application of high resolution mass spectrometry|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|pages=3612–29|year=2011|doi=10.1039/C0CP02032J|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13.3612N |issue=9|pmid=21206953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Kendrick mass for a family of compounds F is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass~(F)} = \textrm{(observed~mass)} \times \frac{\textrm{nominal~mass~F}}{\textrm{exact~mass~F}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the hydrocarbon analysis, F=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

As an example, Kendrick analysis has been used for visualizing families of halogenated compounds of environmental interest that differ only by the number of chlorine, bromine or fluorine substitutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A recent publication has suggested that Kendrick mass be expressed in Kendrick units with symbol ''Ke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Junninen| first1 =H.| last2 =Ehn| first2 =M.| last3 =Petäjä| first3 =T.| last4 =Luosujärvi| first4 =L.| last5 =Kotiaho| first5 =T.| last6 =Kostiainen| first6 =R.| last7 =Rohner| first7 =U.| last8 =Gonin| first8 =M.| last9 =Fuhrer| first9 =K.| title =A high-resolution mass spectrometer to measure atmospheric ion composition| journal =Atmospheric Measurement Techniques| volume =3| pages =1039| year =2010| doi =10.5194/amt-3-1039-2010| last10 =Kulmala| first10 =M.| last11 =Worsnop| first11 =D. R.| issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kendrick mass defect==
The Kendrick [[mass defect (mass spectrometry)|mass defect]] is defined as the [[exact mass|exact]] Kendrick mass subtracted from the [[Nominal mass|nominal]] (integer) Kendrick mass:&lt;ref name="pmid11605846"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Hughey CA, Hendrickson CL, Rodgers RP, Marshall AG, Qian K |title=Kendrick mass defect spectrum: a compact visual analysis for ultrahigh-resolution broadband mass spectra |journal=[[Anal. Chem.]] |volume=73 |issue=19 |pages=4676–81 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11605846 |doi= 10.1021/ac010560w|url= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall2008"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Marshall |first1=A. G. |last2=Rodgers |first2=R. P. |title=Mass Spectrometry Special Feature: Petroleomics: Chemistry of the underworld |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |pages=18090–5 |year=2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0805069105 |postscript=.|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10518090M |issue=47 |pmid=18836082 |pmc=2587575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass~defect}= \textrm{nominal~Kendrick~mass} - \textrm{Kendrick~mass}&lt;/math&gt;

In recent years the equation has changed due to rounding errors to:

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass~defect}= \textrm{nominal~mass} - \textrm{Kendrick~exact~mass}&lt;/math&gt;

The members of an [[alkylation]] series have the same [[degree of unsaturation]] and number of heteroatoms ([[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]]) but differ in the number of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units. Members of an alkylation series have the same Kendrick mass defect.

The Kendrick mass defect has also been defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass~defect}= (\textrm{nominal~Kendrick~mass} - \textrm{Kendrick~mass}) \times 1{,}000&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Panda|first1=Saroj K.|last2=Andersson|first2=Jan T.|last3=Schrader|first3=Wolfgang|title=Mass-spectrometric analysis of complex volatile and nonvolatile crude oil components: a challenge|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume=389|issue=5|pages=1329|year=2007|pmid=17885749|doi=10.1007/s00216-007-1583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviations ''KM'' and ''KMD'' have been used for Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Reemtsma|first1=Thorsten|title=Determination of molecular formulas of natural organic matter molecules by (ultra-) high-resolution mass spectrometry Status and needs|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=1216|issue=18|pages=3687–3701|year=2009|pmid=19264312|doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2009.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kendrick mass analysis==
[[File:Kendrick plot.gif|thumb|right|300 px|Plot of Kendrick mass defect as function of Kendrick mass; horizontal lines indicate common repeat units. Each dot in the plot corresponds to a peak measured in a mass spectrum.]]

In a Kendrick mass analysis, the Kendrick mass defect is plotted as function of nominal Kendrick mass for ions observed in a mass spectrum.&lt;ref name="Headley 2009" /&gt; Ions of the same family, for example the members of an alkylation series, have the same Kendrick mass defect but different nominal Kendrick mass and are positioned along a horizontal line on the plot. If the composition of one ion in the family can be determined, the composition of the other ions can be inferred. Horizontal lines of different Kendrick mass defect correspond to ions of different composition, for example degree of saturation or heteroatom content.

A Kendrick mass analysis is often used in conjunction with a [[Van Krevelen diagram]], a two- or three- dimensional graphical analysis in which the elemental composition of the compounds are  plotted according to the atomic ratios H/C, O/C, or N/C.&lt;ref name="Reemtsma 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Wu|first1=Zhigang|last2=Rodgers|first2=Ryan P.|last3=Marshall|first3=Alan G.|title=Two- and Three-Dimensional van Krevelen Diagrams:  A Graphical Analysis Complementary to the Kendrick Mass Plot for Sorting Elemental Compositions of Complex Organic Mixtures Based on Ultrahigh-Resolution Broadband Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Measurements|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=76|issue=9|pages=2511–6|year=2004|pmid=15117191|doi=10.1021/ac0355449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Kendrick mass defect analysis can be carried out by substituting any repeating unit for CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  KMD analysis is particularly useful for the visualizing the data from polymer mass spectra.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Hiroaki|last2=Nakamura|first2=Sayaka|last3=Teramoto|first3=Kanae|last4=Sato|first4=Takafumi|date=2014-08-01|title=Structural Characterization of Polymers by MALDI Spiral-TOF Mass Spectrometry Combined with Kendrick Mass Defect Analysis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry|language=en|volume=25|issue=8|pages=1346–1355|doi=10.1007/s13361-014-0915-y|pmid=24845357|issn=1044-0305|bibcode=2014JASMS..25.1346S|pmc=4105590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouquet|first=Thierry|last2=Nakamura|first2=Sayaka|last3=Sato|first3=Hiroaki|date=2016-04-15|title=MALDI SpiralTOF high-resolution mass spectrometry and Kendrick mass defect analysis applied to the characterization of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) copolymers|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|language=en|volume=30|issue=7|pages=973–981|doi=10.1002/rcm.7525|pmid=26969940|pmc=4787217|issn=1097-0231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a Kendrick mass defect plot of an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer can be created by using ethylene oxide (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O) as the base unit and calculating the Kendrick mass as:

&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Kendrick~mass} = \textrm{IUPAC~mass} \times \frac{44.00000}{44.02621} &lt;/math&gt;

where 44.02621 is the calculated IUPAC mass for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Alternatively, a KMD plot can be constructed for the same copolymer by using propylene oxide as the base unit.

Polymer mass spectra containing multiple charge ions exhibit isotopic splitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=Robert B.|last2=Fouquet|first2=Thierry|title=Paper spray and Kendrick mass defect analysis of block and random ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers|journal=Analytica Chimica Acta|volume=989|pages=38–44|doi=10.1016/j.aca.2017.08.005|pmid=28915941|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krist Anthony Novoselic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|v|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{lang-hr|'''Krist Novoselić'''}}; born May 16, 1965) is an [[Americans|American]] [[musician]] and [[Activism|political activist]], and was the [[bassist]] and founding member of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] alongside [[guitarist]] and [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] [[Kurt Cobain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvana.com/|title=Official Nirvana Website: Complete Discography, Videos and more|website=www.nirvana.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana|title=Nirvana {{!}} Music|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana achieved massive success, earning multiple gold and [[Platinum (award)|platinum awards]] and touring around the world at sold-out shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7518783/nirvana-nevermind-nine-chart-facts-anniversary|title=Nirvana's 'Nevermind': 9 Chart Facts About the Iconic Album|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nirvana disbanded following the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] in 1994, Novoselic formed [[Sweet 75]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/articles/sweet75.html|title=Life After Nirvana For Krist Novoselic - Page 1|last=tsunami@luini.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year and [[Eyes Adrift]] in 2002, releasing one album with each band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2009, he played in the [[punk rock]] band [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], and in 2011, he contributed bass and accordion to the song "[[Wasting Light|I Should Have Known]]" on the [[Foo Fighters]]' studio album ''[[Wasting Light]]'', along with playing [[bass guitar]] and [[accordion]] in his current band, Giants in the Trees since June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/giantsinthetrees/about/|title=Giants in the Trees Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/foo-fighters-375-1290502|title=Dave Grohl teams up with Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on new Foo Fighters album - NME|date=2010-10-27|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his musical endeavours, Novoselic has been active politically, including the creation of the [[political action committee]] JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/politics/career.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2010 he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'s'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|title=Reverb – "Krist Novoselic" Archives – Seattle Weekly|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006203927/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|archivedate=October 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 Novoselic has been board chair of the [[electoral reform]] organization [[FairVote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/tags/author_krist_novoselic|title=Author krist novoselic at FairVote|last=FairVote.org|website=FairVote|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krist Anthony Novoselic was born on May 16, 1965 to [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/krist-novoselic-ne-vjeruje-bushu/114008.aspx|title=Krist Novoselic ne vjeruje Bushu|publisher=index|work=index.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/showtime/glazba/24409/Nirvanin-basist-hrvatskog-porijekla-duboko-u-politici.html|title=Nirvanin basist hrvatskog porijekla duboko u politici|publisher=tportal|work=tportal.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/17042010/novaselici-nismo-ni-sanjali-da-ce-nam-sin-postati-rock-zvijezda|title=Novaselići: Nismo ni sanjali da će nam sin postati rock zvijezda!|publisher=[[Zadarski list]]|work=zadarskilist.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant parents, Kristo and Maria, in [[Compton, California]]. He lived there for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/audio/interviews/mp3/media/krist2.mp3 Interview with Krist Novoselic – Audio file]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humoropedia.com/krist-novoselic/|title=5 Unreal Facts About Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic You’D Never Believe|work=Humoropedia|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic has a younger brother Robert, born in 1968, and a younger sister, Diana, born in 1973. In 1979, his family relocated to [[Aberdeen, Washington]] as a result of surging real estate costs in California. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Younger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/younger.php|title=Novoselic Dedication Page|publisher=novoselic.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memories of listening to music was listening to [[Chuck Berry]] with his father. Growing up, he had a "severe" [[Malocclusion|underbite]], for which underwent corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kristnovoselicescalators.tumblr.com/post/142188663820/novoselic-91-i-had-started-reading-michael|title=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic — Novoselic ‘91 I had started reading Michael...|website=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pavitt commodore.jpg|thumb|Novoselic with Kathleen Hanna, Bruce Pavitt and Dylan Carlson, Paramount Theater, Seattle, October 31st, 1991]]
Novoselic was already interested in [[Hard rock|hard rock bands]] such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Who]], [[Van Halen]], [[Devo]] and [[Aerosmith]]. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Prljavo kazalište]] and [[Azra]]. While in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he picked up an interest in [[punk rock]], and discovered bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Ramones]] when he lived in Croatia at the age of 14 for one year.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/krist-novoselic/110291/biography|title=Krist Novoselic Biography – AOL Music|publisher=Music.aol.com|date=May 16, 1965|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalweb.com/nirvana2/101_random_facts.htm|title=101 Random Facts|website=www.goalweb.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[John Entwistle]], and [[Gene Simmons]] as the fundamental influences of his bass playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Krist Novoselic: My Favorite Bass Players (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080836/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|archivedate=August 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Novoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend [[Kurt Cobain]], who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to [[punk rock]]. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair ended up sharing similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band [[Melvins]]. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] and Kurt attended Montesano High School (Washington). At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his former band [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]], and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nirvana/biography|title=Nirvana Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Novoselic worked as a [[House painter and decorator|painter and decorator]] and was eventually laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wattpad.com/301062129-nirvana-facts-krist-novoselic|title=Nirvana FACTS - Krist Novoselic  - Wattpad|website=www.wattpad.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nirvana (1987–1994) ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
	 
Cobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] [[cover band]], in which Cobain played [[Drum kit|drums]] and Novoselic sang and played [[guitar]]. That band was short-lived as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You are: The Story of Nirvana|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|isbn=0-385-47199-8|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]]. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1987.php|title=Nirvana Live Guide - 1987|website=www.nirvanaguide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer [[Dale Crover]] filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met [[Chad Channing]]. The trio recorded their debut [[album]] ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subpop.com/releases/nirvana/bleach_deluxe_edition|title=Bleach: Deluxe Edition|last=Records|first=Sub Pop|website=Sub Pop Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and [[Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/surprising-drummer-reveals-missed-joining-nirvana-twice/|title=Surprising Drummer Reveals How He Missed Out On Joining Nirvana Twice|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-01-13|work=AlternativeNation.net|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/nirvana-chad-channing-no-regrets/|title=Chad Channing Recalls His Time in Nirvana Without Regrets|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic contributed to song writing of various songs, helping out Cobain, such as giving ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselic-on-kurts-writing-process-and-the-in-utero-aesthetic-20131003|title=Krist Novoselic on Kurt Cobain's Writing Process|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-scream-mn0001287850|title=The Scream {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were impressed by their drummer, [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/dave-grohls-first-band-scream-to-reissue-1988-album-no-more-censorship/|title=Dave Grohl’s first band, Scream, to reissue 1988 album No More Censorship|date=2018-03-29|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from [[San Francisco]], where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final [[drummer]]. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their ''Bleach'' Album. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardrock.com/rpm/nirvana-signs-to-a-major-or-how-kim-gordon-saved-the-world/|title=NIRVANA SIGNS TO A MAJOR (or how Kim Gordon saved the world)|work=Hard Rock presents Revolutions Per Minute|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] to record ''[[Nevermind]].'' Novoselic helped write the song "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]". Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/howling-in-the-abyss-the-improbable-success-of-nirvanas-nevermind/|title=Howling in the Abyss: The Improbable Success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind'|date=2016-09-23|work=Observer|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Nevermind]]'' had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/nirvana-debuted-smells-like-teen-spirit-22-years-ago-tonight-20130417|title=Watch Nirvana Debut 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Live in 1991|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, at the [[MTV Music Awards|MTV music awards show]], Nirvana would win awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician [[Brian May]] ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/10/nirvanas-eight-most-rock-n-roll-moments.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nirvana-181-1336070|title=Nirvana bassist reveals Brian May helped him after bass-throwing injury - NME|date=2008-11-20|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvanas-novoselic-relives-failed-1992-vma-bass-toss-20081120|title=Nirvana's Novoselic Relives Failed 1992 VMA Bass Toss|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a [[compilation album]] named ''[[Incesticide]]''. Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs "[[Dive (Nirvana song)|Dive]]", "[[Hairspray Queen]]", and "[[Incesticide|Aneurysm]]" on the album. This album was produced by a joint venture between [[DGC Records|DGC]] and [[Sub Pop|Sup Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/incesticide-19930121|title=Review: Nirvana's 'Incesticide' Delivers Emotional Honesty|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|Novoselic (left) playing bass alongside singer Cobain (right) in 1992.]]
During Nirvana's 1992 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading]] concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/songguide/bodyd9ac.html?songid=179|title=The Money Will Roll Right In|website=www.livenirvana.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic was an occasional [[vocalist]] and [[backing vocalist]] in Nirvana, occasionally singing "[[Scoff (song)|Scoff]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" at live shows. Novoselic stated that "I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/adrift/articles/guitar.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1993, Nirvana worked on their third album [[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']], it debuted at number one on the [[billboard 200]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nirvana/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177363|title=Nirvana In Utero Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recording sessions mixed by [[Steve Albini]] were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound perfect" as well as the Novoselic and the rest of the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". ''In Utero'' sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5b8c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Nirvana - In Utero|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/in-utero-19930916|title=In Utero|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Nirvana performed on [[MTV Unplugged]] with [[Lori Goldston]] playing [[cello]], the introduction of guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]],'' which earned a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|best alternative music performance.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-20110517|title=100 Best Albums of the '90s|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-album-anniversary/|title=23 Years Ago: 'Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York' Released|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/deep-10-nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-new-york|title=Deep 10: Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York|date=2016-11-03|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/krist-novoselic-kurt-cobain-clear-mind-wouldnt-have-killed-himself/|title=Krist Novoselic Discusses Kurt Cobain's Suicide|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, where the video for Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" was awarded for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1994/mtvvmas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 1994 MTV Video Music Awards|website=www.rockonthenet.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several songs, including "Exhausted", "[[Big Me]]", "[[February Stars]]", and "Butterflies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2013/09/09/220657501/dave-grohl-and-krist-novoselic-share-memories-unreleased-tracks-from-in-utero|title=Dave Grohl And Krist Novoselic Share Memories, Unreleased Tracks From 'In Utero'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived. The song "[[You Know You're Right]]" was the band's final studio recording. The band had split up following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Kurt's death]], with both members going their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/features/krist-novoselic-on-nirvanas-rise-traumatic-end-and-his-future-with-giants-in-the-trees/|title=Krist Novoselic On Nirvana's Rise, Traumatic End And His Future With Giants In The Trees — Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic and Grohl continued to support the Nirvana franchise. Novoselic worked on completing the ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' [[box set]] and ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]'' album, as well as pushing for release of a [[Nevermind|20th anniversary album for ''Nevermind'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/discography.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Nirvana (1995–present) ===
After Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band [[Sweet 75]] with Seattle musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single [[Sweet 75 (album)|self-titled album]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselics-ecelctic-new-sound-19970911|title=Krist Novoselic’s Ecelctic New Sound|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=1997-09-11|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/sweet75/info.html|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com -|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Novoselic joined singer [[Johnny Cash]], guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]] and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] to record a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", for the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-27/entertainment/ca-29172_1_willie-nelson |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Novoselic directed his first movie, ''[[L7 (band)|L7]]: [[The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum|The Beauty Process]]'', a [[pseudo-documentary]] that utilizes [[concert]] footage taped in 1997 in three American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://clatsopnews.com/2017/09/28/kris-novoselic/|title=Krist Novoselic: Famous Rock Star Lives Among Us - ClatsopNews|last=Publisher|first=ClatsopNews|date=2017-09-28|work=ClatsopNews|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/l7.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|title=L7: The Beauty Process|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213788/|others=Bryan Lee Brown, Suzi Gardner, Gail Greenwood|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he joined [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Soundgarden]] guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] in the [[No WTO Combo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/569932/correction-novoselic-biafra-were-in-no-wto-combo/|title=CORRECTION: Novoselic, Biafra Were In No-WTO Combo|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alternativetentacles.com/artists/no-wto-combo/|title=Alternative Tentacles Records|date=2018-01-19|work=Alternative Tentacles Records|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Krist Novoselic, 2007.jpg|thumb|Novoselic in 2007.]]
In 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background [[vocals]] on Foo Fighters' song "Walking a Line", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'' album sessions. The track is included on the ''One by One'' bonus [[DVD]], as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former [[Meat Puppets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeatpuppets.com/|title=Meat Puppets|website=www.themeatpuppets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; front man [[Curt Kirkwood]] and former [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] drummer [[Bud Gaugh]] to form [[Eyes Adrift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there was another group called "Eyes Adrift", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album "Bud, Curt &amp; Krist" in this nation. Eyes adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the [[Japan]]ese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], singing lead on "Inquiring Minds", "Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel" and "Pasted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-251464/|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-08-27|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a single named ''Alaska''.

Following the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in recent years, Novoselic has occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, "Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about."&lt;ref&gt;Jasmin, Earnest.

In 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]. In October 2010, [[Dave Grohl]], former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on [[BBC]] [[radio]], that Novoselic would be joining [[Foo Fighters]] as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/952506/foo-fighters-return-dave-grohl-recruits-krist-novoselic |title=Foo Fighters Return, Dave Grohl Recruits Krist Novoselic |work=Billboard  |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first experience with [[Foo Fighters]] was participating in the encore of their show on August 29, 1997 at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]] as part of the [[Bumbershoot]] [[festival]], where he played bass for the band's covers of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]" and "[[Communication Breakdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendersky|first=Ari|title=Semi-Nirvana Reunion at Bumbershoot|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 5, 1997|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/semi-nirvana-reunion-at-bumbershoot-19970905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Novoselic performed [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for a non-album track titled "Walking a Line", later released on a special edition of the band's album ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-secretive-musical-project-dave-grohl/|title=Nirvana Bassist Krist Novoselic Talks About Secretive Musical Project With Dave Grohl|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[encore]] of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in [[Tarzana, California]] on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist [[Pat Smear]] for a version of Nirvana's "[[Marigold (song)|Marigold]]" a 1992 Grohl original, which was a [[B-side]] on Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=Foo Fighters Secret Show Becomes Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/12/22/foo-fighters-secret-show-becomes-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion on the song "[[I Should Have Known (Foo Fighters song)|I Should Have Known]]", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album called ''[[Wasting Light]]'', released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=New Foo Fighters Album Will Be a Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/10/28/new-foo-fighters-album-will-be-a-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2017, Novoselic joined Foo Fighters on stage at [[Matthew Knight Arena]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], to play bass guitar on "[[Big Me]]", a song off Foo Fighters debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-surviving-nirvana-members-reunite-at-foo-fighters-show-w513601|title=See Surviving Nirvana Members Reunite at Foo Fighters Show|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months later, on October 6, 2018, Novoselic joined the band during an encore to play several Nirvana songs, with Dave Grohl on drums, Pat Smear on guitar, and Joan Jett filling in as their lead singer.

== Political and social activism ==
[[File:Krist Novoselic 15A.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Novoselic in 2008]]
Novoselic has had an interest in politics from high school. This included the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] conflict between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=garyalexw|title=Nirvana in Belfast - MTV News|date=2012-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyVYQvQPk|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nirvana/1992/kings-hall-belfast-northern-ireland-63d67e4f.html|title=Nirvana Setlist at King's Hall, Belfast|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state legislature attempted to pass a [[Bill (law)|bill]] called the Erotic Music Law. The [[law]] would allow courts to declare certain albums "erotic" by their content, and would make it illegal to sell those albums to those under the age of 18. A lobbying group called the Washington Music Industry Coalition formed as a response to the bill. Novoselic and Nirvana actively [[Campaigner|campaigned]] against the bill and performed a benefit concert for the [[Advocacy group|lobbying group]] in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/nirvana-bassist-turns-politician|title=Nirvana Bassist Turns Politician|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krist appeared on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] [[KOMO-TV]]{{'}}s "Town Meeting" in March 1992 arguing his points and expressing his views with two opposing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RareNirvana|title=Krist Novoselic on Komo TV's "Town Meeting" Show in 1992|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrog9H-Yd0|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Erotic Music Law was reintroduced to the [[Washington State Legislature]] as the Matters Harmful to Minors bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/senator-krist-19960208|title=Senator Krist: An Interview With Krist Novoselic|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the music industry had serious clout in Seattle given the success of the scene, Novoselic proposed creating a [[political action committee]], which was named JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/then-now-krist-novoselic-musician-1.608822|title=Then &amp; now Krist Novoselic, musician|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, JAMPAC fought a number of different issues, including the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]], a 1985 law that strictly limited the ability of minors to attend shows. With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/icons-of-rock-krist-novoselic/|title=Icons Of Rock: Krist Novoselic|date=2011-05-01|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic remains active in politics making appearances to advocate [[electoral reform]] (especially [[instant-runoff voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-ic.galegroup.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/ic/ovic/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Magazines&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA126653168&amp;mode=view|title=Krist Novoselic: Smells Like Governance|author=Katherine Turman|publisher=Opposing Viewpoints|date=January–February 2005|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[proportional representation]]) and running the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fixour.us/|title=Wahkiakum Democrats Precinct Caucus|publisher=Fixour.us|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered a 2004 run for [[Lieutenant governor|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]], challenging an incumbent of the same party, but ultimately decided against it. He also joined the board of [[FairVote]], then the Center for Voting and Democracy, and was appointed chair in January 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kornelis|first=Chris|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Smells Like a New Blogger: Krist Novoselic (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907194917/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|archivedate=September 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first book, ''[[Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy]]'', was published in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/books/chapters/of-grunge-and-government.html|title='Of Grunge and Government'|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/topic/of-grunge-and-government-let-s-fix-this-broken-democracy|title=Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers Novoselic's musical past, including Nirvana's rise to a worldwide phenomenon of the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-267813870.html|title= Recalling the spirit of '91 |work=The New Zealand Herald | date=September 24, 2011| publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers his interest in politics, his support of electoral reform, and his belief in the need to return to grassroots movements and clean up politics overall.

He supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |title=Barack Obama For President |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130232930/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php/ |title=Presidential Pick-A-Problem Primary |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102131705/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php |archivedate=November 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since broken with the Democratic Party, partly because "it's a top-down structure" adverse to reform from its grassroots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic?%20Run%20blog))|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, FairVote, Dumping the Dems, &amp;amp; Why the GOP Should Embrace Anarchy|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he made a donation to [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/krist-novoselic.asp?cycle=08|title=Krist Novoselic - $1,570 in Political Contributions for 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grange is not actually a political party. He was running in order to protest Washington state's system, in which a candidate can claim any party as their own (real or fictional) without consent or support from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times|url=http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/olympia/2009/jun/04/former-nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-running-wahkiakum-county-clerk/|title=The Spokesman Review, Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic running for Wahkiakum County clerk… .

[[File:KristNovoselicpodium.jpg|thumb|Novoselic giving a speech during his political career.]]
Novoselic continues to support political reform, even looking at [[social network]]s such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as major factors in shaping the political future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2013011568_novoselic27web.html|title=Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic sees political potential in social networks|author=Carla Meyer|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=September 27, 2010|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his support for [[Voting|fair voting]] reforms on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Washington Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/309013-5|title=Krist Novoselic on Electoral Reforms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Novoselic was asked how he described his [[Ideology|political views]], and he responded, "I'm an [[anarcho-capitalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], moderate... I don't know" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic (at 11:30)&lt;/ref&gt; On his [[Twitter]] page, he announced that he had voted for 2016 [[Libertarian]] [[presidential candidate]] [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KristNovoselic/status/594881482914562048|title=Krist Novoselić on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, he supported [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|his political campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic |first=Krist |url=http://kristnovoselic.blogspot.com/2015/08/real-election-reform-enters-2016.html |title=This Is Krist Novoselić: Real Election Reform Enters The 2016 Race |publisher=Kristnovoselic.blogspot.com |date=2015-08-12 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Phoenicopteriformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is incomprehensive, as the [[American flamingo]] has yet to be quantified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23813">The differences between '''additives for [[hydraulic fracturing]]'''  in different countries are the type of chemicals used (hazardous, non-hazardous), the disclosure of chemicals and the composition of fracturing fluid. In 2010, [[Halliburton]] announced the creation of food additive based hydraulic fracturing fluid in response to calls for transparency and demand for a "more environmentally friendly" unconventional hydrocarbon production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soraghan|first1=Mike|title=Halliburton Announces Ecofriendly Fracking Fluid, More Disclosure|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/11/15/15greenwire-halliburton-announces-ecofriendly-fracking-flu-80875.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=15 November 2010|quote=Halliburton Co., which is fighting U.S. EPA about disclosure of its hydraulic fracturing fluid, today announced that it will publicly disclose detailed information on its website about the chemicals used in its fracturing fluids. The Houston-based oilfield services company announced the creation of a new fracturing fluid that uses chemicals "sourced entirely from the food industry."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes all [[List of impact craters on Earth#All craters listed alphabetically|60 confirmed impact craters]] in [[North America]] in the [[Earth Impact Database]] (EID), plus the newly-discovered [[Hiawatha Glacier|Hiawatha crater]] in [[Greenland]] which is not yet in the EID. These features were caused by the collision of large [[meteorites]] or [[comets]] with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original [[rim (craters)|rim]] diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features.

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
{{main|List of unconfirmed impact craters on Earth}}
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4915">The '''President of the American Statistical Association''' is the head of the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA). According to the association's [[bylaws]], the president is an [[corporate title|officer]], and a member of the [[board of directors]] and of the [[executive committee]]. Elections for the position are held annually, in which all full members are eligible to vote. The term in office is typically three years, as [[President-Elect]] and [[Past President]] are also official positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16600">This is a list of some of the major unsolved problems, puzzles, or questions in economics. Some of these are theoretical in origin and some of them concern the inability of orthodox economic theory to explain an empirical observation.

==Capital Theory==
{{main|Capital (economics)}}
*'''[[Cambridge capital controversy]]''':The Cambridge capital controversy is a dispute in economics that started in the 1950s. The debate concerned the nature and role of capital goods and a critique of the neoclassical vision of aggregate production and distribution. The question of whether the natural growth rate is exogenous, or endogenous to demand (and whether it is input growth that causes output growth, or vice versa), lies at the heart of the debate. The resolution of the debate has not been agreed upon by economists.
*'''[[Transformation problem]]''':The transformation problem is the problem of finding a general rule by which to transform the values of commodities based on socially necessary labor time into the competitive prices of the marketplace.  The essential difficulty is how to reconcile profit in the form of surplus value from direct labour inputs and the ratio of direct labour input to capital input that vary widely between commodities, with the tendency toward an average rate of profit on all capital invested.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.A. (1971) "Understanding the Marxian Notion of Exploitation: A Summary of the So-Called Transformation Problem Between Marxian Values and Competitive Prices" Journal of Economic Literature 9 2 399–431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral economics==
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
*'''[[Revealed preference]]''': Does Revealed Preference theory truly reveal consumer preference when the consumer is able to afford all of the available options? For example, if a consumer is confronted with three goods and they can afford to purchase all three (A, B, and C) and they choose to first purchase A, then C, and then B - does this suggest that the consumer preference for the goods is A &gt; C &gt; B? The debate rests on the fact that since the consumer can afford all three goods and does not need to make a preferential decision, does the order of consumption reflect any preference?&lt;ref name=Morgenstern&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Oskar Morgenstern]]|year=1972|title=Thirteen critical points in contemporary economic theory|journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]]|volume=10|pages=1163&amp;ndash;1189|jstor=2721542}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Tâtonnement]]''': The act of tâtonnement plays a key role in the formulation of [[general equilibrium theory]]. The claim is that if an initial contract does not lead to an equilibrium, it is ended and new contracts are formulated. If the initial contract is not called off, it will likely lead to a different set of prices, depending on the degree of error in the original process. The question is whether successive re-contracting continues with the parties forgetting the previously planned positions taken or whether the parties engage in a form of tâtonnement to achieve optimality.&lt;ref name=Morgenstern /&gt; See also [[Hill climbing]] and [[Walrasian auction]].
*'''Unified models of human biases''': Neoclassical economics has concentrated on the development of models that reflect an idealized economic agent, sometimes referred to as [[Homo economicus]], as a way of studying economics. In the period spanning the 1970s to the 1990s, research began to emerge that suggested that people were subject to cognitive biases such as the [[framing effect]], [[loss aversion]], the [[gambler's fallacy]], [[confirmation bias]], and many others. Further, these effects could produce anomalies such as [[herd behavior]] or [[momentum investing]] inconsistent with economic models that did not incorporate human psychological limitations.&lt;ref name=behavior&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Foundations of Behavioral and Experimental Economics: Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith | publisher =[[The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] | date = 17 December 2002 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/ecoadv02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some models have begun to include [[bounded rationality]] and [[risk aversion]], such as [[prospect theory]], there still remains to be seen a unified model that can make useful predictions that incorporates the entirety of cognitive biases and rational limitations in most humans.&lt;ref name=Machina&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Machina |  first = Mark | title = Choice under Uncertainty: Problems Solved and Unsolved | journal =[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–154 | year = 1987 | url = http://dss.ucsd.edu/~mmachina/papers/Machina_Problems_Paper.pdf | doi=10.1257/jep.1.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there even exists debate as to whether it is necessary to incorporate such psychological limitations into economic models. While some economists insist they are necessary to fully appreciate the complexity of the market, others still contend that a model that incorporates human biases is either unrealistic or question its usefulness arguing that a model that doesn't approximate agents as being perfectly rational, with the possibility of minimal exceptions, is unlikely to be successful.&lt;ref name=Machina /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Krugman | first = Paul | author-link = Paul Krugman | title = How Did Economists Get It So Wrong? | newspaper =[[The New York Times]] | date = 2 September 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial economics==
{{main|Financial economics}}
* '''[[Equity premium puzzle]]''': The equity premium puzzle is thought to be one of the most important outstanding questions in neoclassical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2005/09/new_research_on.html|title=Has Barro solved the equity premium puzzle?|work=[[New Economist]] weblog|date=2005-09-29|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is founded on the basis that over the last one hundred years or so the average real return to stocks in the US has been substantially higher than that of bonds. The puzzle lies in explaining the causes behind this equity premium. While there are a number of different theories regarding the puzzle, there still exists no definitive agreement on its cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=34|date=March 1996|pages=42&amp;ndash;71|title=The Equity Premium: It’s Still a Puzzle|author=Narayana R. Kocherlakota|author-link=Narayana R. Kocherlakota| url=http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/kdsalyer/LECTURES/Ecn200e/Kocherla.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Dividend puzzle]]''': The dividend puzzle is the empirically observed phenomenon that companies that pay [[dividend]]s tend to be rewarded by [[investor]]s with higher [[Valuation (finance)|valuations]]. At present, there is no explanation widely accepted by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Borges | first = Maria Rosa | title = Is The Dividend Puzzle Solved ? | date = July 2008 | url = http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~depeco/wp/wp382008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Prast | first = Henriette | title = Investor psychology: a behavioral explanation of six finance puzzles | date = March 2004 | url = http://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/Research%20Series%20Supervision%20no%2064_tcm47-146072.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bernheim | first = B. Douglas | title = Tax Policy and the Dividend Puzzle | journal =[[RAND Journal of Economics]] | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–476 | year = 1991 | doi=10.2307/2600982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]] suggests that the puzzle can (only) be explained by some combination of taxes, bankruptcy costs, market inefficiency (including that due to [[Behavioral economics|investor psychology]]), and [[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]].
*'''Improved [[Black–Scholes]] and [[binomial options pricing model]]s''': The Black–Scholes model and the more general binomial options pricing models are a collection of equations that seek to model and price [[Private equity|equity]] and [[call option]]s. While the models are widely used, they have many significant limitations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/4/29/Science-in-Finance-IX-In-defence-of-Black-Scholes-and-Merton&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among them are the model's inability to account for historical market movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Baggett | first = L. Scott | last2 = Thompson | first2 = James | last3 = Williams | first3 = Edward | last4 = Wojciechowski | first4 = William | title = Nobels for nonsense | journal =[[Journal of Post Keynesian Economics]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–18 |date=October 2006 | doi=10.2753/pke0160-3477290101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their frequent overpricing of options, with the overpricing increasing with the time to maturity.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hull | first = John | last2 = White | first2 = Alan | title = The Pricing of Options on Assets with Stochastic Volatilities | journal =[[Journal of Finance]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 281–300 |date=June 1987 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1987.tb02568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of a model that can properly account for the pricing of call options on an asset with [[stochastic volatility]] is considered an open problem in financial economics.
*'''Problems with the [[Option style|American option]]''': Is there a closed form for American [[Put option|put options]]? Is there a forward [[partial differential equation]] for the American Option in a [[local volatility]] model?

==International economics==
{{main|International economics}}
* '''[[Home bias in trade puzzle]]''': The home bias in trade puzzle is an empirical observation that even when factors such as economic size of trading partners and the distance between them are considered, trade between regions within a given country is substantially greater than trade between regions in different countries, even when there are no substantial legal barriers. There is currently no framework to explain this observation.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle&gt;{{Citation | last= Obstfeld  | first= Maurice |author1-link=Maurice Obstfeld| last2= Rogoff | first2= Kenneth|author2-link=Kenneth Rogoff| year= 2000| editor-last= Bernanke | editor-first= Ben | editor-link=Ben Bernanke| editor2-last= Rogoff | editor2-first= Kenneth | contribution= The Six Major Puzzles in International Macroeconomics: Is There a Common Cause? | title=NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2000 | volume = 15 | pages = 339–390 | publisher=[[The MIT Press]] | isbn = 0-262-02503-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Edmond|first = Chris|url = http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~cedmond/632/N8A.PDF|title = Note 8a from course 316–632 "International Monetary Economics"|type = Handout}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Equity home bias puzzle]]''': This puzzle concerns the observation that individuals and institutions in many countries only hold modest amounts of foreign equity, despite the ability for vast diversification of their portfolios in the global economy.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle /&gt; While some explanations do exist, such as that local individuals and firms have greater access to information about local firms and economic conditions, these explanations are not accepted by the majority of economists and have been mostly refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Nieuwerburgh |first=Stijn |authorlink= |author2=Veldkamp, Laura  |date=July 2005 |title=Information Immobility and the Home Bias Puzzle |journal=NYU Working Paper |volume=FIN-04-026 |issue= |pages= |id=ssrn 1294476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Backus–Kehoe–Kydland puzzle]]''': The Backus–Kehoe–Kydland consumption correlation puzzle is the empirical observation that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle /&gt; Standard economic theory suggests that country-specific output risks should be collective and domestic consumption growth should not depend strongly on country-specific income shocks. Thus, we should not see the observation that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output; and yet we do.&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1992"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Kehoe | first2 = Patrick J.| last3 = Kydland | first3 = Finn E. |author3-link=Finn Kydland| year=1992 |title= International Real Business Cycles | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 100 | pages = 745–775 | doi = 10.1086/261838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1995"&gt;{{Citation | last= Backus  | first= David K.  | last2= Kehoe  | first2= Patrick J.  | last3= Kydland  | first3= Finn E.  | year= 1995  | editor-last= Cooley  | editor-first= Tom  | contribution= International Business Cycles: Theory and Evidence  | title=Frontiers of Business Cycle Research | publisher= [[Princeton University Press]]  | isbn = 0-691-04323-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Feldstein–Horioka puzzle]]''': The Feldstein-Horioka puzzle originates from an article in the 1980s that found that among [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries, averages of long-term national savings rates are highly correlated with similar averages of domestic investment rates. Standard economic theory suggests that in relatively open international financial markets, the savings of any country would flow to countries with the most productive investment opportunities; hence, saving rates and domestic investment rates would be uncorrelated, contrary to the empirical evidence suggested by [[Martin Feldstein]] and [[Charles Horioka]]. While numerous articles regarding the puzzle have been published, none of the explanations put forth have adequate empirical support.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;
*'''PPP Puzzle''': The PPP puzzle, considered one of the two [[real exchange rate puzzles]], concerns the observation that [[real exchange rate]]s are both more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] and more persistent than most models would suggest. The only clear way to understand this volatility would be to assign substantial roles to monetary and financial [[Shock (economics)|shocks]]. However, if shocks play such a large role the challenge becomes finding what source, if one even exists, of [[nominal rigidity]] that could be so persistent to explain the long-term prolonged nature of real exchange rate deviations.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;
*'''The exchange rate disconnect puzzle''': The exchange rate disconnect puzzle, also one of the so-called real exchange rate puzzles, concerns the weak short-term feedback link between exchange rates and the rest of the economy. In most economies, the exchange rate is the most important relative price, so it is surprising, and thus far unexplained entirely, that the correlations are not stronger.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;

The '''Mediterranean monk seal''' (''Monachus monachus'') is a [[monk seal]] belonging to the family [[Phocidae]]. {{As of|2015}}, it is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals survive in three or four isolated subpopulations in the Mediterranean, (especially) in the [[Aegean Sea]], the archipelago of [[Madeira]] and the [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cabo Blanco]] area in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=Karamanlidis2016&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karamanlidis, A.A. | date = April 2016 | title = The Mediterranean monk seal ''Monachus monachus'': status, biology, threats, and conservation priorities | journal = Mammal Review | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 92–105 | doi = 10.1111/mam.12053|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be the world's rarest pinniped species.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Description==
This species of [[Pinniped|seal]] grows from approximately {{convert|80|cm|ft}} long at birth up to an average of {{convert|2.4|m|ft}} as adults. Males weigh an average of {{convert|320|kg|lb}} and females weigh {{convert|300|kg|lb}}, with overall weight ranging from {{convert|240|-|400|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gr/displayITM1.asp?ITMID=30 |title=MOm Website |publisher=Mom.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monachus-guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/medit1903.htm |title=Mediterranean Monk Seal Fact Files: Biology: External appearance and anatomy |publisher=Monachus-guardian.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/mediterraneanmonkseal.htm |title=Mediterranean Monk Seal (''Monachus monachus'') - Office of Protected Resources - NOAA Fisheries |publisher=Nmfs.noaa.gov |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to live up to 45 years old;&lt;ref name=mom/&gt; the average life span is thought to be 20 to 25 years old and reproductive maturity is reached at around age four.

The monk seals' pups are about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long and weigh around {{convert|15|–|18|kg|lb}}, their skin being covered by 1–1.5 centimeter-long, dark brown to black hair. On their bellies, there is a white stripe, which differs in color and shape between the two sexes. In females the stripe is usually rectangular in shape whereas in males it is usually butterfly shaped.&lt;ref name="Funchal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-funchal.pt/ciencia/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=593:lobo-marinho&amp;catid=109:especie-do-mes&amp;Itemid=338|title=Lobo marinho|publisher=The City of [[Funchal]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hair is replaced after six to eight weeks by the usual short hair adults carry.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

Pregnant Mediterranean monk seals typically use inaccessible undersea caves while giving birth, though historical descriptions show they used open beaches until the 18th century. There are eight pairs of teeth in both jaws.

Believed to have the shortest hair of any pinniped, the Mediterranean monk seal fur is black (males) or brown to dark grey (females), with a paler belly, which is close to white in males. The snout is short broad and flat, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upward, unlike their [[Hawaiian monk seal|Hawaiian relative]], which tend to have more forward nostrils. The flippers are relatively short, with small slender claws. Monk seals have two pairs of retractable abdominal teats, unlike most other pinnipeds.

===Reproduction===
[[File:Colonia de focas monje de Cabo Blanco (1945).jpg|thumb|160px|right|A colony on [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cabo Blanco]] in 1945]]

Very little is known of this seal's reproduction. Scientists have suggested that they are [[polygyny|polygynous]], with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or [[storm surge]], which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cabo Blanco]] colony. According to the IUCN species factsheet, "pup survival is low; just under 50% survive their first two months to the onset of their moult, and most mortalities occurred in the first two weeks. Survival of pups born from September to January is 29%. This very low survival rate is associated with mortality caused by severe storms, and high swells and tides, but impoverished genetic variability and inbreeding may also be involved. Pups born during the rest of the year had a survival rate of 71%".

In 2008, lactation was reported in an open beach, the first such record since 1945, which could suggest the seal could begin feeling increasingly safe to return to open beaches for breeding purposes in Cabo Blanco.&lt;ref name=monachus-guardian2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monachus-guardian.org/mguard22/2215mednew.htm#MauritaniaWestern%20Sahara |title=Mediterranean Monk Seal News II - Monachus Guardian 11 (2): November 2008 |publisher=Monachus-guardian.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed for an average of nine hours.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Diet==
Mediterranean monk seals are [[diurnality|diurnal]] and feed on a variety of [[fish]] and [[mollusk]]s, primarily [[octopus]], [[squid]], and [[eel]]s, up to 3&amp;nbsp;kg per day. They are known to forage at depths up to 250 meters, with an average depth varying between specimens.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Monk seals prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey.

==Habitat==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The habitat of this pinniped has changed over the years. In ancient times, and up until the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. In more recent times, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for these activities. Often these caves are inaccessible to humans. Often their caves have underwater entries and their caves are often positioned along remote or rugged coastlines.

Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.

==Status==
This [[earless seal]]'s former range extended throughout the Northwest Atlantic Africa, Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]], coastlines, including all offshore islands of the Mediterranean, and into the [[Atlantic]] and its islands: [[Canary Islands|Canary]], [[Madeira]], [[Ilhas Desertas]], [[Porto Santo]]... as far west as the [[Azores]]. [[Vagrancy (biology)|Vagrants]] could be found as far south as [[Gambia]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands, and as far north as continental Portugal and Atlantic France.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

Several causes provoked a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, who used to consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

Nowadays, its entire population is estimated to be less than 700 individuals widely scattered, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the [[Aegean Sea]] (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in [[Gyaros]] island,&lt;ref name=Karamanlidis2016/&gt; and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is in the Atlantic Ocean, in the [[Western Sahara]]n portion of [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cabo Blanco]] (around 270 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the [[Desertas Islands]] – approximately 30-40 individuals&lt;ref name="EFEverde"/&gt;). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in [[Cintra Bay]].&lt;ref name=FootPrintBook&gt;{{

These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

Other remaining populations are in [[Antalya Province|southwestern Turkey]] and the [[Ionian Sea]] (both in the eastern Mediterranean). The species status is virtually moribund in the western Mediterranean, which still holds tiny [[Morocco|Moroccan]] and [[Algeria]]n populations, associated with rare sightings of vagrants in the [[Balearic Islands]],&lt;ref name=monachus-guardian3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monachus-guardian.org/news/news080620.htm |title=TMG Latest News: 20 June 2008 |publisher=Monachus-guardian.org |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sardinia]], and other western Mediterranean locations, including Gibraltar.

In [[Sardinia]] the Mediterranean monk seal was last sighted in May 2007 and April 2010. The increase of sightings in Sardinia suggests that the seal occasionally inhabits the Central Eastern Sardinian coasts, preserved since 1998 by the [[Gennargentu National Park|National Park of Golfo of Orosei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoblog.it/post/3403/sardegna-rispunta-la-foca-monaca|title=Sardegna: rispunta la foca monaca|author=Matteo Razzanelli|date=8 May 2007|work=Ecoblog.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrostudinatura.it/news/default.asp?id=119|title=Riavvistata la foca monaca in Sardegna|work=centrostudinatura.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gruppodinterventogiuridico.blog.tiscali.it/2010/04/17/torna-la-foca-monaca-e-forse-non-e-mai-andata-via/|title=Gruppo d'Intervento Giuridico o.n.l.u.s.|work=tiscali.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonies on the [[Pelagie Islands]] ([[Linosa]] and [[Lampedusa]]) were destroyed by fishermen, which likely resulted in local extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monachus-guardian.org/mguard14/1415mednew.htm A brief survey of Linosa island]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Cabo Blanco 1997 die off and recovery===
Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In the summer of 1997, more than 200 animals&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; or two-thirds of its seal population were wiped out within two months, extremely compromising the species' [[viable population]]. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided between a [[Phocine distemper virus|morbilivirus]] or, more likely, a [[Red tide|toxic algae bloom]],&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; the mass die-off emphasized the precarious status of a species already regarded as critically endangered throughout its range.

Numbers in this all-important location started a slow-paced recovery ever since. A small but incipient (up to 20 animals by 2009) sub-population in the area had started using open beaches. In 2009, for the first time in centuries, a female delivered her pup on the beach (open beaches is the optimal habitat for the survival of pups, but had been abandoned due to human disturbance and persecution in past centuries).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/iyb/doc/celebrations/iyb-spain-monksealatlantic-successstory.pdf The recovery of the Mediterranean monk seal in the Atlantic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only by 2016 the colony had recovered to its previous population (about 300 animals). This was made possible by a recovery plan financed by Spain.&lt;ref name="EFEverde"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.efeverde.com/noticias/la-colonia-de-focas-monje-de-mauritania-se-triplicado-desde-su-crisis-de-1997/ | work=EFE Verde | first=Eloy | last=Vera | title=La colonia de focas monje de Mauritania se ha triplicado desde su crisis de 1997| date=22 December 2016| language=es| accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, a new record of births was set for the colony (83 pups).&lt;ref name="EFEverde"/&gt;

However, the threat of a similar incident, which could severely reduce or wipe out the entire population, remains.&lt;ref name=monachus-guardian4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/medit01.htm |title=Mediterranean Monk Seal Fact Files: Overview |publisher=Monachus-guardian.org |date=1978-05-05 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2010, fishermen spotted an injured Mediterranean monk seal off the coasts of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. When zoo veterinarians arrived to help the seal, it had slipped back into the waters. Members of the Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center arrived at the scene and tried to locate the injured mammal, but with no success. This was the first sighting of the species in the region since Lebanese authorities claimed to have found a population of 10–20 other seals on their coasts 70 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rinat |first=Zafrir |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1141303.html |title=Critically endangered seal spotted off Israel coast - Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the seal was also sighted a couple of weeks later in the northern kibbutz of Rosh Hanikra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=צפריר רינת 20.01.2010 18:11 עודכן ב: 18:17 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1143950.html |title=כלב ים נזירי - מין נדיר ביותר - נצפה שוב בחופי ישראל, הפעם בנהריה - מדע וסביבה - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact location was not communicated so as to keep the site protected. The society was appealing to the Greek government to integrate the part of the island on which the seals live into a [[marine protected area]].

On 8 March 2011, the BBC Earth news &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9416000/9416895.stm | work=BBC News | first=Victoria | last=Gill | title=Rare baby seal rescued in Greece | date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that a pup seal had been spotted on 7 February while monitoring a seal colony on an island in the southwestern Aegean Sea. Soon after, it showed signs of weakness and it was taken to a rehabilitation centre to try to save it. The aim is to release it back into the wild as soon as it is strong enough.

In November 2014, an adult monk seal was reportedly seen inside the port of [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]]. A female monk seal, called Argiro by the locals, was repeatedly seen on beaches of [[Samos]] island in 2014 and 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoosos.gr/etiketa/fokia-arguro-samos/#axzz3vnlOenMu|title=SNews regarding seal Argiro|work=zoosos.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two were reported in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/04/26/monk-seals-spotted-in-paphos-sea/ Monk seals spotted in Paphos sea]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2015, a large floating "fish" was reported near Raouche, [[Beirut]] in [[Lebanon]], and collected by a local fisherman. This turned out to be the body of a female monk seal known to have been resident there for some time. Further investigations revealed that she was pregnant with a pup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonfiles.com/news/866922|title=بعد قتل زوجته وابنته "راهب" الدالية وحيداً|work=lebanonfiles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2016, a monk seal was spotted and photographed by a group of foreign exchange students and local bio-engineers in a creek in [[Manavgat|Manavgat District]] in [[Turkey]]'s southern [[Antalya Province]]. According to the scientists involved in local projects to protect the animals, this was the first ever documented sighting of a monk seal swimming in a river. Possible reasons for the animal's appearance included better opportunities for hunting, as well as higher salinity levels due to lower water levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/rare-monk-seal-spotted-by-students-in-antalya-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=97623&amp;NewsCatID=341 Rare monk seal spotted by students in Antalya (Hurriyet Daily News, April 11, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2017, a specimen was spotted and photographed by a group of fishermen off the coasts of [[Tricase]] in the south of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diregiovani.it/2017/06/13/116892-foca-monaca-nel-salento-video.dg/ Monk seal spotted off Tricase, Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
[[Image:Phoque moine.JPG|thumb|A seal swims at [[Ras Nouadhibou]]]]
Damage inflicted on fishermen's nets and rare attacks on off-shore fish farms in [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] are known to have pushed local people towards hunting the Mediterranean monk seal, but mostly out of revenge, rather than population control. Preservation efforts have been put forth by civil organizations, foundations, and universities in both countries since as early as the 1970s. For the past 10 years{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, many groups have carried out missions to educate locals on damage control and species preservation. Reports of positive results of such efforts exist throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/monk_seal_project/index.cfm |title=WWF - Mediterranean monk seal project |publisher=Panda.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007030921/http://panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/monk_seal_project/index.cfm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Aegean Sea]], Greece has allocated a large area for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek [[Alonissos Marine Park]], that extends around the Northern [[Sporades]] islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gr |title=MOm Website |publisher=Mom.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.

The complex politics concerning the covert opposition of the Greek government towards the protection to the monk seals in the eastern Aegean in the late 1970s is described in a book by William Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monk Seal Conspiracy|first=William|last=Johnson|isbn=0-946097-23-2|date=1988-03-31|publisher=Heretic Books|url=http://www.iridescent-publishing.com/msccont.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil companies apparently may have been using the monk seal sanctuary project as a [[stalking horse]] to encourage greater cooperation between the Greek and Turkish governments as a preliminary to pushing for oil extraction rights in a geopolitically unstable area. According to Johnson, the Greek secret service, the YPEA, were against such moves and sabotaged the project to the detriment of both the seals and conservationists, who, unaware of such covert motivations, sought only to protect the species and its habitat.

One of the largest groups among the foundations concentrating their efforts towards the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Turkish: ''Akdeniz Foklarını Araştırma Grubu'') operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Turkish: ''Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği'') in [[Turkey]] (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the [[Foça]] municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadafag.org/english/index.php SAD-AFAG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514094153/http://www.sadafag.org/english/index.php |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation of the species requires both the preservation of land and sea, due to the need for terrestrial [[hauling-out|haul-out]] sites and caves or caverns for the animal to rest and reproduce. Even though responsible [[scuba diving]] instructors hesitate to make trips to known seal caves, the rumor of a seal sighting quickly becomes a tourist attraction for many. Irresponsible scuba diving trips scare the seals away from caves which could become habitation for the species.

==Conservation==
Under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]], [[Mediterranean Monk Seal Memorandum of Understanding|the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Eastern Atlantic Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal]] was concluded and came into effect on 18 October 2007. The MoU covers four range States (Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal and Spain), all of which have signed, and aims at providing a legal and institutional framework for the implementation of the Action Plan for the Recovery of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in the Eastern Atlantic.

As there are indications of small population increases in the subpopulations, as of 2015, the Mediterranean monk seal's [[IUCN]] conservation status has been updated from [[critically endangered]] to [[endangered species|endangered]] in keeping with the IUCN's speed-of-decline criteria, with a recommendation for re-assessment in 2020.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The '''mountain tapir''' or '''woolly tapir''' (''Tapirus pinchaque'') is the second-smallest of the five [[species]] of [[tapir]], only the recently described ''[[Tapirus kabomani]]'' being smaller, and is the only one to live outside of [[tropical rainforest]]s in the wild.&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Perissodactyla | id = 14100042 | pages = 633–634}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most easily distinguished from other tapirs by its thick woolly coat and white lips.

The species name comes from the term ''"La Pinchaque"'', an imaginary beast said to inhabit the same regions as the mountain tapir.&lt;ref&gt;Downer, Craig C. [http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/iucn-ssc/tsg/action97/ap97-14.htm "Status and Action Plan of the Mountain Tapir ''(Tapirus pinchaque).''"] ''Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan'' published by the IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
 
Mountain tapirs are black or very dark brown, with occasional pale hairs flecked in amongst the darker fur. The fur becomes noticeably paler on the underside, around the anal region, and on the cheeks. A distinct white band runs around the lips, although it may vary in extent, and there are usually also white bands along the upper surface of the ears. In adults, the rump has paired patches of bare skin, which may help to indicate sexual maturity. The eyes are initially blue, but change to a pale brown as the animal ages.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010 | title = Tapirus pinchaque (Perissodactyla: Tapiridae) | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | url = https://academic.oup.com/mspecies/article-pdf/42/863/166/8269111/42-863-166.pdf | pages = 166–182 | doi = 10.1644/863.1 | last1 = Padilla | first1 = Miguel | last2 = Dowler | first2 = Robert C. | last3 = Downer | first3 = Craig C. | displayauthors = 1 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other species of tapir, the fur is long and woolly, especially on the underside and flanks, reaching {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} or more in some individuals.&lt;ref name=CITES&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorgensen, J.P.|editor=Dollinger, P.|year=1988|title= Identification manual.

Sheet A-118.002.001.003| publisher=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna |location= Lausanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Adults are usually around {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|0.75|to|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height at the shoulder. They typically weigh between {{convert|136|and|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and while the sexes are of similar size, females tend to be around {{convert|25|to|100|kg|lb}} heavier than the males.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADW&gt;[http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Tapirus_pinchaque/ Tapirus pinchaque], Animal Diversity Web&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arkive&gt;[http://www.arkive.org/mountain-tapir/tapirus-pinchaque/#text=Facts Mountain Tapir], Arkive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Perissodactyla/Tapirus_pinchaque.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other types of tapir, they have small, stubby tails and long, flexible [[proboscis]]es. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot, each with large nails and supported by a padded sole. A patch of bare skin, pale pink or grey in colour, extends just above each toe.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

==Reproduction==
Female mountain tapirs have a 30-day [[estrous]] cycle, and typically breed only once every other year. During courtship, the male chases the female and uses soft bites, grunts, and squeals to get her attention, while the female responds with frequent squealing. After a gestation period of 392 or 393 days, the female gives birth to a single young; multiple births are very rare.&lt;ref name=Bonney1979&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bonney, S.  |author2=Crotty, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1979 | title = Breeding the mountain tapir, Tapirus pinchaque, at the Los Angeles Zoo | journal = International Zoo Yearbook | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 198–200 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1090.1979.tb00563.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newborn mountain tapirs weigh about {{convert|5.4|to|6.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and have a brown coat with yellowish-white spots and stripes. Like adults, baby mountain tapirs have thick, woolly fur to help keep them warm. [[Weaning]] begins at around three months of age. The immature coloration fades after about a year, but the mother continues to care for her young for around 18 months. Mountain tapirs reach [[sexual maturity]] at age three and have lived up to 27 years in captivity.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[Image:Mountain Tapir3.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain tapir feeding]]
Tapirs are [[herbivore]]s, and eat a wide range of plants, including leaves, grasses, and [[bromeliad]]s. In the wild, particularly common foods include [[lupin]]s, ''[[Gynoxys]]'', [[fern]]s, and [[Gunnera|umbrella plant]]s. It also seeks out natural [[salt lick]]s to satisfy its need for essential [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

Mountain tapirs are also important [[seed disperser]]s within their environments, and have been identified as a [[keystone species]] of the high Andes. A relatively high proportion of plant seeds eaten by mountain tapirs successfully germinate in their [[Feces|dung]], probably due to a relatively inefficient digestive system and a tendency to defecate near water. Although a wide range of seeds are dispersed in this manner, those of the endangered [[Ceroxylon quindiuense|wax palm]] seem to rely almost exclusively on mountain tapirs for dispersal, and this plant, along with the [[Lupinus caucensis|highland lupine]], declines dramatically whenever the animal is extirpated from an area.&lt;ref name=Downer1996/&gt;

[[Predator]]s of mountain tapirs include [[cougar]]s, [[spectacled bear]]s, and, less commonly, [[jaguar]]s.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

==Behaviour==
When around other members of their species, mountain tapirs communicate through high-pitched whistles, and the males occasionally fight over [[estrous]] females by trying to bite each other’s rear legs. But for the most part, mountain tapirs are shy and lead solitary lives, spending their waking hours foraging for food on their own along well-worn tapir paths.&lt;ref&gt;Goudot, Justin. "Nouvelles observations sur le Tapir Pinchaque (Recent Observations on the Tapir Pinchaque)," ''Comptes Rendus,'' Paris 1843, vol. xvi, pages 331-334. Available [http://www.tapirback.com/reprints/goudot1.htm online] with English translation by Tracy Metz.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their bulk, they travel easily through dense foliage, up the steep slopes of their hilly [[habitat]]s, and in water, where they often wallow and swim.

Mountain tapirs are generally [[crepuscular]], although they are more active during the day than other species of tapirs. They sleep from roughly midnight to dawn, with an additional resting period during the hottest time of the day for a few hours after noon, and prefer to bed down in areas with heavy vegetation cover.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt; Mountain tapirs forage for tender plants to eat. When trying to access high plants, they will sometimes rear up on their hind legs to reach and then grab with their [[prehensile]] snouts. Though their eyesight is lacking, they get by on their keen senses of smell and taste, as well as the sensitive bristles on their proboscises.&lt;ref name=Downer1997&gt;{{cite book|author=Downer, Craig C.|editor=Brooks, D.M.|year=1997|chapter= Status and action plan of the mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque)|title= Tapirs—status survey and conservation action plan |publisher= International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |location= Gland, Switzerland |pages= 10–22|url= http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/iucn-ssc/tsg/action97/ap97-14.htm|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males will frequently mark their territory with dung piles, [[urine]], and rubbings on trees, and females will sometimes engage in these behaviors, as well. The territories of individuals usually overlap, with each animal claiming over {{convert|800|ha|sqmi}}, and females tend to have larger territories than males.&lt;ref name=Downer1996/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The mountain tapir is found in the [[cloud forest]]s and ''[[páramo]]'' of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern]] and [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Central Cordilleras]] mountains in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and the far north of [[Peru]]. Its range may once have extended as far as western [[Venezuela]], but it has long been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from that region. It commonly lives at [[elevation]]s between {{convert|2000|and|4300|m|ft}}, and since at this altitude temperatures routinely fall below freezing, the animal’s woolly coat is essential. During the [[wet season]], mountain tapirs tend to inhabit the forests of the Andes, while during the drier months, they move to the ''páramo'', where fewer biting [[insect]]s pester them.&lt;ref name=Downer1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Downer, Craig C. | year = 1996 | title = The mountain tapir, endangered "flagship" species of the high Andes | journal = Oryx | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=4948340 | pages = 45–58 | doi = 10.1017/S0030605300021384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain tapir has no recognised subspecies.

In Peru, it is protected in the National Sanctuary Tabaconas Namballe. The species needs continuous stretches of cloud forest and ''páramo'', rather than isolated patches, to successfully breed and maintain a healthy population, and this obstacle is a major concern for [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s trying to protect the [[endangered]] animal.

==Evolution==
The mountain tapir is the least specialised of the living species of tapir, and has changed the least since the origin of the genus in the early [[Miocene]]. Genetic studies have shown that mountain tapirs diverged from its closest relative, the [[Brazilian tapir]], in the late [[Pliocene]], around three million years ago. This would have been shortly after the formation of the [[Panamanian Isthmus]], allowing the ancestors of the two living species to migrate southward from their respective points of origin in Central America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]. However, the modern species most likely originated in the Andes, some time after this early migration.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

==Vulnerability==
[[Image:Two Tapirus pinchaque.jpg|Two mountain tapirs in San Francisco Zoo|thumb|240px]]
The mountain tapir is the most threatened of the five ''Tapirus'' species, classified as "Endangered" by the [[IUCN]] in 1996. According to the IUCN, there was a 20% chance the species could have been [[extinct]] as early as 2014. Due to the fragmentation of its surviving range, populations may already have fallen below the level required to sustain genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=Downer1996/&gt;

Historically, mountain tapirs have been hunted for their meat and hides, while the toes, proboscises, and intestines are used in local [[folk medicine]]s and as [[aphrodisiac]]s. Since they will eat crops when available, they are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their produce. Today, [[deforestation]] for [[agriculture]] and mining, and [[poaching]] are the main threats to the species.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010/&gt;

There may be only 2,500 individuals left in the wild today, making it all the more difficult for scientists to study them. Also, very few individuals are found in zoos. Only a handful of breeding pairs of this species exists in captivity in the world — at the [[Los Angeles Zoo]], the [[Cheyenne Mountain Zoo]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and, as of 2006, the [[San Francisco Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lazoo.org/template4.html Eye on Conservation: Tale of the Tapir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113101942/http://www.lazoo.org/template4.html |date=2007-01-13 }} from the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmzoo.org/mountaintapir.html Mountain Tapir Conservation at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035144/http://www.cmzoo.org/mountaintapir.html |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfzoo.org/podcasts/bts_12_20_06.html Podcast from the San Francisco Zoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712175231/http://www.sfzoo.org/podcasts/bts_12_20_06.html |date=2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, a mating pair is kept in Langley, BC, at the [http://www.mtnviewconservation.org/?page_id=130 Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre]. The nine individuals in captivity are descendants of just two founder animals. This represents a distinct lack of [[genetic diversity]] and may not bode well for their continued existence in captivity. The three zoos that house this species are working to ensure that the remaining wild populations of mountain tapirs are protected. Two mountain tapirs were sent from San Francisco Zoo to [[Cali Zoo]], making them be the only captive tapirs in their natural home range; also, one male is kept in Pitalito, Huila, and it is possible to move it to the Cali Zoo to make a breeding pair.

 [[microscope]]. The illumination is from above, leading to a dark central region.]]
[[File:Newton's rings 02.svg|thumb|The experimental setup: a [[convex lens]] is placed on top of a flat surface.]]
'''Newton's rings''' is a phenomenon in which an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern is created by the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of [[light]] between two surfaces—a [[sphere|spherical]] surface and an adjacent touching flat surface. It is named for [[Isaac Newton]], who first studied the effect in 1717. When viewed with [[monochrome|monochromatic light]], Newton's rings appear as a series of concentric, alternating bright and dark rings centered at the point of contact between the two surfaces. When viewed with white light, it forms a concentric ring pattern of rainbow colors, because the different [[wavelength]]s of light interfere at different thicknesses of the air layer between the surfaces.

==Phenomenon==
The phenomenon was first described by [[Robert Hooke]] in his 1664 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', although its name derives from the physicist Isaac Newton, who was the first to analyze it.

==Theory==
[[Image:Optical flat interference.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Closeup of a section of the top glass on the optical flat, showing how interference fringes form. At positions where the path length difference is equal to an odd multiple of a half-wavelength ''(a)'', the reflected waves reinforce, resulting in a bright spot.  At positions where the path length difference is equal to an even multiple of a half-wavelength ''(b)'', the reflected waves cancel, resulting in a dark spot. This results in a pattern of concentric bright and dark rings, interference fringes.]]  
[[File:Newton rings.jpg|thumb|Newton's rings seen in two [[plano-convex lens]]es with their flat surfaces in contact.  One surface is slightly convex, creating the rings.  In white light, the rings are rainbow-colored, because the different wavelengths of each color interfere at different locations.]]

The pattern is created by placing a very slightly [[convex lens|convex]] curved glass on an [[optical flat]] glass.  The two pieces of glass make contact only at the center, at other points there is a slight air gap between the two surfaces, increasing with radial distance from the center.  The diagram at right shows a small section of the two pieces, with the gap increasing right to left.   Light from a [[monochromatic]] (single color) source shines through the top piece and reflects from both the bottom surface of the top piece and the top surface of the optical flat, and the two reflected rays combine and [[Superposition principle|superpose]].  However the ray reflecting off the bottom surface travels a longer path.  The additional path length is equal to twice the gap between the surfaces.  In addition the ray reflecting off the bottom piece of glass undergoes a 180° phase reversal, while the [[internal reflection]] of the other ray from the underside of the top glass causes no phase reversal.   The brightness of the reflected light depends on the difference in the path length of the two rays:
*'''''Constructive interference (a)''''': In areas where the path length difference between the two rays is equal to an even multiple of half a [[wavelength]] (λ/2) of the light waves, the reflected waves will be [[in phase]], so the "troughs" and "peaks" of the waves coincide.  Therefore, the waves will reinforce (add) and the resulting reflected light intensity will be greater.  As a result, a bright area will be observed there.
*'''''Destructive interference (b)''''': At other locations, where the path length difference is equal to an odd multiple of a half-wavelength, the reflected waves will be 180° [[out of phase]], so a "trough" of one wave coincides with a "peak" of the other wave. Therefore, the waves will cancel (subtract) and the resulting light intensity will be weaker or zero.  As a result, a dark area will be observed there.  Because of the 180° phase reversal due to reflection of the bottom ray, the center where the two pieces touch is dark. 
This interference results in a pattern of bright and dark lines or bands called "''interference fringes''" being observed on the surface.   These are similar to [[contour line]]s on maps, revealing differences in the thickness of the air gap.  The gap between the surfaces is constant along a fringe.  The path length difference between two adjacent bright or dark fringes is one wavelength ''λ'' of the light, so the difference in the gap between the surfaces is one-half wavelength.  Since the wavelength of light is so small, this technique can measure very small departures from flatness.  For example, the wavelength of red light is about 700&amp;nbsp;nm, so using red light the difference in height between two fringes is half that, or 350&amp;nbsp;nm, about 1/100 the diameter of a human hair.  Since the gap between the glasses increases radially from the center, the interference fringes form concentric rings.  For glass surfaces that are not spherical, the fringes will not be rings but will have other shapes.

For illumination from above, with a dark center, the radius of the ''N''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; bright ring is given by
:&lt;math&gt; r_N= \left[\lambda R \left(N - {1 \over 2}\right)\right]^{1/2}, &lt;/math&gt;
where 
''N'' is the bright-ring number, ''R'' is the [[radius of curvature]] of the glass lens the light is passing through, and ''&amp;lambda;'' is the wavelength of the light.

The above formula is also applicable for dark rings for the ring pattern obtained by transmitted light.

Consider light incident on the flat plane of the [[convex lens]] that is situated on the [[optically flat]] glass surface below. The light passes through the glass lens until it comes to the glass-air boundary, where the transmitted light goes from a higher refractive index (''n'') value to a lower ''n'' value. The transmitted light passes through this boundary with no phase change. The reflected light (about 4% of the total) also has no phase change.  The light that is transmitted into the air travels a distance, ''t'', before it is reflected at the flat surface below; reflection at the air-glass boundary causes a half-cycle phase shift because the air has a lower refractive index than the glass. The reflected light at the lower surface returns a distance of (again) ''t'' and passes back into the lens.  The two reflected rays will interfere according to the total phase change caused by the extra path length ''2t'' and by the half-cycle phase change induced in reflection at the lower surface. When the distance ''2t'' is less than a wavelength, the waves interfere destructively, hence the central region of the pattern is dark.

A similar analysis for illumination of the device from below instead of from above shows that in that case the central portion of the pattern is bright, not dark.  (Compare the given example pictures to see this difference.)

Given the radial distance of a bright ring, ''r'', and a radius of curvature of the lens, ''R'',  the air gap between the glass surfaces, ''t'', is given to a good approximation by

:&lt;math&gt;t = {r^2 \over 2R}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the effect of viewing the pattern at an angle oblique to the incident rays is ignored.

==Thin-film interference==
{{main|Thin-film interference}}
The phenomenon of Newton's rings is explained on the same basis as [[thin-film interference]], including effects such as "rainbows" seen in thin films of oil on water or in soap bubbles.  The difference is that here the "thin film" is a thin layer of air.

The '''nursing process''' is a modified [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009)Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 72, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackley, B. J., &amp; Ladwig, G. B. (2017). Nursing diagnosis handbook: An evidence-based guide to planning care (10 ed.). St. Louis: Mosby/Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing practise was first described as a four-stage nursing process by Ida Jean Orlando in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Marriner-Tomey &amp; Allgood (2006) Nursing Theorists and their work. p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[nursing theory|nursing theories]] or [[health informatics]]. The diagnosis phase was added later.

The nursing process uses clinical judgement to strike a balance of [[epistemology]] between personal interpretation and research evidence in which  [[critical thinking]] may play a part to categorize the clients issue and course of action. Nursing offers diverse patterns of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, P. (2009) Inspired knowing in nursing. p. 63 in Loscin &amp; Purnell (Eds) (2009) Contemporary Nursing Process.Springer Pub&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing knowledge has embraced pluralism since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, H (2010) The Nature of Theoretical Thinking in Nursing. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors refer to a [[mind map]] or [[Abductive|abductive reasoning]] as a potential alternative strategy for organizing care.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, J &amp; Lowenstein (2010) Innovative Teaching Strategies in Nursing and Related Health Professions.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] plays a part for experienced nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009) Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 222, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
[[File:Nursing process (NANDA).svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of the five-phase nursing process]]
The nursing process is goal-oriented method of caring that provides a framework to [[nursing care]]. It involves seven major steps:

*A
: [[Nursing assessment|Assess]] (what data is collected?)
*D
: [[Nursing diagnosis|Diagnose]] (what is the problem?)
*O
:  Outcome Identification - (Was originally a part of the Planning phase, but has recently been added as a new step in the complete process).
*P
: [[Nursing care plan|Plan]] (how to manage the problem)
*I
: Implement (putting plan into action)
*R
:Rationale (Scientific reason of the implementations)
*E
: Evaluate (did the plan work?)

According to some theorists, this seven-steps description of the nursing process is outdated and misrepresents nursing as linear and atomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com/Chapter+7+Practice+Methods|title=RogerianNursingScience - Chapter 7 Practice Methods|author=|date=|website=rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing assessment}}
The nurse completes an [[holistic]] [[nursing assessment]] of the needs of the individual/family/community, regardless of the reason for the encounter. The nurse collects [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[data]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] [[data]] using a nursing framework, such as Marjory  [[Gordon's functional health patterns]].

====Models for data collection====
Nursing assessments provide the starting point for determining nursing diagnoses. It is vital that a recognized nursing assessment framework is used in practice to identify the patient's* problems, risks and outcomes for enhancing health. The use of an evidence-based nursing framework such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern Assessment should guide assessments that support nurses in determination of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. For accurate determination of nursing diagnoses, a useful, evidence-based assessment framework is best practice.

=====Methods=====
*Client Interview
*Physical Examination
*Obtaining a health history (including dietary data)
*Family history/report
*

===Diagnosing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing diagnosis}}
[[Nursing diagnosis|Nursing diagnoses]] represent the nurse's clinical judgment about actual or potential health problems/life process occurring with the individual, family, group or community. The accuracy of the nursing diagnosis is validated when a nurse is able to clearly identify and link to the defining characteristics, related factors and/or risk factors found within the patients assessment. Multiple nursing diagnoses may be made for one client.

===Planning phase===
{{Main article|Nursing care plan}}
In agreement with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to use the [[evidence-based]] [[Nursing Outcomes Classification]] to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures.  The interventions used in the [[Nursing Interventions Classification]] again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a [[nursing care plan]].

===Implementing phase===
The nurse implements the [[nursing care plan]], performing the determined interventions that were selected to help meet the goals/outcomes that were established. Delegated tasks and the monitoring of them is included here as well.

'''Activities'''
* pre-assessment of the client-done before just carrying out implementation to determine if it is relevant
* determine need for assistance
* implementation of nursing orders
* delegating and supervising-determines who to carry out what action

===Evaluating phase===
The nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.

==Characteristics==
The nursing process is a '''cyclical''' and '''ongoing''' process that can end at any stage if the problem is solved. The nursing process exists for every problem that the individual/family/community has. The nursing process not only focuses on ways to improve physical needs, but also on social and emotional needs as well.

The entire process is recorded or documented in order to inform all members of the health care team.

==Variations and documentation==
{{see also|Nursing documentation}}
The '''PIE method''' is a system for documenting actions, especially in the field of [[nursing]].

The '''Natural History Museum of Oman''' is a [[natural history museum]], located at the Ministry of Heritage and Culture complex, Al Khuwair, opposite the [[Zawawi Mosque]] in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Oman]]. 

The museum opened on 20 December 1985, and has detailed coverage of Oman's [[flora and fauna]], with displays on indigenous [[mammal]]s, [[insects]], and [[birds]] and [[botanical garden]]s. One of the highlights of the museum is the whale hall: it houses the huge skeleton of a [[sperm whale]], which was washed up on the Omani coastline in the 1986.The museum contains marine and animal fossils and ancient mammals such as monkeys and elephants primitive, teeth [[Deinotherium]] and [[Gomphotherium]], and stuffed animals:
[[Arabian leopard]]. [[Caracal]]. [[Arabian Oryx]]. Arabian wolf. Arab Red fox. Ghazal skeleton Arabic. Ibex Arabic. Flamengo. Birds. Crow. Owl. Reptiles. Snakes' lizards. Snails and shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/entert/museums.asp?cat=tour&amp;subcat=entert1|title=Natural History Museum|publisher=Omanet.om| accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New premises==
In January 2014, the Ministry of Heritage and Culture announced plans to build new premises for the museum, the project will consist of three floors with a gross area rated to 5,000 square meters. The first floor is specialised for exhibiting marine environments such as sandy coasts, mangroves, rocky coasts and coral reef environments as well as the geological history of the Sultanate’s seas while the second floor displays wild environments such as mammals, insects, birds, valleys, caves and water springs in addition to the geological history of Oman.

The third floor is specialised for showcasing information about the solar system, planets, space and meteors. The museum includes lectures halls and temporary exhibitions. Additionally, it has well equipped educational halls that will be used for workshops and educational programmes. The museum includes five fundamental scientific sections specialised for research, records, studies, and archives works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.omanobserver.om/?p%3D45889 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107180436/http://main.omanobserver.om/?p=45889 |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Metzger''' was a [[German-British]] engineer, and inventor of an [[Impact extrusion|impact-extrusion]] process for forming seamless zinc and brass cans.

==Family==
Otto Metzger was the son of Jewish parents: Ludwig Metzger (1852{{ndash}}1931) and Gretchen (Guldmann) (1864{{ndash}}1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Geh-Kommerzienrat-Ludwig-Metzger/6000000021935585041 |title= Ludwig Metzger |publisher=Geni.com |access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guldmann&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Gretchen-Metzger-Guldmann/6000000022601267865 |title= Gretchen Guldmann | publisher=Geni.com |access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Metzger grew up in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, where he met his wife, Sophie (Josephthal) (1894{{ndash}}1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Sofie-Metzger/6000000014315709284 |title=Sophie Josephthal | publisher=Geni.com |access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Otto Metzger had previously served as a [[reserve officer]] in the [[Bavarian Army|Bavarian Engineers]] and so, at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he was immediately [[Conscription|conscripted]]. He served in the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],  and rose to the rank of [[Oberleutnant|lieutenant]], and was awarded [[Iron Cross]] medals (1st and 2nd class).&lt;ref name=Berlin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rijo.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/EN_NU_JU_metzge2e.pdf |last=Berlin |first=Ludwig |date=2001 |title=Biography of Otto Metzger |publisher=Rijo Research |place=Nuremberg|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering Career in Germany==
After his early schooling at the ''Neues Gymnasium'' in Nuremberg, he continued his studies at the ''[[Technical University of Munich]]'', and obtained a [[Master of Science in Engineering|Diplom-Ingenieur]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]] at the ''[[Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy]]''.

Otto Metzger then spent several years travelling and gaining engineering experience both in Germany, and also in Austria, France, Britain, USA and in Mexico.

On his return to Nuremberg in 1912, he took a post with a local metals company, ''Schmidtmer &amp; Co'', first as an engineer, and then becoming a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]].  After the First World War, he returned to his previous work; the company (then called ''Süddeutsche Metallindustrie'') was taken over by ''[[:de:Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke|Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke AG]]'' in 1926, and in 1930 became a subsidiary of the [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] ''Metallindustrie AG''.&lt;ref name=Berlin /&gt;  He was to stay with that company in various engineering and management positions until 1938, during which time he developed and [[patented]] inventions related to impact-extrusion of zinc, brass and other [[non-ferrous metals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| US |1918858 |status=patent |title=Matrix for extruding metals |fdate=1932-06-30 |gdate=1933-07-18 |inventor=Otto Metzger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |US |2099449 |status=patent| title=Method of making dry cells |fdate=1934-11-26 |gdate=1937-11-16 |inventor=Otto Metzger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |US |2117738 |status=patent |title=Packing for perishable victuals |fdate=1935-11-21 |gdate=1938-05-17 |inventor=Otto Metzger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical products for these patents were seamless cans for [[zinc-carbon batteries]], brass [[shell casings]], and containers for [[foodstuff]] and for drinks.

==Nazi Persecution and Emigration==
Starting in about 1933, the [[History of the Jews in Germany#, Jews under the Nazis (1933–45)|persecution]] of Jews in [[Nazi]] Germany intensified.

This reached a climax on 9{{nbsp}}November 1938, when Jews were attacked in their homes and businesses during the night of [[Kristallnacht]].  Otto Metzger was returning from Britain, where he had just concluded a licensing agreement with a British company, ''Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd'', to use his patented impact-extrusion technology.  He was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] at the German border, on his way home to Nuremberg, and imprisoned in the [[Dachau concentration camp]].  Meanwhile his wife, having had their home and belongings invaded and smashed by Nazi stormtroopers and having spent the night wandering the streets of Nuremberg, waited in vain for Otto’s return.&lt;ref name=Berlin /&gt;

Otto Metzger was released from Dachau on 15{{nbsp}}December 1938, and returned home to Nuremberg.  By late-March 1939, he had managed to obtain the necessary travel documents to leave Germany, and he and his wife left for Britain.  Otto had been unable to obtain documents for his mother Gretchen (who by that time was aged 74);  she remained in Nuremberg, and was transported  by the Nazis to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]], where she died in 1943.&lt;ref name=Guldmann /&gt;

==Later life in Britain==
On arrival in Britain in early 1939, Otto Metzger was immediately employed by ''Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd''.  He stayed with the company until his retirement in 1958, rising to the position of [[Managing Director]].&lt;ref name=Berlin /&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], Otto Metzger was not interned as an [[Enemy alien#United Kingdom|enemy alien]], as were most German immigrants; the British Government valued his expertise for the war effort.

Otto Metzger died of a heart-attack in 1961. Otto and his wife Sophie are commemorated by adjacent rose bushes, planted in the [[Willesden Jewish Cemetery]] in London.

[[File:Principia philosophiae.tif|thumb|''Principia Philosophiæ'', 1685]]
[[File:Descartes Principles of Philosophy 1.png|thumb|right|The illustration of movement of objects from the ''Principles'']]
'''''Principles of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|Principia Philosophiæ}}) is a book by [[René Descartes]]. In essence it is a synthesis of the ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' and ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''&lt;ref name="Durandin"&gt;Guy Durandin, Les Principes de la Philosophie. Introduction et notes, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, Paris, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in [[Latin]], published in 1644 and dedicated to [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]], with whom Descartes had a long-standing friendship. A French version (''Les Principes de la Philosophie'') followed in 1647. It set forth the principles of nature—the [[Laws of Physics]]—as Descartes viewed them. Most notably, it set forth the principle that in the absence of external forces, an object's motion will be uniform and in a straight line. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] borrowed this principle from Descartes and included it in his own ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''; to this day, it is still generally referred to as [[Newton's First Law of Motion]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Whiteside, ''The prehistory of the Principia'' Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 45, 13 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was primarily intended to replace the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] curriculum then used in French and British universities. The work provides a systematic statement of his [[metaphysics]] and [[natural philosophy]], and represents the first truly comprehensive, [[mechanics|mechanistic]] account of the universe.

==Preface to the French edition==
Descartes asked Abbot Claude Picot to translate his Latin ''Principia Philosophiæ'' into French. For this edition he wrote a preface, disguised as a letter to the translator, whose title is "''Letter of the author to the translator of the book, that may be used as a preface''". This was published in 1647, a date already in the maturity final period of his life. In this writing Descartes pours some reflexions about his idea of wisdom and philosophy. Its content may be summarized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm| title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface|  author=René Descartes| others=John Veitch (trans.)| accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concept of philosophy'''. Philosophy is the study of ''wisdom'', understood as the ability to conduct the human activities; and also as the perfect knowledge of all the things that a man can know for the direction of his life, maintenance of his health, and knowledge of the arts. Only God is perfectly wise, and the man is more or less wise, in proportion to the knowledge he has of the most important truths.

'''The degrees of knowledge'''. Descartes identifies four degrees of knowledge, he names ''common'', and a fifth one he designates as ''higher''. The first degree consists on clear and evident notions that can be acquired without need of any meditation. The second degree is all that is learned by means of the senses. The third comprises what we learn when talking with other men. The fourth consists on what we can learn from the writings of men capable of giving good instructions.

'''Higher wisdom'''. There have been great men in all times that have sought after a better and more secure wisdom, a ''fifth degree'' of knowledge. This has consisted on the search for the ''first causes'', and those that have followed this pursuit have been named ''philosophers'', but he thinks that no one has been successful yet.

'''Doubt and certainty'''. Since Plato and Aristotle there has been a discussion about doubt and certainty. Those that have favored doubt have arrived to extremes of doubting even the most evident things, and those that have sought certainty have relied excessively on senses. Though it is true that it has been accepted that the senses may mislead us, according to Descartes nobody had yet expressed that the truth can not be based on the senses, but in the ''understanding'', when it is founded on ''evident perceptions''.

'''Meditations on first philosophy'''. The search for the first causes, or basic truths, as undertaken by Descartes is contained in this work. It explains the [[metaphysics|metaphysical principles]] on which to build the rest of knowledge.

'''The tree of philosophy'''. The philosophy is like a tree, whose roots are the ''metaphysics'', its trunk the ''physics'', and the branches the rest of sciences, mainly ''medicine'', ''mechanics'', and ''morals'' that is the last level of wisdom. In the same way that the tree has its fruits in its outer parts, the usefulness of philosophy is also contained in the parts that are learnt at the end.

'''Signy Research Station''' is an Antarctic research base on [[Signy Island]], run by the [[British Antarctic Survey]].

==History==
Signy was first occupied in 1947 when a meteorological station was established in [[Factory Cove]] above the old whaling station.&lt;ref name="BAS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/signy/index.php| title=Signy Research Station| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=19 February 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918231143/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/signy/index.php| archivedate=18 September 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second research base on the [[South Orkney Islands]] (after the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Orcadas Base]] in 1903). In 1955, a new hut, Tønsberg House was built on the site of the whaling station. In 1963, it was turned into a laboratory for biological research. Initially operated year-round, since 1995/6 the station has been open from November to April each year (southern hemisphere summer).

==Facilities==
Today, the base has four buildings with capacity for 8 people.&lt;ref name="BAS"/&gt; The main building, Sorlle House (named after the whaling captain who himself named Signy Island), provides living accommodation and laboratories. The other buildings are for storage and provision of power and water services. There are also four small huts around the island.

==Research==
Marine and terrestrial biology is carried out at Signy, particularly looking at the effects of climate change on the southern ocean ecosystems. Three species of penguin ([[Adélie penguin|Adélie]], [[Chinstrap penguin|chinstrap]] and [[Gentoo penguin|gentoo]]) are monitored at the base.&lt;ref name="BAS"/&gt;

To continue an original time series of visual sea ice observations after the station became summer-only, an automated sea ice camera now operates all year around,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/engineering/signy_ice_camera.php| title=Signy Sea Ice Camera| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a continuous record of sea ice extent near the station for over 50 years.

'''Soil classification''' deals with the systematic [[categorization]] of [[soil]]s based on distinguishing characteristics as well as criteria that dictate choices in use.

== Overview ==
Soil classification is a dynamic subject, from the structure of the system itself, to the definitions of classes, and finally in the application in the field. Soil classification can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.

=== Engineering ===
Engineers, typically [[geotechnical engineer]]s, classify soils according to their engineering properties as they relate to use for foundation support or building material. Modern engineering classification systems are designed to allow an easy transition from field observations to basic predictions of soil engineering properties and behaviors.

The most common engineering classification system for soils in [[North America]] is the [[Unified Soil Classification System]] (USCS). The USCS has three major classification groups: (1) coarse-grained soils (e.g. sands and gravels); (2) fine-grained soils (e.g. silts and clays); and (3) highly organic soils (referred to as "[[peat]]").  The USCS further subdivides the three major soil classes for clarification. It distinguishes sands from gravels by grain size, and further classifying some as "well-graded" and the rest as "poorly-graded". Silts and clays are distinguished by the soils' [[Atterberg limits]], and separates "high-plasticity" from "low-plasticity" soils as well. Moderately organic soils are considered subdivisions of silts and clays, and are distinguished from inorganic soils by changes in their plasticity properties (and Atterberg limits) on drying. The '''European soil classification system''' (ISO 14688) is very similar, differing primarily in coding and in adding an "intermediate-plasticity" classification for silts and clays, and in minor details.

Other engineering soil classification systems in the United States include the [[AASHTO Soil Classification System]], which classifies soils and aggregates relative to their suitability for pavement construction, and the Modified [[Donald Burmister|Burmister]] system, which works similarly to the USCS, but includes more coding for various soil properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.columbia.edu/ling/burmister/burmister.html |title=Donald M. Burmister |publisher=Civil.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full geotechnical engineering soil description will also include other properties of the soil including color, in-situ moisture content, in-situ strength, and somewhat more detail about the material properties of the soil than is provided by the USCS code. The USCS and additional engineering description is standardized in ASTM D 2487.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials |year=1985 |series=D 2487-83 |title=Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes: Annual Book of ASTM Standards |volume=04.08 |pages=395–408 |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D2487.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SoilTextureTriangle.jpg|thumb|Soil texture triangle showing the [[USDA]] classification system based on grain size]]

For soil resources, experience has shown that a natural system approach to [[scientific classification|classification]], i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property ([[soil morphology]]), behaviour, or [[pedogenesis|genesis]], results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses. Differing concepts of pedogenesis, and differences in the significance of morphological features to various land uses can affect the classification approach. Despite these differences, in a well-constructed system, classification criteria group similar concepts so that interpretations do not vary widely. This is in contrast to a technical system approach to soil classification, where soils are grouped according to their fitness for a specific use and their [[edaphic]] characteristics.

Natural system approaches to soil classification, such as the French Soil Reference System (Référentiel pédologique français)  are based on presumed soil genesis.   Systems have developed, such as [[USDA soil taxonomy]] and the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]], which use [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] criteria involving soil morphology and laboratory tests to inform and refine [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] classes.
Another approach is numerical classification, also called [[ordination (statistics)|ordination]], where soil individuals are grouped by multivariate statistical methods such as [[cluster analysis]]. This produces natural groupings without requiring any inference about soil genesis.

In [[soil survey]], as practiced in the [[United States]], soil classification usually means criteria based on [[soil morphology]] in addition to characteristics developed during [[soil formation]].  Criteria are designed to guide choices in [[land use]] and [[soil management]]. As indicated, this is a hierarchical system that is a hybrid of both ''natural'' and objective criteria.  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] provides the core criteria for differentiating soil map units. This is a substantial revision of the  [[1938 USDA soil taxonomy]] which was a strictly natural system.  The USDA classification was originally developed by [[Guy D. Smith|Guy Donald Smith]], former director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's soil survey investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/08/29/guy-d-smith-73-usda-soil-expert-dies/962ae425-d6cb-40c0-af27-c0fcb1700b2d/|title=Guy D.

[[Land use capability map|Land Capability Classes]], [[hydric soil]], and [[prime farmland]] are some examples. &lt;!-- consider moving this paragraph to soil survey article--&gt;

In addition to scientific soil classification systems, there are also [[vernacular]] soil classification systems. [[Folk taxonomies]] have been used for millennia, while scientifically based systems are relatively recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forages.oregonstate.edu/is/ssis/main.cfm?PageID=162 Soil classification systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907150151/http://forages.oregonstate.edu/is/ssis/main.cfm?PageID=162 |date=2006-09-07 }}.

==Soil classifications for OSHA==
The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) requires the classification of soils to protect workers from injury when working in excavations and trenches. OSHA uses 3 soil classifications plus one for rock, based primarily on strength but also other factors which affect the stability of cut slopes:&lt;ref name=OSHA-pa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10931 |title=Safety and Health Regulations for Construction Subpart P, Excavations, Appendix A|publisher=Osha.gov |date= 9 August 1994|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{vanchor|Stable Rock}}: natural solid mineral matter that can be excavated with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed.
* {{vanchor|Type A}} - cohesive, plastic soils with unconfined compressive strength greater than 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf)(144 kPa), and meeting several other requirements (which induces a [[lateral earth pressure]] of 25 psf per ft of depth&lt;ref name=OSHA-pc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10933 |title=Safety and Health Regulations for Construction Subpart P, Excavations, Appendix C|publisher=Osha.gov |date= 9 August 1994|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* {{vanchor|Type B}} - cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength between 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) and 1.5 tsf (144 kPa), or unstable dry rock, or soils which would otherwise be Type A (lateral earth pressure of 45 psf per ft of depth&lt;ref name=OSHA-pc /&gt;)
* {{vanchor|Type C}} - granular soils or cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength less than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) or any submerged or freely seeping soil or adversely bedded soils (lateral earth pressure of 80 psf per ft of depth&lt;ref name=OSHA-pc /&gt;)
* {{vanchor|Type C60}} - A subtype of Type C soil, though is not officially recognized by OSHA as a separate type, induces a lateral earth pressure of 60 psf per ft of depth&lt;ref name="corrug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacificshoring.com/store/media/pdf/corrugated-sheeting.pdf|title=Corrugated Sheeting, Tabulated Data|date=January 1, 2012|publisher=Pacific Shoring, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&amp;p_id=21360|title=Soil classification. - Occupational Safety and Health Administration|author=|date=|website=www.osha.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the soil classifications has implications for the way the excavation must be made or the protections (sloping, shoring, shielding, etc.) that must be provided to protect workers from collapse of the excavated bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dts/sltc/methods/validated/id194/id194.html |title=Sampling and Analytical Methods &amp;#124; Classification of Soils for Excavations, ID-194 |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-pb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10932 |title=Safety and Health Regulations for Construction Subpart P, Excavations, Appendix B |publisher=Osha.gov |date=9 August 1994|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical soil classification systems focus on representing some specific facet or quality of the soil, rather than a direct pedogenetic classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6359">During the 1920s, '''Soviet urban planning ideologies''' established along two competing lines: the urbanist and disurbanist schools. Whilst the proposed form of the city differed between the two ideologies, their visions of social organization for communal living overlapped. 

== Background ==

In the decades before the formation of the Soviet Union, Tsarist Russia had experienced a rapid period of industrialisation and urbanisation, tripling in size between 1850 and 1914.&lt;ref name=Bater&gt;{{cite book|last=Bater|first=J|title=The Soviet City: Ideal and Reality|year=1980|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1917 October Revolution, the new State inherited overcrowded cities characterised by poor sanitation and disease, and class divide.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=R|title=Plans, pragmatism and people: The legacy of Soviet planning for today’s cities|year=1995|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1917 revolution brought Marxist attitudes that rural life was backward and resulted in inequality.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Such ideals required the distinction between rural and urban be abolished so as to raise the population to a common standard of living. All land was nationalised and socialised, and on 20 August 1918 all urban property was transferred by decree to the State or local authorities.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Houses and apartments once belonging to the bourgeoisie were subdivided to provide accommodation for the proletariat, providing some initial relief to overcrowding. 

The collapse of the old spatial order required that new planning approaches to the city be created.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; Whilst the economic and labour demands of World War I and the ongoing Civil War meant that the implementation of physical urban outcomes were prevented, a debate as to the desired form the socialist city was initiated.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; The debate continued throughout the 1920s, with two broad opposing schools of thought emerging: the urbanists, and the disurbanists.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt;

== Urbanist school ==

The urbanist school was led by [[Leonid Sabsovich]], and included significant architects of the time including the brothers [[Viktor Aleksandrovich Vesnin|Viktor]], [[Leonid Aleksandrovich Vesnin|Leonid]] and [[Alexander Vesnin]], and the brothers [[Panteleimon Golosov|Panteleymon]] and [[Ilya Golosov]].&lt;ref name=French/&gt; They opposed the expansion of existing cities and instead advocated for a partial decentralisation to a system of self-contained, compact centres located around industry,&lt;ref name=Macel&gt;{{cite book|title=Soviet Architecture|year=1989|publisher=Art Unlimited Books|location=Amsterdam|pages=18|author=Macel, O|editor=Kloos, M.|chapter=Tradition, Innovation and Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a fixed population of approximately 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt;

These new cities would embody strict land-use zoning, development of both housing and industry, walkable journeys to work, green spaces and leisure facilities, and a non-commercial centre.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; Both Bater&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; and French&lt;ref name=French/&gt; acknowledge the influence of the [[Garden city movement]] on the concept, though the degree is debated.

Such a city would break down distinctions between the agriculturalist and proletarian, and dissolve the nuclear family to create a completely communal way of life.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; Key to the concept was the creation of communal houses, each accommodating two to three thousand people in separate sleeping units – ‘cells’ of 5 to 6 square metres each.&lt;ref name=Macel/&gt; All other activities, including kitchens, eating halls, crèches and kindergartens, would be accommodated in communal facilities attached to or nearby the communal house.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; An extreme example was Ivan Kuznin’s proposal in which the day for each age group would be ordered with precisely regulated timing for each action, such as waking up, washing, dressing, walking to dining hall.&lt;ref name=Macel/&gt;

Design competitions for communal houses include Kharkiv in 1924-5, Moscow in 1925-6 and Leningrad in 1930.&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

== Disurbanist school ==

The disurbanist school was led by the theorists [[Mikhail Okhitovich|M. Okhitovich]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg|M. Ginsburg]].&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; In contrast to the urbanists, the disurbanists saw the achievement of the Marxist goal of the dissolution of the difference between town and country as the total abolition of the traditional concept of the town.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; They proposed that settlement be dispersed across the whole of the Soviet Union in the form of continuous ribbon developments. Individual dwellings would be distributed along roads in natural and rural surroundings, but within easy reach of communal dining and recreation amenities.&lt;ref name=Bater/&gt; Employment centres would be located at road junctions, with bus services transporting workers from their houses.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Whilst individual living space would be private, the disurbanists proposed a communal lifestyle similar to that proposed by the urbanists.&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

Proposals put forward by the disurbanists included Okhitovich’s 1930 plan for [[Magnitogorsk]] which consisted of eight 25km long ribbons converging on a metallurgical plant.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Ginsberg imagined that Moscow’s population be emptied and resettled in long linear zones of communal houses through forests, serviced by bus stations and zones of recreation and service amenities at regular intervals.&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

== Abandonment ==

Whilst many proposals were put forward by both the urbanists and disurbanists schools of thought, very few were actually implemented. French&lt;ref name=French/&gt; argues that the theoreticians failed to understand the social working of groups. The majority of the working class rejected the idea of the collective dwelling and Stalin being a political realist saw the proposals as too utopian - dangerous experiments that could be economically crippling.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; The planning ideas of the urbanists and disurbanists were subsequently abandoned with the State reverting to classicism.

In [[general relativity]], '''[[John Lighton Synge|Synge's]] world function''' is an example of a [[bitensor]], i.e. a tensorial function of pairs of points in the spacetime. Let &lt;math&gt;x, x'&lt;/math&gt; be two points in spacetime, and suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to a convex [[normal neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; so that there exists a unique [[geodesic]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, up to the affine parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\lambda_0) = x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\lambda_1) = x&lt;/math&gt;. Then Synge's world function is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x,x') = \frac{1}{2} (\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{0}) \int_{\gamma} g_{\mu\nu}(z) t^{\mu}t^{\nu} d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;t^{\mu}= \frac{dz^{\mu}}{d\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent vector to the affinely parametrized geodesic &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x,x')&lt;/math&gt; is half the square of the geodesic length from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;. Synge's world function is well-defined, since the integral above is invariant under reparametrization. In particular, for [[Minkowski spacetime]], the Synge's world function simplifies to half the [[spacetime interval]] between the two points:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x,x') = \frac{1}{2} \eta_{\alpha \beta} (x-x')^{\alpha} (x-x')^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Taishan Station''' ({{zh|s=泰山站|t=泰山站|p=Tàishān Zhàn}}) is the fourth of four [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] research stations in [[Antarctica]].

Officially opened on February 8, 2014, it is the fourth Chinese research station in Antarctica following [[Antarctic Great Wall Station|Great Wall]], [[Antarctic Zhongshan Station|Zhongshan]] and [[Antarctic Kunlun Station|Kunlun]] stations.

The site is located 2,621 m above sea level in [[Princess Elizabeth Land]], 522 km and 600 km to Zhongshan and Kunlun stations respectively.&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2014-02/08/c_126102061.htm |title=中國南極泰山站 |accessdate=15 February 2014 |date=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its function is to a facilitate a relay point between the two stations.

The construction started on December 26, 2013. The station's main building covers an area of 410 m², together with the auxiliary building covering 590 m², provide the living and researching area for 20 people during the Antarctic summer.&lt;ref name="xinhua"/&gt;

'''''The Improving State of the World: Why We're Living Longer, Healthier, More Comfortable Lives On a Cleaner Planet''''' ({{ISBN|1930865988}}) is a 2007 book by [[Indur M. Goklany]], published by the [[Cato Institute]]. As per the title, it argues that the state of the world and humanity is rapidly improving.

== Contents ==
The book lists many supporting statistics:
*The average person has never been better fed than today. Between 1961 and 2002, the world average daily food supply per person increased by 24% (38% in developing nations). Chronic [[undernourishment]] in developing nations declined from 37 to 17 percent of their population between 1969–71 and 2000-02. Greater [[agricultural productivity]] and [[international trade]] has caused inflation-adjusted prices of food commodities to decline by 75 percent since 1950. Access to [[safe water]] and [[sanitation]] has increased.
*Before [[industrialization]], at least one out of every five children died before reaching his or her first birthday, equivalent to more than 20%. In 2003 the worldwide rate was 5.7% which is approximately the same as the developed nations had in 1950. The progress is illustrated by that many [[developing nations]], such as India, [[Peru]], and [[Ghana]], in 1998 had a lower [[infant mortality]] than the US had in 1913.
*For much of human history, [[life expectancy]] used to be between 20–30 years. By 1900 it had increased to 31 years. By 2003 it was 66.8 years. Even in Africa, the poorest continent, it has increased to 45.6 years. Not only are people living longer, they are also healthier in old age. During the course of the 20th century, the average onsets of diseases such heart disease (9 years), respiratory disease (11 years), and cancer (8 years), have been delayed.
*Between 1970 and the early 2000s, global [[illiteracy]] rates dropped from 36 to 18 percent. Globally, the percentage of relevant population enrolled in [[tertiary education]] increased from 6.8 to 25.6 percent between 1965 and 2001.
*Worldwide [[child labor]] (age 10-14) has decreased from 24.9 percent in 1960 to 10.5 percent in 2003.
*Total lifetime spent working for the average British worker declined from 50 to 20 percent of the total "disposable life hours" between 1856 and 1981. Due mainly to improved and cheaper lighting, the increase in free time is arguable even greater, since darkness previously greatly restricted available activities, especially for the poor.
*In 1900 no country had [[universal suffrage]] and only 12.4 percent of the world's population had even limited suffrage. Today 44.1 percent of the world's population live in nations deemed free by [[Freedom House]] and another 18.6 percent in nations deemed partly free.

A common perception is that such progress from economic growth and technology is unsustainable due to worsening environmental problems. The book argues that this is wrong. In the early stages of economic and technological development environmental impact does increase. Improving access to factors such as food, shelter, and electricity is seen as more important than the environment. As development continues and these problems are tackled, the environmental impact becomes a higher priority, and then steps are taken to reduce it. This pattern can be seen for many environmental indicators, such as [[air quality]], availability of safe water, sanitation, and [[DDT]] and [[PCB residues]] in human tissues, which initially declined with increasing development but have more recently improved.

On the other hand, "The reality ... is that the fight over environmental regulation, at least in the United States, was -- and remains -- a fierce one and that environmental skeptics and businesses have done their best to prevent regulations such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air]] and [[Clean Water Act]]s from ever becoming law. It is also the case that without those regulations, the 'cleaner planet' Goklany sees today would not exist.... The point is that far from being the inevitable product of a strong economy, environmental improvement is often the result of political struggles that could very easily have gone the other way." says [[James Surowiecki]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20070708140136/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701fareviewessay86410/james-surowiecki/better-and-better-the-myth-of-inevitable-progress.html review] of the book.

Goklany in a reply stated "I am no more convinced than he is about the [[inevitability of progress]]" and that the book had stated "a democratic society, because it has the political means to do so, will translate its desire for a cleaner environment into laws, either because cleanup is not voluntary or rapid enough, or because of sheer symbolism. The wealthier such a society, the more affordable -- and more demanding -- its laws."[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20071101faletter86674/indur-m-goklany/better-lives.html]

A '''time control''' is a mechanism in the tournament play of almost all two-player [[board games]] so that each round of the match can finish in a timely way and the tournament can proceed.  Time controls are typically enforced by means of a [[game clock]], where the times below are given per player. Time pressure (or [[time trouble]] or ''zeitnot'') is the situation of having very little time on a player's clock to complete their remaining moves.

In the case of [[chess]], the World Chess Federation [[FIDE]] has a single, classical time control for most of its major events: 90 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one.&lt;ref name="fidefastchess"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=39&amp;view=category|work=FIDE Handbook|title=07. Time Control|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=8 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526085151/http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=39&amp;view=category|archivedate=26 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Candidates tournament and the World Championship are currently played at 100 minutes for 40 moves, followed by 50 minutes for 20 moves, followed by 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment starting from move one. Also, FIDE formulates different time controls for [[fast chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=171&amp;view=article |title=FIDE Handbook – E.I. Laws of Chess - For competitions starting on or after 1 July 2014 - Appendices |accessdate=2014-07-27 |publisher=[[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] |quote=''A.1 A 'Rapidplay' game is one where either all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player; or the time allotted plus 60 times any increment is of more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player.'' ... ''B.1 A 'blitz' game' is one where all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of 10 minutes or less for each player; or the allotted time plus 60 times any increment is 10 minutes or less.'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707015326/http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=171&amp;view=article |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The amount of time given to each player to complete their moves will vary from game to game. 
However most games tend to change the classification of tournaments according to the length of 
time given to the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemma.ujf.cas.cz/~cieply/GO/format.html#CLASS|title=Instructions|author=|date=|website=gemma.ujf.cas.cz|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220072413/http://gemma.ujf.cas.cz/~cieply/GO/format.html#CLASS|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter time limits, which do not afford due consideration to moves, are afforded a lesser degree of importance. Indeed, shorter limits are normally given special names to distinguish them.

In chess, the categories of short time limits are: "'''lightning'''", "'''bullet'''", "'''blitz'''", and "'''rapid'''".
"'''Bullet'''" or "'''Lightning'''" games are the fastest, with either a very short time limit per move (such as ten seconds) or a very short total time (such as one or two minutes). 
"'''Blitz'''" games typically give five to ten minutes per player, and "'''rapid'''" games give between ten and sixty minutes.
By way of contrast, for [[Go (board game)|Go]], anything under twenty minutes could be considered "blitz".

==Methodology==
The exact approach to using a [[game clock]] to regulate games varies considerably.

===Sudden death===
This is the simplest methodology. Each player is assigned a fixed amount of time for the whole game: once a player's main time expires, they lose the game.

===Hourglass===
Each player's clock starts with a specified time (e.g. 1 minute, 10 min etc.). While Player 1 is deciding a move, player 1's clock time is decreasing and Player 2's clock time is increasing. This is similar to how an [[hourglass]] works; sand empties from one container and fills into the other. Moving slowly gives your opponent extra time. The sum of both clocks will always remain the same. There is no maximum amount of time allotted for a game with this timing method; as long as both players play quickly, the game will continue until its natural end. When time runs out on one player's clock the game is over and that player loses. Use of this time control is uncommon.

===Overtime formats===
Here the game time is separated into two basic domains: the main time, and the overtime. To switch between the two requires some trigger event. Often this is the expiration of the main time. In [[chess]], reaching a fixed number of moves can trigger the gain of a fixed amount of bonus time. This is the general chess rule and it usually occurs in long games after the 40th move:
e.g. 120 minutes to complete the first 40 moves, and another 30 minutes to complete the entire game.

In [[Go (board game)|go]] two common forms are:

====Japanese byo-yomi====
{{nihongo|'''Byo-yomi'''|秒読み|byōyomi}} is an extended time control in two-player [[game]]s, specifically [[shogi]] and [[Go (board game)|go]]. The word is borrowed from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; the term literally means "counting the seconds", or more generally, "countdown".

After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of periods (for example five periods, each of thirty seconds). If a move is completed before the time expires, the time period resets and restarts the next turn. If a move is not completed within a time period, the time period will expire, and the next time period begins. This is written as &lt;maintime&gt; + &lt;number of byo-yomi time periods&gt; of &lt;byo-yomi time period&gt;. Using up the last period means that the player has ''lost on time''. In some systems, such as certain [[Go (board game)|Go]] title matches, there is no main time; instead, the time used is rounded ''down'' to the nearest whole increment, such as one minute, and the actual counting of time occurs toward the end of one player's time.

A typical time control is "60 minutes + 30 seconds byo-yomi", which means that each player may make as many or as few moves as he chooses during his first 60 minutes of thinking time, but after the hour is exhausted, he must make each move in thirty seconds or less.  To enforce byo-yomi, a third person or a [[game clock]] with a byo-yomi option is necessary.

In [[Go professional|professional Go]] games and many amateur tournaments, a player has several byo-yomi periods, for example five periods of one minute each. If a player makes his move within a one-minute period, he retains all five periods for his future moves.  If a player oversteps one minute, he starts the following move in the second rather than the first byo-yomi period.  In effect, the player has one minute per move plus four extra one-minute packets which may be used as needed, e.g. four moves of two minutes each, or one move of five minutes, or any other combination.

In higher-level tournaments, such as the Kisei tournament, the player's time is often composed entirely of byo-yomi periods (for example, in an eight-hour game, the player may have 480 periods of one minute each), rather than having a main block of thinking time. In this case, the actual counting of time (verbally) begins once the player falls below a certain threshold of time, such as 10 minutes; when the time is being counted, the player is informed at intervals how much time they have used in their current period, and how many extra periods they have left. (For example, the time may be called at 10-second intervals, and when 55 and 58 seconds have been used; during a player's final minute, the last 10 seconds are counted one by one.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britgo.org/bgj/10643.html|title=Byoyomi Explained - British Go Association|author=|date=|website=www.britgo.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807223313/http://www.britgo.org/bgj/10643.html|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the televised [[NHK Cup (Go)|NHK Cup tournament]], the player has 30 seconds per move plus 10 extra one-minute periods which may be used as needed.

When analog game clocks are used to enforce byo-yomi, it is more convenient to assign additional time for a block of moves, rather than for each move.  In ''Canadian byo-yomi'', a player typically gets 5 minutes for 10 to 20 moves.  The [[IGS Go server]] uses a similar system, but the byo-yomi time is variable and always covers 25 moves.  Thus the time control "20 minutes + 15 minutes byoyomi" on IGS means that after the initial 20 minutes of thinking time are over, a player is granted 15 additional minutes, which may be spent however he chooses.  If these minutes expire before he has made 25 more moves, he loses.  If he makes 25 more moves in less than 15 minutes, he is granted another 15 minutes of byo-yomi, and so on indefinitely.

Canadian byo-yomi imposes a certain average speed of play, but allows the player to spend more time to ponder on difficult moves.  Several byo-yomi periods in one move per period variant (also known as ''Japanese byo-yomi'', though that is a bit of [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]) serve essentially the same purpose, albeit to a lesser extent.

Unused time during one byo-yomi period does not carry forward to future moves.  This is in contrast to the [[Time control#Compensation (increment or delay methods)|Fischer clock]] often used in [[chess]], with designations such as "5 minutes + 12 seconds per move".  Under this time control each player has twelve seconds added to his clock after every move, starting from the first move, regardless of how much time he spends on each move.  Thus if a player thinks for eight seconds before making his first move, he will have five minutes and four seconds on his clock after making it.

====Canadian overtime====
After using all of his/her main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time &amp;mdash; for example, twenty moves within five minutes. In [[Go (game)|Go]], players stop the clock, and the player in overtime counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused, whilst the opponent sets the clock to the overtime period. If all the moves are made in time, then another period of overtime starts &amp;mdash; another set of stones and the timer again reset to the overtime period. If all the moves are not made in time, the player has ''lost on time''. This is written as &lt;main time&gt; + &lt;number of moves to be completed in each time period&gt; in &amp;lt;time period&amp;gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.infinit.net/steven/byoyomi.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120185427/http://pages.infinit.net/steven/byoyomi.htm |archivedate=2006-11-20 |df= }} The Origins of Canadian Byo-Yomi&lt;/ref&gt; In '''Progressive Canadian Overtime''' the required rate of play alters in additional overtime periods &amp;mdash; EG 1hour + 10 in 5, 20 in 5, 30 in 5, 40 in 5 etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britgo.org/rules/approved.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206134243/http://www.britgo.org/rules/approved.html |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }} BGA Rules page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation (increment or delay methods) {{anchor|Compensation (delay methods)}}===

'''Increment''' (also known as Fischer and bonus)—a specified amount of time is added for each move. For example, if the increment is thirty seconds, each player gets an additional thirty seconds for each move. Under FIDE and US Chess rules you get the increment for move one as well. For example, for G/3;inc2 (three minutes of base time with a two-second increment each move), you start with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital [[chess clock]]s automatically give the increment for move one and thus for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually to be base time so each player gets the increment for move one.

'''Bronstein delay'''—this timing method adds time but unlike increment not always the maximum amount of time is added. If a player expends more than the specified delay, then the entire delay is added to the player's clock but if a player moves faster than the delay, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is added. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds is added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds for a move, five seconds is added after they complete their move. This ensures that the base time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, you get the delay time for move one under FIDE and US Chess rules.

'''Simple delay''' (also known as countdown delay and US delay)—with this timing method, the clock waits for the delay period each move before starting to subtract the player's base time. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the base time starts going down. This timing method is mathematically equivalent to Bronstein delay. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the US while Bronstein delay is the form of delay most often used in most other countries.

===Penalty formats===
Such methods exact a points penalty, or fine, on the player who breaches their time limit. One example occurs in Go, where the Ing Rules enforce fines on breaches of main time and overtime periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgo.org/resources/KSS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231074549/http://www.usgo.org/resources/KSS.html |archivedate=2006-12-31 |df= }} "Ing's SST Laws of Go"&lt;/ref&gt; In tournament [[Scrabble]], the time control is standardized to 25 minutes per side with a 10-point penalty for each minute or part thereof that is used in excess,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/build/rules/rules2.html#r3c2 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223812/http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/build/rules/rules2.html |date=2007-09-27 }} "NSA Official Tournament Rules", National Scrabble Association&lt;/ref&gt; so that overstepping the allotted time by 61 seconds carries a 20-point penalty. In chess, a person will automatically lose if they lose their game on time unless they try a draw claim. (See Rule 14-H in the USCF manual for chess).

==Usage on chess servers==
On chess servers (like [[Internet Chess Club]] and [[Free Internet Chess Server]]) the time control is usually expressed with a formula: ''time+increment''. Where ''time'' is a fixed amount of time (in minutes) assigned at move 0 for the entire game, and ''increment'' (in seconds) is the amount added after each move.

A game can even have a ''time'' set to 0: the clock is set to 0 and started after the first move with the increment only on both sides, and each move each player is granted only the increment: a 0+10 is a game where after the first move each player has 10 seconds to move.
