'''Aaron Ben Asher of Karlin''' (June 6, 1802 – June 23, 1872), known as '''Rabbi Aaron II of Karlin''', was a famous [[rabbi]] of the [[Ḥasidim]] in northwestern [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=Aaron ben Asher of Karlin (Rabbi Aaron II. of Karlin)|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=15 |author=[[Paul Wendland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of followers used to visit him annually, about the time of the [[Jewish New Year]], as is the custom among that sect, and he was highly esteemed by his adherents. He "reigned" in [[Karlin (Pinsk)|Karlin]], near [[Pinsk]], in the government of [[Minsk]] (currently in [[Belarus]]), in succession to his father and his grandfather, [[Aaron ben Jacob of Karlin|Aaron ben Jacob]].&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

A few years before his death he had a quarrel with a family of Karlin and removed from there to [[Stolin]], a town several miles distant. Considering the amount of business that the yearly influx of strangers brought to the city where he resided, his removal was regarded as a misfortune for Karlin. He died, aged seventy years and seventeen days, in [[Mlyniv|Malinov]], near [[Dubno]], in [[Volhynia]], while on a journey to the wedding of his granddaughter, and was succeeded by his son, [[Asher of Stolin]]. Asher died in [[Drohobycz]] about one year after the death of his father, and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, the so-called Yenuḳa (Baby) of Stolin, against whose rabbinate (in the Ḥasidic sense) Schatzkes — or, according to others, Judah Lob Levin (called Yehallel of [[Kiev]]) — under the pseudonym "Ḥad min Ḥabraya" (One of the students), wrote a satire in "Ḥa-Shaḥar" (vi. 25-44).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

Aaron is the author of ''Bet Aharon'' (''Aaron's House''; [[Brody]], 1875), which contains his [[Kabbalah|cabalistic]] and ethical expositions of the [[Pentateuch]]. It also contains the writings of his grandfather, of his father, and of his son.&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

Aaron's daughter, Miriam, married Rabbi [[Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (first Sadigura rebbe)|Avrohom Yaakov Friedman]] (1820–1883), the first [[Rebbe]] of the [[Sadigura (Hasidic dynasty)|Sadigura]] Hasidic dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17198.html|title=RUZHIN, ISRAEL|author=Itzhak Alfassi|year=2008|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Yisroel.

The '''Bagirmi languages''' comprise half a dozen languages spoken in southern [[Chad]]. They are members of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] language family.

The most populous Bagirmi language is [[Naba language|Naba]], spoken by the [[Bilala people|Bilala]], [[Kuka people|Kuka]], and [[Medogo people|Medogo]], who together number a quarter million. The languages are:
:[[Bagirmi language|Barma]] (Bagirmi proper), [[Naba language|Naba]], [[Kenga language|Kenga]], [[Fer language|Fer]], [[Beraku language|Beraku]], [[Disa language|Disa]]

''Ethnologue'' lists a couple more ([[Jaya language|Jaya]], [[Morom language|Morom]]) between Kenga and Naba, and [[Gula language (Chad)|Gula]] (Sara Gula) further south, next to [[Sar language|Sar]].

'''Bareqi Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|لهجة بارقية}}) is the [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken in [[Bareq]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is spoken in many towns and villages in that [[wadi]].

==Characteristics==
Bareqi Arabic has many aspects that differentiate it from all other dialects in the Arab world. Phonologically, Bareqi Arabic is similar to the majority of Yemeni dialects and [[Himyaritic language]]. All Bareqi dialects also share the unusual feature of replacing the definite article ''al-'' with the prefix ''am-''. The dialects of many towns and villages in the wadi and the coastal region are characterized by having changed ج ({{IPAslink|dʒ}}) to a [[palatal approximant]] ي {{IPAblink|j}} (called {{IPAslink|dʒ}} yodization).

'''Cappadocian''', also known as '''Cappadocian Greek''' or '''Asia Minor Greek''', is a [[mixed language]] spoken in [[Cappadocia]] (Central Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/695490/The_Resurrection_of_Cappadocian_Asia_Minor_Greek_|title=The Resurrection of Cappadocian (Asia Minor Greek)|pages=3|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language originally diverged from the [[Medieval Greek]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] following the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turk]] victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. As a result of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in the 1920s, all [[Cappadocian Greeks]] were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard [[Modern Greek]] and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, [[Mark Janse]] ([[Ghent University]]) and Dimitris Papazachariou ([[University of Patras]]) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lmgd.philology.upatras.gr/index.php/en/10-ne/27-2014-02-28-08-26-57|title=Laboratory of Ancient Greek Dialects|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Patras|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard [[Modern Greek]].

By the fifth century AD, the last of the Indo-European [[Anatolian languages|native languages of Asia Minor]] ceased to be spoken, [[Hellenization|replaced]] by [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swain|first1=Simon|last2=Adams|first2=J.

Cappadocian Greek first began to diverge from the [[Medieval Greek]] common language of the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] six centuries later,&lt;ref name="Dawkins" /&gt; following the Byzantine's defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. This defeat allowed [[Turkish language|Turkish]] speakers to enter Asia Minor for the first time, severing Cappadocia from the rest of the Byzantine world.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Over the next centuries Cappadocian Greek would be heavily influenced by Turkish, but unlike [[Standard Modern Greek]], it would not be influenced by [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and French from the [[Frankokratia]] period, which followed the [[Fourth Crusade]]'s sack of [[Constantinople]] in 1204.

The earliest records of the language are in the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] [[Persian language|Persian]] poems of [[Rumi|Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]] (1207-1273), who lived in Iconium ([[Konya]]), and some [[ghazal]]s by his son [[Sultan Walad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/Play/rumiwalad.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213095022/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/Play/rumiwalad.html |archivedate=December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khamush.com/greek/gr.htm |title=Rumi |publisher=Khamush.com |date=2004-05-09 |accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of the texts is difficult as they are written in [[Arabic script]], and in Rumi's case without vowel points; Dedes' is the most recent edition and rather more successful than others.&lt;ref&gt;Δέδες, Δ. 1993. Ποιήματα του Μαυλανά Ρουμή. Τα Ιστορικά 10.18–19: 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, G. 1895. Die griechischen Verse in Rabâbnâma. Byzantinische Zeitschrift 4: 401–411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burguière, P. 1952. Quelques vers grecs du XIIIe siècle en caractères arabes. Byzantion 22: 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Cappadocians shifted to Turkish altogether (written with the Greek alphabet, [[Karamanlides|Karamanlidika]]). Where Greek was maintained ([[Sille (village)|Sille]] near Konya, numerous villages near Kayseri, including [[Misthi]], [[Malakopea]], and [[Kaymakli|Anakou]] and Pharasa town), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. However, there are next to no written documents in Medieval or early Modern Cappadocian, as the language was, and still essentially is, a spoken language only. Those educated to read and write, such as priests, would do so in the more classicising literary Greek. The earliest outside studies of spoken Cappadocian date from the 19th century, but are generally not very accurate.

One of the first documented studies was ''Modern Greek in Asia Minor: A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1916), by [[Richard MacGillivray Dawkins]] (1871–1955), the first Bywater and Sotheby Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at the [[University of Oxford]], based on fieldwork conducted by the author in Cappadocia in 1909–1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/moderngreekinas00hallgoog |title=Modern Greek in Asia Minor; a study of the dialects of Siĺli, Cappadocia and Phárasa, with grammar, texts, translations and glossary : Dawkins, R. M. (Richard McGillivray), 1871-1955 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the population exchange, several Cappadocian dialects have been described by collaborators of the Center for Asia Minor Studies (Κέντρον Μικρασιατικών Σπουδών) in Athens: Uluağaç (I.I. Kesisoglou, 1951), Aravan (D. Phosteris &amp; I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960), Axo (G. Mavrochalyvidis &amp; I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960) and Anaku (A.P. Costakis, 1964), resulting in a series of grammars (although regrettably not all Cappadocian villages were covered). The Pharasiot priest Theodoridis also published some folk texts.

In recent years, the study of Cappadocian has seen a revival following the pioneering work on ''[[Language contact|Language Contact]], [[Creolization]], and [[Genetic (linguistics)|Genetic Linguistics]]'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988) by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman, and a series of publications on various aspects of Cappadocian linguistics by Mark Janse, professor at [[Roosevelt Academy]], who has also contributed a grammatical survey of Cappadocian to a forthcoming handbook on Modern Greek dialects edited by Christos Tzitzilis ([[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]).

The recent discovery of Cappadocian speakers by Janse and Papazachariou will result in the release of a new dictionary and a compilation of texts.

Cappadocian Greek is well known from the linguistic literature as being one of the first well documented cases of [[language death]], and in particular the significant admixture of non-Indo-European linguistic features into an Indo-European language. This process was pronounced in South-Western Cappadocia, and included the introduction of [[vowel harmony]] and verb-final word order.

==Characteristics==
The Greek element in Cappadocian is to a large extent Byzantine, e.g. ''θír'' or ''tír'' "door" from (Ancient and) Byzantine Greek ''θύρα'' (Modern Greek πόρτα, from Italian), ''píka'' or ''épka'' "I did" from Byzantine Greek έποικα (Modern Greek έκανα). Other, pre-Byzantine, archaisms are the use of the possessive adjectives ''mó(n)'', ''só(n)'' etc. from Ancient Greek εμός, σός etc. and the formation of the [[imperfect]] by means of the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-išk-'' from the Ancient Greek (Ionic) iterative suffix ''-(e)sk-''. Turkish influence appears at every level. The Cappadocian sound system includes the Turkish [[vowels]] ı, ö, ü, and the Turkish [[consonants]] b, d, g, š, ž, tš, dž (although some of these are also found in Greek words as a result of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]).

Turkish [[vowel harmony]] is found in forms such as ''düšündǘzu'' "I think", aor. 3sg ''düšǘntsü'' &lt; ''düšǘntsi'' (Malakopi), from Turkish ''düşünmek'', ''patišáxıs'' &lt; ''patišáxis'' "king" (Delmeso), from Turkish ''padişah''. Cappadocian [[noun]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is characterized by the emergence of a generalized [[agglutinative]] [[declension]] and the progressive loss of [[grammatical gender]] distinctions, e.g. ''to néka'' "the (neuter) woman (feminine)", genitive ''néka-ju'', plural ''nékes'', genitive ''nékez-ju'' (Uluağaç). Another Turkish feature is the morphological marking of definiteness in the accusative case, e.g. ''líkos'' "wolf (nominative / unmarked indefinite accusative)" vs. ''líko'' "wolf (marked definite accusative)".

[[Agglutinative]] forms are also found in the [[verb]] system such as the [[pluperfect]] ''írta ton'' "I had come" (lit. "I came I was") (Delmeso) on the model of Turkish ''geldi idi'' (''geldiydi''). Although Cappadocian [[word order]] is essentially governed by [[discourse]] considerations such as [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]], there is a tendency towards the Turkish [[subject–object–verb]] word order with its typological correlates (suffixation and pre-nominal [[grammatical modifiers]]).

The commonality among all Greek Cappadocian dialects is that they evolved from Byzantine Greek under the influence of Turkish. On the other hand, those dialects evolved in isolated villages. This has resulted in a variety of Greek Cappadocian dialects.

== Revitalisation ==
Although Cappadocian Greek was once believed to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went so far as to say that Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising [[social media]] about the language to inform the larger Greek population.

==Dialects==
* Northeastern Cappadocian (Sinasos, Potamia, Delmeso)
* Northwestern Cappadocian (Silata or Zila, Anaku, Flojita, Malakopi)
* Central Cappadocian (Axo; [[Misthi]]) (See [[Misthiotica]])
* Southwestern Cappadocian (Aravan, Gurzono; Fertek)
* Southeastern Cappadocian (Oulagatz (Uluağaç), Semendere)
* Farasiot: dialect of [[Pharasa]] (Faraşa) town (now Çamlıca village [[Yahyalı]], [[Kayseri]]) and other nearby villages (Afshar-Köy, Çukuri), more closely related to [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]], though both are the closest relatives of Cappadocian

'''Codework''' is the mixing of [[Alan Sondheim]]'s writing with the code of various [[computer languages]]. The word 'codework' was originally created and given its name by Sondheim,&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, A. 2001, ABR, Vol 22, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also popularized by other Internet artists such as [[Mez Breeze]].&lt;ref&gt;Raley, Rita 2009, Interferences: [Net.Writing] and the Practice of Codework&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes referred to as net.writing. It is said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/net.writing |title= Code|accessdate=2007-01-25 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been inspired by the eclectic poetry of [[e.e.cummings]].

Codework has been used for many forms of writing, mostly [[poetry]] and [[fiction]]. Duc Thuan's  [http://www.ducthuan.com/JavaMoon/moon.htm Days of the Java Moon] is an example of fiction in the codework style. For example:
&lt;!-- should it be &lt;source&gt;--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    //Feeling.
   if(ashamed++ == losing self-esteem.S_____ wasn't on diet) [re]solution =
   would stop eating lunch next time;

   //Result.
   after all = S_____ couldn't resist to eat when see[sniff]ing food
   ("ate();", felt defeated &amp; self-disgusted x 1000);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''Colognian grammar''' describes the formal systems of the modern [[Colognian language]] used in [[Köln|Cologne]] currently and during at least the past 150&amp;nbsp;years. It does not cover the [[Historic Colognian]] grammar, although similarities exist.

Colognian has verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] and nominal [[declension]].

The [[Colognian declension]] system [[marker (linguistics)|marks]] [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[grammatical article|articles]], and [[adjective]]s to distinguish [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical case|case]], and [[grammatical number|number]].
There are the three [[grammatical gender]]s called [[Feminine gender|feminine]], [[Masculine gender|masculine]], and [[Neuter gender|neuter]], and a special case most often treated as exceptions of neuter. Like the German declension, the Colognian declension system does not mark grammatical gender for its plural forms; plural can thus be treated similar to another gender in it formalism.
Five [[grammatical case]]s are distinguished: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], and [[vocative case|vocative]].
Genitive has two variants, either of which can also be described as expressions using dative.
[[Grammatical number|Number]] is either [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]] in declension.

The [[Colognian conjugation]] system has a few hundred individual types of [[grammatical conjugation]]s, which mark [[verb]]s to distinguish [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], modality, etc.
Colognian basic verbs are classified as strong, weak, or irregular.
Independently, there are composite verbs, which are classified as either separable or inseparable.
Colognian also has modal verbs and auxiliary verbs, each forming grammatical classes of their own.
There are three [[Grammatical person|persons]], [[Grammatical person#1st person|1st&amp;nbsp;person]], [[Grammatical person#2nd person|2nd&amp;nbsp;person]], and [[Grammatical person#3rd person|3rd&amp;nbsp;person]].
[[Grammatical number|Number]] is either [[singular (grammar)|singular]] or [[plural]] in conjugations.
[[Grammatical voice]] can be [[active voice|active]], [[passive voice|passive]], or [[mediopassive voice|reflexive]].
Colognian has [[indicative]] and [[conjunctive mood|conjunctive]] [[grammatical mood|moods]], and there are also [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[energetic mood]], [[inferential mood|inferential]] and [[renarrative mood|renarrative]], none of which is completely developed.
The [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]s of Colognian conjugation include [[unitary aspect|unitary]]-[[episodic aspect|episodic]], [[continuous aspect|continuous]], [[habitual aspect|habitual]]-[[enduring aspect|enduring]], and [[gnomic aspect|gnomic]].
In Colognian, [[grammatical tense]] can be [[present tense]], [[preterite tense]] or [[past tense]], [[simple perfect tense|simple perfect]] or [[present perfect tense|present perfect]], [[pluperfect tense|past perfect tense]], [[completed past perfect tense]], [[simple future tense]], or [[perfect future tense]].

{{Colognian grammar}}

== Case system ==
Colognian distinguishes the four [[grammatical case]]s
[[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]].
The genitive has two variants, both of which are compounds or expressions.

Colognian is a [[nominative–accusative language]], more precisely a nominative–accusative–dative language.

=== Nominative ===
Nominative is the basic form of nouns, etc.
It is used to mark the subject or agent in a clause, the verb of which is in the active voice.
It marks the subject or patient in a clause, the verb of which is in the passive voice.

=== Genitive ===
The two variants of the genitive are compounds. They both contain declined forms identical to dative, plus additional elements. Genitives can only be used in conjunction with another noun, to which they refer. One genitive form in standard word order requires that noun to precede the genitive compound, while the other genitive form is required to follow the noun it refers to. Genitives express a stronger or weaker kind of possession, ownership, or belonging-to.

* Examples:&lt;ref name="cge" /&gt;
** ''{{lang|ksh|däm Päul sing Sofa}}'' ({{lang|en|Paul's sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dat Sofa vum Pitter}}'' ({{lang|en|Peter's sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|däm Marie sing Sofa}}'' ({{lang|en|Mary's sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dä Tant Marie iehr lila Hötche}}'' ({{lang|en|Auntie Mary's little purple hat }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dat Jeseech vun dä Frau Schmitz}}'' ({{lang|en|Mrs. Smith's face }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|ene Fläsch ehre Ring}}'' ({{lang|en|a bottle's ring, the ring of a bottle }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|et Föttche vun enem Pöttche}}'' ({{lang|en|the rear side of a mug or jar or little pot or potty }})

=== Dative ===
…

=== Accusative ===
The [[accusative case|accusative]] marks the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]] in a [[transitive sentence]].

The accusative is also governed by some [[preposition]]s, and by some prepositions in conjunction with specific verb classes, which means that independent of other grammatical contexts, these prepositions make the referenced noun use the accusative form.

There is a class of [[adverbial expression]]s most often telling a time of an action or the place of a movement employing the accusative case. They always have an equivalent expression using a preposition + accusative.

Accusative forms in Colognian grammar are in all instances identical to their corresponding nominative forms. Where needed, potential ambiguities are reduced by [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic elements]] of speech, but are extremely rare, since Colognian unlike elsewhere follows a strict subject–predicate–object (SPO) word order for transitive sentences in active and reflexive voices and predicate–subject–object (PSO) for questions. This makes it very distinct from German, where word order is more flexible. Because direct objects cannot occur in the passive voice, the accusative does not occur in passive sentences.

* Examples:&lt;ref name="cge" /&gt;
** ''{{lang|ksh|däm Päul sing Sofa}}'' ({{lang|en|Paul’s sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dat Sofa vum Pitter}}'' ({{lang|en|Peter’s sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|däm Marie sing Sofa}}'' ({{lang|en|Mary’s sofa }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dä Tant Marie iehr lila Hötche}}'' ({{lang|en|Auntie Mary’s little purple hat }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|dat Jeseech vun dä Frau Schmitz}}'' ({{lang|en|Mrs. Smith’s face }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|ene Fläsch ehre Ring}}'' ({{lang|en|a bottles ring, the ring of a bottle }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|et Föttche vun enem Pöttche}}'' ({{lang|en|the rear side of a mug or jar or little pot or potty }})

=== Vocative ===
It could be argued that Colognian has a [[vocative case|vocative]], the forms of which is identical to the nominative with the articles stripped off. Most commonly, this case is seen as a part of the nominative. Since wishes can be expressed using vocative + imperative, this case is applicable to almost any [[noun]] and [[noun expression]]. Also, few specific verbs can require an object to use the vocative case.

* Examples:&lt;ref name="cge" /&gt;
** ''{{lang|ksh|Marie}}'' ({{lang|en|Mary }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|Köbes}}'' ({{lang|en|waiter, keeper, Jacob }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|Mam}}'' ({{lang|en|mum, mama, mother }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|leev Bröck}}'' ({{lang|en|dear bridge }})

== Gender system ==
There are three [[grammatical gender]]s in Colognian: [[Masculine gender|masculine]], [[Feminine gender|feminine]], and [[Neuter gender|neuter]] gender. Most nouns have fixed gender, but there is a class of nouns that can switch from predominantly neuter to feminine on certain occasions. Colognian shares this phenomenon with a large group of local and vernacular languages almost along the entire river Rhine. Very few nouns have an unclear gender.

=== Masculine ===

=== Feminine ===

=== Neuter ===

=== Natural gender ===
[[Natural gender]] plays only a small role in Colognian grammar. While male persons or living beings customarily are referred to with the masculine gender, females are generally referred to using the neuter gender, with some exceptions mentioned [[#Neuter-feminine gender switching|below]]. However, if a person or animal is named or nicknamed with a meaningful Colognian noun, which is not uncommon, the noun’s gender is used to determine [[grammatical article|articles]] accompanying the name, but otherwise the person’s natural gender is used.

=== Neuter-feminine gender switching ===

=== Unclear gender ===
There are very few Colognian nouns of unclear grammatical gender, which have therefore been used with varying gender. This may apply to [[neologism]]s for some time until a certain gender evolves for them.

== Number system ==

=== Number in declension ===
The singular is always used when there is exactly one instance of something or occasionally, depending on the ways such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a "one" at their end, such as 1,001. The plural is used in all other cases, except with zero. Depending on the context and the noun, the singular or the plural is used with zero; sometimes either can be used, but most often, Colognian speakers choose their wording to avoid expressions of the type "zero + noun."

=== Number in conjugation ===

=== Number in syntax ===

=== Singular ===
Singular is always used, when there is exactly one instance of something, or occasionally, depending on the ways, such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a "one" at their end, such as 1001.

=== Plural ===
Plural is used for anything else but zero.

=== Zero ===
Depending on context and the noun, singular or plural is used with zero instances.
Some nouns allow only one of them, other nouns allow that either can be chosen arbitrarily.
Yet the actual choice then usually depends on [[aesthetic]] aspects of the sentence.
Generally, this has little impact since most often Colognian speakers prefer wordings avoiding expressions ususing zero as a count.

== Verbs ==
…&lt;!--  to be continued  --&gt;

=== Voices ===
Colognian conjugation has the [[voice (grammar)|voice]]s: [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice|passive]]. Also, there is the [[reflexive (grammar)|reflexive]] which combines [[Voice (grammar)#The middle voice|middle voice]] and [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]].

==== Active ====
…&lt;!--  to be continued  --&gt;

==== Passive ====
…&lt;!--  to be continued  --&gt;

==== Reflexive ====
The reflexive is used, when agent and patient of an action are identical. It can be seen as a [[middle voice]] which is both [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice|passive]] at the same time. There are few [[reflexive verb]]s that are used reflexively only. Many verbs, when used in their reflexive form, carry a connotation of self-contention, or of emotional profit for the agent/patient, there the aspect of being formally reflexive can also be seen as [[Benefactive case|benefactive]]. 
Reflexive can also be [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]]. Since this is predominantly used in generalized speech, semantics diverge from middle voice. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] may help to disambiguate. Grammatical forms are identical, however.
…&lt;!--  to be continued  --&gt;

* Examples&lt;ref name="cge" /&gt; of mandatory middle voice reflexive:
** ''{{lang|ksh|Dat deiht sech bedde}}'' ({{lang|en|She is praying }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|Ech moot mech lääje}}'' ({{lang|en|I had to lay down }})
** ''{{lang|ksh|Ühr kännd Üch he nit uß}}'' ({{lang|en|You do not know the ways here }})

** ''{{lang|ksh|Mer hellef sech}}'' ({{lang|en|People support each other / One finds ways to get along }})

[[File:Skurvogn.JPG|thumb|Modern construction trailer]]
'''Construction trailers''' are mobile structures ([[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]]) used to accommodate temporary offices, dining facilities and storage of [[building material]]s during [[construction]] projects.

==Hook-ups==
Typically, trailers need to be equipped with [[telephone line]]s and [[electrical power]]. [[Portable toilet|Lavatories]] are usually provided for separately.  They are often skid-mounted, on trailers, or put on piles.  Construction trailers are often manufactured using traditional stick-frame construction.  [[Intermodal container]]s are also being converted into construction trailers.

==Use in different countries==
===United States===
Municipalities can require the use of construction trailers to be subject to permit proceedings. The City of [[Fremont, California]], for example, publishes its permit requirements on its municipal website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.fremont.ca.us/Permits/BuildingPermits/ConstructionSiteTrailer.htm |title=City of Fremont, California municipal website |accessdate=26 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Enclosed Cargo Trailers are a very popular tool used by many in the construction industry. Keeping equipment and materials clean and dry are a high priority to anyone that construction industry. These trailers are very user friendly and are multipurpose. Hauling generators, ladders, air compressors and other small to medium sized power tools from one job site to the next is a necessity. 
Construction trailers are ordinarily moved by heavy trucks but may also be moved by rail.

===Europe===
[[File:Wagenburg Zaffaraya Neufeld Bern.JPG|thumb|''Wagenburg'' with several construction trailers in Switzerland]]
There are people in Europe, especially in [[German-speaking Europe]], who live in trailers of this type, and in German there are words for a congregation of these trailers, ''Bauwagenplatz'' and ''Wagenburg''.

In 2008 [[Norway|Norwegian]] media reported that two construction sites (of Byggmester [[Harald Langemyhr]] AS) had been housing Polish workers in construction trailers — 4 workers in each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1352815.ece|title=Forsiden|website=www.dn.no|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|dogsbody}}
A '''dogsbody''', or less commonly '''dog robber''' in the [[Royal Navy]], is a [[junior officer]], or more generally someone who does drudge work. A rough American equivalent would be a "[[gofer]]," "grunt"&lt;ref name="DEFN"&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dog1.htm Dogsbody definition]&lt;/ref&gt; or "lackey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lackey Lackey definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Royal Navy used dried [[pea]]s and [[egg (food)|egg]]s boiled in a bag ([[pease pudding]]) as one of their staple foods circa the early 19th century. [[Sailor]]s nicknamed this item "dog's body". In the early 20th century, junior officers and [[midshipmen]] who performed jobs that more senior officers did not want to do began to be called "dogsbodies".&lt;ref name="DEFN"/&gt; The term became more common in non-naval usage c. 1930, referring to people who were stuck with rough work.&lt;ref name="DEFN"/&gt;

The term dogsbody has not always been derogatory, with a number of people deliberately using it as their callsign or handle. The most famous of these is probably [[Douglas Bader]], who was an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter pilot during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reach for the Sky'', Paul Brickhill&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PointeShoes-Heels.jpg|thumb|right|Pointe shoes with heels. Allows dancer to go from standing on the heel, to standing on the toes (en Pointe)]]

'''Dori shoes''' are dance shoes that combine the toe box of a [[pointe shoe]] with a dance heel approximately 3 inches ( about 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm ) in length. These allow the dancer to combine steps from multiple dance styles with classical ballet, by switching balance from standing on the heel to standing [[en pointe]], and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Womack|first=Jeremy|title=Dori Shoes- Pointes &amp; Heels Dancer Shoe|url=http://www.jeremywomack.com/2010/11/dori-shoes-pointes-heels-dancer-shoe.html|publisher=Jeremy Womack|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127005804/http://www.jeremywomack.com/2010/11/dori-shoes-pointes-heels-dancer-shoe.html|archivedate=2010-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Dorimar Bonilla, a Las Vegas choreographer and dancer originally from Puerto Rico, first created the shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Womack|first=Jeremy|title=Dori Shoes: Pointes and Heels|url=http://www.lasvegasnightlifenetwork.com/photo/albums/dori-shoes-pointes-heels|publisher=Las Vegas Nightlife Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first used for performance at a cabaret show by "The Coquettes" at CatHouse, inside the [[Luxor Hotel]] and casino in Las Vegas. They have also been seen in shows such as "Ran Can Can" in Puerto Rico, "Sin City Comedy" in Las Vegas, and "Broadway Bares- Las Vegas", produced by American theater choreographer and director, [[Jerry Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leach|first=Robin|title=Strip Scribbles|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/luxe-life/2010/may/24/strip-scribbles-mario-lopez-lo-bosworth-host-3rd-a/|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

[[Ballet]] technique is essential to many other dance styles, yet dance shoes made for styles other than ballet make performing ballet moves difficult because they do not include the support to enable dancers to perform [[classical ballet]] moves. At the same time, a traditional pointe shoe does not provide the look that most of today’s dances require. Dori shoes attempt to solve this problem and feature the toe box of a pointe shoe alongside a dance heel: this is meant to allow for multi-functional dancing and performing. The shoes are also intended to help dancers to develop a higher level of technique in their performance because dancers are not limited to a specific style. As with traditional pointe shoes, they are intended only for to be used by professional dancers onstage or students training in dance schools, not as a fashion accessory.

==Construction==

Dori shoes contain a specially designed sole, to allow the combination of a fully functional pointe shoe's toe box with a dance heel. This sole is flexible so that the dancer can flex or point the feet. The heel is approximately {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The exterior is covered with satin and it has a similar look to a traditional pointe shoe. As with traditional pointe shoes, elastic bands and ribbons must be attached to secure the shoe to the feet. The placement of elastic bands and ribbons varies depending on the physique of the dancer. For this reason, they can not be attached in the manufacturing process and instead must be attached by the dancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">'''Double truck''' refers to a pair of facing pages, usually in a [[newspaper]] or [[magazine]], with content that stretches over both pages.

In most newspapers and magazines, the booklet-like format is accomplished by folding large sheets of paper in half. This allows the pages to be opened like a book. Sometimes, usually only in magazines, the pages are [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] or [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]ed at the fold to hold the pages together.

Under this technique, each sheet of paper is actually four separate pages of the finished product. Two pages appear next to each other on the front of the sheet, with the other two likewise on the reverse side. Each time an additional sheet is added, the publication gains four additional pages. Because of this, most newspapers and publications are printed with page multiples of four.

This creates a rather confusing arrangement of pages. For example, in a 16 page newspaper, which uses 4 sheets of paper, the pages are arranged as follows:
* SHEET A FRONT: Pages 16 and 1
* SHEET A BACK: Pages 2 and 15
* SHEET B FRONT: Pages 14 and 3
* SHEET B BACK: Pages 4 and 13
* SHEET C FRONT: Pages 12 and 5
* SHEET C BACK: Pages 6 and 11
* SHEET D FRONT: Pages 10 and 7
* SHEET D BACK: Pages 8 and 9

These press sheets are known as printers pairs. In printers pairs the two pages that are next to each other should always add up to one more than the total number of pages in the finished product, that is if the first page starts with 1.

Notice how, in this example, the two middle pages, 8 and 9, will appear next to each other on the back of sheet D. This creates a double truck.

On a typical newspaper page, there is a margin on all four sides, say 1&amp;nbsp;inch all around. Obviously you don't want print running  right against the edge of the paper, but you also don't want print to run into the fold or where the publication might be stapled. However, when the two pages meet in the middle like 8 and 9 in our example, this isn't a concern because both pages appear right next to each other and lie relatively flat.

In a double truck, the text and images on the pages crosses over the fold. This can create some eye-catching visual effects. For example, newspaper often use a double truck to display large illustrations, graphics, maps or photo collages, often in full color. Often double trucks are saved for special reports or in-depth graphical elements.

In addition, it is also possible to produce double truck advertisements, which are quite eye-catching as well. Typically advertisers pay a premium price for such ads.

Although newspapers are most frequently published with page counts in multiples of four, it is possible to achieve page counts in multiples of two. To do this, a sheet of paper with only one page on each side is added often, but not always, in the center. This sheet, sometimes called a "dink," is half the size of a normal sheet because it doesn't have a mate next to it.  Dinks are generally not used in magazines or bound publications because they cannot be held in place.

==Etymology==
The name "double truck" comes from the days when the heavy forms for newspaper pages (the metal version of each page), largely filled with lead type, were rolled around the composing room floor on heavy carts called trucks. Two pages for one project meant a double truck.&lt;ref name=BWP&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalistic Jargon|publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]]|url=http://www.freep.com/legacy/jobspage/high/jargon.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==

[[File:Drag Queens at High Heel Drag Race.jpg|thumb|Participants of the High Heel Drag Race in Washington, D.C.]]
The use of "drag" in this sense appeared in print as early as 1870&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2012 (Online version of 1989 2nd. Edition) Accessed 11 April&lt;/ref&gt; but its origin is uncertain.  One suggested etymological root is 19th-century theatre slang, from the sensation of long skirts trailing on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=drag] Online Etymology Dictionary: Drag&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the performing arts==
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2017|talk=Verifiability of performing arts section}}
There is a long history of drag in the performing arts, spanning a wide range of cultural as well as artistic traditions.

Drag in the theatre arts manifests two kinds of phenomenon. One is cross-dressing in the performance, which is part of the [[social history]] of theatre. The other is cross-dressing ''within'' the theatrical fiction (i.e. the character is a cross-dresser), which is part of literary history.

Drag is often played for comic effect. Examples include the female characters (at times caricatures) played by male members of [[Monty Python]], and [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' In other cases the comedy may be primarily in the material being performed, and not necessarily in the fact that the women characters are portrayed by men, such as in many [[Kids in the Hall]] sketches.

[[Baden-Powell]], founder of the Scout Movement, was keen on amateur theatricals from Charterhouse public school where, among other roles, he played female operatic roles. In the army he made a speciality of female roles and would often make his own dresses. His stage speciality was what he called his skirt dance.&lt;ref&gt;http://zagria.blogspot.mx/2007/12/something-about-scouts-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
Cross-dressing elements of performance traditions are widespread cultural phenomena. In England, [[actor]]s in [[Shakespeare]]an [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and all Elizabethan theatre, were all male; female parts were played by young men in drag. Shakespeare used the conventions to enrich the gender confusions of ''[[As You Like It]],'' and [[Ben Jonson]] manipulated the same conventions in ''[[Epicœne, or The silent woman|Epicœne, or The Silent Woman]],'' (1609). The plot device of the film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) turns upon this Elizabethan convention. During the reign of Charles II the rules were relaxed to allow women to play female roles on the London stage, reflecting the French fashion, and the convention of men routinely playing female roles consequently disappeared. However, in current-day [[Pantomime|British pantomime]], the [[Pantomime dame]] is a traditional role played by a man in drag, while the [[Principal boy]], such as [[Prince Charming]] or [[Dick Whittington#Dick Whittington—stage character|Dick Whittington]], is played by a girl.

Within the dramatic fiction, a [[double standard]] historically affected the uses of drag. In male-dominated societies where active roles were reserved to men, a woman might dress as a man under the pressures of her dramatic predicament. In these societies a man's position was above a woman's, causing a rising action that suited itself to tragedy, sentimental melodrama and comedies of manners that involved confused identities. A man dressed as a woman was thought to be a falling action only suited to broad low comedy and burlesque. [[Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo]] are an all-male ballet troupe where much of the humor is in seeing male dancers ''[[en travesti]];'' performing roles usually reserved to females, wearing tutus and dancing ''en pointe'' with considerable technical skill.

These conventions of male-dominated societies were largely unbroken before the 20th century, when rigid gender roles were undermined and began to dissolve. This evolution changed drag in the last decades of the 20th century. Among contemporary drag performers, the theatrical drag queen or street queen may at times be seen less as a "[[female impersonator]]" per se, but simply as a [[drag queen]], and the role of the queen existing as an identity based in neither mainstream male nor mainstream female conventions. Examples include [[The Cockettes]], [[Danny La Rue]] or [[RuPaul]].

====In folk custom====
Men dressed or disguised as women have featured in traditional customs and rituals for centuries. For example, the characters of some regional variants of the traditional [[mummers play]], which were traditionally always performed by men, include Besom Bet(ty); numerous variations on Bessy or Betsy; Bucksome Nell; Mrs Clagdarse; Dame Dolly; Dame Dorothy; Mrs Finney; Mrs Frail and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkplay.info/Texts/CastIndex_.htm Master Mummers website: Character Name Index to Folk Play Scripts, Compiled by Peter Millington] Accessed 1 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The variant performed around [[Plough Monday]] in Eastern England is known as the Plough Play&lt;ref name='Hole'&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', p238, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also Wooing Play or Bridal Play)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkplay.info/Notts/Td00023.htm Folkplay Info: ''Bibliography of Nottinghamshire Folk Plays &amp; Related Customs'', E.C. Cawte et al. (1967)] Accessed 1 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and usually involves two female characters, the young "Lady Bright and Gay" and "Old Dame Jane" and a dispute about a bastard child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkplay.info/Texts/89sk63cm.htm Folkplay Info: Cropwell, Notts. Ploughboys' Play - 1890, Chaworth Musters (1890)] Accessed 1 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A character called Bessy also accompanied the Plough Jags (aka Plough Jacks, Plough Stots, Plough Bullocks, etc.) even in places where no play was performed: "she" was a man dressed in women's clothes, who carried a collecting box&lt;ref name='Hole'/&gt; for money and other largesse.

"Maid Marian" of the [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance]] is played by a man, and the Maid Marians referred to in old documents as having taken part in May Games and other festivals with [[Morris dance]]rs would most probably also have been men. The "consort" of the [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] [[Castleton Garland Day|Garland King]] was traditionally a man (until 1956, when a woman took over the role) and was originally simply referred to as "The Woman".&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs,'' p.114, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}. "Until 1956, 'she' was always a man in female dress, veiled and riding side-saddle – the Man-Woman of tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
In Baroque opera, where soprano roles for men were sung by [[castrato|castrati]], [[Handel]]'s heroine Bradamante, in the opera ''[[Alcina]],'' disguises herself as a man to save her lover, played by a male soprano; contemporary audiences were not the least confused. In Romantic [[opera]], certain roles of young boys were written for alto and soprano voices and acted by women ''en travestie'' (in English, in "[[trouser role]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bohemianopera.com/roles_af.htm|title=bohemianopera.com - bohemianopera Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.bohemianopera.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar trouser role in pre-Romantic opera is Cherubino in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]'' (1786). Romantic opera continued the convention: there are trouser roles for women in drag in Rossini's ''Semiramide'' (Arsace), Donizetti's ''Rosamonda d'Inghilterra'' and ''Anna Bolena,'' [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''Benvenuto Cellini,'' and even a page in Verdi's ''Don Carlo.'' The convention was beginning to die out with Siebel, the ingenuous youth in [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''Faust'' (1859) and the gypsy boy Beppe in Mascagni's ''L'Amico Fritz,'' so that Offenbach gave the role of Cupid to a real boy in ''Orphée aux Enfers.'' But [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played Hamlet in tights, giving French audiences a glimpse of Leg (the other in fact being a prosthesis) and Prince Orlovsky, who gives the ball in ''[[Die Fledermaus]],'' is a [[mezzo-soprano]], to somewhat androgynous effect. The use of ''travesti'' in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''Rosenkavalier'' (1912) is a special case, unusually subtle and evocative of its 18th-century setting, and should be discussed in detail at ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]].''

===Film and television===
The self-consciously risqué bourgeois high jinks of Brandon Thomas' ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' (London, 1892) were still viable theatre material in ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' 1978, which was remade, as ''[[The Birdcage]],'' as late as 1996. In the 1890s the slapstick drag traditions of undergraduate productions (notably [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]] at [[Harvard College]], annually since 1891 and at other [[Ivy League]] schools like [[Princeton University]]'s [[Triangle Club]] or the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Mask and Wig]] Club) were permissible fare to the same middle-class American audiences that were scandalized to hear that in [[New York City]], rouged young men in skirts were standing on tables to dance the [[Can-Can]] in [[Bowery]] dives like [[The Slide]]. [[Drag show]]s were popular night club entertainment in New York in the 20s, then were forced underground, until the "Jewel Box Revue" played Harlem's Apollo Theater in the 1950s: "49 men and a girl." The girl received a roar of applause, when she was revealed as the same smart young man in dinner clothes who had been introducing each of the evening's acts. Drag as a last-resort tactic in situational farce (its only permissible format at the time) made a big Hollywood splash in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

For the San Francisco drag troupe, [[The Cockettes]] (1970–72), who performed with glitter eyeshadow and gilded mustaches and beards, the term "[[genderfuck]]" was coined. Drag broke out from underground theatre in the persona of [[Glen Milstead|Divine]] in [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]'s ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972): see also [[Charles Pierce (female impersonator)|Charles Pierce]]. The crowd surrounding [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Factory]] scene of the 1960s–1980s also included some drag queens who achieved a certain amount of fame, such as [[Candy Darling]] and [[Holly Woodlawn]], both immortalized in the [[Lou Reed]] song "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]." The [[Cult movie|cult hit]] movie musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' has inspired several generations of young people to attend performances in drag, although many of these fans would deny that they are actually transvestites.

On American [[network television]], only the broadest slapstick drag tradition was generally represented. Few American TV comedians consistently used drag as a comedy device, among them [[Milton Berle]], [[Flip Wilson]] and [[Martin Lawrence]], although drag characters have occasionally been popular on sketch TV shows like ''[[In Living Color]]'' (with [[Jim Carrey]]'s grotesque female bodybuilder) and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (with the [[Gap Girls]], among others). On the popular 1960s military sitcom, ''[[McHale's Navy]],'' Ensign Parker ([[Tim Conway]]) sometimes had to dress in drag (often with hilarious results) whenever McHale and/or his crew had to disguise themselves in order to carry out their elaborate schemes. ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' occasionally features men dressing in women's clothes, though this was not considered drag since it was not for a performance. The popular Canadian comedy group [[The Kids in the Hall]] also used drag in many of their skits. [[Dame Edna Everage|Dame Edna]], the drag persona of Australian actor [[Barry Humphries]], is the host of several specials, including ''The Dame Edna Experience.'' Dame Edna also tours internationally, playing to sell-out crowds, and has appeared on TV's ''[[Ally McBeal]].''

Dame Edna represents an anomalous example of the drag concept. Her earliest incarnation was unmistakably a man dressed (badly) as a suburban housewife. Edna's manner and appearance became so feminised and glamorised that even some of her TV show guests appear not to see that the Edna character is played by a man. The furor surrounding Dame Edna's "advice" column in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine suggests that one of her harshest critics, actress [[Salma Hayek]], was unaware Dame Edna was a female character played by a man.

On stage and screen, the actor-playwright-screenwriter-producer [[Tyler Perry]] has included his drag character of Madea in some of his most noted productions, such as the stage play ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (play)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'' and the [[Diary of a Mad Black Woman|feature film he based upon it]].

Maximilliana and [[RuPaul]] co-star together in the TV show ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' starring [[Don Johnson]] and [[Cheech Marin]] during the two-part episode "'Cuda Grace." Maximilliana, looking passable, leads one of the investigators to believe she is "real" and sexually advances only to learn there is something extra down there, greatly to his dismay.

In the [[United Kingdom]], drag has been more common in comedy, on both film and television. [[Alastair Sim]] plays the headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton in ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' (1954) and ''[[Blue Murder at St Trinian's]]'' (1957). He played the role straight; no direct joke about the actor's true gender is made. However, Miss Fritton is quite non-feminine in her pursuits of betting, drinking and smoking. The gag is that whilst her school sends out girls into a merciless world, it is the world that need beware. Despite this, or perhaps because of Sim's portrayal, subsequent films in the series went on to use actresses in the headmistress role ([[Dora Bryan]] and [[Sheila Hancock]] respectively). The 21st century re-boot of the series however reverted to drag, with [[Rupert Everett]] in the role.

On television, [[Benny Hill]] portrayed several female characters, the [[Monty Python]] troupe and [[The League of Gentlemen (comedy)|The League of Gentlemen]] often played female parts in their skits. The League of Gentlemen are also credited with the first ever portrayal of "nude drag," where a man playing a female character is shown naked but still with the appropriate female anatomy, like fake breasts and a [[merkin]]. Within the conceit of the sketch/film, they are actually women: it is the audience who are in on the joke.

Monty Python women, whom the troupe called [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#The Pepperpots|pepperpots]], are random middle-aged working/lower middle class typically wearing long brown coats that were common in the 1960s. Save for a few characters played by [[Eric Idle]], they looked and sounded very little like actual women with their caricatural outfits and shrill falsettos. However, when a sketch called for a "real" woman, the Pythons almost always called on [[Carol Cleveland]]. The joke is reversed in the Python film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' where "they" are pretending to be men, including obviously false beards, so that they can go to the stoning. When someone throws the first stone too early the [[Pharisee]] asks "who threw that," and they answer "she did, she did,..." in high voices. "Are there any women here today?" he says, "No no no" they say in gruff voices.

In the 1970s the most familiar drag artist on British television was [[Danny La Rue]]. La Rue's act was essentially a [[music hall]] one, following on from a much older, and less sexualised tradition of drag. His appearances were often in variety shows such as ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'' (itself a pastiche of music hall) and ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''. Such was his popularity that he made a film, ''[[Our Miss Fred]]'' (1972). Unlike the "St Trinians" films, the plot involved a man having to dress as a woman.

[[Kenny Everett]] dragged up in his TV show as an [[wikt:over the top|OTT]] screen star called Cupid Stunt. Kenny was particularly unconvincing as a woman because he had a beard to which a lot of flesh-tone makeup was applied. However she says "all in the best possible taste" as she exposed her knickers as she re-crossed her legs. She is in more of the Dame Edna genre. David Walliams and (especially) Matt Lucas often play female roles in the British television comedy ''[[Little Britain]].'' Walliams also notably plays the part of Emily Howard – a "rubbish transvestite," who makes an unconvincing woman.

In the UK, non-comedic representations of drag acts are less common, and usually a subsidiary feature of another story. A rare exception is the television play (1968) and film (1973), ''[[The Best Pair of Legs in the Business]]''. In the film version [[Reg Varney]] plays a holiday camp comedian and drag artist whose marriage is failing.

===Music===
The world of [[popular music]] has a venerable history of drag. [[Marlene Dietrich]] was a popular actress and singer who sometimes performed dressed as a man, such as in the films ''[[Der blaue Engel|Blue Angel]]'' and ''[[Morocco (1930 film)|Morocco]].'' In the [[glam rock]] era many male performers (such as [[David Bowie]] and [[The New York Dolls]]) donned partial or full drag. This tradition waned somewhat in the late 1970s but was revived in the [[New wave music|new wave]] era of the 1980s, as pop singers [[Boy George]] (of [[Culture Club]]), [[Pete Burns]] (of [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]]), and  [[Philip Oakey]] (of [[The Human League]]), frequently appeared in a sort of semi-drag, while female musicians of the era dabbled in their own form of [[androgyny]], with performers like [[Annie Lennox]], Phranc and The Bloods sometimes performing as drag kings.  The male [[grunge]] musicians of the 1990s sometimes performed wearing deliberately ugly drag – that is, wearing dresses but making no attempt to look feminine, not wearing makeup and often not even shaving their beards. ([[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] did this several times, notably in the [[In Bloom]] video.) However, possibly the most famous drag artist in music in the 1990s was [[RuPaul]]. In Japan there are several musicians in the [[visual kei]] scene, such as [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] ([[Moi dix Mois]] and [[Malice Mizer]]), [[Kaya (Japanese musician)|Kaya]] ([[Schwarz Stein]]), [[Hizaki]] and [[Jasmine You]] (both [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]), who always or usually appear in full or semi-drag. Maximilliana worked with RuPual in the ''Nash Bridges'' episode "Cuda Grace" and was a regular at the now defunct Queen Mary Show Lounge in Studio City, California until the very end. Max (short for Maximilliana) is most well known for her performance as Charlie/Claire in ''[[Ringmaster: the Jerry Springer Movie]].'' Max has also appeared in other movies including ''[[Shoot or Be Shot]]'' and ''[[10 Attitudes]]'' as well as on television shows including ''Nash Bridges'' as mentioned above, ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]],'' ''[[Gilmore Girls]],'' ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]],'' ''[[Mas Vale Tarde with Alex Cambert]],'' ''[[MadTV]],'' ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]],'' ''[[The Tom Joyner Show]],'' ''[[America's Got Talent]],'' and many others. As of November 11, 2011, Maximilliana had released her first album of all original, fun, dance music for the LGBT community and made it available on [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[CdBaby]].

==Drag kings and queens==
{{Further|Drag king|Drag queen|Faux queen|Drag show}}
In gay slang, a "queen" is an effeminate gay man, or a gay man with a specialized quality. Along with "drag," the term "drag queen" has entered the general lexicon.

[[Drag queen]]s (first use in print, 1941) are stereotypically viewed to be [[gay]] men that dress in drag, either as part of a performance or for personal fulfillment. Though a good portion who wear women's clothing are [[cisgender]] men, the term drag queen distinguishes them from [[transvestites]], [[transsexuals]] or [[transgender]] people. Doing drag here often includes wearing dramatically heavy makeup, wigs and prosthetic devices as part of the costume.
Females are called [[drag king]]s; however, ''drag king'' also has a much wider range of meanings. It is currently most often used to describe entertainment (singing or lip-synching) in which there is no necessarily firm correlation between a performer's deliberately macho onstage persona and offstage gender identity or sexual orientation, just as cis males who do female drag for the stage may or may not identify as being either gay or female in personal identity.

==History==
ELAN is developed by the [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]] in [[Nijmegen]]. The first version was released around the year 2000 under the name EAT, Eudico Annotation Tool. It was renamed to ELAN in 2002. Since then, two to three new versions are released each year. It is developed in the programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with interfaces to platform native media frameworks developed in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Objective-C]].

'''Ergative–absolutive languages''', or '''ergative languages''' are languages that share a certain distinctive pattern relating to the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] (technically, [[verb argument|arguments]]) of verbs. Examples are [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and several [[Indo-European languages]], such as the [[Kurdish languages]] including [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]]. 

In an ergative language, the single argument ("[[subject (grammar)|subject]]") of an [[intransitive verb]] behaves like the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, and differently from the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]].&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1989), p. 110ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages, such as [[English language|English]] and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She walks.") behaves grammatically like the agent of a transitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She finds it.") but differently from the object of a transitive verb ("him" in the sentence "She likes him.").

In ergative–absolutive languages with [[grammatical case]], the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the [[ergative case|ergative]]. In nominative–accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the [[nominative case|nominative]] while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the [[accusative case|accusative]]. 

There is a variant group, the [[Tripartite language|ergative-accusative languages]] (such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]), which function ergatively with respect to nouns but are nominative-accusative with pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. W. Dixon]], ''Searching for Aboriginal Languages:Memoirs of a Field Worker,'' Cambridge University Press 2011 p.163&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--He says that Dyirbal is nominative-accusative with pronouns, but he doesn't call that pattern "ergative-accusative"--&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

==Ergative vs. accusative languages==

An ergative language maintains a [[syntax|syntactic]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] equivalence (such as the same [[word order]] or [[grammatical case]]) for the object of a transitive verb and the single core argument of an intransitive verb, while treating the agent of a transitive verb differently.

This contrasts with [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages such as [[English language|English]], where the single [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an intransitive verb and the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] of a transitive verb (both called the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of a transitive verb.

{{Clear|left}}

(reference for figure:  &lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;)

These different arguments are usually symbolized as follows:
* '''A''' = agent of transitive verb
* '''O''' = object of transitive verb (also symbolized as '''P''' for "patient")
* '''S''' = core argument of intransitive verb

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="5"
!
! Ergative–absolutive
! Nominative–accusative
|-
| '''A'''
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ERG&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''O'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''S'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|}

''See [[morphosyntactic alignment]] for a more technical explanation and a comparison with [[nominative–accusative language]]s.''

Note that the word ''subject'', as it is typically defined in grammars of nominative–accusative languages, has a different application when referring to ergative–absolutive languages, or when discussing [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in general.

Ergative languages tend to be either verb-final or verb-initial; there are few, if any, ergative [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]-languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~asw/lab/lab87/LAB87_lahne.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realization of ergativity==
Ergativity can be found in both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntactic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;For a kind of "phonological" ergativity, see Rude (1983), also Vydrin (2011) for a detailed critique.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological ergativity===
If the language has morphological [[grammatical case|case]], then the [[verb argument]]s are marked thus:
* The agent of a transitive verb ('''A''') is marked as [[ergative case]], or as a similar case such as [[oblique case|oblique]].
* The core argument of an intransitive verb ('''S''') and the object of a transitive verb ('''O''') are both marked with [[absolutive case]].&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no case marking, ergativity can be marked through other means, such as in verbal morphology. For instance, [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and most [[Mayan languages]] have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative–absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most [[markedness|unmarked]] form of a word (exceptions include [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]]&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark (2008). "Semantic alignment systems: what's what, and what's not". In Donohue, Mark &amp; Søren Wichmann, eds. (2008). ''The Typology of Semantic Alignment''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The following examples from [[Basque language|Basque]] demonstrate an ergative–absolutive case marking system:

|-

| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;intrans&lt;/sub&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;
|-

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan="3" | "Martin saw Diego."
|}

Here "-Ø" represents a [[Null morpheme|zero morpheme]], as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are "-k" after a vowel, and "-ek" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a [[determiner]]. The default determiner (commonly called the [[Article (grammar)|article]], which is suffixed to [[Noun|common nouns]] and usually translatable by "the" in English) is "-a" in the singular and "-ak" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for "gizon" ("man" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is [[Homophony|homophonous]] with the ergative singular. See [[Basque grammar]] for details.&lt;ref&gt;King, Alan R. ''The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction.'' Reno: University of Nevada Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a nominative–accusative language:

{| class="wikitable"

| colspan="2" | ''Otoko ga tsuita.''
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

| kodomo &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''o'''&lt;/span&gt;
| mita
|-

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| man &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;NOM&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| child &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| saw
|-
! Function:
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;intrans&lt;/sub&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Translation:
| colspan="2" | "The man arrived."
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan="3" | "The man saw the child."
|}

In this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same [[nominative case]] particle ''ga'', while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the [[accusative case]] o.

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

Accusative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:He (S) traveled.

(S form = A form)

Hypothetical ergative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:Him (S) traveled.

(S form = O form)

A number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative–accusative marking on verbs and ergative–absolutive case marking on nouns.

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the [[perfective]] aspect (also known as the "aorist [[screeve]]"). Compare:

: ''K'ac'i vašls č'ams.'' (''კაცი ვაშლს ჭამს'') "The man is eating an apple."
:''K'ac''''ma''' vašli č'ama.'' (''კაცმა ვაშლი ჭამა'') "The man ate an apple."

''K'ac'-'' is the root of the word "man". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ''(k'ac'i).'' In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix ''-ma''.

However, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:

:''K'ac''''ma''' daacemina.'' (''კაცმა დააცემინა'') "The man sneezed."

Although the verb ''sneeze'' is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as "sneeze" used to have a direct object (the object being "nose" in the case of "sneeze") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.

===Syntactic ergativity===
Ergativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying “Arrived I” for “I arrived”, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.

Syntactic ergativity may appear in:
* [[Word order]] (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)
* [[Syntactic pivot]]s
* [[Relative clause]]s – determining which arguments are available for relativization
* [[Subordination (linguistics)|Subordination]]
* [[Switch reference]]

====Example====

Example of syntactic ergativity in the "[[conjunction reduction]]" construction ([[coordinated clause]]s) in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] in contrast with English conjunction reduction. (The subscript (i) indicates coreference.)

[[English language|English]] ([[Agent–verb–object|SVO]] word order):
# Father returned.
# Father saw mother.
# Mother saw father.
# Father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; returned and father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; saw mother.
# Father returned and ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; saw mother.
# Father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; returned and mother saw father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;.
#* Father returned and mother saw ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;. (ill-formed, because S and deleted O cannot be [[coreference|coreferential]].)

[[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] ([[Object–subject–verb|OSV]] word order):
# Ŋuma banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u. (''Father returned.'')
# Yabu ŋumaŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Mother father-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father saw mother.'')
# Ŋuma yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Mother saw father.'')
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, yabu ŋumaŋgu&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, mother father-''ŋgu&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, father saw mother.'')
#* Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, yabu ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; buṛan. (lit. *''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, mother ____''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' saw''; ill-formed, because S and deleted A cannot be coreferential.)
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, mother saw father.'')
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, ____''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, mother saw father.'')

===Split ergativity===
{{main|Split ergativity}}
The term ''ergative–absolutive'' is considered unsatisfactory by some, since there are very few languages without any patterns that exhibit [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative alignment]]. Instead they posit that one should only speak of ''ergative–absolutive systems'', which languages employ to different degrees.

Many languages classified as ergative in fact show '''split ergativity''', whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. [[Basque language|Basque]] is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], though it shows thoroughly nominative–accusative [[Morphosyntactic alignment|syntactic alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/agreementbasque1.pdf. Retrieved 5 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi]], the ergative case is marked on agents in the [[preterite]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses for transitive and [[ditransitive verb]]s, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.

:''laṛkā kitāb kharīdtā hai''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-NOMINATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-IMPERFECT-MASCULINE be-PRESENT&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy buys a book."

:''laṛke ne kitāb kharīdī''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-ERGATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-PERFECT-FEMININE&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy bought a book."

::''(¹) The grammatical analysis has been simplified to show the features relevant to the example.''


In the Northern Kurdish language [[Kurmanji]], the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and "future in the past" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:
:(1) Ez diçim. (I go)
:(2) Ez wî dibînim. (I see him.)
:(3) Ew diçe. (He goes)
:(4) Ew min dibîne. (He sees me.)

but:
:(5) Ez çûm. (I went)
:(6) Min ew dît. (I saw him.)
:(7) Ew çû. (He went.)
:(8) Wî ez dîtim. (He saw me.)

In sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.  

In [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.

===Optional ergativity===

Many languages with ergative marking display what is known as ''optional ergativity'', where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly ''optional'' but is affected by [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Note that unlike [[split ergativity]], which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.

Optional ergativity may be motivated by:
* The [[animacy]] of the subject, with more ''animate'' subjects more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[semantics]] of the verb, with more ''active'' or ''transitive'' verbs more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[grammatical structure]] or [tense-aspect-mood]

Languages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2010) Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective. ''Lingua'' 120: 1610–1636&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of ergative languages==
Prototypical ergative languages are, for the most part, restricted to specific regions of world: the [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), [[Caucasus]], [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|the Americas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and [[Australia]] and parts of [[New Guinea]].

Some specific languages are the following:

'''Americas'''

* [[Chinook languages]]
* [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskaleut languages]]
* [[Guaicuruan languages]]
* [[Macro-Je languages]]
* [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]
* [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoque]]
* [[Panoan languages]]
* [[Tsimshian languages|Tsimshian]]

'''Africa'''

'''Sign languages''' −− (for example, [[Nepalese Sign Language#NSL Morhosyntax|Nepali Sign Language]]) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of [[Actant#In linguistics|actant]] incorporation in verbs.&lt;ref&gt;MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s that have been studied, [[classifier handshape]]s are incorporated into verbs, indicating the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verb]]s when incorporated, and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s. (If we follow the "[[Semantic Phonology]]" model proposed by [[William Stokoe]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in [[Nepali Sign Language]] the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a [[manual alphabet]] handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the [[Object (grammar)|object]].)

Many other languages have limited ergativity. In both [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Hindi]] ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]), ergative behavior occurs only in the [[preterite]] and [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses, and in the [[Georgian language|Georgian]], ergativity only occurs in the [[perfective]].

The [[Philippine languages]] (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) are sometimes considered ergative (Schachter 1976, 1977; Kroeger 1993), however they have also been considered to have their own unique morphosyntactic alignment. See [[Austronesian alignment]].

Several scholars have hypothesized that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was an ergative language. However, this hypothesis is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavant |first=Marc |title=Proto-Indo-European Ergativity... Still To Be Discussed |journal=Poznań Studies in Contemporary Linguistics |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=433–447 |doi=10.2478/v10010-008-0022-y |url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/r26389132nk67172/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximations of ergativity in English==

English has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix "-ee" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:

:"John has retired" → "John is a retiree"
:"John has escaped" → "John is an escapee"

However, with a transitive verb, adding "-ee" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:

:"Susie employs Mike" → "Mike is an employee"
:"Mike has appointed Susie" → "Susie is an appointee"

Etymologically, the sense in which "-ee" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French [[past participle]]s in "-é". This is still the prevalent sense in [[British English]]: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except "escapee" are still marked as "chiefly U.S." by the "[[Oxford English Dictionary]]".

English also has a number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.

When English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition "of" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with "of"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with "by" as in a passive construction):

:"(a dentist) extracts a tooth" → "the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)"
:"(I/The editor) revised the essay" → "(my/the editor's) revision of the essay"
:"(I was surprised that) the water boiled" → "(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water"
:"I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)" → "My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)"

'''Gulf''' is a proposed native [[North America]]n language family composed of the [[Muskogean languages]], along with four [[language isolates]]: [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and (possibly) [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. 

Gulf was proposed as a language family by [[Mary Haas]] (Haas 1951, 1952), but the family has not been rigorously established by the comparative method. Historical linguists such as [[Lyle Campbell]] (Campbell and Mithun 1979, Campbell 1997) list the relationship as unproven, though a number of Muskogean scholars believe that Muskogean is at least related to Natchez (Campbell 1997:305). 

However, it is considered by a number of specialists on Muskogean languages, including Mary Haas and [[Pamela Munro]]. Munro (1995) has regarded the hypothesis of a Gulf family of languages as promising; Haas thought the closest language to Muskogean would be Natchez, followed by Tunica, Atakapa, and, rather dubiously, Chitimacha. A difficulty in evaluating the hypothesis is the lack of available data. Most of the data on Chitimacha and Natchez is still unpublished and held in archives.

This holds e. g. for [[Noaidi|shamanism among Sami groups]]. Some of their shamanistic beliefs and practice shared important features with [[Shamanism in Siberia|those of some Siberian cultures]].&lt;ref name=samsib&gt;Voigt 1966: 296&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their [[yoik]]s were sung on shamanistic rites,&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).&lt;ref name=swap&gt;Voigt 1966: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, yoiks are sung in two different styles, one of these are sung only by young people. But the traditional one may be the other, the “mumbling” style, resembling to magic spells.&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surprising characteristics of yoiks can be explained by comparing the music [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, as observed in yoiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. Some yoiks intend to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel/&gt; This  can be contrasted to [[bel canto]], which intends to exploit human speech organs on the highest level to achieve an almost “superhuman” sound.&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===

[[Shamanism in Siberia]] is far from being homogeneous. In some of the various cultures there, mimicking natural sounds can be present: some instances of [[overtone singing]], and also certain shamanic songs of some cultures can be examples.

==== Samoyedic ====

The seance of [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] shamans were accompanied by women imitating the sounds of the reindeer calf, (thought to provide fertility for those women).&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, A. Popov observed the Nganasan shaman Dyukhade Kosterkin imitating the sound of polar bear: the shaman was believed to have transformed into a polar bear.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obi-Ugric ====

A Russian traveler described a [[Khanty people|Khanty]] shamanic séance: it took place in the [[birch bark]] tent in full darkness. Only the song and the [[dombra]] music of the shaman could be heard: he invoked his spirits. It was mimicked as if the direction of the sound were moving: it sounded as if the shaman had flown around in the tent and left. Later, the voices of various animals (cuckoo, owl, [[hoopoe]], duck, squirrel) could be heard. Then it was imitated as if the shaman had flown back into the tent, singing his song.&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Altai ====

Among several peoples near the [[Altai Mountains]], the new drum of a shaman must go through a special ritual. This is regarded as “making the drum alive”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and skin for the new drum narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a [[libation]]: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with the voice of the shaman in the name of the tree and the deer. Among the [[Tubalar]], this means literally the imitation of the behavior and the voice of the animal by the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli01|Eliade 2001]]: 164 (= Chpt 5 discussing the symbolics of shamanic drum and costume, the subsection about the drum)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Soyots|Soyot]] shamanic song, sounds of bird and wolf are imitated to represent helping spirits of the shaman.&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Interculturalism''' refers to support for [[Cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural dialogue]] and challenging [[Auto-segregation|self-segregation]] tendencies within cultures.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Multiculturalism's Double-Bind: Creating Inclusivity Cosmopolitanism and Difference. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009. P. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Interculturalism involves moving beyond mere passive acceptance of a multicultural fact of multiple cultures effectively existing in a society and instead promotes dialogue and interaction between cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ibanez B. Penas, Ma. Carmen López Sáenz. Interculturalism: Between Identity and Diversity. Bern: Peter Lang AG, 2006. P. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interculturalism has arisen in response to criticisms of existing policies of [[multiculturalism]], such as criticisms that such policies had failed to create inclusion of different cultures within society, but instead have divided society by legitimizing segregated separate communities that have isolated themselves and accentuated their specificity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is based on the recognition of both differences and similarities between cultures.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Hans van Ewijk. ''European Social Policy and Social Work: Citizenship-Based Social Work''. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. P. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; It has addressed the risk of the creation of absolute [[relativism]] within [[postmodernity]] and in multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her work ''Cultivating Humanity'', describes interculturalism as involving "the recognition of common human needs across cultures and of dissonance and critical dialogue within cultures" and that interculturalists "reject the claim of [[identity politics]] that only members of a particular group have the ability to understand the perspective of that group".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Femi James Kolapo. ''Immigrant Academics and Cultural Challenges in a Global Environment''. Amherst, New York, USA: Cambria Press, 2008. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Rattansi, in his book ''Multiculturalism: A Very Short Introduction'' (2011) argues that Interculturalism offers a more fruitful way than conventional multiculturalism for different ethnic groups to co-exist in an atmosphere that encourages both better inter-ethnic understanding and civility; he provides useful examples of how interculturalist projects in the UK have shown in practice a constructive way forward for promoting multi-ethnic civility. Based on a considerable body of research, he also sets out the outlines of a new interpretation of global history which shows that concepts of tolerance are not restricted to the West, and that what is usually regarded as a unique Western cultural achievement should more appropriately be regarded as a Eurasian achievement. He thus offers a more interculturalist view of global history which undermines notions of 'a clash of civilisations'.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Interculturalism has both supporters and opponents amongst people who endorse multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Gerald Delanty views interculturalism as capable of incorporating multiculturalism within it.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Delanty. Community: 2nd edition. Routledge, 2009. P. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Nussbaum views interculturalism as distinct from multiculturalism and notes that several humanities professors have preferred interculturalism over multiculturalism because they view multiculturalism as being "associated with relativism and identity politics".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]]' agency [[UNESCO]] adopted the [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]] in 2005 that declares support for interculturality.&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 4 Paragraph 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], all universities are required to have a section on [[intercultural competence]] in their [[social work]] programs, that involves students being able to be open to listen and communicate with people of different cultural backgrounds, have knowledge of the backgrounds of cultural groups, knowledge of existing stereotypes and prejudices involving cultural groups, and other criteria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Salman Cheema, the Head of Marketing and Communications of the [[British Council]], in an article titled "From Multiculturalism to Interculturalism – A British perspective", spoke of an event co-hosted by the British Council and [[Canada]]'s [[Institute for Research on Public Policy]] (IRPP) in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada on April 11, 2013, interculturalist advocate Phil Wood declared that multiculturalism has faced serious problems that need to be resolved through interculturalism, and rejected those opponents of multiculturalism who seek to restore a pre-multiculturalist [[monoculturalism|monoculturalist]] society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishcouncil.ca/from-multiculturalism-to-interculturalism-a-british-perspective. http://www.britishcouncil.ca/our-team (background on Salman Cheema)&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later in Montreal, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party of Canada]] (NDP) declared support for interculturalism in the preamble of its constitution adopted its federal convention held in Montreal on April 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/ndp-convention-a-new-preamble-is-approved/|title=NDP convention: A new preamble is approved|date=14 April 2013|publisher=Macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Movement Writing Alphabet''' (IMWA) is a set of symbols that can be used to describe and record movement. Its creator, Valerie Sutton, also invented ''MovementWriting'', which employs IMWA in four general application areas: [[SignWriting]] for [[sign language]], [[DanceWriting]] as a form of [[dance notation]], MimeWriting for classic [[mime]], and SportsWriting for [[ice skating]] and [[gymnastics]].

==Identification numbers==
The IMWA has more than 27,000 elements that are represented by unique identification numbers. Each identification number specifies six attributes—{{clarify span|category, group, symbol, variation, fill, and rotation|date=April 2014}}—as dash-separated values. The symbol is specified with a three-digit value whereas all other attributes use a two-digit value (e.g., 01-01-001-01-01-01).

There are eight categories: hand, movement, face, head, upper body, full body, space, and punctuation.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

There are 40 groups{{clarify|date=April 2014}}. The {{clarify span|keyboard design and symbol palette|date=April 2014}} are based on the 40 groups.

==History==
[[File:Explaining ase Wikipedia at SDPL jeh.jpg|thumb|Valerie Sutton]]
The IMWA was originally designed for describing sign language and consequently was named ''Sutton's Sign Symbol Sequence'' (SSS) by its inventor, Valerie Sutton. The original symbol set, SSS-95, was limited in size due to memory constraints in personal computers at the time. The SSS-99 symbol set expanded the number of symbols, and the SSS-2002 set was the first to use the current identification numbering system. The final version, SSS-2004, was renamed ''International Movement Writing Alphabet'' (SSS-IMWA) to reflect its usefulness in applications beyond sign language.

'''Kalikananda Abadhut''' (1910 – 13 April 1978) was a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] saint novelist and traveller.

==Biography==
Abadhut born to Anathnath Mukherjee in [[Bhowanipore]], [[Kolkata]]. His real name was Dulala Chandra Mukherjee but he took a pen name Kalikananda Abadhut.

The '''languages of Uttar Pradesh''' generally belong to two zones in the [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Indo-Aryan languages#Central Zone (Madhya or Hindi)|Central]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages#Eastern Zone|East]]. Hindi is the state's official language (Urdu is co-official), and according to census data, it is spoken by 91.32% of the population.&lt;ref name="2011lang"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM52ndReport.pdf |title = Report of the Commissioner for linguistic minorities: 52nd report (July 2014 to June 2015) |pages = 49–53 |publisher = Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities, Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hindi is a wide label that covers many dialects, which may or not be considered separate languages and may or may not be fully mutually intelligible. These include [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], [[Braj Bhasha]], [[Bundeli language|Bundeli]], [[Bagheli language|Bagheli]], [[Kannauji language|Kannauji]], [[Khariboli]] (all of these belonging [[Indo-Aryan languages#Central Zone (Madhya or Hindi)|Central zone]], considered to be the core of the [[Hindi belt]]) and [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]]. Bhojpuri belongs to the [[Bihari languages]] of the [[Indo-Aryan languages#Eastern Zone|Eastern zone]], and its status as a Hindi language is subject to debate.

==History==

The languages of Uttar Pradesh mainly derive from the [[Prakrits]] of the Old Indo-Aryan languages, and ultimately [[Sanskrit]].

==Inventories==

Linguists generally distinguish the terms "language" and "dialects" on the basis of 'mutual comprehension'. The Indian census uses two specific classifications in its own unique way: (1) 'language' and (2) 'mother tongue'. The 'mother tongues' are grouped within each 'language'. Many 'mother tongues' so defined would be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is specifically the case for many 'mother tongues' with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the 'language' Hindi.

==Official languages==

The languages of state administration are [[Modern Standard Hindi|Hindi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uplegassembly.nic.in/UPLL.HTML |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619093010/http://www.uplegassembly.nic.in/UPLL.HTML |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; established by the Uttar Pradesh Official Language Act, 1951, and [[Urdu]], established by the Amendment to the same in 1989.

==Writing systems==

{{see also|Kaithi|Devanagari|Nastaliq}}

Devanagari is the main script used to write Uttar Pradesh languages, although Urdu is written in the [[Nastaliq]] style of the [[Perso-Arabic script]]. [[Kaithi]] was widely used historically.

The [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]] was formed in 1893 to promote the usage of the [[Devanagari]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempweb34.nic.in/xnagari/html/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410082202/http://tempweb34.nic.in/xnagari/html/index.php |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ledger line''' refers to the parallel lines incised or sculpted around the edge of the top surface of a mediaeval [[tombstone]] (or "ledger-stone"), laid on the floor of a church or on a [[chest tomb]] (or "altar-tomb"), within which lines is inscribed memorial text, generally in gothic script. Thus the phrase "Inscribed on a ledger line", commonly found in the writings of English [[Antiquary|antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[William Henry Hamilton Rogers|Rogers, William Henry Hamilton]], ''The Antient Sepulchral Effigies and Monumental and Memorial Sculpture of Devon'', Exeter, 1877, p.76[http://www.mocavo.co.uk/The-Ancient-Sepulchral-Effigies-and-Monumental-and-Memorial-Sculpture-of-Devon-2/392542/257]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of Hebrew words of Persian origin''' will contain the words loaned from [[Persian language]] to the [[Hebrew language]]. As the [[Jews]] lived as an exiled and homecoming population for almost 2 centuries under the [[Persian Empire]], many of them borrowed words spoken within the empire and these words stucked with Hebrew for the generations to come and helped shaping Hebrew's set of vocabulary for terms the [[Israelites]] weren't familiar with prior to living and interacting with Persians. The name of the Persian monarch who let the Jews [[Return to Zion]], [[Cyrus the Great]], is a character beloved by the Jews for his part in their history.

==Botanics==
* ''[[Etrog]]'' - אתרוג = A fruit, it derives from the Persian word "turung" which means "Greenish-Yellowish" (originally from [[Tamil language]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.safa-ivrit.org/imported/persian.php List of Hebrew words of Persian origin] in Hebrew&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Fistuk'' - פיסטוק = [[Pistachio]]. Comes from "pistah" in Persian.
* ''Limon'' - לימון = [[Lemon]], in Persian it's a general name for [[citrus]].
* ''Lilach'' - לילך = A lighter shade of [[purple]], and also the Hebrew name of [[Syringa]]. Derives from "nilak" in Persian.
* ''Pardes'' - פרדס = [[Orchard]]. This word was also the core for "[[Paradise]]".
* ''Shoshana'' - שושנה = [[Rose]]. From the name of the once capital of the Persian Empire, [[Shushan]].
* ''Sukar'' - סוכר = [[Sugar]], from the Persian word "shakar" that was borrowed from [[Sanskrit]].

==Politics==
* ''Saris'' - סריס = A male servant to the monarch who was steralized to prevent him from having any hopes of usurping the throne.
* ''Gizbar'' - גזבר = A man in-charge of the money and taxes of the local community. Comes from "ganzabara" in Persian which means: "Holder of the Treasury".

[[File:Modus ponens logical form.jpg|thumb|This logical argument utilizing [[modus ponens]] makes use of three statements in logical form expressed in simplified English.]]
{{Hatnote|This article is about the term as used in logic. For the linguistics term, see [[Logical form (linguistics)]].}}
{{Redirect|Argument structure|the possible complements of a verb in linguistics|verb argument}}
In  [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], a '''logical form''' of a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] expression is a precisely-specified [[Semantics|semantic]] version of that expression in a [[formal system]]. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly [[Ambiguity (syntax)|ambiguous]] statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal [[formal language]], the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from [[syntax]] alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one [[string (computer science)|string]] that represents the same logical form in a given language.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, CUP 1999, pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical form of an [[argument]] is called the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of the argument.

==History==
The importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. [[Aristotle]], in the [[Prior Analytics]], was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.

According to the followers of Aristotle like [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]], only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms.  The concrete terms ''man'', ''mortal'', etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek ''hyle'', Latin ''materia'') of the argument.

The term "logical form" itself was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called [[philosophical logic]]. Russell wrote: "Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsY9g_DDA9MC&amp;pg=PA53 Russell, Bertrand. 1914(1993). Our Knowledge of the External World: as a field for scientific method in philosophy. New York: Routledge. p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PreyerPeter2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gerhard Preyer |editor2=Georg Peter |title=Logical form and language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioVFUN8yd9QC&amp;pg=PA54 |year=2002 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-924555-0 |page=54 |chapter=What is logical form? |author=Ernie Lepore |author2=Kirk Ludwig}} [http://www.indiana.edu/~socrates/papers/What%20is%20Logical%20Form.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of argument form ==
To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.
;Original argument
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
;Argument form
:All ''H'' are ''M''.
:''S'' is ''H''.
:Therefore, ''S'' is ''M''.

All we have done in the ''Argument form'' is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the ''form'' of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the ''Argument form'' is the ''sentence form'' of its respective sentence in the original argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Patrick J.|title=A concise introduction to logic|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, Calif.|year=1988|isbn=0-534-08928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of argument form==
Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[Validity (logic)|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bassham, Gregory | title=Critical thinking : a student's introduction | publication-date=2012 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-07-803831-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]]. 

;Affirming the consequent
:All dogs are animals.
:Coco is an animal.
:Therefore, Coco is a dog.

;Denying the antecedent
:All cats are animals.
:Missy is not a cat.
:Therefore, Missy is not an animal.

A logical [[argument]], seen as an [[ordered set]] of sentences, has a logical form that [[compositionality|derives]] from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form.&lt;ref name="BeallBeall2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Beall|title=Logic: the Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLnTavNvIqYC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77498-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors only define logical form with respect to whole arguments, as the [[schema (logic)|schemata]] or inferential structure of the argument.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi |title=Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA386|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[argumentation theory]] or [[informal logic]], an argument form is sometimes seen as a broader notion than the logical form.&lt;ref name="Pinto2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Pinto|title=Argument, inference and dialectic: collected papers on informal logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK0a5CgyV7kC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-7005-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to ''the subject matter'' of the argument by [[schematic variable]]s.  Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.

==Logical form in modern logic==

The fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat:  
*On the traditional view, the form of the sentence consists of (1) a subject (e.g., "man") plus a sign of quantity ("all" or "some" or "no"); (2) the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which is of the form "is" or "is not"; (3) a predicate (e.g., "mortal"). Thus: 'all men are mortal'. The logical constants such as "all", "no" and so on, plus sentential connectives such as "and" and "or" were called [[syncategorematic]] terms (from the Greek ''kategorei'' – to predicate, and ''syn'' – together with). This is a fixed scheme, where each judgment has a specific quantity and copula, determining the logical form of the sentence. 
*The modern view is more complex, since a single judgement of Aristotle's system involves two or more logical connectives. For example, the sentence "All men are mortal" involves, in term logic, two non-logical terms "is a man" (here ''M'') and "is mortal" (here ''D''): the sentence is given by the judgement ''A(M,D)''. In [[predicate logic]], the sentence involves the same two non-logical concepts, here analyzed as &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the sentence is given by &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (m(x) \rightarrow d(x))&lt;/math&gt;, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]]. 

The more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving [[logical connective]]s, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the [[problem of multiple generality]], where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as "Some guys have all the luck", because both quantities "all" and "some" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.

'''Muircheartach mac Con Ceartaich Mac Liag''', aka '''Muircheartach Beag''', Irish poet, died 1015.

MacLiag was [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]]. He was a native of South Connacht and died in 1015. He was the chief poet and secretary of King [[Brian Boru]]. He is supposedly the source of the history of [[Brian Boru]] called   [[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]] (English: The War of the Irish with the Foreigners).

His obit is given in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] as follows- “M1015.7 Macliag, i.e. Muircheartach, son of Cuceartach, chief poet of Ireland at that time, died. The following was Macliag's first quatrain: 
1.	Muircheartach Beag, son of Maelcertach, who has been herding the cows, 
It is more worthy that he retaliates not,—give him a handful of findraip (corn).
His last quatrain was this: 
1.	O Bell, which art at the head of my pillow, to visit thee no friends come; 
Though thou makest thy ‘ding dang,’ it is by thee the salt is measured.”. (This is a very early example of the phrase “ding dong” to describe the sound a bell makes. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] only manages to trace the phrase back to the 15th century. They are currently investigating this quote from the annals with a view to amending their entry)

His obit is given in the [[Annals of Ulster]] as follows- “U1016.3 Mac Liag, chief ollav of Ireland, died.”

His obit is given in the [[Annals of Loch Cé]] as follows- “LC1016.1  Mac Liag, chief poet of Erinn, mortuus est.”

His obit is given in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]] as follows- “Annal CS1016 Kalends. Mac Liac i.e. Muirchertach, chief ollamh of Ireland, an excellent man, dies in Inis Gaill Duibh on the Sinna. Mac Liac's first verse: 
1.	Little Muircertach, son of Maelcertach, 
Who is wont to be herding the cows— 
He is the innocent who attempts not to wound; 
Give him a handful of finnraip.(corn)”

In [[analytic philosophy]], the term '''natural kind''' identifies a grouping of singular objects that always share particular qualities, whether or not humans know either the objects or the qualities.  A natural kind labels a "real" structure in the natural world, not an artificial result of human reasoning, by which scholars try to explain common sense knowledge with scientific knowledge.

Those who believe in natural kinds debate their structure and how it can be known.  The structure of kinds is assumed to be stable despite worldly experience of constant flux.  According to tradition, natural kinds can be known in two forms: as knowledge of general ideas about kinds, acquired by [[deductive reasoning]], and as knowledge of observable examples of kinds, known by [[inductive reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Dew38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: The Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|date=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419–20}}

Results of deductive and inductive reasoning are stated in [[propositions]] that express relations among objects and their qualities.  For example: "All water is &lt;math&gt;H_2 O&lt;/math&gt;." "All men are mortal." "All crows are black."

Believers in natural kinds claim such propositions describe objects and related qualities that exist.  But they recognize that inductive propositions about "all" of a kind are problematic, because no-one can observe "all" of anything.  Drawing conclusions about all members of a kind after observing a small sample appears illogical.  But this kind of reasoning appears to be necessary, and often "works," meaning proves to be able to identify stable kinds.

Scientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study into ''kinds'' and theorize about those kinds.  To say that a kind is ''natural'' is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests and actions of human beings.  We tend to assume that science is often successful in revealing these kinds; it is a [[corollary]] of [[scientific realism]] that when all goes well the [[Categorization|classifications]] and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] employed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature.  The existence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to justify our scientific inferences and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=

This article identifies some contentious issues surrounding natural kinds. It presents a minority view expressed by John Dewey that natural kinds are a false conclusion of contaminated instrumental reasoning. It presents several majority views expressed by four more recent scholars—W. V. O. Quine, Hilary Kornblith, Hasok Chang, and Rasmus Winther—that natural kinds are real and important scientific facts.

==John Dewey==
In 1938, [[John Dewey]] published ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry.''  He there explained how modern scientists practice induction and deduction, and why they have no use for natural kinds.

The philosophical issue is how humans can infer one kind of thing from another.  The traditional answer grew out of Aristotle's assertion that humans describe entities they know in two kinds of propositions.  Existential kinds known by observation are stated in "generic" propositions.  Conceptual kinds known by reasoning are stated in "universal" propositions.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|529–32}}

Dewey argued that modern scientists do not follow Aristotle in treating inductive and deductive propositions as facts already known about nature's stable structure.  They treat propositions as intermediate steps in inquiry, hypotheses about processes displaying stable patterns.  Aristotle's generic and universal propositions have become tools of inquiry rather than results of inquiry.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Propositions as such are ... provisional, intermediate and instrumental.  Since their subject-matter concerns two kinds of means, material and procedural, they are of two main categories: (1) Existential [generic means, known by induction], referring directly to actual conditions, as determined by experimental observation, and (2) ideational or conceptual [universal means, known by deduction], consisting of interrelated meanings, which are non-existential in content ... but which are applicable to existence through the operations they represent as possibilities.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|283–4}}

Modern induction starts with a question to be answered or a problem to be solved.  It identifies problematic subject-matter and seeks potentially relevant qualities and conditions.  Generic existential data thus identified are reformulated—stated abstractly as if-then universal relations capable of serving as answers or solutions.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No grounded generic propositions can be formed save as they are the products of the performance of operations indicated as possible by universal propositions.  The problem of inference is, accordingly, to discriminate and conjoin those qualities [kinds] of existential material that serve as distinguishing traits (inclusively and exclusively) of a determinate kind.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|275}}

Dewey described these abstract steps concretely with the example of the kind "morning dew."  From antiquity, the common-sense belief had been that "All dew is a kind of rain," meaning dew drops fall.  By the early 1800s the curious absence of rain and the growth of understanding led scientists to examine new qualities.  Functional qualities of bodies [kinds] as solid-liquid-gas at different temperatures, and operational constants of conduction and radiation, led to new inductive hypotheses "directly suggested by ''this'' subject-matter, not by any data [kinds] previously observable.  ....  There were certain [existential] conditions postulated in the content of the new [non-existential] conception about dew, and it had to be determined whether these conditions were satisfied in the ''observable'' facts of the case.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|430}}

After demonstrating that dew could be formed by these generic existential phenomena, and not by other phenomena, the universal hypothesis arose that dew forms following established laws of temperature and pressure.  "The outstanding conclusion is that inductive procedures are those which ''prepare'' existential material so that it has convincing evidential weight with respect to an inferred generalization.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|432}}  Existential data are not pre-known natural kinds, but become conceptual statements of "natural" processes.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Objects and qualities [kinds] as they naturally present themselves or as they are "given," are not only not the data of science but constitute the most direct and important obstacles to formation of those ideas and hypotheses that are genuinely relevant and effective.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|425}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are brought to the conclusion that it is modes of ''active response'' which are the ground of generality of logical form, not the existential immediate qualities of that which is responded to.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

Dewey concluded that nature is not a collection of natural kinds, but rather of reliable processes discoverable by competent induction and deduction.  Assuming kinds to be given leads to the error of assuming that conceptual universal propositions can serve as evidence for generic propositions; observed consequences affirm imagined causes.  "For an 'inference' that is not ''grounded'' in the evidential nature of the material from which it is drawn is ''not'' an inference.  It is a more or less wild guess."&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|428}}  Modern induction is not a guess about natural kinds, but a means to create instrumental understanding.

==Willard Van Orman Quine==
In 1969, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] brought the term "natural kind" into contemporary analytic philosophy with an essay bearing that title.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornblith|first=Hilary|title=Inductive Inference and Its Natural Ground|publisher=MIT Press|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}  His opening paragraph laid out his approach in three parts.  First, it questioned the logical and scientific legitimacy of reasoning inductively from a few samples to all members of a kind.  "What tends to confirm an induction?"  Second, it assumed that colors are inductively-identified natural kinds, despite some logical puzzles that can be solved: non-black ravens and green-blue emeralds.  Finally, it suggested that human psychological structure can explain the illogical success of induction: "an innate flair that we have for natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Qui"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine|first=Willard Van Orman|editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]|publisher=D. Reidel|contribution=Natural Kinds|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}

Quine believed the ancient method of induction can identify kinds.  It groups experiences into kinds by recognizing qualities shared by observed similar objects: "... each [observed] black raven tends to confirm the law [universal proposition] that all ravens are black ..."  Observing shared generic traits warrants the inductive universal prediction that future experience will confirm the sharing: "And every reasonable [universal] expectation depends on resemblance of [generic] circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects." "The notion of a kind and the notion of similarity or resemblance seem to be variants or adaptations of a single [universal] notion.  Similarity is immediately definable in terms of kind; for things are similar when they are two of a kind."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Quine interpreted humanity's "innate flair for natural kinds" as intuitive recognition of criteria for judging degrees of similarity among objects.  These criteria work instrumentally when applied inductively: "... why does our innate subjective spacing [grouping] of [existential] qualities accord so well with the functionally relevant [universal] groupings in nature as to make our inductions tend to come out right?"

He admitted that generalizing after observing a few similarities is scientifically and logically unjustified.  The number and degrees of similarities and differences humans experience are infinite.  But the method is justified by its instrumental success in revealing natural kinds.  The "problem of induction" is how humans "should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate, scientifically unjustified similarity standards."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|48–9}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A standard of similarity is in some sense innate.  This point is not against empiricism; it is a commonplace of behavioral psychology.  A response to a red circle, if it is rewarded, will be elicited by a pink eclipse more readily than by a blue triangle; the red circle resembles the pink ellipse more than the blue triangle.  Without some such prior spacing of qualities, we could never acquire a [classification] habit; all stimuli would be equally alike and equally different.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Quine credited human ability to recognize colors as natural kinds to their evolutionary role in human survival—distinguishing safe from poisonous kinds of food.  He recognized that modern science often judges color similarities to be superficial, but denied that replacing obvious similarities by abstract universal similarities makes natural kinds any less permanent and important.  The human brain's capacity to recognize abstract kinds joins the brain's capacity to recognize existential similarities.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit is due to man's inveterate ingenuity, or human sapience, for having worked around the blinding dazzle of color vision and found the more significant regularities elsewhere.  Evidently natural selection has dealt with the conflict [between visible and invisible similarities] by endowing man doubly: with both a color-slanted quality space and the ingenuity to rise above it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He has risen above it by developing modified systems of kinds, hence modified similarity standards for scientific purposes.  By the [inductive] trial-and-error process of theorizing he has regrouped things into new kinds which prove to lend themselves to many inductions better than the old.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|49}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A man's judgments of similarity do and should depend on his theory [universal propositions], on his beliefs; but similarity itself, what the man's judgments purport to be judgments of, [is] an objective relation in the world.  It belongs in the [generic] subject matter not of our [universal] theory ... about the world, but of our [universal] theory of the [generic] world itself.  Such would be the acceptable and reputable sort of similarity concept, if it could be defined.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Quine argued that the success of innate and learned criteria for judging degrees of similarity, applied inductively to small samples of kinds, constitutes evidence of the existence of natural kinds; observed consequences affirm imagined causes.  His reasoning continues to provoke philosophical debates.

==Hilary Kornblith==
In 1993 [[Hilary Kornblith]] published a review of debates about natural kinds since Quine had launched that epistemological project a quarter-century earlier.  He evaluated Quine's "picture of natural knowledge" as natural kinds, along with subsequent refinements.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Quine's original assumption that discovering knowledge of mind-independent reality depends on inductive reasoning, despite its being illogical, continued to be acceptable.  His further assumption that success of inductive reasoning confirms both the existence of natural kinds and the legitimacy of the method also continued unquestioned, by Kornblith himself and scholars at large.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I argue that natural kinds make inductive knowledge of the world possible because the clustering of properties characteristic of natural kinds makes inferences from the presence of some of these properties to the presence of others reliable.  Were it not for the existence of natural kinds and the causal structure they require, any attempt to infer the existence of some properties from the presence of others would be no more than quixotic; reliable inductive inference would be impossible.  The [generic] causal structure of the world as exhibited in [universal] natural kinds thus provides the natural ground of inductive inference.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Quine's assumption of an innate human psychological process--"standard of similarity," "subjective spacing of qualities"—also remained unquestioned.  Kornbluth provided new labels for the necessary cognitive qualities: "native processes of belief acquisition," "the structure of human conceptual representation," "native inferential processes," "reasonably accurate detectors of covariation."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|3, 9. 95}} "To my mind, the primary case to be made for the view that our [universal] psychological processes dovetail with the [generic] causal structure of the world comes ... from the success of science.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Kornblith denied that this logic makes human classifications the same as mind-independent classifications: "The categories of modern science, of course, are not innate."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|81}} But he offered no explanation of how the two can be distinguished.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If the scientific categories of mature sciences did not correspond, at least approximately, to real kinds in nature, but instead merely grouped objects together on the basis of salient observable properties which somehow answer to our interests, it would be utterly miraculous that inductions using these scientific categories tend to issue in accurate predictions.  Inductive inference can only work ... if there is something in nature binding together the [generic] properties which we use to identify kinds.  ....  Unobservables [universal propositions] are then postulated to explain the constant conjunction of observable properties.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|41–2}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We approach the world by presupposing that it contains natural kinds.  Our inferences depend on this presupposition,...  This presupposition thus gives us a built-in advantage in understanding what the world is like, and thereby makes inductive understanding of the world a real possibility.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|87}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When a population [kind] is uniform with respect to some [generic] property, [inductive] inferences from small samples, and indeed, ''from a single case'', are perfectly reliable.  If I note that a [generic] sample of [universal] copper conducts electricity and straightaway conclude that all copper conducts electricity, then I will do just as well as someone ... checking a very large number of copper samples for their conductivity.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|92–3, emphasis added}}

Kornblith didn't explain how tedious modern induction accurately attributes a generic quality to all of some universal kind.  He attributed such success to individual sensitivity that a single case is representative of all of a kind.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If we are sensitive to the situations in which a population is uniform with respect to some property, then making inferences on the basis of very small samples will be a reliable and efficient way to gain information about a population [natural kind].&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Accepting intuition as a legitimate ground for inductive inferences from small samples, Kornblith criticized popular arguments by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that intuition is irrational.  He continued to argue that traditional induction explains the success of modern science.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our [universal] conceptual and inferential tendencies jointly conspire, at least roughly, to carve  nature at its [generic] joints and project the features of a kind which are essential to it.  This preestablished harmony between the [generic] causal structure of the world and the [universal] conceptual and inferential structure of our minds produces reliable inductive inference.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|94}}

==Hasok Chang and Rasmus Gronfeldt Winther==
[[Hasok Chang]] and Rasmus Winther contributed essays to a collection entitled ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'', published in 2016.  The editor of the collection, Catherine Kendig, envisioned a new sense of natural kinds, different from traditional classifications of objects according to their "essences, laws, sameness relations, fundamental properties ... and how these map out the ontological space of the world."  She collected original works examining results of discipline-specific classifications of kinds: "the empirical use of natural kinds and what I dub 'activities of natural kinding' and 'natural kinding practices'."&lt;ref name="Ken"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendig|first=Catherine|title=Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice|publisher=Routledge|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}}  Her natural kinds include scientific disciplines themselves, each with its own methods of inquiry and resulting natural knowledge.

Chang's contribution displayed Kendig's "natural kinding activities" or "practice turn" by reporting classifications in the discipline of chemistry—a field renowned for examples of timeless natural kinds: "All water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O;" "All gold has atomic number 79."

Taking prior classifications of kinds as given, he illustrated how chemists' methods and results are both used and developed: "how fundamental classificatory concepts become refined and corrected through our practical scientific engagement with nature. Any considerable and lasting success of such engagement generates confidence in the classificatory concepts used in it, and invites us to consider them as 'natural'."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

Chang explicitly rejected Quine's basic assumption that natural kinds are real generic objects. "When I speak of a (natural) kind in this chapter, I am referring to a [universal] classificatory concept, rather than a collection of  objects."  His kinds result from humanity's continuous knowledge-seeking activities called science and philosophy.  "Putting these notions more unambiguously in terms of concepts rather than objects, I maintain: if we hit upon some stable and effective classificatory concepts in our inquiry, we should cherish them (calling them 'natural kinds' would be one clear way of doing so), but without presuming that we have thereby found some eternal essences.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|33–4}}

Treating human classifications as natural kinds means endorsing both the practices and findings of modern scholars, without considering possible flaws in either practices or findings; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. Chang used the example of phlogiston to explain modern practice in chemistry.

Phlogiston was once considered by scientists to be a combustible object capable of explaining fire and its heat.  Phlogiston was combustible because it contained heat in latent form.  "All fire is liberated phlogiston."  But when subjected to newly-understood processes such as oxidization and calcination, the kind phlogiston failed to perform as intellectually required.  New properties of combustion led to denial of the existence of phlogiston.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

Chang did not describe the inductive and deductive methods that led chemists to dismiss phlogiston. But he argued that those methods could just as well have been successfully applied to imaginary phlogiston as to oxidization and calcination that displaced it. "I think phlogiston should have been regarded as a natural kind as much as anything else."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

Chang claimed his examples of classification practices in chemistry confirmed the fallacy of the traditional assumption that natural kinds exist as mind-independent reality.  He attributed this belief more to imagining supernatural intervention in the world, than to illogical induction.  He did not consider the popular belief that innate psychological capacities enable traditional induction to work.
{{quotation
|Much natural-kind talk has been driven by an intuitive metaphysical essentialism that concerns itself with an objective [generic] order of nature whose [universal] knowledge could, ironically, only be obtained by a supernatural being.  Let us renounce such an unnatural notion of natural kinds.  Instead, natural kinds should be conceived as something we humans may succeed in inventing and improving through scientific practice.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Rasmus Winther's Contribution to ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'' gave new meaning to natural objects and qualities in the discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIS).  This "inter-discipline" engages in discovering patterns in--and displaying spatial kinds of--data, using methods that make its results unique natural kinds.
{{quotation
|Collecting and collating geographical data, building geographical data-bases, and engaging in spatial analysis, visualization, and map-making all require organizing, typologizing, and classifying geographic space, objects, relations, and processes.  I focus on the use of natural kinds ..., showing how practices of making and using kinds are contextual, fallible, plural, and purposive.  The rich family of kinds involved in these activities are here baptized mapping kinds.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|1197}}

He later identified sub-kinds of mapping kinds as "calibrating kinds," "feature kinds," and "object kinds" of "data model types."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|202-3}}

Winther identified "inferential processes of abstraction and generalization" as methods used by GIS, and explained how they are used to generate digital maps.  He illustrated two kinds of inquiry procedures, with sub-procedures to organize data.  They are reminiscent of Dewey's multiple steps in modern inductive and deductive inference.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|205}}  Methods for transforming generic phenomena into kinds involve reducing complexity, amplifying, joining, and separating.  Methods for selecting among generic kinds involves elimination, classification, and collapse of data.

He argued that these methods for mapping kinds can be practiced in other disciplines, and briefly considered how they might harmonize three conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.

Some philosophers believe there can be a "pluralism" of kinds and classifications.  They prefer to speak of "relevant" and "interesting" kinds rather than eternal "natural" kinds.  They may be called social constructivists whose kinds are human products.  Chang's conclusions that natural kinds are human-created and instrumentally useful would appear to put him in this group.

Other philosophers, including Quine, examine the role of kinds in scientific inference. Winther does not examine Quine's commitment to traditional induction drawing conclusions from small samples of similar objects, but accepts Quine's willingness to call human-identified kinds that work natural.
{{quotation
|Quine holds that kinds are "functionally relevant groupings in nature" whose recognition permits our inductions to "tend to come out right."  That is, kinds ground fallible inductive inferences and predictions, so essential to scientific projects including those of GIS and cartography.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|207}}

Finally, Winther identified a philosophical perspective seeking to reconstruct rather than reject belief in natural kinds.  He placed Dewey in this group, although continuing to ignore incompatible views of how induction identifies generic and universal kinds.
{{quotation
|Dewey resisted the standard view of natural kinds, inherited from the Greeks ...  Instead, Dewey presents an analysis of kinds (and classes and universals) as fallible and context-specific hypotheses permitting us to address problematic situations effectively.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|208}}
Winther concludes that classifying practices used in Geographic Information Science is able to harmonize these conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.
{{quotation
|GIS and cartography suggest that kinds are simultaneously discovered [as pre-existing structures] and constructed [as human classifications].  Geographic features, processes, and objects are of course real.  Yet we must structure them in our data models and, subsequently, select and transform them in our maps.  Realism and (social) constructivism are hence not exclusive in this field.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Given the centuries of disagreement about the existential and logical reality of natural kinds, and the incoherent collection of untested common-sense propositions and tested scientific propositions on which beliefs rest, the optimistic eclecticism found in contributions to ''Natural Kinds and Classifications Practice'' is unlikely to find universal acceptance.

'''Nepalese Sign Language''' or '''Nepali Sign Language''' is the main [[deaf sign language]] of [[Nepal]]. It is a somewhat [[Language standardization|standardized language]] based informally on the variety of [[Kathmandu]], with some input from varieties of [[Pokhara]] and elsewhere. As an indigenous sign language, it is not related to oral [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The newly promulgated constitution on Nepal 2072 (2015) had specifically mentioned the right to have education in Sign Language for the deaf. Likewise the newly passed Disability right act 2072 (2017) in its definition of Language has mentioned "“Language” means spoken and sign languages and other forms of speechless language. "  in practice it is recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Nepal)|Ministry of Education]] and the [[Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare (Nepal)|Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare]], and is used (albeit in a somewhat pidginized form) in all schools for the deaf. In addition, there is legislation underway in Nepal which, in line with the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD) which Nepal has ratified, should give Nepalese Sign Language equal status with the oral languages of the country.

==History==
Nepalese Sign Language may have originated in the first school for the deaf in Nepal, established in Kathmandu in 1966 by an ENT doctor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The school was later moved to a children’s home in [[Kathmandu|Naxal]]. The aim of the school was to teach speech therapy to deaf children to have them learn to speak. Even so, deaf people who went to the school at this time recall using signs with each other during and after school. The oral policy continued until the arrival of the Patricia Ross, who tried to have total communication introduced into the school in 1985.

In 1980, 13 young Kathmandu deaf established the [[Deaf Welfare Association]]. This was the first association of any type established by disabled themselves and run under their own leadership &amp; management. Later the name of the organization was changed to [[Kathmandu Association of the Deaf]] (KAD). One of the chief goals of KAD was social reform of deaf people with an effort to promote and further develop sign language. At the time sign language was still banned in the deaf school; however, KAD worked hard to keep it alive at deaf gatherings on weekends. Later KAD developed a one-handed [[fingerspelling]] system for [[devanagari]] with the support of UNICEF.

==Role of other sign languages in development==
As we will see below in the section on work on the first NSL dictionary was undertaken by an American in conjunction with KAD. Although this American was hearing, she had a basic knowledge of the American Sign Language and had worked with deaf in Jamaica previously as a volunteer. Although the process of collecting signs focused on Nepalese Sign Language itself, it is hard to imagine that the process did not occasionally involve Ross interjecting signs she already knew. Thus, it is hard to imagine that there was no influence from other languages (e.g. ASL) during this process. In addition, Nepalese deaf had already had contact with some Italian and Swedish Deaf who had come Nepal as tourists.

Generally speaking then, NSL developed as a natural language established by the deaf community of Kathmandu valley, but we cannot deny the influence of the other sign languages, nor of artificial systems of sign such as [[Total Communication]] or [[Simultaneous Communication]]. This influence from outside due to contact (with, for example [[Indian Sign Language]] and with structural principles introduced from [[Manually coded language|artificial sign systems]] used in the United States) was strong during its initial stage of the formation, but in different ways and to different degrees remains strong to this day (although the contact is more with [[International Sign]], [[American Sign Language]] and various European sign languages used by visiting deaf tourists and by deaf from European funding organizations). There are also, not surprisingly, semantic overlaps with spoken Nepali (and perhaps other spoken languages).&lt;ref name=green2008&gt;E. Mara Green (2008) “Nepali Sign Language and Nepali: Social and Linguistic Dimensions of a Case of Inter-Modal Language Contact.” In Non-Speech Modalities: Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society, 2009 Special Session.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociolinguistics==
Although much work remains yet to be done, it is clear that Nepalese Sign Language is not used natively by the overwhelming majority of deaf people in Nepal. There are a number of reasons for this. The main reason, however, is that, as with hearing Nepalese, the majority of deaf in Nepal live in villages, surrounded by non-signing hearing population and not in contact with NSL users. Since the overwhelming majority of  deaf children in Nepal as in all countries are born into hearing families without a single signing member, Nepalese Sign Language is primarily learned first at schools for the deaf. However, as these schools are few in number, and not readily accessible to most,  it can be concluded that most deaf Nepalese have no opportunity to acquire Nepalese Sign Language under normal circumstances. (To a certain small extent, the [[National Deaf Federation Nepal]], in programs funded by the [[Swedish Deaf Association]] (SDR), [[Deaf Way-UK]] and other funders, sends trained deaf sign language instructors to remote villages to teach deaf there (and their families and fellow villagers) the basics of Nepalese Sign Language. Unfortunately, such instructors are few in number, and cannot possibly reach all deaf Nepalese.

While the vast majority of non-hearing Nepalese do not have the opportunity to acquire NSL,&lt;ref&gt;Raghav Bir Joshi (1991) Nepal: A paradise for the deaf? Sign Language Studies 20: 161- 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little et al. 1993{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devkota 2003{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=green2003&gt;E. Mara Green (2003) Hands That Speak, BA Thesis, Amherst College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erika Hoffman-Dilloway 2011"&gt;Erika Hoffman-Dilloway (2011) Lending a hand: Competence through cooperation in Nepal’s Deaf associations, Language in Society 40, 285–306.&lt;/ref&gt; those who are a part of the country’s active Deaf communities are often well connected to wide international network of signers through formal relationships with foreign Deaf organizations and personal relationships with foreign signers initiated and maintained through channels such as tourism, Facebook, and Skype chatting.

Both of these extremes affect NSL. Researchers have discussed the [[homesign]] systems generated by Deaf Nepalese in the absence of or in addition to NSL, which are one source of [[Variation (linguistics)|linguistic variation]] in the language&lt;ref name="Erika Hoffman-Dilloway 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway 2008 pp. 192"&gt;Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway (2008) Metasemiotic Regimentation in the Standardization of Nepalese Sign Language, Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, Vol. 18, Issue 2, pp. 192–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway (2010) Many Names for Mother: The Ethno-Linguistic Politics of Deafness in Nepal, South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 33: 3, 421 — 441.&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential impact of late exposure to NSL on signing practice.&lt;ref name="Erika Hoffman-Dilloway 2011"/&gt; In addition, scholars have noted that first exposure to signing practice often takes place in schools for the deaf, where classes are taught primarily by hearing teachers who use [[Signed Nepali]] or [[Sign-Supported Nepali]] (that is, signing that uses lexical items from NSL but grammatical constructions from spoken Nepali); this code can become another source of variation in Deaf Nepalese' signing repertoire.&lt;ref name=green2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway 2008 pp. 192"/&gt;

==Role of the Nepali Manual Alphabet==
As mentioned above, a [[Fingerspelling#1.1.1|one-handed fingerspelling]] system for [[devanagari]], the [[Nepali manual alphabet]],  was developed by KAD with the support of UNICEF. Although the idea behind this alphabet may have been motivated by foreign fingerspelling alphabets (especially [[American manual alphabet]] and the [[International manual alphabet]]), in fact only a few of the forms of the letters can be said to derive directly from those foreign alphabets (i.e. अ from “a”, ब from “b”, म from “m”, and र from “r”).

The Nepalese Manual Alphabet is used not for NSL per se, but for [[code switching]] into Nepali (i.e. when a signer spells out a personal or place name, or a Nepali word). The importance of the forms of this alphabet are, however, not restricted to this function. Indeed, [[fingerspelling]] [[handshape]]s have been widely used in development of new signs, through a process perhaps borrowed from America's various systems of Signed English, whereby the initial letter of the Nepali word is incorporated into the NSL, thus creating so-called "[[initialized sign]]s". Perhaps more than anything else, it is this system of [[initialized sign]]s which makes the lexicon of NSL structurally different from the lexicon of [[Indian Sign Language]].&lt;ref name=Morgan2012&gt;MW Morgan (2012). "Through and Beyond the Lexicon: A Semiotic Look at Nepal Sign Language Affiliation." Paper given at Himalayan Languages Symposium, Varanasi, India on 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The classification of Nepalese Sign Language is currently under dispute.&lt;ref name=Morgan2012/&gt; Older work has suggested that Nepalese Sign Language is not related to other sign languages. Wittmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; posits that NSL is a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through [[stimulus diffusion]] from an existing sign language, likely [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] or the systems that underlay it. [[Gallaudet University]] reports that NSL was "developed by the Peace Corps from local and American signs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=997860 |title=Sign Language| publisher=[[Gallaudet University]] |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, J. (1993) The Relationship of Sign Language Varieties in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. Sign Language Studies 78: 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt; compared sign-language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal and found cognate rates of 62–71%. He concluded these are separate languages of the same family. Zeshan concludes that “IPSL may be in use throughout India, Pakistan, and Nepal with varying degrees of dialectal variation”.&lt;ref name=Zeshan2003&gt;Ulrike Zeshan (2003) Indo-Pakistani Sign Language Grammar: A Typological Outline. Sign Language Studies 3/2: 157-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is indisputable that Nepalese Sign Language shares a significant number of signs with the various varieties of sign languages of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] (specifically [[Delhi]] and [[Bombay]] varieties of [[Indian Sign Language]]) and [[Karachi]] variety of [[Pakistani Sign Language]]),&lt;ref name=Morgan2012/&gt; argues that previous work, especially that of Woodward and Zeshan cited above, suffer from numerous flaws, both in theory, method, data and conclusion. Both use [[lexicostatistical]]  methods which have been widely criticized (and discarded) by [[historical linguist]]s for decades. In addition, although both modify the  word lists on which they perform their statistics, they nevertheless apply cutoff percentages derived from the standard [[word lists]].

Although it is unclear how or where Zeshan obtained her data (as she has never been in Nepal), Woodward is clear: his data is obtained from the first "dictionary" of Nepalese Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ross, and NK Devkota (1989). Nepali Sign Language Dictionary: The Welfare Society for the Hearing Impaired. Kathmandu: Shayogi Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This dictionary, as many first attempts, has numerous flaws, including the fact that at least one of the sign [[Informant (linguistics)|language informants]] had received his education in India, and thus his sign language at least is likely to be influenced by [[Indian Sign Language]], thus potentially skewing the data in favor of Woodward's conclusions.

As Morgan shows, an analysis of the sign languages as currently used in Nepal (i.e. the national sign language) and India (standard [[Indian Sign Language]]), argues for two alternative conclusions.&lt;ref name=Morgan2012/&gt; One likely alternative is that Nepalese Sign Language was never a member of a proposed Indo-Pakistani Sign Language family, and all supposed [[cognate]] signs are either the result of [[Loanword|borrowing]] (NSL has been influenced by ISL signing practices, particularly in the schools for the deaf in the south of the country),&lt;ref&gt;Shilu Sharma (2003) The origin and development of Nepali Sign Language. Kathmandu: Tribhuvan
University M.A. thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; a shared [[South Asian gestural base]] (which Zeshan herself alludes to as an area which needs further research),&lt;ref name=Zeshan2005&gt;Ulrike Zeshan (2005). Regional variation in Indo-Pakistani Sign Language : Evidence from content questions and negatives. In: U. Zeshan (ed.), Interrogative and Negative Constructions in Sign Languages. Sign Language Typology Series No. 1. Nijmegen: Ishara Press, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; or of chance similarity. Another possible alternative is that at one point in time Nepalese Sign Language and Indo-Pakistani Sign Language did in fact share a common source, but subsequent (and rapid) changes in NSL (and likewise in IPSL) over the past 30 years have resulted in a situation where the two languages are no longer related.

==Lexicon==
Work on documenting the lexicon of Nepalese Sign Language started in the mid-1980s. The first work collecting signs in Nepal that we know of was started in 1985. Patricia Ross, an American [[Peace Corps]] volunteer, was a pioneer in sign language research in Nepal. However, her work with Kathmandu Association of the Deaf (KAD) was to collect already existing signs, not creating new signs. As she herself writes: "The initial stumbling block in initiating [[total communication]] in Nepal was the lack of any recorded sign language. Many people did not know that there was a fully developed system of Nepalese signs. Despite the fact that sign was not used in the schools, the deaf people, out of their own need to communicate, had developed an intricate system of signs".&lt;ref name=Ross1990&gt;Patricia Ross (1990). ''Peace Corps Times''.{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the process of collecting signs, Ross further stated: "I would write down words and the students would discuss and argue about what the proper sign was. Slowly and patiently the students taught me their signs, their language."&lt;ref name=Ross1990/&gt; Ross's work collecting NSL signs eventually lead to the publication of the first Nepalese Sign Language dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ross &amp; N.K. Devkota (1989). Nepali Sign Language Dictionary: The Welfare Society for the Hearing Impaired. Kathmandu: Shayogi Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the National Deaf Federation Nepal (at that time called [[National Federation of Deaf and Hearing Impaired]], or NFDN) published a much more extensive dictionary,&lt;ref name="Acharya &amp; Sharma 2003"&gt;K. Acharya &amp; D. Sharma (2003). Nepali Sign Language Dictionary. Nepal National Federation of the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing (NFDH). Kathmandu. Quality Printers&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to work on both documenting and supplementing the Nepalese Sign language lexicon.

==Phonology==
Despite the incongruity of applying the term [[phonology]] to a [[sign language]], like other sign languages Nepalese Sign Language also has a sub-morphemic level of structuring which is analogous (to a certain degree at least) to phonology in [[spoken language]]s.

As such, the standard sign language model of phonology (first developed by [[William Stokoe]] for [[American Sign Language]] and originally called [[cherology]]&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1960){{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be applied to Nepalese Sign Language as well, according to which signs are analyzable according to five [[parameter]]s:

* [[Handshape]] (or Dez in Stokoe's original terminology)
* [[Orientation (sign language)|Orientation]]
* [[Location (sign language)|Location]] (or Tab in Stokoe's original terminology)
* [[Movement (sign language)|Movement]] (or Sig in Stokoe's original terminology)
* [[Expression (sign language)|Expression]] (which in fact can be interpreted broadly to include all [[non-manual]] elements of a sign)

Although linguistic research on Nepalese Sign Language is still in its infancy, and we do not have a complete list of for any of these parameters we can safely state that:

*(1) The set of [[handshape]]s for NSL includes not only those basic [[unmarked]] handshapes which form the core of most sign languages, but also, due to the widespread application of [[initialized sign]]s, also a number of highly [[marked]] handshapes. These highly marked handshapes can, in their origin at least, be considered to be uniformly [[indexicality|indexic]] (in the [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peircean]] [[semiotic]] sense), in that they always and without exception have a meaning correlate with a Nepali word which begins with the letter indicated by the handshape in the Nepali manual alphabet. Thus, for example, the marked handshape श /sha/ occurs in words such as CITY (शहर /shahar/), EDUCATION (शिक्षा /shiksha:/), PEACE (शान्ति /sha:nti/), ENEMY (शत्रु /shatru/), TECHNIQUE/SKILL (शिल्प /shilpa/), SHIVA (शिव /shiva/, BRANCH (शाखा /sha:kha:), SHERPA (शेर्पा /sherpa:/, all of them associated with a Nepali word beginning with the letter श /sha/ (albeit in some cases now frequently spelled with स /sa/ (e.g. सहर in place of शहर for 'city')). In addition there are handshapes such as those used in the sign for POTATO (अालु) that are neither unmarked nor based on initialization.
*(2) The set of [[location (sign language)|location]]s for NSL is generally restricted to the hemisphere bounded by the comfortable extension of both arms rotated at the sides of the body and also in front of the body, but may also extend beyond this.
*(3) [[Expression (sign language)|Expression]] alone (i.e. unaccompanied by any of the other [[parameter]]s nor any [[manual sign]]) can occasionally constitute a NSL sign.

One of the problems of [[phonemic analysis]] on NSL, which is also manifest in other sign languages, is the absence of extensive lists of [[minimal pair]]s such as are typically found for all [[spoken language]]s. While such pairs are impossible to find for all possible [[minimal pair]]s, a sufficient number of such pairs can be produced to justify the method. Such pairs are especially easy to find in cases of [[initialized sign]]s; thus, for example, while the index finger with tip indexic the back of the opposite wrist indicates the generic term TIME (Nepali: समय /samaj/), a म /ma/ handshape indicates OPPORTUNITY (Nepali: मौका /mauka:/), a फ /pʰa/ [[handshape]] indicates FREETIME (Nepali: फुर्सत /pʰursat/), etc.

==Morphosyntax==
{{Cleanup rewrite||section|date=October 2016}}
Nepalese Sign Language shares a number of features with most sign languages studied to date:

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] in NSL, as in languages in general, comes in two types: [[derivational morphology]] and grammatical or [[inflectional morphology]].

One feature which is difficult to ignore is [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]. This feature is a pervasive one, and one which blurs the border between [[phonology]], which is "supposed" to be meaningless (i.e. capable of distinguishing meaning without having meaning of its own)  and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], where all forms have meaning. Thus for example, we have incorporation of [[handshape]]s from the Nepali manual alphabet into lexical items as we saw above the sections above on manual alphabet and lexicon.

Incorporation also occurs in NSL verbs, in what are often referred to as "[[classifier predicates]]". Here, as in many other sign languages studied,&lt;ref&gt;MW Morgan (2009){{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the pattern is [[ergative-accusative]], with [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]s of [[intransitive verb]]s (e.g. ONE-PERSON in "One person passed by in front of me")), and [[Object (grammar)|object]]s of [[transitive verb]]s (e.g. "thick classifier" in "I ate a buff burger").

[[William Stokoe]], the "founder" of (American) Sign Linguistics, proposed a theoretical revision called "[[Semantic Phonology]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. ''Sign Language Studies'', 71: 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Under such a proposal, the sign for TEA चिया /chiya:/ could be seen as a complete predicate, with the "classifier"—in this case the Nepali manual alphabet [[handshape]] च /cha/ standing for TEA चिया /chiya:/ -- being incorporated into a "verb" DRINK.

Frequently, and especially at the level of the lexicon, instruments are also incorporated.

Many verbs also [[Agreement (grammar)|agree]] in [[Grammatical person|person]] (and [[Number (grammar)|number]]) with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]] (often the [[indirect object]], as e.g. "He stared at me" with the sign LOOK-AT directed from [[Grammatical person|third person]] to [[Grammatical person|first person]]). However, there is no grammatical or semantic criteria, other than it being transitive which can determine whether a verb will manifest agreement or not. To a limited extend the phonological feature of being "body anchored" (that is, having contact with the body at some point during execution) can limit agreement (e.g. a sign which starts with a body contact will be less free to show subject agreement, and a sign which ends with body contact will be less free to show object agreement).

Thus, in sentences of the type "I gave a book to you" we may have a single [[sign]] GIVE, [[inflected]] for [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] (motion of the verb begins from the signer (= I) and moves towards the [[recipient]] [= you]), and the [[handshape]] of the verb GIVE is modified to incorporate a "thick classifier" [[handling classifier]] [[handshape]] (= object the size and shape of a BOOK).

===Syntax===
Typically, in discourse, sentences are short, and verbal [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] ([[Prime actant|actants]]) are often left to context (leading to average clause length of less than 2 signs). In addition, NSL (like other sign languages), tends to be [[Topicalization|topicalizing]]; that  is, the topic is [[fronted (phonetics)|fronted]] (moved to the front of the clause). Given these two facts, it is hard to a "[[Basic Word Order]]" for NSL; nevertheless, in those instances where both [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[patient (grammar)|patient]] are lexicalized and where there is no [[topicalization]] (e.g. in artificially elicited sentences in isolation), the word order tends to be [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] (Subject-Object-Verb) --- just like [[Nepali (language)|Nepali]] and most members of the [[Sprachbund#Indian subcontinent|South Asian Sprachbund]].

==Discourse features==

Discourse in Nepalese Sign Language shares many features with discourse in other sign language:

# Discourse tends to be firmly "anchored" deictically, both within the space-time of the speech situation and also within the space-time of the narrative situation. As space in front of and around the signer can both represent real world space, but also the narrative world space, in addition to being used grammatically, index points and other spatial references are frequent, and may shift between the various frames.
# Clause length in discourse tends to be rather short, so that, for example, clauses with transitive verbs will very rarely have both agent and patient expressed lexically.
# What would in spoken discourse be called "co-speech gesture" in fact is fully integrated into the communicative semiotic of sign language discourse. The same is true of action embodiment (mimed action).
# As the signer has at their disposal several multiple articulators (i.e. not only both hands, which may be used as independent articulators, but also their own body (in the form of embodied action)), it is possible for extremely complex discourse events to be expressed simultaneously, whereas in spoke language they would have to be expressed by a long chain of sequential lexical and grammatical morphemes.

==Other indigenous sign languages of Nepal==
In addition to the national sign language, several local indigenous [[village sign language|'village' sign languages]] have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;The term "village sign language" is increasingly used as if it were a technical term describing a typologically distinct category of sign languages. Although such a class of sign languages MAY exist, it is not the intention here to imply that any of the following sign languages actually falls into such a category. Rather, they are sign languages which have arisen in a village context, and which are distinct from the [[national sign language]], in this case Nepalese Sign Language. Further research will have to be done to determine if they share any features with those sign languages elsewhere in the world which have been called "[[village sign language]]s" (e.g. [[Kata Kolok]] in Bali, [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] in Ghana, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt;  The following “village sign languages” have been identified: [[Jhankot Sign Language]], [[Jumla Sign Language]], and [[Ghandruk Sign Language]]. Although insufficiently studied, they each appear to be mutually unintelligible to native signers of Nepalese Sign language, and thus qualify as separate sign languages.

{{Other uses|Munhwa (disambiguation){{!}}Munhwa}}
'''North Korean standard language''' or '''Munhwaŏ''' ({{korean |hangul=문화어 |hanja={{lang|ko|文化語}}|context=north}}) is the [[North Korea]]n [[standard language|standard version]] of [[Korean language]]. Munhwaŏ was adopted as the standard in 1966. The adopting proclamation stated that the [[Pyongan dialect]] spoken in the North Korean capital [[Pyongyang]] and its surroundings should be the basis for Munhwaŏ; however, in practice, Iksop Lee and S. Robert Ramsey report that Munhwaŏ remains "firmly rooted" in the [[Seoul dialect]], which had been the national standard for centuries. Most [[North–South differences in the Korean language|differences between the North and South Korean standards]] are thus attributable to replacement of [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]] and other [[loanword]]s with pure Korean words, or the Northern ideological preference for "the speech of the working class" which includes some words considered non-standard in the South.&lt;ref name="LeeRamsey2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Iksop Lee|author2=S. Robert Ramsey|title=The Korean Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2000|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4831-1|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Following the liberation of Korea in 1945, both sides of the Korean peninsula continued to follow the Korean language guidelines as defined by the [[Korean Language Society]] in 1933 with the "Proposal for Unified Korean Orthography" ({{Ko-hhrm||||hangul=한글 맞춤법 통일안|hanja=|mr=|rr=}}) and in 1936 with the "Collection of Assessed Standard Korean Words" ({{Ko-hhrm||||hangul=사정한 조선어 표준말 모음|hanja=|mr=|rr=}}). In 1954, the 1933 proposal was replaced by a new system ({{Korean|hangul=조선어 철자법|hanja=|rr=|mr=|context=north}}) by the North Korean government in which thirteen words were slightly modified. Although the reformation created little difference, from this point the languages spoken by people on both sides on the Korean peninsula only grew in difference.

During the emergence of the [[Juche]] idea in the 1960s, [[Kim Il-sung]] coordinated an effort to purify the Korean language from [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] loanwords as well as words with less common [[Hanja]] characters, replacing them with new words derived from native Korean words.

Thus, North Korea began to refer to its own dialect as "cultural language" ({{Korean|hangul=문화어|hanja=|rr=|mr=|context=north}}) as a reference to its return to words of Korean cultural origin, in juxtaposition to South Korea's reference to its own dialect as "standard language" ({{Korean|hangul=표준어|hanja=|rr=|mr=}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In [[linguistics]], especially within [[generative grammar]], '''phi features''' (denoted with the Greek letter [[Phi|φ]] 'phi') are the semantic features of [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]],  [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and [[Grammatical case|case]], as encoded in pronominal agreement with [[nouns]] and [[pronouns]] (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe [[lexical category|lexical categories]] and case features.&lt;ref name="Kerstens, Johan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cJagGHOlKDUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 The syntax of number, person, and gender: a theory of phi-features], Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1993, p.2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Phi-features are often thought of as the "silent" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885337994|title=The universal structure of categories : towards a formal typology|last=Martina,|first=Wiltschko,|isbn=9781316004159|location=Cambridge|oclc=885337994}}&lt;/ref&gt;, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a [[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]] phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.

== Predicate-Argument Agreement ==
[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/309976|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky,|date=1965|publisher=M.I.T. Press|isbn=0262530074|location=Cambridge|oclc=309976}}&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In [[English language|English]], we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly '''verbs''' and '''adjectives''' are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Person ===
In English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table '''Person Agreement for WALK: English'''. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Agreement for WALK: English
!PERSON
!singular

|-
|'''1st'''
|I walk
|We walk
|-
|'''2nd'''
|You walk
|You (all) walk
|-
|'''3rd'''
|He/she/it '''''walks'''''
|They walk
|}
In a null-subject language such as [[Italian language|Italian]], however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:

&lt;u&gt;- Camminare (''to walk''):&lt;/u&gt;
cammin'''o''' (''I walk)'', cammin'''iamo''' (''we walk'')

camm'''ini''' (''you walk''), cammin'''ate''' (''you all walk'')

cammi'''na''' (''he/she walks''), camm'''inano''' (''they walk'')
=== Number ===
In English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is ''-s'' inflected on nouns that are plural:

- Duck'''s''', fridge'''s''', baseball'''s''', cup'''s''', book'''s''', mirror'''s''', car'''s''', building'''s''', clown'''s''', bridge'''s''', cream'''s'''....

Some cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:

- M'''en''', wom'''en''', m'''ice''', t'''eeth'''....

Neither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.
[[File:Feminine and Masculine inflections (singular) in Italian.png|alt=|thumb|419x419px|Bolded words are the inflected forms for gender in Italian.]]

=== Gender ===
English is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. [[German language|German]], for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the '''adjectives''' and '''determiners''' are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.

=== Case ===
Reflexivity is overt in English for every person:

my'''''self'',''' your'''''self'',''' him'''''self''''', your'''''selves''''', our'''''selves''''', them'''''selves'''''

In many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in [[French language|French]] ''se''. French ''se'' is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Déchaine|first=Rose-Marie|last2=Wiltschko|first2=Martina|date=2017-03-23|title=A Formal Typology of Reflexives|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.1111/stul.12072|journal=Studia Linguistica|language=en|volume=71|issue=1-2|pages=60–106|doi=10.1111/stul.12072|issn=0039-3193}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.

X'-theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its' complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its' categorical features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1c4gAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=categorical+features+syntax&amp;ots=qYelHsihQL&amp;sig=VE_cP6B_sgmIe9tTy8W7tYg7r1o#v=onepage&amp;q=categorical%20features%20syntax&amp;f=false|title=The Syntax of Number, Person and Gender: A Theory of Phi-Features|last=Kerstens|first=Johan|date=2012-06-25|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110869361|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9939">The term '''phonestheme''' ({{IPAc-en|f|oʊ|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|θ|iː|m}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|phonestheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''phonaestheme''' in British English) was coined in 1930 by British linguist [[J. R. Firth]] (from the Greek φωνή ''phone'', "sound", and αἴσθημα ''aisthema'', "perception" from αίσθάνομαι ''aisthanomai'', "I perceive")  to label the systematic pairing of form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Firth, J. R. | authorlink = J. R. Firth |year=1964 |orig-year=1930 |title = The Tongues of Men, and Speech | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = London | page = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such pairing would violate the [[Course_in_General_Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness principle]] of [[semantics]].

A phonestheme is different from a [[morpheme]] because it does not meet the normal criterion of [[compositionality]].

Within [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce's]] "theory of signs" the phonestheme is considered to be an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|icon]]" rather than a "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|symbol]]" or an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|index]]".

==Identification==
Phonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme.  Phonesthemes "fascinate some linguists", as [[Ben Zimmer]] has phrased it, in a process that can become "mystical" or "unscientific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |author-link=Ben_Zimmer |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2014/10/lexicon_valley_the_etymology_and_history_of_the_word_snark_with_lexicographer.html |title=Where Did the Word ''Snark'' Come From? |website=Lexicon Valley |publisher=Slate |host=Bob Garfield and Mike Vuolo |date=2014-10-20 |time=0:27:30 |access-date=2015-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, the English phonestheme "gl-" occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like "glitter", "glisten", "glow", "gleam", "glare", "glint", "glimmer", "gloss", and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., "-isten", "-ow", and "-eam" do not make meaningful contributions to "glisten", "glow", and "gleam".
There are three main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.

===Corpus studies===
The first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.

Corpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.

===Study of patterns in neologisms===
The second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of [[neologisms]] (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word ''bangle'' is a [[Loanword|loan]] from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] but speakers tend to associate it with English [[onomatopoeia]] like ''bang''. While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.

===Study of linguistic processing patterns===
The final type of evidence uses the methods of [[psycholinguistics]] to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.

Discussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of [[sound symbolism]].

==Distribution==
Phonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other [[Indo-European languages]], [[Austronesian languages]], and Japanese.

While phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like "-ash" and "-ack" in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact ("smash", "crash", "bash", etc.) and abrupt contact ("smack", "whack", "crack", etc.), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolinger |first=Dwight |date=1980 |title=Language, the Loaded Weapon: The use and abuse of language today |location=New York |publisher=Longman |page=20 |isbn=0582291089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their ''motivation''. In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of "-ack", for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as "gl-", for the simple reason that their meanings (such as 'pertaining to light or vision') entail no sound.

While there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato's
Cratylus clearly mentioned the gl- and st- phonesthemes and their explanation in terms of phonosemantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leonardi |first=Filippo Maria |date=2015 |title=Phonesthemes in Latin Language |publisher=Academia.edu |url=https://www.academia.edu/17549917/Phonesthemes_in_Latin_Language_2015_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of phonesthemes in English (aside from "gl-"), include "sn-", related to the mouth or nose, as in "snarl", "snout", "snicker", "snack", and so on; and there is also a set of words starting with "sl-", which appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like "slide", "slick", "sled", and so on - which are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with sl- that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slosh, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth, sleepy, sleet, slip, slipshod, slope, slit, slay, sleek, slant, slovenly, slab, slap, slough, slum, slump, slobber, slaver, slur, slog, slate.

==Ablaut phonesthesia==
{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}
A further phonesthetic phenomenon, ablaut [[phonesthesia]], mimics the paradigm of a strong verb like ''swim'' : ''swam'' : ''swum'' with internal vowel change or ''[[apophony]]''. Take the word "flip."  It has an alliterative group, "fl-", that evokes the volatility of fly, flow, flee, fleet, flash, flake, and flick. Its rhymes, dip, sip, quip, drip, pip, tip, slip, and so forth, add to a connotation of minor labile action. But it is also part of an ablaut series where vowel alternation has semantic value (as in "flip-flop").

This kind of vowel alternation can be found in reduplicated word pairs like "pitter-patter," "chit-chat," "tip-top," or "tip-tap."

A regularity of phonesthetic relationship is shown by proportional analogies such as '''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp''';&lt;ref&gt;The conventionally abbreviated expressions, such as "'''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp'''", when fully expanded, are read as "'''clip''' is to '''clasp''' in precisely the same way as '''grip''' is to '''grasp'''", and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''crash : crush :: mash : mush'''; or '''crash : crunch :: mash : munch'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |mailing-list=Linguist List |last=Grew |first=Philip |title=re: 9.1050 Phonological Clusters of Semantically Similar Words |date=1998-08-05 |url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/9/9-1106.html |access-date=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">[[File:Mappa del Pizzo.svg|thumb|Spread of Mafia extortion by province in Italy]]

The '''pizzo''' is [[protection money]] paid to [[the Mafia]] often in the form of a forced transfer of money, resulting in [[extortion]]. The term is derived from the Sicilian ''pizzu'' ('beak'). To ''let someone wet their beak'' ([[Sicilian language]] "fari vagnari u pizzu") is to pay protection money. The practice is widespread in [[Southern Italy]],{{cn|date=July 2015}} not only by the Sicilian [[Cosa Nostra]], but also by the [['Ndrangheta]] in [[Calabria]] and the [[Camorra]] in [[Campania]]. 

Another [[etymology|etymological]] explanation of the term is "beakerful", referring to the right of an overseer to scoop from the grain being threshed by peasants.&lt;ref name=paoli241&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Paying the pizzo might also be in kind, for example by forcing a company to put someone (often a member of a criminal organisation) on the payroll, compulsory provision of services by Mafia controlled businesses as well as subcontracting to Mafia-controlled companies.&lt;ref name=paoli164&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses that refuse to pay the pizzo might be burned down. In return, businesses receive "protection" and can enlist neighbourhood Mafiosi to cut through bureaucracy or resolve disputes with other tradesmen. Collecting the pizzo keeps the Mafia in touch with the community and allows it to "control their territory".&lt;ref name=tel280406&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/28/wmafia128.xml The pizzo racket], The Daily Telegraph, April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mafia extorts more than 160 million euro a year from shops and businesses in the Palermo region, with the island as a whole paying 10 times that figure, investigators estimate.&lt;ref name=tel080308&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/08/wmafia108.xml Mafia-free supermarket defies mob extortion], The Daily Telegraph, March 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Around 80 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay up a pizzo.&lt;ref name=tel241007&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/10/23/wmafia123.xml Italy's biggest business: the Mafia], The Daily Telegraph, October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to Palermo University, the pizzo averages 457 euros (640 dollars) a month for retail traders and 578 for hotels and restaurants, but construction companies are asked to pay over 2,000 euros per month according to economic daily [[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'s figures.&lt;ref name=afp080308&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jLjxsdQPEBu-zA-ytPbvYHUSyOZA To the Mafia's horror, pizzo-free shop opens Palermo doors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314010142/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jLjxsdQPEBu-zA-ytPbvYHUSyOZA |date=2008-03-14 }}, AFP, March 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first to refuse to pay protection money was [[Libero Grassi]], a shopkeeper from [[Palermo]]. In January 1991, he wrote an open letter to the ''[[Giornale di Sicilia]]'', the local newspaper. Published on the front page, it was addressed to an anonymous "Dear Extortionist". It caused an uproar and, later that same year, Grassi was murdered.&lt;ref name=bbc110408&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7342106.stm Sicilians grow defiant of Mafia], BBC News, April 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Addiopizzo]] – a [[grassroots]] social conscious-motivated consumer movement – frustrated with the Mafia's stranglehold on the local economy and political life, peppered Palermo with stickers stating: "An entire populace who pays pizzo is a mob without dignity." They organise demonstrations wearing black T-shirts with the Addiopizzo logo, a broken circle with an X in the middle and the words "consumo critico" (critical consumption).&lt;ref name=cds050506&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2006/05_Maggio/03/pizzo.shtml One Hundred Defiant Shopkeepers Say "We Don’t Pay Protection Money"], Corriere della Sera, May 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pratek Man Tuladhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: प्रत्येक मान तुलाधर) (1924-1991) was a [[Nepal]]ese trader and [[philatelist]]. Born in [[Kathmandu]] into a family of hereditary merchants, he spent his youth in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]] where they owned a business house.

During his stay in Tibet(1939-1960), alongside his main occupation of conducting trade between [[India]], Nepal and Tibet, he developed an avid interest in collecting photographs, postage stamps and coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tuladhar |first=Sidhartha Man |date=3rd/4th Quarters 1999 |title=Dharma Man Tuladhar and Pratek Man Tuladhar: Nepalese Traders in Tibet |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1999_003_004.pdf |newspaper=Postal Himal: Quarterly of the Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |page=23 |publisher=Nepal &amp; Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singer |first=Armand E. |date=3rd Quarter 1996 |title=An Undelivered Cover to Lhasa, Tibet |url= http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1996_003.pdf |newspaper=Postal Himal: Quarterly of the Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |page=45 |publisher=Nepal &amp; Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Pratek Man was the eldest of the three children of father [[Triratna Man Tuladhar]] and mother Punya Maya [[Kansakar]]. His grandfather was the celebrated trader and philanthropist [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]]. His younger sister [[Tara Devi Tuladhar]] was a social worker.

Pratek Man went to Lhasa for the first time in 1939 to join his family business house Chhusingsyar, one of the largest traders in Tibet at the time. The firm maintained branches in [[Gyantse]] and [[Phari]] besides [[Ladakh]] and [[Kolkata]] in India. Tuladhar returned after nine years and married Jagat Shobha (1933-1981). He went to Lhasa again in 1952 and returned to Kathmandu for the last time in 1960, after spending a total of 17 years in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tuladhar |first=Sidhartha Man |date=3rd/4th Quarters 1999 |title=Dharma Man Tuladhar and Pratek Man Tuladhar: Nepalese Traders in Tibet |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1999_003_004.pdf |newspaper=Postal Himal: Quarterly of the Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |page=23 |publisher=Nepal &amp; Tibet Philatelic Study Circle |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuladhar was among the last of the traditional [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar]] merchants. The historical trade ended after the [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] route linking India and Tibet through [[Sikkim]] was shut down by the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.

After returning to Nepal, he devoted his time to serving [[Buddhism]]. He acted as a translator for Tibetan [[lama]]s translating their sermons into the local language besides writing articles on Buddhism for magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar |first=Lochan Tara |date=2007 |title=Dharmachari Guruma |publisher=Nirvana Murti Vihara |location=Kathmandu |isbn=978-99946-2-982-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyotr Patrushev''' (1942 - 28 March 2016) was a [[Russia]]n author who escaped the [[Soviet Union]] by swimming to [[Turkey]] across the [[Black Sea]] border in 1962. 

A competitive swimmer in Russia, he was targeted for hazing by a sergeant in his army unit and feigned mental illness to avoid death or maiming. He later escaped and then swam from the USSR to Turkey. He was detained in Turkey and held in solitary confinement for long periods. He was sentenced to death for treason in absentia by the Soviet government for his escape.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/03/11/2843061.htm Pyotr Patrushev's compelling journey as a translator and refugee March 11, 2010] ''[[ABC Radio National]]'' Retrieved April 7, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

Patrushev became a broadcaster, journalist, conference interpreter and [[translator]] in the West, working for the [[BBC]] in [[London]] and later for the [[Radio Liberty]] in Munich and San Francisco, as well as writing for Australian newspapers, radio and television. He has worked as a Senior Consultant, CIS and Eastern Europe for ([[Chatswood]]-based) Conflict Resolution Network. As a top level Russian translator and interpreter he was a member of AIIC, the International Association of Conference Interpreters and the [[National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters]]. He interpreted for Russian and Australian Heads of State i.e. ([[Vladimir Putin]], [[John Howard]]), Prime Ministers, Members of the Cabinet, etc.

Patrushev's commentaries in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and on the national radio and television established him as one of the pre-eminent commentators on Soviet and Russian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, SBS Russian program&lt;/ref&gt; His work as an interpreter with American and Russian scientists in the 80’s and 90’s in the areas of brain/mind interaction provided him with a wealth of material for his book ''Project Nirvana.''&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Williams,  ABC Radio National, "In Conversation".&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, when Patrushev visited his native Soviet Union in 1990 for the first time in 28 years - "the country which, only a few weeks before his return, overturned the death penalty imposed on him for his dramatic escape abroad all those years ago"&lt;ref name="Fear"/&gt; - he was taken away by guards and detained for more than eight hours when he first arrived at Moscow Airport.&lt;ref name="Fear"&gt;Sheila Browne. "Fear and Greed Rule as a Mighty Nation Falls Apart." ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]], Northern Herald'' October 25, 1990, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He had made the trip to visit relatives, mainly in his native Siberia, and make contacts for the network, which teaches conflict resolution skills under the auspices of the [[United Nations Association of Australia]].&lt;ref name="Fear"/&gt; Although both Soviet and Australian authorities had assured Patrushev that it was safe for him to travel to the Soviet Union on his Australian passport, he was still detained, "most of the time in a hot and stuffy airport hotel, without being able to contact the Australian Embassy or his waiting relatives."&lt;ref name="Fear"/&gt; He was freed with no explanation, except that of the hotel manager who commented: "See, [[perestroika]] is working."&lt;ref name="Fear"/&gt;

Until his death, he lived in [[Jervis Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;''The great escape weekender''. Keeli Cambourne. ''[[Illawarra Mercury]]'' (Australia). Weekender; p. 8. February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], with his wife and son.

'''Richard Ben Sapir''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|p|ɪər}}; 1936–1987) is best known for ''[[The Destroyer (fiction)|The Destroyer]]'' series of novels that he co-created with [[Warren Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sapir, &amp; Warren Murphy (1985).  ''Remo The Adventure Begins'', New York, NY: Signet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Murphy (1995). ''The Destroyer # 100 Last Rites'', Ontario, Canada: Worldwide Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sapir, &amp; Warren Murphy (1981). ''The Destroyer # 44 Balance of Power'', New York, NY: Pinnacle Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.palm.com/author/detail/1111 Author Biography] viewed June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Murphy biography appended to body of work agreement (June 30, 2000) [http://sec.edgar-online.com/2000/06/30/17/0000932214-00-000120/Section28.asp Sec.edgar-online.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/sapir_richard_ben Sf-encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Destroyer'' was written in 1963, while Sapir worked as a city hall reporter in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and Murphy served as secretary to the city's mayor. Ahead of its time with a plot centered upon a brash young westerner trained in the martial arts by a master assassin from [[North Korea]], the book went unpublished until June 1971 but eventually spawned a highly successful adventure series with over 30 million copies in print by the late 1990s.

Before arriving on the illustrious shores of [[Sinanju]], Sapir worked as an editor and in public relations. In addition to ''The Destroyer'' series, Sapir wrote five novels:  ''Bressio'' (1975), ''[[The Far Arena]]'' (1978), ''[[The Body (novel)|The Body]]'' (1983), ''Spies'' (1984), and ''Quest'' (1987), a modern-day search for the Holy Grail. ''The Body'', which was made into a movie in 2001, is about a Jewish archaeologist who finds a skeleton underneath an Arab shopkeeper's basement that might be the body of Jesus and the American Jesuit priest who is sent by the Vatican to investigate.

Richard Sapir was a graduate of [[Columbia University]] and lived with his wife in [[New Hampshire]] before he died in 1987 from a heart attack.

The '''Saharan languages''' are a small family of languages spoken across parts of the eastern [[Sahara]], extending from northwestern [[Darfur]] to southern [[Libya]], north and central [[Chad]], eastern [[Niger]] and northeastern [[Nigeria]].  Noted Saharan languages include [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] (4 million speakers, around [[Lake Chad]] in Chad, Nigeria, Niger, and [[Cameroon]]), [[Daza language|Daza]] (330,000 speakers, Chad), [[Teda language|Teda]] (49,000 speakers, northern Chad), and [[Zaghawa language|Zaghawa]] (170,000 speakers, eastern Chad and [[Darfur]]). They are a part of the proposed [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.

A '''Siamese connection''' or '''splitter''' in [[fire protection engineering]] is a [[pipe fitting]] that allows two or more [[fire hose]]s to be connected to a single [[standpipe (firefighting)|standpipe]] riser at the same general location.

It is so-called due to the visual similarity to [[Siamese twins]].

The '''Momuna languages''', [[Momina language|Momina]] and [[Momuna language|Momuna]], also known as '''Somahai''', are a [[language family|family]] of two closely related [[Papuan languages]]. 

==Classification==
The Somahai pronouns, singular *na, *ka, *mo, are typical of [[Trans–New Guinea]] languages. They were placed in the [[Central and South New Guinea languages|Central and South New Guinea]] branch of that family by Wurm. [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross]] could not locate enough evidence to classify them. Usher found them to be closest to the [[Mek languages]], in the [[Central West New Guinea languages|Central West New Guinea]], which partially overlaps with Wurm's C&amp;SNG.

'''Karl Stig-Erland''' "'''Stieg'''" '''Larsson''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|iː|ɡ|_|ˈ|l|ɑr|s|ə|n}}; {{IPA-sv|ˈkɑːɭ ˈstiːɡ ˈæːɭand ˈlɑːʂɔn}}; 15 August 1954 – 9 November 2004) was a Swedish journalist and writer.  He is best known for writing the [[Millennium (novel series)|''Millennium'' trilogy]] of  [[crime fiction|crime novels]], which were published posthumously and adapted as motion pictures. Larsson lived much of his life in [[Stockholm]] and worked there with [[socialist]] politics and journalism, including as an independent researcher of [[right-wing extremism]].

He was the second best-selling author in the world for 2008, behind [[Khaled Hosseini]].&lt;ref name=AbeBooks&gt;{{cite web | title=Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008 | url=http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ | date=15 January 2009 | publisher=[[AbeBooks]] | accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third novel in the ''Millennium'' trilogy, ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'', became the most sold book in the United States in 2010, according to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Winning Game: 2010 Hardovers, Facts, Figures |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/46541-the-winning-game-2010-hardcovers-facts--figures-2011.html?page=1 |first=Daisy |last=Maryles|magazine=Publishers Weekly|date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2015, his series had sold 80 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here’s the Cover for the New Book in Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Series|url=http://time.com/3765229/girl-in-the-spiders-web/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Stieg Larsson was born on 15 August 1954, as Karl Stig-Erland Larsson, in [[Umeå]], [[Västerbotten County|Västerbottens län]], Sweden, where his father and maternal grandfather worked in the Rönnskärsverken [[smelting]] plant. Suffering from [[arsenic poisoning]], his father resigned from his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[Stockholm]]. But because of their cramped living conditions, they chose to let one-year-old Larsson remain behind. So until the age of nine, Larsson lived with his grandparents in a small wooden house in the countryside, near the village of Bjursele in [[Norsjö Municipality]], [[Västerbotten County]].&lt;ref name=Norran&gt;{{cite web|last=Petersson|first=Jenny|title=Berättelsen om Stieg Larsson|trans-title=The story about Stieg Larsson|language=Swedish|url=http://norran.se/noje/article35797.ece|publisher=norran.se|accessdate=15 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111006153308/http://norran.se/2007/06/berattelsenomstieglarsson/|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the village school and used cross-country skis to get to and from school during the long, snowy winters in northern Sweden. He loved the experience of living there.

In the book ''[["There Are Things I Want You to Know" About Stieg Larsson and Me]]'', [[Eva Gabrielsson]] describes this as Larsson's motivation for setting part of his first novel ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'' in northern Sweden, which Gabrielsson calls "godforsaken places at the back of beyond."

Larsson was not as fond of the urban environment in the city of [[Umeå]], where he moved to live with his parents after his grandfather, Severin Boström, died of a [[heart attack]] at age 50. In 1974, Larsson was drafted into the Swedish Army, under the conscription law, and spent 16 months in compulsory military service, training as a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortarman]] in an infantry unit in [[Kalmar County|Kalmar]].&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-08-02/&gt;

His mother Vivianne also died early, in 1991, from complications with [[breast cancer]] and an [[aneurysm]].&lt;ref name="Gabrielsson, Eva 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabrielsson|first= Eva, |first2=Marie-Françoise |last2=Colombani |first3=Linda|last3= Coverdale |title="There Are Things I Want You to Know" about Stieg Larsson and Me |location= New York |publisher=[[Seven Stories]] |year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
On his 12th birthday, Larsson's parents gave him a typewriter as a birthday gift.&lt;ref name=Norran /&gt;

Larsson's first efforts at writing fiction were not in the genre of crime, but rather [[science fiction]]. An avid science fiction reader from an early age, he became active in Swedish [[science fiction fandom]] around 1971; co-edited, together with Rune Forsgren, his first [[Science fiction fanzine|fanzine]], ''Sfären'', in 1972; and attended his first [[science fiction convention]], SF•72, in Stockholm. Through the 1970s, Larsson published around 30 additional fanzine issues; after his move to Stockholm in 1971, he became active in the Scandinavian SF Society, of which he was a board member in 1978 and 1979, and chairman in 1980.

In his first fanzines, 1972–74, he published a handful of early short stories, while submitting others to other semi-professional or amateur magazines. He was co-editor or editor of several science fiction fanzines, including ''Sfären'' and ''[[Science fiction fandom#Fanspeak|FIJAGH!]]''; in 1978–79, he was president of the largest Swedish science-fiction fan club, Skandinavisk Förening för Science Fiction (SFSF). An account of this period in Larsson's life, along with detailed information on his fanzine writing and short stories, is included in the biographical essays written by Larsson's friend [[John-Henri Holmberg]] in ''The Tattooed Girl'', by Holmberg with Dan Burstein and Arne De Keijzer, 2011.

In early June 2010, manuscripts for two such stories, as well as fanzines with one or two others, were noted in the [[Kungliga Biblioteket|Swedish National Library]] (to which this material had been donated a few years earlier, mainly by the Alvar Appeltofft Memorial Foundation, which works to further science fiction fandom in Sweden). This discovery of what was called "unknown" works by Larsson generated considerable publicity.&lt;ref name="itzkoff20100608"&gt;{{cite news| last=Itzkoff | first=Dave | url= http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/unpublished-manuscripts-by-stieg-larsson-are-found/ | title= Unpublished Manuscripts by Stieg Larsson Are Found | work=The New York Times | date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism and journalism===
While working as a photographer, Larsson became engaged in [[far-left]] political activism. He became a member of ''[[Socialistiska Partiet|Kommunistiska Arbetareförbundet]]'' (Communist Workers' League),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booksfactory.com/writers/larsson.htm "Steig Larsson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009080509/http://booksfactory.com/writers/larsson.htm |date=9 October 2010 }}. ''booksfactory.com'', Books Of The World.&lt;/ref&gt; edited the Swedish [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] journal ''Fjärde internationalen'', journal of the Swedish section of the ''[[Fourth International (Post-Reunification)|Fourth International]]''. He also wrote regularly for the weekly ''[[Internationalen]]''.&lt;ref name="Stieglarsson.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stieglarsson.com/Life-and-work |title=Biography – Background – Stieg Larsson, the man behind Lisbeth Salander |publisher=Stieglarsson.com |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larsson spent parts of 1977 in [[Eritrea]], training a squad of female [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] guerrillas in the use of mortars.  He was forced to abandon that work, having contracted a kidney disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/15/stieg-girls-with-grenade-launchers |title=Stieg Larson 'spent year training Eritrean guerrillas' |work=The Guardian  |date=16 October 2010 |location=London |first=Homa |last=Khaleeli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Sweden, he worked as a graphic designer at the largest Swedish news agency, [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] (TT), between 1977 and 1999.&lt;ref name="Stieglarsson.com"/&gt;

Larsson's political convictions, as well as his journalistic experiences, led him to found the Swedish Expo Foundation, similar to the British [[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] Foundation, established to "counteract the growth of the extreme right and the [[white power]]-culture in schools and among young people."&lt;ref name="expo.se"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expo.se/about-expo.html |title=About Expo |publisher=Expo.se |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812145309/http://www.expo.se/about-expo.html |archivedate=12 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the editor of the foundation's magazine, [[Expo (magazine)|''Expo'']], in 1995.

When he was not at his day job, he worked on independent research into right-wing extremism in Sweden. In 1991, his research resulted in his first book, ''Extremhögern'' (''The Extreme Right''). Larsson quickly became instrumental in documenting and exposing Swedish extreme right and racist organisations; he was an influential debater and lecturer on the subject, reportedly living for years under [[death threat]]s from his political enemies. The political party [[Sweden Democrats]] (Sverigedemokraterna) was a major subject of his research.&lt;ref name="expo.se"/&gt;



==Name change==
Larsson's first name was originally ''Stig'', which is the standard spelling. In his early twenties, he changed it to avoid confusion with his friend [[Stig Larsson (author)|Stig Larsson]], who would go on to become a well-known author well before Stieg did.&lt;ref name="Norran"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Folkbladet&gt;{{cite web|last=Forsman|first=Hans|title=Stig Larsson: Han ändrade själv stavningen|language=Swedish|trans-title=Stieg Larsson: He changed the spelling himself|url=http://www.folkbladet.nu/137240/2009/02/27/stig-larsson-han-andrade-sjalv-stavningen|publisher=folkbladet.nu|accessdate=15 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185220/http://www.folkbladet.nu/137240/2009/02/27/stig-larsson-han-andrade-sjalv-stavningen|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation is the same regardless of spelling.

==Death==
Larsson died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after climbing the stairs to work on 9 November 2004. He was 50. It was reported that his lifestyle largely consisted of cigarettes, processed food and copious amounts of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/stieg-larsson-girlfriend-eva-gabrielsson-rages-memoir/story?id=12950542|last=Donaldson James|first=Susan|title=Stieg Larsson's Girlfriend Rages in Memoir|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=February 21, 2011|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred at the [[Högalid Church]] cemetery in the district of [[Södermalm]] in Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In May 2008, it was announced that a 1977 [[Will (law)|will]], found soon after Larsson's death, declared his wish to leave his assets to the [[Umeå]] branch of the Communist Workers League (now the [[Socialist Party (Sweden, 1971)|Socialist Party]]). As the will was unwitnessed, it was not valid under Swedish law, with the result that all of Larsson's estate, including future royalties from book sales, went to his father and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_1301161.svd |publisher=SvD.se |date=28 May 2008 |title=Stieg Larssons testamente hittat |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Cantwell | first=Oisin | date=28 May 2008 | title= Ville ge arvet till lokalparti | publisher=Aftonbladet | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article2556626.ab|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His long-term partner [[Eva Gabrielsson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supporteva.com/us/ SupportEva.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042150/http://www.supporteva.com/us/ |date=26 April 2009 }} website. Supports Eva Gabrielsson's position.&lt;/ref&gt; who found the will, has no legal right to the inheritance, sparking controversy between her and his father and brother. Reportedly, the couple never married because, under Swedish law, couples entering into marriage were required to make their addresses (at the time) publicly available, so marrying would have created a security risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Cohen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/13/stieg-larsson-nick-cohen |title=Read Stieg Larsson, the bestselling socialist militant |work=The Observer  |date= 13 September 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his reporting on extremist groups and the death threats he had received, the couple had sought and been granted masking of their addresses, personal data, and [[Personal identity number (Sweden)|identity numbers]] from public records, to make it harder for others to trace them; this kind of "identity cover" was integral to Larsson's work as a journalist and would have been difficult to bypass if the two had married or become registered partners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

An article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine discusses Gabrielsson's dispute with Larsson's relatives, which has also been well covered in the Swedish press. She claims the author had little contact with his father and brother, and requests the rights to control his work so it may be presented in the way he would have wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/01/the-battle-over-stieg-larssons-estate-intensifies | title=The Battle Over Stieg Larsson’s Estate Intensifies | work= Vanity Fair | date=5 January 2010 | archivedate = 2014-07-21 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140721043451/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/01/the-battle-over-stieg-larssons-estate-intensifies

==Work==

===Novels===
{{Main article|Millennium series}}

Larson had originally planned a series of ten books and had completed two and most of a third when he began looking for publishers. At the time of his death in 2004 only three had been completed, and although accepted for publication, none had yet been printed. These were published posthumously as the ''Millennium'' series.

The first book in the series was published in Sweden as {{lang-sv|Män som hatar kvinnor}}{{spaced ndash}}literally{{spaced ndash}}''Men who hate women'' (2005).  It was titled for the English-language market as ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'' and published in the United Kingdom in February 2008.  It was awarded the [[Glass Key award]] as the best [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] crime novel in 2005.

His second novel, ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire|Flickan som lekte med elden]]'' (2006, ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]''), received the [[Best Swedish Crime Novel Award]] in 2006 and was published in the United Kingdom in January  2009.

The third novel, ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nes@t|Luftslottet som sprängdes]]'' ("The Air Castle That was Blown Up"), published in English as  ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'', was published in the United Kingdom in October 2009 and the United States in May 2010.

Larsson left about three quarters of a fourth novel on a notebook computer, now possessed by his partner, [[Eva Gabrielsson]]: synopses or manuscripts of the fifth and sixth in the series, which he intended to comprise an eventual total of ten books, may also exist.&lt;ref name="mcgrath20100523"&gt;{{cite news| last=McGrath | first=Charles | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23Larsson-t.html?ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all | title=The Afterlife of Stieg Larsson | work=The New York Times Magazine | date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielsson has stated in her book, ''[["There Are Things I Want You to Know" About Stieg Larsson and Me]]'' (2011) that she is capable of  finishing the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times |title=A Word From Stieg Larsson's Partner and Would-Be Collaborator |date= 17 February 2011 |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/a-word-from-stieg-larssons-partner-and-would-be-collaborator |first=Elaine |last=Sciolino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Swedish publisher [[Norstedts]] contracted [[David Lagercrantz]], a Swedish author and journalist, to continue the ''Millennium'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/stieg-larssons-fjarde-bok-skrivs-av-lagercrantz/|url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/stieg-larssons-fjarde-bok-skrivs-av-lagercrantz/|accessdate=17 December 2013|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagercrantz did not have access to the material in Gabrielsson's possession, which remains unpublished. The book was published in August 2015 in connection with the 10-year anniversary of the series, under the Swedish title ''Det som inte dödar oss'' (literal English translation: ''That Which Does Not Kill Us''); the English title is ''[[The Girl in the Spider's Web]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fjärde boken i Millenniumserien ges ut|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article18039598.ab|accessdate=17 December 2013|newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ny "Millennium"-bok i augusti|url=http://www.folkbladet.nu/1445523/ny-millennium-bok-i-augusti|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Folkbladet|agency=TT Spektra|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th book in the ''Millennium'' series was released in September, 2017.  The Swedish title is ''Mannen som sökte sin skugga'' (literal English translation: ''The Man Who Hunted his Shadow'') and the English title is ''The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.norstedts.se/forfattare/119997-david-lagercrantz|title=David Langercrantz|date=August 2017|publisher=Norstedts|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[url=https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Who-Takes-Eye-continuing/dp/0451494326]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film adaptations===
The Swedish film production company [[Yellow Bird (company)|Yellow Bird]] has produced film versions of the ''Millennium'' series, co-produced with the Danish film production company [[Nordisk Film]], which were released in Scandinavia in 2009.

===Influences===
Through his written works, as well as in interviews, Larsson acknowledged that a significant number of his literary influences were American and British crime/detective fiction authors. His heroine has some similarities with [[Carol O'Connell]]'s "Mallory," who first appeared in ''[[Mallory's Oracle]]'' (1994). In his work Larsson made a habit of inserting the names of some of his favourites within the text, sometimes by making his characters read the works of Larsson's favorite authors. Topping the list were [[Sara Paretsky]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Val McDermid]], [[Dorothy Sayers]], [[Elizabeth George]], and [[Enid Blyton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindgrendetails |first=Astrid |url=http://www.infloox.com/person?id=83bfe892 |title=Stieg Larsson – infloox ––– NOT VETTED ––– |publisher=Infloox.com |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713031005/http://www.infloox.com/person?id=83bfe892 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the strongest influences originates from his own country: ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', by Sweden's much-loved children's author [[Astrid Lindgren]]. Larsson explained that one of his main recurring characters in the ''Millennium'' series, [[Lisbeth Salander]], is actually fashioned on a grown-up Pippi Longstocking as he chose to sketch her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindgren |first=Astrid |url=http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=7a98a2e4 |title=Pippi Longstocking → Stieg Larsson |publisher=infloox |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713031411/http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=7a98a2e4 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional connections to Lindgren's literary work in the Larsson novels; for example, the other main character, [[Mikael Blomkvist]], is frequently referred to mockingly by his detractors as "[[Bill Bergson|Kalle Blomkvist]]", the name of a fictional teenage detective created by Lindgren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1219/whats-with-the-nickname-kalle-blomkvist Literature.com answer on the nickname]. Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The name Salander was actually inspired by the strong female character in the Kalle Blomkvist trilogy by Astrid Lindgren, Kalle's girlfriend Eva-Lotte Lisander.

Larsson has said when he was 15 years old, he witnessed three of his friends [[gang-rape|gang-raping]] a young girl, which led to his lifelong abhorrence of violence and abuse against women.&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-08-02/&gt; His longtime partner, [[Eva Gabrielsson]], writes that this incident "marked him for life" in a chapter of her book that describes Larsson as a [[feminism|feminist]].&lt;ref name="Gabrielsson, Eva 2011"/&gt; The author never forgave himself for failing to help the girl, and this inspired the themes of sexual violence against women in his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/stieg-larsson-guilt-gang-rape-lisbeth-fueled-millennium/story?id=11324859 |title=Stieg Larsson Silent as Real-Life Lisbeth Raped |accessdate=6 June 2011 |last=James |first=Susan |date=5 August 2010 |work=ABS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gabrielsson, the ''Millennium'' trilogy allowed Larsson to express a worldview he was never able to elucidate as a journalist. She described, in great detail, how the fundamental narratives of his three books were essentially fictionalised portraits of the Sweden few people knew, a place where latent [[white supremacy]] found expression in all aspects of contemporary life, and anti-extremists lived in persistent fear of attack. "Everything of this nature described in the ''Millennium'' trilogy has happened at one time or another to a Swedish citizen, journalist, politician, public prosecutor, unionist or policeman," she writes. "Nothing was made up."&lt;ref name="Gabrielsson, Eva 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr |first= David |work=New York Times Book Review |title=Remembering Stieg Larsson |date=8 July 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/books/review/book-review-there-are-things-i-want-you-to-know-about-stieg-larsson-and-me-by-eva-gabrielsson.html?_r=2&amp;ref=books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also similarities between Larsson's [[Lisbeth Salander]] and [[Peter O'Donnell]]'s [[Modesty Blaise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/cappuccinoculture/5975413/the-end-of-modesty-blaise.thtml |title=The end of Modesty Blaise |accessdate=6 June 2011 |last=Blackburn |first=David |date=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107000101/http://www.spectator.co.uk/cappuccinoculture/5975413/the-end-of-modesty-blaise.thtml |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_676646.html |title=Nordic invasion: Movies, books, music and more |work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] |accessdate=6 June 2011 |last=Behe |first=Rege |date=15 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419032929/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_676646.html |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2010/5/stieg-larsson-s-millennium-trilogy |title=Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy |accessdate=6 June 2011 |last=McDonald |first=Neil |work=Quadrant Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article298109/Millenniumtrilogin-sald-till-trettio-lander.html |title=Millennium trilogy sold to thirty countries |accessdate=6 June 2011 |last=Redvall |first=Eva |date=1 February 2008 |work=Sydsvenskan }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are women from disastrous childhoods who somehow survive to become adults with notable skills, including fighting, and who accomplish good by operating somewhat outside the law. One of Larsson's villains, Ronald Niedermann (a.k.a. "blonde hulk"), has much in common with the invulnerable, sociopathic giant named Simon Delicata in the fourth Modesty Blaise book ''[[A Taste for Death (Modesty Blaise)|A Taste for Death]]''.

'''Sven Otto Rickard Nordqvist''' (born 30 April 1946) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer and illustrator of [[children's book]]s, best known for his series [[Pettson and Findus]], about the old farmer Pettson and his talented cat Findus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://geckopress.com/author_illustrator/sven-nordkvist/ |title=Sven Nordqvist  |accessdate=29 November 2018|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Gecko Press |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Nordqvist was born in [[Helsingborg]] and grew up in [[Halmstad]], Sweden. He originally wanted to be an illustrator but was rejected by several art schools. Instead he studied architecture at [[Lund Institute of Technology]], and worked for a time there as a lecturer in architecture. At the same time he continued to look for work as an illustrator working on advertisements, posters and picture books. In 1983 he won first prize in a children's book competition and since then has worked exclusively as an author and illustrator of children's books.

He is married and has two adult sons.

During his career, he has been given awards in both Sweden and [[Germany]]. His ''Pettson and Findus'' books are especially popular in Germany, where the characters are known as ''Pettersson'' and ''Findus''. In Danish they are called ''Peddersen'' and ''Findus''.

'''''The Linguists''''' is an [[Independent film|independent]] 2008 American [[documentary film]] produced by [[Ironbound Films]] about [[language extinction]] and [[language documentation]].  It follows two [[linguist]]s, [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages]]&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/02/26/1810643.aspx/ | title=The Race To Save Our Languages | date=26 February 2009 | accessdate=13 July 2009 | last=Boyle | first=Alan | work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[K.

==Production==
Seth Kramer, one of the directors, describes how he first got the idea for ''The Linguists'' when, in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], he could not read [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] inscriptions on a path in spite of his [[Jewish]] heritage. He joined with Daniel A. Miller in 2003 to form Ironbound Films, and received a $520,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to support the film.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Later in 2003, the directors chose [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Anderson]] and Harrison to be the protagonists of the film.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; In 2004, director Jeremy Newberger joined the project.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

It took three years to film ''The Linguists'', and during this time over 200 hours of film were collected.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  During this time, the cast and crew travelled to numerous remote areas that one reporter describes as "godforsaken,"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; and coped with physical ailments such as [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The film was completed in August 2007.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | date=13 January 2008 | last=Hughes | first=Jennifer V | accessdate=22 February 2009 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/13artswe.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Racing to Capture Vanishing Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The film begins with the fact that a large proportion of the world's languages (half, out of a total of 7,000, according to the film&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=22 February 2009 | date=2 October 2008 | last=Garreau | first=Joel | title=Babble On, Say Researchers In 'Linguists' Documentary | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/01/AR2008100103115.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are going extinct.  The film's two protagonists, Anderson and Harrison, set out both to gather recordings of several endangered languages in order to document these languages later, and to educate viewers about the current rate of language extinction.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  In the process, they travel to the [[Andes mountains]] in [[South America]], to villages in Siberia, to English-[[Hindi language|Hindi]] boarding schools in Orissa, India, and to an [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservation]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

The film addresses issues including the spread of major [[World language|global languages]] and how they contribute to language extinction;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web | title=Saving Dying Languages in 'The Linguists' | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | work=[[Weekend Edition]] | date=21 February 2009 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100874724}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and social reasons that some languages have been repressed;&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web | title=Say It Loud, Say It Proud | last=Ellison | first=Jesse | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=14 February 2009 | accessdate=21 February 2009 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/184809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasons that [[language revitalization]] and language documentation are important (including both maintaining a scientific record of that language, and preserving unique local knowledge and history that is only carried in the local language).&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

==Reception==
The film was screened at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite web | last=Chang | first=Justin | url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2471&amp;reviewid=VE1117935820&amp;cs=1 | title=Sundance 2008: The Linguists | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate=22 February 2009 | date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later had success on the "indie film circuit."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  It also received attention among the linguistics community on websites such as [[Language Log]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1163 | date=21 February 2009 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | work=[[Language Log]] | title=Set your recorders now! | first=Eric | last=Baković}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">The '''Three Block War''' is a concept described by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Charles C. Krulak|General Charles Krulak]] in the late 1990s to illustrate the complex spectrum of challenges likely to be faced by [[Marines]] on the modern battlefield. In Krulak's example, Marines may be required to conduct full scale military action, [[peacekeeping]] operations and [[humanitarian aid]] within the space of three contiguous [[city block]]s. The thrust of the concept is that modern militaries must be trained to operate in all three conditions simultaneously, and that to do so, leadership training at the lowest levels needs to be high. The latter condition caused Krulak to invoke what he called "strategic corporals"; low-level unit leaders able to take independent action and make major decisions.

The term has been referenced by then-[[CENTCOM]] commander (now Secretary of Defense) General [[James Mattis]], and has also been adopted by the British and Israeli military, including former [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], General Sir [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] and former Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]],&lt;ref name="Robert Fox"&gt; {{cite news

=="Strategic corporal"==
The ''strategic corporal'' is the notion that leadership in complex, rapidly evolving mission environments devolves lower and lower down the [[chain of command]] to better exploit time-critical information into the decision making process, ultimately landing on the [[corporal]], the lowest ranking [[non-commissioned officer]], typically commanding a fire team of 4 individuals or a squad of 12 individuals (three fireteams). In very rapidly evolving mission situations, obtaining mission instructions from remotely located command may result in mission failure, or in casualties to both force personnel and civilians. Conversely, misusing this kind of responsibility may result in personal liability for the team leader: a decision executed to respond to situational needs may result in later prosecution as the team leader's actions are reviewed by higher authorities.

The term "strategic corporal" was coined by General Charles C. Krulak in the title of an article in ''Marines Magazine'' about the "Three Block War," an increasingly important arena of military operations characterized by engagement with hostile, neutral and friendly forces, all at the same time, in a very geographically limited area, e.g., three blocks.&lt;ref name="Krulak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/usmc/strategic_corporal.htm|title=The Strategic Corporal: Leadership in the Three Block War|accessdate=2006-11-23|work=Marines Magazine |publisher=[[Air University (United States)|Air University]]|year=1999|author=Charles C. Krulak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept requires forces to apply an appropriate type of response in a timely manner relative to the immediate context. Complex [[rules of engagement]] are needed that will minimize collateral damage to civilians and infrastructure. However, training "strategic corporals" requires time and money above and beyond what is considered normal [[infantry]] or [[military police]] training.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

The U.S. Army has used the Strategic Corporal term for their plan to equip ordinary squad leaders with advanced laser rangefinders to plot artillery fire.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, Derek. [http://www.army.mil/article/56114/DemonEye__Equipping_the_Strategic_Corporal_for_COIN/ "DemonEye- Equipping the Strategic Corporal for COIN."] U.S. Army, 6 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The need to conduct operations in this situation has significantly emphasised the importance of low level tactical [[leadership|leader]]s and led to the term ''strategic corporal'' being devised.

One of the adjustments in the USMC is to move coordination of artillery down from the battalion to the company level.&lt;ref&gt;Lamothe, Dan. [http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2011/05/marine-training-air-ground-task-force-052411w/ "New training puts distance between HQ and units."] ''Marine Times'', 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]], as detailed in the book and film ''[[Black Hawk Down (book)|Black Hawk Down]]'', small-unit leaders on the ground continually had to make crucial decisions which had major impacts on not only the forces initially deployed on the mission, but to follow on forces as well.

Some definitions of Ulster Scots may also include [[Standard English]] spoken with an Ulster Scots accent.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg,  R. J.

Trudgill, ''Language in the British Isles'', Cambridge; p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
Ulster Scots has been influenced by [[Hiberno-English]], particularly [[Mid-Ulster English]], and by [[Ulster Irish]]. As a result of the competing influences of English and Scots, [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Ulster Scots can be described as "more English" or "more Scots".&lt;ref name="Harris 1985 p14"/&gt;

During the middle of the 20th century, the linguist R. J. Gregg established the geographical boundaries of Ulster's Scots-speaking areas based on information gathered from native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, R. J. (1972) ''The Scotch-Irish Dialect Boundaries'' in Ulster in Wakelin, M. F., ''Patterns in the Folk Speech of the British Isles'', London: Athlone Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulster Scots is spoken in mid and east [[County Antrim|Antrim]], north [[County Down|Down]], north-east [[County Londonderry]], and in the fishing villages of the Mourne coast. It is also spoken in the Laggan district and parts of the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] in east [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and in the south of [[Inishowen]] in north [[County Donegal|Donegal]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline I. Macafee (ed.), ''A Concise Ulster Dictionary''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996; pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey found that 2% of [[Northern Ireland]] residents claimed to speak Ulster Scots, which would mean a total speech community of approximately 30,000 in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey - 1999: USPKULST |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=9 May 2003 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates range from 35,000 in Northern Ireland,&lt;ref name="dcalni.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/frequently_asked_questions.htm#q1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions &amp;#124; DCAL Internet |publisher=Dcalni.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=17 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221094546/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/frequently_asked_questions.htm |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to an "optimistic" total of 100,000 including the [[Republic of Ireland]] (mainly the east of [[County Donegal]]).&lt;ref name="Ulster Scots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-due.de/IERC/ulster_scots.htm |title=Ulster Scots |publisher=Uni-due.de |date= |accessdate=17 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205124558/https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/ulster_scots.htm |archivedate=5 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a seminar on 9 September 2004, Ian Sloan of the Northern Ireland [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] (DCAL) accepted that the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey "did not significantly indicate that unionists or nationalists were relatively any more or less likely to speak Ulster Scots, although in absolute terms there were more unionists who spoke Ulster Scots than nationalists".{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the [[United Kingdom 2011 Census|2011 census of Northern Ireland]], 16,373 people (0.9% of the population) stated that they can speak, read, write and understand Ulster Scots and 140,204 people (8.1% of the population) reported having some ability in Ulster Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/pivotgrid.aspx?dataSetVars=ds-2781-lh-37-yn-2011-sk-136-sn-Census%202011-yearfilter-2011- |title=NINIS Home Page |publisher=Ninis2.nisra.gov.uk |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[linguists]], such as Raymond Hickey,&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Hickey ''Irish English: History and Present Day Forms'', Cambridge University Press, 2007. pp. 85–120&lt;/ref&gt; treat Ulster Scots (and other forms of Scots) as a [[dialect]] of [[English language|English]].

===Legal status===
Ulster Scots is defined in an ''Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland establishing implementation bodies done at Dublin on the 8th day of March 1999'' in the following terms:

{{quote|"Ullans" is to be understood as the variety of the Scots language traditionally found in parts of Northern Ireland and Donegal.}}

The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/19990859.htm |title=The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave effect to the implementation bodies incorporated the text of the agreement in its Schedule 1.

The declaration made by the United Kingdom Government regarding the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CV=1&amp;NA=&amp;PO=999&amp;CN=999&amp;VL=1&amp;CM=9&amp;CL=ENG |title=List of declarations made with respect to treaty No.&amp;nbsp;148 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The United Kingdom declares, in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Charter that it recognises that Scots and Ulster Scots meet the Charter's definition of a regional or minority language for the purposes of Part II of the Charter.}}

This recognition differed significantly from the commitments entered into under the Charter in relation to Irish, for which specific provisions under Part III were invoked for the protection and promotion of that language. The definition of Ullans from the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 above was used in 1 July 2005 Second Periodical Report by the United Kingdom to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe outlining how the UK met its obligations under the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/legal_affairs/local_and_regional_democracy/regional_or_minority_languages/2_monitoring/2.2_States_Reports/UK_report2.pdf PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225044134/http://www.coe.int/t/e/legal_affairs/local_and_regional_democracy/regional_or_minority_languages/2_monitoring/2.2_States_Reports/UK_report2.pdf |date=25 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Good Friday Agreement]] (which does not refer to Ulster Scots as a "language") recognises Ulster Scots as ''"part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland"'', and the Implementation Agreement established the cross-border [[Ulster-Scots Agency]] (''Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch'').

The legislative remit laid down for the agency by the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 is: "the promotion of greater awareness and the use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island".

The agency has adopted a mission statement: ''to promote the study, conservation, development and use of Ulster Scots as a living language; to encourage and develop the full range of its attendant culture; and to promote an understanding of the history of the Ulster-Scots people.''&lt;ref name="Ulster-Scots Agency"/&gt; Despite the Agency's reference to Ulster Scots as "a language", this eliding of the distinction between Ulster Scots as a linguistic form, and "Ulster Scots culture" broadly referring to cultural forms associated with the Scottish-descended population, continued thereafter.

The [[Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2006/53/contents|title=Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] to insert a section (28D) entitled ''Strategies relating to Irish language and Ulster Scots language etc.'' which [[inter alia]] laid on the Executive Committee a duty to "adopt a strategy setting out how it proposes to enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture." This reflects the wording used in the [[St Andrews Agreement]] to refer to the enhancement and development of "the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=199&amp;docID=2931 |title=Home - Department of Taoiseach |publisher=Taoiseach.gov.ie |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still controversy on the status of Ulster Scots.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Gordon, and O'Reilly, Camille (2003) "Essentialising Ulster? the Ulster-Scots Language Movement".

==History and literature==
{{See also|History of the Scots language}}

[[File:Ballygally Castle staircase.jpg|thumb|[[Middle Scots]] inscription "Godis Providens Is My Inheritans" over the main entrance door leading to the tower in [[Ballygally Castle]]]]
[[Scottish people|Scots]], mainly [[Middle Irish|Gaelic]]-speaking, had been settling in [[Ulster]] since the 15th century, but large numbers of [[Scots language|Scots]]-speaking [[Lowlander]]s, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation]], with the peak reached during the 1690s.&lt;ref name="Montgomery &amp; Gregg 1997: 572"/&gt; In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1977: 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature from shortly before the end of the unselfconscious tradition at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is almost identical with contemporary writing from Scotland.&lt;ref name="Montgomery &amp; Gregg 1997: 585"/&gt; W. G. Lyttle, writing in ''Paddy McQuillan's Trip Tae Glesco'', uses the typically Scots forms ''kent'' and ''begood'', now replaced in Ulster by the more mainstream [[Old English|Anglic]] forms ''knew'', ''knowed'' or ''knawed'' and ''begun''. Many of the modest contemporary differences between Scots as spoken in Scotland and Ulster may be due to dialect levelling and influence from Mid Ulster English brought about through relatively recent demographic change rather than direct [[Language contact|contact]] with Irish, retention of older features or separate development.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The earliest identified writing in Scots in Ulster dates from 1571: a letter from Agnes Campbell of County Tyrone to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] on behalf of Turlough O'Neil, her husband. Although documents dating from the Plantation period show conservative Scots features, English forms started to predominate from the 1620s as Scots declined as a written medium.&lt;ref name="Scots 2003"&gt;Corbett, John; McClure, J. Derrick &amp; Stuart-Smith, Jane (eds.) (2003) ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scots'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press {{ISBN|0-7486-1596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These include [[Alexander Montgomerie]]'s ''The Cherrie and the Slae'' in 1700; shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by [[Sir David Lindsay]]; nine printings of [[Allan Ramsay (1686-1758)|Allan Ramsay]]'s ''The Gentle shepherd'' between 1743 and 1793; and an edition of [[Robert Burns]]' poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were [[James Hogg]] and [[Robert Tannahill]].

[[Image:Plaque poetry Writers Square Belfast Robert Huddlestone.jpg|thumb|Poetry by [[Robert Huddlestone]] (1814–1887) inscribed in paving in Writers' Square, Belfast]]
That was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2003"&gt;Robinson (2003) ''The historical presence of Ulster-Scots in Ireland'', in ''The Languages of Ireland'', ed. Cronin, Michael &amp; Ó Cuilleanáin, Cormac; Dublin: Four Courts Press {{ISBN|1-85182-698-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent of these was the ''[[Weaver Poets|rhyming weaver]]'' poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} although the first printed poetry (in the [[Burns stanza|Habbie stanza]] form) by an Ulster Scots writer was published in a [[broadsheet]] in Strabane in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, John, ed. (1974) ''Rhyming Weavers''. Belfast: Blackstaff Press&lt;/ref&gt; These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the ''rhyming weavers'' were [[James Campbell (poet)|James Campbell]] (1758–1818), [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]] (1770–1816), [[Thomas Beggs]] (1749–1847), [[David Herbison]] (1800–1880), [[Hugh Porter (poet)|Hugh Porter]] (1780–1839) and [[Andrew McKenzie (poet)|Andrew McKenzie]] (1780–1839).

Scots was also used in the narrative by Ulster novelists such as [[W. G. Lyttle]] (1844–1896) and [[Archibald McIlroy]] (1860–1915). By the middle of the 19th century the ''[[Kailyard school]]'' of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2003"/&gt; Scots also frequently appeared in Ulster newspaper columns, especially in Antrim and Down, in the form of pseudonymous social commentary employing a folksy first-person style.&lt;ref name="Scots 2003"/&gt; The pseudonymous Bab M'Keen (probably successive members of the Weir family: John Weir, William Weir, and Jack Weir) provided comic commentaries in the ''Ballymena Observer and County Antrim Advertiser'' for over a hundred years from the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2008"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:This is the cover of a book containing the Gospel of Luke in both Ulster Scots and the 1611 AV.png|thumb|''[[Gospel of Luke]]'' in Ulster Scots, 2009&lt;ref&gt;The vowels in ''Guid'' and ''Luik'' are separate [[phoneme]]s. Previous Scots translations spell the name ''Luke''. (Nisbet c.1520, Smyth 1901, Lorimer 1985) The usual Modern Scots spelling is ''Doctor'': "One eminent in learning and able to instruct others in matters of theology or religion"&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection ''Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey'', John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as "Pat M'Carty", and John Clifford (1900–1983) from East Antrim.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Frank (ed.) 2008, ''Ulster-Scots Writing'', Dublin: Four Courts Press {{ISBN|978-1-84682-074-8}}; p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century the poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional [[Modern Scots]] orthographic practice with a series of contradictory [[idiolect]]s.&lt;ref name="abdn.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/riiss/Reviews/Falconer_Frank%20Ferguson.shtml abdn.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004160937/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/riiss/Reviews/Falconer_Frank%20Ferguson.shtml |date=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the significant writers is [[James Fenton (Ulster-Scots poet)|James Fenton]], mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2003"/&gt; He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of [[eye dialect]], dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto.&lt;ref name="abdn.ac.uk"/&gt; The poet [[Michael Longley]] (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection ''The Ghost Orchid''.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2008"/&gt; The writing of Philip Robinson (born 1946) has been described as verging on "[[Postmodern literature|post-modern]] kailyard".&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2008"&gt;Ferguson, Frank, ed.

In 1992 the Ulster-Scots Language Society was formed for the protection and promotion of Ulster Scots, which some of its members viewed as a language in its own right, encouraging use in speech, writing and in all areas of life.

Within the terms of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages the British Government is obliged, among other things, to:
*Facilitate and/or encourage of the use of Scots in speech and writing, in public and private life.
*Provide appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of the language at all appropriate stages.
*Provide facilities enabling non-speakers living where the language is spoken to learn it if they so desire.
*Promote study and research of the language at universities of equivalent institutions.

The [[Ulster-Scots Agency]], funded by DCAL in conjunction with the [[Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]], is responsible for promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island. The agency was established as a result of the [[Belfast Agreement]] of 1998. Its headquarters are on [[Great Victoria Street, Belfast|Great Victoria Street]] in central [[Belfast]], while the agency has a major office in [[Raphoe]], [[County Donegal]].

In 2001 the Institute of Ulster Scots Studies was established at the [[University of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ulster.ac.uk/ulsterscots/intro.html University of Ulster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524052224/http://www.arts.ulster.ac.uk/ulsterscots/intro.html |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ulster Scots Academy has been planned with the aim of conserving, developing, and teaching the language of Ulster-Scots in association with native speakers to the highest academic standards.&lt;ref name="ulsterscotsacademy.org"/&gt;

2010's documentary ''The Hamely Tongue'' by filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today's Ireland.

''Warkschap'' an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] respelling of what tradition would likely render ''warkshap''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By the early 20th century the literary tradition was almost extinct,&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Michael Gregg, Robert (1997) ‘The Scots language in Ulster’, in Jones (ed.), p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; though some 'dialect' poetry continued to be written.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Frank (ed.) (2008) ''Ulster-Scots Writing'', Dublin: Four Courts Press; {{ISBN|978-1-84682-074-8}}; p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Much [[language revival|revival]]ist Ulster Scots has appeared, for example as "official translations", since the 1990s. However, it has little in common with traditional Scots [[orthography]] as described in Grant and Dixon’s ''Manual of Modern Scots'' (1921). [[Aodán Mac Póilin]], an [[Irish language]] activist, has described these revivalist orthographies as an attempt to make Ulster Scots an independent written language and to achieve official status. They seek "to be as different to English (and occasionally Scots) as possible".&lt;ref name="aodan"/&gt; He described it as a hotchpotch of obsolete words, [[neologism]]s (example: ''stour-sucker''&lt;ref&gt;The Scots form would be [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=souk&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd souker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321184937/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=souk&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[vacuum cleaner]]''), redundant spellings (example: ''qoho''&lt;ref&gt;The [[Older Scots]] spelling was usually [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=quha&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=dost quha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321184850/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=quha&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=dost |date=21 March 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''who'') and "erratic spelling".&lt;ref name="aodan"/&gt; This spelling "sometimes reflects everyday Ulster Scots speech rather than the conventions of either modern or historic Scots, and sometimes does not".&lt;ref name="aodan"/&gt; The result, Mac Póilin writes, is "often incomprehensible to the native speaker".&lt;ref name="aodan"/&gt; In 2000, Dr John Kirk described the "net effect" of that "amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features" as an "artificial dialect". He added,&lt;blockquote&gt;It is certainly not a written version of the vestigial spoken dialect of rural County Antrim, as its activists frequently urge, perpetrating the fallacy that it’s ''wor ain leid''. (Besides, the dialect revivalists claim not to be native speakers of the dialect themselves!). The colloquialness of this new dialect is deceptive, for it is neither spoken nor innate. Traditional dialect speakers find it counter-intuitive and false...&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. (2000) "The New Written Scots Dialect in Present–day Northern Ireland" in Magnus Ljung (ed.) ''Language Structure and Variation''; Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell; pp. 121–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005, Gavin Falconer questioned officialdom's complicity, writing: "The readiness of Northern Ireland officialdom to consign taxpayers’ money to a black hole of translations incomprehensible to ordinary users is worrying".&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, Gavin (2005) “Breaking Nature’s Social Union – The Autonomy of Scots in Ulster” in John Kirk &amp; Dónall Ó Baoill eds., ''Legislation, Literature and Sociolinguistics: Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Scotland'', Belfast: Queen’s University, pp. 48–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently produced teaching materials, have, on the other hand, been evaluated more positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etini.gov.uk/ulster_scots.pdf|format=PDF|title=An Evaluation of the Work of the Curriculum Development Unit for Ulster-Scots|publisher=Stranmillis University College|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326190713/http://www.etini.gov.uk/ulster_scots.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three text excerpts below illustrate how the traditional written form of Ulster Scots from the 18th to early 20th century was virtually indistinguishable from contemporary written Scots from Scotland.&lt;ref name="Falconer, G. 2006. p.94"&gt;Falconer, G.

''The Muse Dismissed'' ([[Hugh Porter (poet)|Hugh Porter]] 1780–1839)

:Be hush'd my Muse, ye ken the morn
:Begins the shearing o' the corn,
:Whar knuckles monie a risk maun run,
:An' monie a trophy's lost an' won,
:Whar sturdy boys wi' might and main
:Shall camp, till wrists an' thumbs they strain,
:While pithless, pantin' wi' the heat,
:They bathe their weazen'd pelts in sweat
:To gain a sprig o' fading fame,
:Before they taste the dear-bought cream—
:But bide ye there, my pens an' papers,
:For I maun up, an' to my scrapers—
:Yet, min', my lass— ye maun return
:This very night we cut the churn.

''To M.H.'' (Barney Maglone&lt;ref&gt;Robert Arthur Wilson&lt;/ref&gt; 1820?–1875)

:This wee thing's o' little value,
::But for a' that it may be
:Guid eneuch to gar you, lassie,
::When you read it, think o' me.

:Think o' whan we met and parted,
::And o' a' we felt atween—
:Whiles sae gleesome, whiles doon-hearted—
::In yon cosy neuk at e'en.

:Think o' when we dander't
::Doon by Bangor and the sea;
:How yon simmer day, we wander't
::'Mang the fields o' Isle Magee.

:Think o' yon day's gleefu' daffin'
::(Weel I wot ye mind it still)
:Whan we had sic slips and lauchin',
::Spielin' daftly up Cave Hill.

:Dinna let your e'en be greetin'
::Lassie, whan ye think o' me,
:Think upo' anither meetin',
::Aiblins by a lanward sea.

From ''The Lammas Fair'' (Robert Huddleston 1814–1889)

:Tae sing the day, tae sing the fair,
::That birkies ca' the lammas;
:In aul' Belfast, that toun sae rare,
::Fu' fain wad try't a gomas.
:Tae think tae please a', it were vain,
::And for a country plain boy;
:Therefore, tae please mysel' alane,
::Thus I began my ain way,
:::::Tae sing that day.

:Ae Monday morn on Autumn's verge
::To view a scene so gay,
:I took my seat beside a hedge,
::To loiter by the way.
:Lost Phoebus frae the clouds o' night,
::Ance mair did show his face—
:Ance mair the Emerald Isle got light,
::Wi' beauty, joy, an' grace;
::::Fu' nice that day.

The examples below illustrate how 21st century Ulster Scots texts seldom adhere to the previous literary tradition, ''Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower'', perhaps being a rare exception. Instead there has been an increase in the use of somewhat creative phonetic spellings based on the perceived sound-to-letter correspondences of [[Standard English]], i.e. dialect writing, as exemplified in ''Alice's Carrànts in Wunnerlan'' or the adoption of a more esoteric "amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features"&lt;ref&gt;John. M. Kirk (2000) "The New Written Scots Dialect in Present–day Northern Ireland" in Magnus Ljung (ed.) Language Structure and Variation (Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, Stockholm), pp121–138&lt;/ref&gt; as exemplified in ''Hannlin Rede''.

In 1953, he served as a visiting faculty at Lokbharti Shikshan Sanstha which was an educational institution in [[Sanosara]], [[Bhavnagar district]], Gujarat. In June 1954, he was appointed as professor of Gujarati Literature at [[Gujarat University]]. He was also appointed head of School of languages in that university. In 1956, he toured [[United States of America|America]] and England as a member of a committee sent by the Indian Government to study the activities of 'General Education' in American and some British Universities. In 1964, he became a member of a committee appointed by the Government of Gujarat for establishment of South Gujarat and Saurashtra Universities. From 30 November 1966: he was Vice-Chancellor of Gujarat University. On 17 November 1972: he retired from that post.&lt;ref name="umashankarjoshi.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Divya Bhaskar 2016"/&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''Zipf–Mandelbrot law''' is a [[discrete probability distribution]]. Also known as the [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]]-Zipf law, it is a [[power-law]] distribution on [[Ranking|ranked data]], named after the [[linguistics|linguist]] [[George Kingsley Zipf]] who suggested a simpler distribution called [[Zipf's law]], and the mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], who subsequently generalized it.

The [[probability mass function]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;N,q,s)=\frac{1/(k+q)^s}{H_{N,q,s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_{N,q,s}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{N,q,s}=\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{(i+q)^s}&lt;/math&gt;

which may be thought of as a generalization of a [[harmonic number]]. In the formula, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of the data, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are parameters of the distribution. In the limit as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity, this becomes the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s,q)&lt;/math&gt;. For finite &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; the Zipf–Mandelbrot law becomes [[Zipf's law]]. For infinite &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; it becomes a [[Zeta distribution]].

==Applications==

The distribution of words ranked by their [[frequency]] in a random
[[text corpus]] is approximated by a [[power-law]] distribution, known
as [[Zipf's law]].

If one plots the [[frequency]] rank of words contained in a moderately sized corpus of text data versus the number of occurrences or actual frequencies, one obtains a [[power-law]] distribution, with [[exponent]] close to one (but see Powers, 1998 and Gelbukh &amp; Sidorov, 2001). Zipf's law implicitly assumes a fixed vocabulary size, but the [[Harmonic number|Harmonic series]] with ''s''=1 does not converge, while the Zipf-Mandelbrot generalization with ''s''&amp;gt;1 does. Furthermore, there is evidence that the closed class of functional words that define a language obeys a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution with different parameters from the open classes of contentive words that vary by topic, field and register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecological field studies, the [[relative abundance distribution]] (i.e. the graph of the number of species observed as a function of their abundance) is often found to conform to a Zipf–Mandelbrot law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mouillot | first = D |author2=Lepretre, A

Within music, many metrics of measuring "pleasing" music conform to Zipf–Mandelbrot distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manaris | first = B |author2=Vaughan, D |author3=Wagner, CS |author4=Romero, J |author5=Davis, RB  | title = Evolutionary Music and the Zipf-Mandelbrot Law: Developing Fitness Functions for Pleasant Music | journal = Proceedings of 1st European Workshop on Evolutionary Music and Art (EvoMUSART2003) | volume = 611 | url = http://shaunwagner.com/writings_computer_evomus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
